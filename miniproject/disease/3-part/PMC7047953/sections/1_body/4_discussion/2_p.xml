<p>Viral persistence in breast milk and cervicovaginal fluids has been suspected in some unusual transmission chains [
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In this study, we confirm the presence of viral RNA in breast milk in 2 of 99 women, but cervicovaginal fluids from 273 women tested negative. Although data from previous studies suggest that viral persistence and subsequent viral transmission from these body fluids is generally low or only during short periods of time [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we confirmed the presence of Ebola RNA for up to 500 days in breast milk from 1 female EVD survivor [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. More important, this woman was not pregnant when she developed EVD, but she became pregnant 7 months after discharge from ETU, and she tested positive in breast milk 1 month after delivery. There is no previous evidence or report on EBOV RNA detection in breast milk in women who become pregnant after they have recovered from EVD. Relapse due to EVD has been reported in a survivor who developed meningitis 9 months after recovery from acute EVD [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The reason for the presence of viral RNA in breast milk in this patient remains unclear; virus could have persisted in an immune-privileged site, with pregnancy or lactation being at the origin of relapse with detectable RNA in breast milk. However, RNA was quickly cleared, and no infectious virus made its way into breast milk to infect the newborn, or the infant had an asymptomatic course of illness. Finally, laboratory error causing a false-positive result cannot be excluded.
