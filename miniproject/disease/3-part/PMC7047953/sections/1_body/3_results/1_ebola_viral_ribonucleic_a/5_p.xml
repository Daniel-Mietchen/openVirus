<p>Higher antibody levels to different EBOV proteins were observed in men who tested positive for Ebola RNA: median MFI of 1560 (IQR, 1060–2468) versus 1204 (IQR, 791–2140) for GP antigens, 2460 (IQR, 1674–3859) versus 1667 (IQR, 857–2681) for VP40, and 9449 (IQR, 6059–11125) versus 4766 (IQR, 2584–8450) for NP. The higher antibody levels in viral RNA-positive patients were significantly different for GP (OR = 1.54; 95% CI, 1.01–2.51; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .05), VP40 (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01–2.62; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .05), and especially to NP (OR = 3.06; 95% CI, 1.64–6.35; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .001) proteins. All male EVD survivors with positive semen samples were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) negative.
