 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In general, Ebola virus (EBOV) outbreaks remained restricted to rural or semirural areas and with a limited number of victims. The most important outbreak occurred between December 2013 and March 2016, when the virus spread from a rural area in southeast Guinea to the neighboring countries of Liberia and Sierra Leone and reached the capital cities from each country. More than 28 000 individuals became infected, and at least 11 000 people died [
