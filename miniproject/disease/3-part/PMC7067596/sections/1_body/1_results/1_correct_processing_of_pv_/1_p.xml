<p>To determine the feasibility of producing enterovirus VLPs in 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>, using PV as an exemplar, we employed three different expression cassettes, as described for 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>, each containing the P1 region together with the viral protease. Expression should result in the production of VP0, VP1, and VP3 and assembly into VLPs. A dual promoter expression system previously was used to produce VLPs for other enteroviruses, such as coxsackie A6, coxsackie A16, and enterovirus A71 (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). To this end, we designed two other constructs for comparative analysis alongside the dual promoter, using PV57δ (
