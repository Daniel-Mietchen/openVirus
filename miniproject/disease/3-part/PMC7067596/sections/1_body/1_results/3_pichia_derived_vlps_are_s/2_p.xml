<p>The larger particles (white arrows) then were analyzed by 2D classification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig.Â 3b</xref>). Class averages were highly indicative of icosahedral structure for both the 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs and PV virions. This analysis also showed the VLPs tended to be more angular in shape than the PV virions, indicating that they are in the nonnative conformation. Native (D antigenic) particles are known to be smoother in appearance, as seen in the class averages for PV virions (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). However, the classes show variation in both the size and shape for all expression cassettes, suggesting a level of heterogeneity in the 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs. Interestingly, the addition of 2A to the C terminus of VP1 did not lead to overall changes in particle morphology that could be determined by negative-stain EM.
