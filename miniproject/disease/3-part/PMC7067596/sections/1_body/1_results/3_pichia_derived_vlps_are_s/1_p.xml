<p>Although the density gradient purification suggested that the viral protein produced assembled as VLPs, we sought to confirm this by electron microscopy (EM) and 2D class averaging. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> shows a representative micrograph of 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs from each expression cassette compared with gradient-purified infectious PV. The negative-stain EM images show 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs to be of morphology similar to that of PV particles produced by mammalian cells. The VLPs were similar in diameter across both wt and PV57δ VLPs as well as between the different expression cassettes (33.4 ± 1.40 nm [
 <italic>n </italic>= 20]). The diameters of the 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs were very similar to the diameter of infectious PV virions (33.5 ± 0.56 nm [
 <italic>n </italic>= 20]). In the micrographs of PV57δ samples, small particles, depicted by the red arrows, far outnumbered the larger ∼33-nm particles, suggesting an assembly defect for this mutant.
