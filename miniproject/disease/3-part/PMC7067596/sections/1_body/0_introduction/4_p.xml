<p>PV VLPs have been produced in a number of different expression systems, including mammalian, plant, and insect cells (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Although the secretion of VLPs from insect cells is an attractive option, each of these systems can incur high production costs, making them less accessible for lower- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Yeast is a heterologous expression system with potential for technology transfer to LMICs, as it is inexpensive in terms of medium costs and infrastructure requirements. Additionally, yeast expression is currently licensed for the production of human vaccines against two viral pathogens, hepatitis B virus and human papillomavirus (
