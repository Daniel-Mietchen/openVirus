<p>PV is a positive-sense RNA virus, belonging to the species 
 <italic>Enterovirus C</italic>, with a 7.5-kb genome that contains 2 overlapping reading frames. The recently discovered small open reading frame (ORF) of unknown function has been shown to be important for replication in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> human enteroids (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The major ORF (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1A</xref>) is translated as a single large polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into the mature viral proteins (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). The viral protease 3C and its precursor, 3CD, play key roles in viral replication. 3C is responsible for the processing of the P2 and P3 regions of the viral polyprotein, whereas 3CD has been shown 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to be responsible primarily for cleavage of the structural precursor protein P1 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Additionally, 3CD also has been shown to have an integral role in priming the viral RNA for replication by the viral polymerase 3D (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). P1 is processed to produce the capsid proteins VP0, VP3, and VP1, with the subsequent cleavage of VP0 into VP2 and VP4 thought to be driven by the encapsidation of the viral genome (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Mature PV virions contain 60 copies of each of VP1 to VP4, forming an ∼30-nm icosahedral capsid (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In addition, PV infection also leads to the production of empty capsids (ECs), which lack the viral genome but are otherwise identical to the mature virions, except that they contain uncleaved VP0 (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Recombinantly expressed ECs could be developed as a virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine to replace the current vaccines against PV. However, wt ECs are inherently unstable, resulting in a conformational expansion of the particles and conversion from native antigenicity (termed D antigen) to the nonnative form (termed C antigen) (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This conformational switch is of particular importance as the nonnative antigen is a poor inducer of neutralizing antibodies and, therefore, is incapable of providing a long-lasting, protective immune response against PV (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, any attempts to produce PV VLPs must also attempt to ensure the particles maintain the D antigenic form.
