<p>Using P1 sequences from the wt and a previously characterized mutant, we show that PV VLPs can be produced in the yeast 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> via three different expression constructs. The expression of the potentially cytotoxic 3CD is modulated using different molecular biology approaches. The VLPs produced from each construct show physical properties similar to those of the ECs produced naturally during infection. Additionally, through two-dimensional (2D) class averaging of electron microscopy data, we show that PV VLPs produced from each expression cassette maintain the classic icosahedral morphology associated with picornavirus capsids, highlighting the potential of 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> as a model system for the production of enterovirus VLPs.
