<p>Virus-infected HeLa cells were freeze-thawed and clarified by differential centrifugation. Supernatant was collected and virus pelleted through a 30% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion at 151,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> (using a Beckman SW 32 Ti rotor) for 3.5 h at 10°C. Virus pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and clarified by differential centrifugation. Supernatant was purified through 15 to 45% (wt/vol) sucrose density gradient by ultracentrifugation at 151,000 ×

 <italic>Pichia</italic> cell suspensions were thawed and subjected to cell lysis using CF-1 cell disruptor at ∼275 MPa and chilled to 4°C following the addition of 0.1% Triton X-100. The resulting lysate then was centrifuged at 4,000 rpm to remove the larger cell debris, followed by a 10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> spin to remove further insoluble material. The supernatant then was nuclease treated using 25 U/ml HS-nuclease (2BScientific) for 1.5 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The supernatant then was mixed with saturated ammonium sulfate (40%, vol/vol) and incubated at 4°C overnight. The precipitated protein was pelleted at 4,000 rpm and resuspended in PBS plus 0.1% Triton X-100. The solution then was pelleted at 10,000 ×
