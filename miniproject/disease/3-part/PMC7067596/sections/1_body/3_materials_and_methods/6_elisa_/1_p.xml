<p>A noncompetitive sandwich ELISA was used to measure PV-1 D and C antigen content (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Briefly, 2-fold dilutions of antigen were captured using a PV-1-specific polyclonal antibody and then detected using PV-1-specific D antigen (MAb 234)- or C antigen (MAb 1588)-specific monoclonal antibody (kindly provided by NIBSC), followed by anti-mouse peroxidase conjugate (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). BRP was used as the standard for D antigen content in each ELISA, which then was analyzed through a Biotek PowerWave XS2 plate reader.
