<p>Raw micrographs were visualized with ImageJ, 1.51d (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). The measuring tool of ImageJ was used to calculate VLP/virion diameter; three separate measurements were taken and averaged to give a diameter for each VLP/virion.
