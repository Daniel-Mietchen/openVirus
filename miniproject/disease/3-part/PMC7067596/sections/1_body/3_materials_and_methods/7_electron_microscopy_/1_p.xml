<p>To prepare samples for negative-stain transmission EM, carbon-coated 300-mesh copper grids (Agar Scientific, UK) were glow discharged in air at 10 mA for 30 s. Three-microliter aliquots of purified VLP/virus stocks were applied to the grids for 30 s, and then excess liquid was removed by blotting. To improve the concentration of particles on the grid surface, a second 3-μl aliquot was applied for a further 30 s, and then grids were washed twice with 10 μl distilled H
 <sub>2</sub>O. Grids were stained with 10 μl 1% uranyl acetate solution, which was promptly removed by blotting before another application of 10 μl 1% uranyl acetate solution for 30 s. Grids were subsequently blotted to leave a thin film of stain and then air dried. EM was performed using an FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope (operating at 200 kV with a field emission gun) with an FEI CETA CMOS charge-coupled device camera (Astbury Biostructure Laboratory, University of Leeds). Samples were imaged across a range of defocus values (−2.0 μm to −3.8 μm) at a nominal magnification of ×25,000, resulting in an object sampling of 0.418 nm/pixel.
