<p>Cell-cultured virus supernatant samples were prepared through a 1:1 mixture with 2× Laemmli buffer and heated to 95°C for 3 min. For 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived protein samples, 100 μl culture was centrifuged at 2,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min and resuspended in 100 μl 0.1 M NaOH for 5 min before being centrifuged at 2,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for a further 5 min. Cell pellets then were resuspended in 2× Laemmli buffer and heated to 95°C for 3 min. Gradient fraction samples were prepared through a 1:5 mixture with 5× Laemmli buffer. Protein extracts were analyzed by 12% (wt/vol) SDS-PAGE using standard protocols. Western blot analyses were performed using a monoclonal primary antibody against VP1 protein (MAb 8560; Millipore), followed by detection with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (Promega). To identify viral protease 3CD, a rabbit polyclonal antibody was used, followed by detection with a goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and developed using a chemiluminescent substrate (Promega) (
