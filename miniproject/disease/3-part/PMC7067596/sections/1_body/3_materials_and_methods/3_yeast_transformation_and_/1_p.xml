<p>Plasmids were linearized by AflII digestion and then transformed into PichiaPink strain one (Invitrogen) by electroporation. The transformed yeast cells were plated on 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> adenine dropout (PAD) selection plates that lacked adenine and incubated at 28°C until sufficient numbers of white colonies appeared (3 to 5 days). To screen for high-expression clones, 8 colonies were randomly selected for small-scale expression experiments. Briefly, colonies were cultured in yeast extract-peptone-dextrose (YPD) for 48 h at 28°C with shaking at 250 rpm and then pelleted at 1,500 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, resuspended in yeast extract-peptone-methanol (YPM; 0.5%, vol/vol, methanol) to induce protein expression, and cultured for a further 48 h. Cultures were fed methanol to 0.5% (vol/vol) 24 h postinduction. To determine the expression levels of each clone, the samples were analyzed by Western blotting as described below. For VLP production, a stab from a previously expressing glycerol stock was cultured for 48 h in YPD to high density. To increase biomass, 2 ml of the starter culture was added to 200 ml YPD in a 2-liter baffled flask and cultured at 28°C at 250 rpm for a further 24 h. Cells were pelleted at 1,500 × 
 <italic>g</italic>, resuspended in 200 ml YPM (0.5%, vol/vol, methanol), and cultured for a further 48 h. Cultures were fed methanol to 0.5% (vol/vol) 24 h postinduction. After 48 h, cells were pelleted at 2,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> and resuspended in breaking buffer (50 mM sodium phosphate, 5% glycerol, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) and frozen prior to processing.
