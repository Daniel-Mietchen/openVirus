<p>As we move toward the eradication of poliovirus, the number of cVDPV cases is now outnumbering the number of paralytic polio cases caused by wt PV (

However, both OPV and IPV require the production of large amounts of infectious virus, which raises biosafety concerns around the potential for the reintroduction of PV to the environment (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore, as we edge closer to a polio-free world, we need to consider alternative vaccine production strategies to ensure control of PV is maintained. One solution is to produce a virus-free VLP vaccine using a heterologous expression system. This approach has been successful for the production of PV VLPs in both plant and insect cell systems, but both of these require specialist equipment, which increases the cost of production, making it difficult to translate these production methods to LMICs (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Yeast offers an alternative heterologous expression system that can produce levels of protein production similar to those of mammalian cells (e.g., 400 mg/liter compared to 500 mg/liter from mammalian cells [

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Therefore, we looked to build on the previous work of Rombaut and Jore by producing PV VLPs in yeast to determine if this is a viable expression system for future enterovirus vaccine production, especially in light of the recent emergence of the neurovirulent enterovirus D68 as well as the increasing cases of enterovirus A71 and coxsackievirus A16, the etiological agents of hand, foot, and mouth disease (
