<p>Unfortunately, the VLPs produced in this study were in the nonnative conformation, as highlighted by ELISA (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>), and the clear conformational difference between the 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs and the PV virions was apparent by 2D classification (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3b</xref>). Although this was expected for the wt sequence, it was surprising for PV57δ. The PV57δ mutant previously was shown to produce ECs in both C and D antigenic conformations in mammalian cells by immunoprecipitation (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). It is clear that the ELISA may not detect lower levels of antigen, as illustrated by no detection of either PV57δ-2A-3CD or PV57δ-IRES-3CD here. These data also suggest that the alternative, dual promoter expression cassette should be the primary choice for the production of other enterovirus VLPs. Although we cannot be certain that the 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs produced here would not lead to a protective immune response, the observation that these are positive for C antigen suggests that they are poor inducers of neutralizing antibodies and, therefore, are unlikely to induce protective immune responses (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The lack of pocket factor or the incorporation of a suboptimal molecule also could be responsible for the dominance of the C conformation. Pocket factor has been identified as a small lipid moiety that binds in a hydrophobic cleft in VP1 (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). This molecule contributes to maintaining capsid stability and is displaced during receptor binding and consequent conformational changes associated with the cell entry process. Capsids produced in mammalian cells have a natural pocket factor; however, it is unclear whether VLPs produced in heterologous expression systems bind a cofactor that occupies the pocket. Structural analysis by cryo-EM of plant-derived PV VLPs failed to demonstrate the presence of pocket factor, suggesting that pocket-binding lipids can be expression system dependent (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Additionally, Rombaut and Jore (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) found that wt PV VLPs produced in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> required the addition of pocket binding compounds to maintain the native conformation, suggesting either the absence of pocket factor or the incorporation of a pocket factor with low binding affinity, which was easily displaced through the addition of pocket binding compounds.
