<p>To ensure that no host RNA or cognate mRNA was being nonselectively packaged into the VLPs, we used the 260/280-nm absorbance ratio to estimate the level of nucleic acid present in the purified VLPs. The ratio of nucleic acid to protein was far lower than that in the purified infectious virus and was similar to the levels of nucleic acid found in equivalent fractions in the vector-only purified yeast lysate, suggesting that the VLPs did not encapsidate substantial quantities of nonspecific nucleic acid.</p>
