<p>First, we investigated the production of PV VLPs using a range of expression cassettes. The dual promoter expression cassette was used previously for the production of other picornavirus VLPs, while the introduction of TaV 2A and RhPV IRES was used to modulate the expression of 3CD (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). 3C protease previously was shown to have a toxic effect on cell viability, whereas 3CD was shown to be the active protease in P1 processing and should be less toxic than 3C (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Therefore, in an attempt to reduce protease toxicity, we introduced a previously characterized noncleavable 3CD into our expression constructs (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). However, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1C</xref>, there is clear cleavage of 3CD, suggesting that the noncleavable phenotype is expression system dependent. Presumably, a host protease is responsible for the 3CD cleavage seen, which occurs at a sequence close to the natural cleavage site. It would be interesting to fully ablate this cleavage event in 
 <italic>Pichia</italic> or introduce mutations into 3C
 <sup>pro</sup> to reduce toxicity, as shown previously for foot-and-mouth disease virus, and determine the impact of these modifications on VLP production (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). We demonstrated that all three expression cassettes led to the correct processing of P1 through the detection of VP-1 using monoclonal antibody (MAb) 8650. This antibody also can detect full-length P1 and other processing intermediates; however, we detected no structural precursors by immunoblotting, suggesting good P1 processing efficiency in each expression cassette. Additionally, we also showed that both the TaV 2A and RhPV IRES were able to control 3CD translation in 
 <italic>Pichia</italic>. These could be important tools for the production of VLPs from other virus families, such as flaviviruses or orthomyxoviruses, which may require differential expression of constructs required for protein maturation (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>).
