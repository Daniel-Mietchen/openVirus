  <p>Purification of virions and VLPs. All samples were purified by ultracentrifugation and fractioned from top to bottom in 1-ml aliquots. A 12-μl sample from each fraction then was taken and boiled in 5× Laemmli buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE prior to analysis by immunoblotting using mouse monoclonal α-VP1. Shown is a representative example of three separate experiments for each construct.</p>
