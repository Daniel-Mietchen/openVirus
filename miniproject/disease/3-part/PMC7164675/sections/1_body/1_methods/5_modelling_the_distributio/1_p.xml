<p>A boosted regression tree (BRT) modelling [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] framework was used to determine the sensitivity of patterns in human KFD cases to land use, topographical and host variability, and to generate maps of potential distribution across Shivamogga. BRTs combine regression trees, which build a set of decision rules on the predictor variables by portioning the data into successively smaller groups with binary splits [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and boosting, which selects the tree that minimises the loss of function, to best capture the variables that define the distribution of the input data. BRTs have been shown to have high performance amongst methods used to predict species distributions [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], probably due to their ability to fit complex, non-linear responses to environmental covariates and their robustness to outliers. However, they can be prone to over-fitting data and therefore a number of stringent cross-validation checks were used to avoid this (see below).
