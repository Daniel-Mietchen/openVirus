 <xref rid="pntd.0008179.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], the model framework accounted for the sparse, spatially clustered recording effort that often arises in public health surveillance datasets[

We discuss the extent to which disease patterns were predictable from landscape, topographical host and landscape metrics, whether human cases of KFD are associated with particular forest types, mosaic habitats or forest loss and how model predictions could improve targeting of interventions and surveillance.
