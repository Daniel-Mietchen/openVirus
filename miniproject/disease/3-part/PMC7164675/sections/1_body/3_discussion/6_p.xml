<p>The finding that human cases of KFD are more likely to occur in landscapes with greater coverage of plantations is consistent with suggestions that large KFD epidemics in the 1970s and 1980s were linked to international development projects that replaced evergreen forest with cashew plantations [

There are numerous potential explanations for the finding that human cases or KFD are more likely in landscapes with higher cattle densities. Cattle are thought to amplify local densities of ticks and bring ticks into households (either directly or through dry leaves used as fodder) whilst cattle grazing may bring small-holders into contact with tick habitat in forests, paddies and plantation.
