<p>Since our models are developed with disease data at household level, and scaled to the daily movement of local communities of 1â€“2 km through the landscape, impacts of micro-scale factors such as small water-bodies (&lt;10 km) on disease patterns may not be detectable. Obtaining finer scale data on how locations of exposure to relate to such micro-scale factors is difficult because people are often unable to pinpoint where on their daily routes infected ticks were picked up and close monitoring of burdens by researchers may hamper livelihood activities.</p>
