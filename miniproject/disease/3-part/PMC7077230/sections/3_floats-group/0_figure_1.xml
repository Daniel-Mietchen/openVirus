  <p>The prevalence of clinical or scientific application depends on the method and the type of data it yields. Classic approaches, like serology and PCR, are quick, but naturally limited to only the known pathogens. More advanced methods, such as HTS, could supply vital data for diagnostics (e.g., optimal target regions for PCR) and further clinical research.</p>
