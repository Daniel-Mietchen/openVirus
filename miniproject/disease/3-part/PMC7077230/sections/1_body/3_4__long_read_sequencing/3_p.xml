<p>One of the most popular ONT sequencers—the MinION—has been praised for possessing multiple boons: relatively low cost, when compared to platforms by Illumina and Thermo Fisher Scientific, and mobility, owing to compact dimensions of the sequencer, simplicity of protocols, and rapid sample processing. Another great advantage that ONT platforms hold over second-generation sequencing is the length of analyzed fragments. Because fragments over 2 Mb can be read in a single run with maintained quality, in metagenomic experiments, genes of interest, like those of drug resistance [

Furthermore, available protocols include not only those for metagenomics, but also for studying select organisms, e.g., viruses. Both parallel and consecutive sequencing of samples can be performed, owing to a multitude of pores in a cell.
