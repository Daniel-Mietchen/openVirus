<p>ELISA has become one of the most widely used tests, owing to high sensitivity and specificity (both usually reported at &gt;90% [

Modern commercial kits are designed to cover a large variety of antigens, bacterial and viral, even at femto- and attomole concentrations. All these factors contribute to the popularity of ELISA, turning it into a universal tool for disease screening and prognosis. At the same time, strong limitations restrict its use. Because the test basically relies on antigen detection, cross-reactivity between heterologous antigens can lead to false positive results, like with influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell and hepatitis C virus antigens [

It is also of note that ELISA does not provide any extra data beyond approximate viral burden and limited detection of a pathogen, rendering the identification of new viruses impossible.
