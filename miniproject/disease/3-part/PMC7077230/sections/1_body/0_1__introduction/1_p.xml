<p>As some statistical models suggest, there are over 320,000 mammalian viruses in existence [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], a little over 200 of which are known to infect humans [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], with the number increasing steadily over decades [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The recent years have been marked by a rising frequency of emerging viral infections, e.g., SARS [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], Zika [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], or a more recent 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> 2019-nCoV outbreak [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Bearing that in mind, the range of available diagnostic tools seems disproportionate to the growing number of diseases, because they detect only known pathogens, which constitute ~0.07% of viral entities. Metaphorically, we are attempting to look at a vast sea of threats through the eye of a needle.
