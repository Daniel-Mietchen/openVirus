<p>Graf et al. (2016) [
 <xref rid="B47-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] compared the sensitivity of two pathogen identification methods: metagenomic RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) with further Taxonomer processing and commercial FDA-approved respiratory virus panel (RVP) for GenMark eSensor. They used 42 virus-positive controls from pediatric patients and 67 unidentified samples [

Metagenomic analysis revealed 86% of known respiratory pathogens, with supplementary PCR corroborating the finding in a mere third of discordant samples. However, for unknown samples, consistency between the two methods reached as high as 93%. Still, metagenomic analysis uncovered 12 extra viruses that were either not targeted by the RVP or failed to bind to complementary nucleotide strands on the chip because of significantly mutated genome sequences. A metagenomic approach not only aids in identification of a pathogen, but also grants an insight into its nucleotide sequence. Although viral sequences constituted only a small fraction of total reads, sufficient data for 84% of samples were gathered to allow for high-resolution genotyping.
