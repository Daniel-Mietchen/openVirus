<p>Unlike traditional tests [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>], when fast unbiased pathogen identification is crucial for effective disease containment. Unbiased HTS can also aid in investigating cases of unknown clustered viral infections, when other diagnostic tools do not provide sufficient information, like in the case of the new
