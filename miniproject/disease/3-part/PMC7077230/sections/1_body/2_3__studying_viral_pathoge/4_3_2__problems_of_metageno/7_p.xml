<p>Metagenomics was initially suggested for expanding the knowledge on existing families, rather than discovering new ones [
 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], which naturally limits its application to the broad-range search. In practice, reads very often fail to map to reference genomes due to a lack of even minimally homologous sequences [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This situation is anticipated in cases of organisms that have not been screened for viral infections before or whenever strains of known viruses in the sample possess unique sequences that have not been described yet. Thus, a better understanding of the virosphere requires not only expansive sets of samples, but also improvements to data processing algorithms. Paradoxically, the more we explore the biology of viruses, the more apparent it becomes that only a negligible part of their taxonomy is being studied and, to make matters worse, mainly that of closely related viruses, rather than the principally new ones [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. In this way, while rapidly gaining profoundness, our knowledge of viruses is progressively narrowing.
