<p>Standardization of the method is yet another issue. Because metagenomics is aimed at describing a multitude of microorganisms in a sample, and also due to biases and host-cell DNA and RNA abundance, robust references and normalization methods have to be developed. A possible solution has been proposed by Wilder et al. [
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], who suggested creating reference metagenomic libraries for sequencing with unknown samples. Indeed, this approach seems logical and reliable in cases when an abundance of a particular virus is expected. For example, comparing reference samples with a clinical sample, where an abundance of a particular viral species is observed, would indicate a possible on-going infection. Nevertheless, confidence intervals have to be set to ensure that the differences are significant, and studying more samples is required for an accurate evaluation, so further research is required. However, it is challenging to conceptualize standards when the search for new viruses is concerned, because there is no apparent candidate for a standard. In this case, limits on the sequencing quality can be imposed that would help differentiate between sequencing artifacts and the actual discovery of a new pathogen. Validation could include cultivation with supplementary PCR and further whole genome sequencing for new pathogens.
