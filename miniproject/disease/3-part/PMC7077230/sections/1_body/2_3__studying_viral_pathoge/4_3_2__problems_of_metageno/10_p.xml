<p>In summary, the most notable deterrents for clinical metagenomics are: (1) the complexity and high costs of sample preparation, (2) the requirement for special bioinformatic education and skills, (3) the need for a powerful data processing infrastructure and (4) the possible inconsistency between results owing to uneven pathogen distribution in a body and/or quality of sampling. Nevertheless, the mentioned limitations can potentially be alleviated with advances in sequencing technologies [
