<p>VirusSeq [
 <xref rid="B159-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>] is intended for detection of viral sequences in tumor tissues. First, it removes human sequences by comparing them against the reference. The MOSAIK program [
 <xref rid="B166-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>] is used both prior to filtration and afterwards to ensure quality sequence detection. VirusSeq sets limits on the minimally acceptable number of reads and coverage based on the size of viral genome. For example, it demands at least 1000 reads per virus given that the sequencing depth equals at least 30Ã—. Although the threshold can be adjusted, this tool has been developed for reads with high coverage and is consequently not recommended for processing data with a low percentage of viral reads.
