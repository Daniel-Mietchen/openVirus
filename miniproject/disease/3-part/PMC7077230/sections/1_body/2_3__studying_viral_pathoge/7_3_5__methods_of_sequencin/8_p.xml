<p>VirusHunter [
 <xref rid="B165-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>], on the other hand, utilizes BLASTn to filter out human-related sequences after quality evaluation. Sequences that pass filtration are taxonomically classified according to BLASTn and BLASTx algorithms. Thus, VirusHunter requires a high-quality hostâ€™s genome for sorting the sequences and significant computational power to run.
