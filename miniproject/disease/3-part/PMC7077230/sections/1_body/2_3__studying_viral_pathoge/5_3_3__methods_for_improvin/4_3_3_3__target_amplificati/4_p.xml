<p>As stated above, PCR works perfectly for amplification of small viral genomes, like those of HIV and influenza virus. For that purpose, primers are designed so that they cover a whole genome, either in a few fragments or in a single molecule. In theory, cloning shorter sequences is simpler, more reliable and increases sequencing depth, whilst also requiring compilation of primer panels for each genus. Nevertheless, target amplification has its own shortcomings. For instance, it has low data scalability, while requiring a relatively large amount of input material to ensure proper site coverage without biases. For this reason, its application is mainly restricted to samples that meet robust requirements (amount of input DNA, material quality, absence of PCR inhibitors, etc.). For instance, amplification of the whole Ebola virus genome utilizes 11 or 19 primer pairs, covering over 97% of the full sequence [
