<p>Briese et al. [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>] developed VirCapSeq-VERTâ€”a platform for concentrating nucleic acids of vertebrate viruses. It contains approximately two million biotinylated probes for target enrichment. VirCapSeq-VERT detects virtually all human viruses, including new ones, featuring up to 40% of unknown sequences. Another team of researchers created an analogous approach, called ViroCap [
 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>], which has been tested in a virological lab on actual clinical samples. In 26 samples, metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) with ViroCap detected all anticipated viruses plus 30 that had not been identified before. An experiment carried out later [
 <xref rid="B125-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>] demonstrated that out of 30 viruses identified with NGS and missed by clinical tests, 18 were identified by MSS and ViroCap, and an additional 12 with ViroCap only. Another powerful computational tool for designing probes has been recently developed by Metsky et al. [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. CATCH (compact aggregation of targets for comprehensive hybridization) analyzes target viral genomes and selects a minimum number of probes for optimal coverage of multiple viruses. This results in an effective hybridization-based enrichment, while preserving the original viral diversity of a sample. Reduction in the number of probes curtails experiment costs, while increasing the efficiency of metagenomic sequencing.
