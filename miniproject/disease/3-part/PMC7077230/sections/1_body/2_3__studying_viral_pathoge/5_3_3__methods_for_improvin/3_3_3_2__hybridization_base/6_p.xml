<p>Sensitivity of hybridization is increased when probes are designed using a large set of reference sequences, resulting in a better coverage of all conceivable genetic variants. This is achieved because target enrichment is still possible when target sequences differ from a probe sequence. However, full sequences are needed when creating hybridization probes, while designing PCR primers requires sequences only of the flanking regions. Another advantage of probe-based methods is that if some oligonucleotides fail to anneal during hybridization, overlapping probes might compensate [
