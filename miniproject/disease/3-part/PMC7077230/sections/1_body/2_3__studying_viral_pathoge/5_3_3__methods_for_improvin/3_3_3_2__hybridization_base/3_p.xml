 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00211" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. For this, short DNA or RNA probes are used, which are complementary to the chosen sequences in a viral genome. The trick is to use several probes for one viral genome, thus ensuring its full coverage and guaranteed extraction: even if the genome contains major mutations, there is a distinct possibility that some target sequences remain unchanged, allowing for binding with a probe. Probes themselves are biotinylated at one end, binding strongly to beads covered in streptavidin. After that, a magnet separator is used to wash the beads from any redundant DNA and RNA with further elution of target sequences [
