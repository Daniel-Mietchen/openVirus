<p>Experiments that compare modern clinical assays with HTS-based tests conclude that data derived from sequencing might be helpful in several ways. It can serve for pathogen detection and identification and also supply clinically valuable information on the presence of resistance genes or resistance-yielding mutations in a pathogen’s genome [

However, genetic libraries must be created, often from samples with low concentrations of a pathogen’s nucleic acids and high content of nucleic acids from a host and other microorganisms. An elegant solution has been proposed by two independent teams of researchers, resulting in the development of a novel commercially available enrichment tool [
