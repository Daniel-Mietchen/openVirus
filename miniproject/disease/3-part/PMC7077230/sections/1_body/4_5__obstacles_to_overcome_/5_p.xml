<p>Proper quality control is another problem. It is difficult to set a valid standard when the method is aimed at discovering new types of organisms. To confirm the NGS data, the pathogen in question has to be extracted, cultured as a pure strain and genetically characterized. Perhaps, the samples subject to NGS assays should be analyzed at several facilities to confirm the reproducibility of the results. The use of different sequencing platforms would ensure even better reproducibility and help prevent biases and typical mistakes that various sequencing technologies are prone to, while also excluding the human factor.</p>
