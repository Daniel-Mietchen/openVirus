<p>Thank you so much for your kind suggestion to change the title. However, we would like to highlight the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses during the 2017 season in Myanmar and focus the first case of antiviral resistance not only full-genome sequencing analysis in our MS. We kindly request you to accept the MS title to remain as before; “Epidemic of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 analyzed by full genome sequences and a first case of oseltamivir-resistant strain in Myanmar 2017”.</p>
