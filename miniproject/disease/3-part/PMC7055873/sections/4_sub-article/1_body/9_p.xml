<p>We have done 3 major changes in the revised manuscript. One of the authors has changed from Nobuhiro Takemae to Yuko Uchida due to the mistake of a person who conducted the NGS. We elaborated the information for the in-patients and added the clinical characteristics of the in-patients. Additionally, we also added the internal genes sequence of the H275Y mutated virus analyzed by NGS. </p>
