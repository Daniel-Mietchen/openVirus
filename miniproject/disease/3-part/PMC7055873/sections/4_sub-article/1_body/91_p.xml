In addition, we added the variant rate of oseltamivir-resistance tyrosine amino acid substitution at position 275 in NA gene of one oseltamivir- resistant Myanmar strain in “Drug resistant influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus” under results section. We added the internal genes of oseltamivir-resistant H275Y mutated virus. </p>
