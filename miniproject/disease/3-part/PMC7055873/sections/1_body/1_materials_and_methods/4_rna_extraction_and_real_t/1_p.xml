<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 140 μL of nasopharyngeal swab supernatant of the original clinical sample for initial typing and from viral isolate for subtyping/lineage detection of influenza A or B using QIAamp Viral RNA mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time PCR using QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN) was performed according to the protocols provided by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, Japan [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] to screen influenza viruses from original clinical specimens for initial typing as Type A or B. Subtyping PCR for A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) and differentiation for B/Victoria or B/Yamagata lineages was performed at NHL for the virus isolates using specific primers and probes, respectively [
