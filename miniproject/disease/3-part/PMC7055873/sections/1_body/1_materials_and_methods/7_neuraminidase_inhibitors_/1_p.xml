<p>The selected influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were tested using fluorescence-based inhibition assay (NA inhibition assay) against four kinds of neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir (Sequoia Research Products Ltd., Pangbourne, UK), zanamivir (Sequoia Research Products Ltd.), peramivir (Shionogi &amp; Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan), and laninamivir (Daiichi Sankyo Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). Susceptibility of viruses from culture supernatants of infected MDCK cells were used to test the inhibitory effect of each NA inhibitor (NAI). Prior to NAI assay, NAIs were diluted to a final concentration range of 0.005–1250 nM. Each influenza virus isolate was diluted to a final concentration of 25,000 fluorescence units to obtain a dilution in the linear range of the NA activity curve. Twenty-five microliters of each diluted NAI was added to each well of a microtiter plate, followed by the addition of 25 μL of each virus dilution [

Fifty microliters of 2′-(4-Methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) substrate was added to each well at a final concentration of 25 μM, and then, the plates were incubated at 37 °C for 60 min. The reaction was finally stopped by adding 260 μL of 200 mM sodium carbonate to each well. The fluorescence of the released 4-methyl umbelliferone (4-MUNANA) was measured in a microplate reader TriStar LB942 (Berthold Japan K.K., Tokyo, Japan) using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. Inhibitory effect was expressed as the IC
 <sub>50</sub> calculated using XLfit software (IDBS, Surrey, UK). The strain was assessed as resistant if the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value against one of four drugs is 100-fold elevated for influenza A [
