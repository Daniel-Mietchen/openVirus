<p>In Myanmar, the peak of influenza virus activity coincides with the rainy season. Myanmar has a tropical monsoon climate with three seasons: winter (November—February), summer (March—Mid May), and rainy (Mid May—October) seasons, based on the analysis of pressure, rainfall, and temperature [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This observation is also similar to the national surveillance data reported to the regional and global influenza surveillance platform (FluNET), which showed that the regional influenza outbreak started during the rainy season from July (week 29) to September (week 36), and influenza virus activity peaked in August with 369 flu-positive cases during the reported weeks 31–35 in 2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Nationally, an increasing number of influenza cases was notified in July, and the large number of samples for influenza testing became a burden to NIC, which resulted in a restriction on sample handling in our study sites. Therefore, influenza detection was decreased in August at study sites compared to the national influenza peak period.
