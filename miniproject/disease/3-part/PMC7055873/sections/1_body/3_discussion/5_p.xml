<p>Another known important amino acid change, D222N/G in HA, was not detected in viruses from Myanmar in-patients. This mutation affects virus tropism and enhances the severity of disease and mortality by assisting viral binding to α-2,3 receptors, which are mainly present in the lower respiratory tract with the occurrence of 0.4% frequency at global level [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In NA phylogeny, amino acid substitutions V13I, I34V, and I314M were found in all Myanmar strains. These substitutions were also detected in Indian and Nepalese A(H1N1)pdm09 outbreak strains in early 2015, which suggests the coevolution of HA and NA [

According to our investigation (unpublished data), influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses, which were the predominant circulating strains in Myanmar during 2016, could be a possible reason for this big outbreak of A(H1N1)pdm09 and it may be responsible for the reduced herd immunity against A(H1N1)pdm09, when the new 6B.1 clade virus was introduced in Myanmar in 2017.
