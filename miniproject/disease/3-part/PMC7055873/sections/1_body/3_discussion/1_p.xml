<p>A regional influenza outbreak with the major subtype of A(H1N1)pdm09 occurred in Myanmar from June to October in 2017, and an increased number of severe pneumonia cases were reported [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The viruses involved in this outbreak were genetically very similar to A(H1N1)pdm09 strains circulating in Asia and other countries during the same year. There were no differences in the genetic characteristics of A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses collected from out-patients and in-patients, including cases with fatal outcomes. The antigenicity of the Myanmar viruses was similar to the vaccine strain. In addition, the first case of oseltamivir-resistant virus in Myanmar without prior oseltamivir treatment was detected in our study.
