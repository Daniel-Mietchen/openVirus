<p>According to the phylogenetic analysis, the 2017 Myanmar influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strains belonged to clade 6B.1 and were closely related to the strains that circulated in India and other countries during the same period. India reported several outbreaks and severe cases caused by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 of Clade 6B and 6B.1 during 2015–2017 [
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. We suspect the possibility of transmission from India or other countries situated to the west of Myanmar because early cases of this outbreak were reported from Chin State, which shares its western border with Bangladesh. The analyzed strains in this study are genetically similar to the vaccine viruses, A/Michigan/45/2015 and A/Singapore/GP1908/2015. It was known that S74R, I295V mutations in HA protein were recently acquired by the virus; this mutation has high frequency of detection (66%) globally [

 <xref rid="pone.0229601.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Similarly, these mutations were highly detected (87%) in Myanmar strains. In contrast to Myanmar strains, amino acid substitutions A73V, V321I, T508A, and I510T, were reported from Central India sequences in 2017 with low global occurrence [
