<p>The present patient exhibited no elevation of CK and only a modest increase in CRP despite his extremely severe muscle pain. The levels of CK and CRP remained normal in at least 24% and 26% of the patients with HPeV3-associated myalgia, respectively (

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), the increase in CK values may have been missed in some cases. Another possible explanation for the lack of any marked increase in CK values is that the inflammation caused by HPeV3 infection predominantly occurs in the fasciae without severe damage to the muscle (

Although the exact mechanism underlying the development of orchiodynia in these cases was not clarified, swollen testes and peritesticular effusion were revealed by computed tomography (CT) (
