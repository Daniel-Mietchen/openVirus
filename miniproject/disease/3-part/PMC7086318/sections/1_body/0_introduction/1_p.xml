<p>Epidemic myalgia, also known as Bornholm disease, is a viral infectious disease that was first reported by Ejnar Sylvest in the 1930s (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It was named after the Danish island of Bornholm, where its outbreak was reported for the first time. It is characterized by the sudden onset of extreme pain in the chest or upper abdomen, sometimes associated with a fever or sore throat. Coxsackievirus and Echovirus have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease (

Whereas mild myalgia is frequently caused by viral infection, epidemic myalgia associated with HPeV3 infection can be distinguished from such common viral-associated symptoms based on its characteristic symptoms of extreme myalgia and muscular weakness predominantly affecting the proximal muscles of the upper and lower extremities (
