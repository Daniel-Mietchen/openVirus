<p>The splenic architecture builds a natural barrier against blood-borne pathogens [
 <xref rid="B9-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. A variety of factors are important to maintain these fragile structures and assure the functional synergy of spleen resident cells [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Due to their location in the marginal zone and proximity to blood conduits in the spleen, CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages (CD169
 <sup>+</sup> MΦs) are the first line of defense against a variety of viruses [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. During blood-borne infections, CD169
 <sup>+</sup> MΦs are the first cell types to be infected. Therefore, CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages contribute to early antiviral immune activation [
 <xref rid="B16-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Since CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages constitutively express high levels of the interferon-inhibitor 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> (UBP43), they were postulated to accelerate viral replication [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Functionally, the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 (UBP43; 
 <italic>Usp18</italic>) blocks IFNAR signaling through the competitive binding of JAK1 binding site at subunit IFNAR2, independent of its isopeptidase activity [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This results in a lack of Type-I interferon (IFN-I) production in CD169
 <sup>+</sup> MΦs, and Honke et al. demonstrated that, therefore, VSV can undergo excessive replication in these cells. This mechanism is beneficial for the host, as it produces a sufficient amount of antigen for immune activation and subsequently leads to the strong production of IFN-I and is known as enforced virus replication [
 <xref rid="B18-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IFN-Is are a group of inducible cytokines which can be produced by a variety of cell types, like leucocytes, endothelial cells and myeloid cells upon stimulation. The induction of antiviral pathways upon IFN-I binding leads to the induction of ISGs (interferon stimulated genes) like RNase L, RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) or Mx protein GTPases [
 <xref rid="B20-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fast and robust IFN-I production is not only essential for the induction of an antiviral state and clearance of viral infection, but also plays a major role in B cell activation and antibody response [
 <xref rid="B23-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Neutralizing antibody responses are essential to control EBOV and VSV infections [
 <xref rid="B25-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-vaccines-08-00142" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Whether the cell-intrinsic expression of 
 <italic>Usp18</italic> in CD169
 <sup>+</sup> macrophages indeed influences antiviral immune response remains unknown.
