<p>Organ samples were embedded in TissueTek O.T.C. (Sakura) medium and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 8 Âµm sections were generated. Sections were fixed with acetone and unspecific binding sites were blocked After 48 h using two percent fetal calf serum (FCS, Gibco) in PBS. VSV-Glycoprotein (VSV-G) was stained with Anti-VSV-G tag antibody (Abcam). Ebola virus glycoprotein was stained with Anti-Ebola surface glycoprotein (clone KZ52) from absolute antibodies. Secondary antibodies were obtained from ThermoFisher (anti-rabbit). Anti-CD169 (clone MOMA-1) was obtained from Bio-Rad. Antibodies were used in a dilution of 1:100 in blocking buffer and incubated for 30-60 minutes in a humidified darkened chamber at room temperature. Slides were covered with Fluorescence Mounting Medium (Dako, Glostrup, Denkmark) and processed for imaging with a Keyence BZ-9000 microscope.</p>
