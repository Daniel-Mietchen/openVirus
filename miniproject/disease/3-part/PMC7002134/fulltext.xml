These viruses are transmitted between humans and mosquitoes and cause various emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases worldwide (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr"><italic>2</italic></xref>). Among them, DENV causes about 390 million human infections and 20,000 deaths annually, and the World Health Organization has listed it as one of the &#x0201c;Ten Threats to Global Health in 2019&#x0201d; (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>). In addition, other flaviviruses have caused numerous epidemics across the globe, as the recent ZIKV outbreaks in Americas and the spread of JEV and WNV into new geographic territories have become serious threats to human health (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr"><italic>4</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr"><italic>5</italic></xref>). It is estimated that over 40% of the world are at the risk of mosquito-borne flavivirus infection, and up to now, no specific antiviral therapy is available for flaviviruses (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr"><italic>3</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr"><italic>6</italic></xref>).</p><p>RNA interference (RNAi) is an evolutionarily conserved posttranscriptional gene-silencing mechanism in all eukaryotes, in which small noncoding RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs), direct the silencing of gene expression by causing the destruction or translational repression of complementary target RNAs, respectively (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). RNAi is believed to have originally evolved as an intrinsic antiviral immune mechanism in diverse eukaryotes (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). In the process of antiviral RNAi, viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) replicative intermediates (vRI-dsRNAs) produced during viral replication or dsRNAs from viral RNA secondary structures are recognized and cleaved by host endoribonuclease Dicer into 21- to 23-nucleotide (nt) virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs), which are then loaded into Argonaute (AGO) proteins of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), to direct the destruction of viral RNAs in infected cells (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Thus far, RNAi has been widely recognized as one of the most important antiviral mechanisms in fungi, plants, and invertebrates, whereas many viruses encode viral suppressors of RNAi (VSRs) as the immune evasion strategies (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>).</p><p>In contrast, in the differentiated mammalian cells in which viral infection and replication usually occur, vRI-dsRNAs and other viral nucleic acids mainly induce innate antiviral immune defenses, such as the interferon (IFN) system, and whether RNAi exerts any physiologically important antiviral effect in mammals has remained a long-lasting subject of debates (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). Recently, several lines of evidence have demonstrated that RNAi plays important antiviral roles in murine embryonic stem cells and human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs) (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>). However, stem or progenitor cells are not the usual infection targets for most viruses, including flaviviruses. Also, in differentiated mammalian cells, a mere handful of VSR-disabled mutant viruses, including human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), influenza A virus (IAV), and Nodamura virus (NoV), have been found to induce vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response during infection (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>).</p><p>For flaviviruses, previous studies have revealed, as expected, that DENV and ZIKV can induce the production of vsiRNAs in infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito cells (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). However, it still remains unknown whether RNAi exerts any antiviral effect against flavivirus infection in differentiated mammalian cells. Given the fact that mosquito-borne flaviviruses are transmitted between humans and mosquitoes, and that they carry out their life cycles in both of these organisms, determining whether and how flaviviruses induce and antagonize the shared antiviral defense mechanism, RNAi, in the two distinct host species would deepen understanding of the flavivirus processes of the infection, transmission, and pathogenesis, as well as the mechanisms of antiviral RNAi in both mammals and insects.</p><p>Flavivirus encodes a polyprotein that is further processed into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. Here, we initially examined all the DENV2 nonstructural proteins and found that the nonstructural protein NS2A suppressed Dicer-dependent siRNA production both in vitro and in the context of DENV2 infection. When the VSR activity of NS2A was disabled by reverse genetics, the resulting VSR-deficient mutant DENV2 induced abundant vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response in infected mammalian somatic cells. These vsiRNAs are Dicer-dependently produced from vRI-dsRNAs, loaded into AGO, and active to silence complementary viral RNA. Correspondingly, the VSR-deficient DENV2 suffered severe defects in replication and infection in mammalian somatic cells and mice, which were successfully rescued by the genetic ablation of key RNAi component. In infected <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito cells, DENV2 uses the same VSR (NS2A) to antagonize antiviral RNAi, and the replication defect caused by the VSR deficiency could be also rescued by the deficiency of RNAi. In addition, NS2As of other DENV serotypes and mosquito-borne flaviviruses, including JEV, WNV, and ZIKV, also suppressed RNAi in vitro, and JEV has been found to use NS2A to antagonize antiviral RNAi in both mosquito and human cells during JEV infection. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RNAi can be triggered to exert a critical antiviral effect against flavivirus infection in both mammals and mosquitoes, while flavivirus uses NS2A as a bona fide VSR to evade antiviral RNAi in both organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>DENV2 nonstructural protein NS2A suppresses RNAi in vitro</title><p>Previous studies by us and others have implied that antiviral RNAi response and vsiRNA production would become obvious in differentiated mammalian cells infected with viruses whose VSRs are disabled by reverse genetics (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). Therefore, to examine whether flavivirus has the ability to induce antiviral RNAi in differentiated mammalian somatic cells, we first sought to determine whether any flaviviral protein can work as a potential VSR. To this end, we examined all DENV2 nonstructural proteins via a classic reversal-of-silencing assay. In this assay, enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)&#x02013;specific dsRNA was transfected into EGFP-expressing <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, together with expression vectors for individual DENV2 nonstructural proteins, and the levels of EGFP mRNA and protein were determined via Northern blotting and fluorescence microscopy. As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref> and fig. S1 (A to C), the ectopic expression of DENV2 NS2A effectively restored the expression of EGFP mRNA and protein, indicating that NS2A is a potential VSR in insect cells. Of note, the ectopic expression of Flock House virus (FHV) B2 protein (named FB2), a well-established VSR, and the knockdown of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> Dicer-2 (dmDcr2-KD) or AGO2 (dmAGO2-KD) were used as positive controls, which, as predicted, inhibited the dsRNA-induced RNAi (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>, lane 3; fig.

At 24 hours post-transfection (hpt), EGFP-specific dsRNA (0.1 &#x003bc;g) was transfected. Total RNAs were extracted at 24 hpt and subjected to Northern blotting with a digoxigenin (DIG)&#x02013;labeled RNA probe targeting the 500 to 720 nt of EGFP open reading frame (ORF).

At 48 hpt, FHV RNA transcription was induced by incubation with CuSO<sub>4</sub> at 0.5 mM, and 24 hours after induction, total RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blotting by DIG-labeled RNA probe specific for FHV RNA1 and RNA3.

In this assay, a VSR-deficient FHV replicon mutant (pFR1-&#x00394;B2) was expressed to self-replicate in S2 cells (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Owing to the lack of B2, this mutant FHV replicon was unable to evade antiviral RNAi, resulting in the near clearance of self-replicated FHV genomic RNA1 and subgenomic RNA3 in S2 cells, while the presence of NS2A successfully rescued the replication of FHV replicon (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). Together, these results showed that DENV2 NS2A is a potential VSR whose overexpression effectively suppressed RNAi in insect cells.</p><p>A key step of RNAi is the biogenesis of siRNAs from the cleavage of exogenous or endogenous dsRNAs by mammalian Dicer or insect Dicer-2 (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>). Thus, we examined whether NS2A would affect the siRNA production from dsRNA via small RNA Northern blotting. Our data show that DENV2 NS2A inhibited the production of siRNAs from transfected dsRNAs in S2 cells (fig. S1E, lane 4). Moreover, we further examined whether NS2A binds to long dsRNA. To this end, gel shift assays were performed by incubating 0.05 &#x003bc;M synthetic 200-nt digoxigenin (DIG)&#x02013;labeled dsRNA with increasing concentrations of recombinant maltose-binding protein (MBP)&#x02013;fusion NS2A (fig.

As shown in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, while dsRNA was efficiently processed into siRNAs by hDicer (lanes 2 and 3), the presence of MBP-NS2A effectively protected dsRNA from Dicer cleavage dose dependently (lanes 5 to 8).

S2C) and then examined the single-point mutations of conserved arginine (R) or lysine (K) to alanine (A) via reversal-of-silencing assay. The mutational analysis revealed that the conserved R94 and K135 are critical for the in vitro VSR activity of NS2A (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). Furthermore, we found that either the R94A or K135A mutation almost abolished the dsRNA-binding activity of NS2A (fig.

While the replication of DENV2<sub>R94A</sub> and DENV2<sub>K135A</sub> had no significant difference in Aag2 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1F</xref>), we found that the replication of DENV2<sub>R94A</sub> was markedly weaker than that of DENV2<sub>K135A</sub> in C6/36 cells (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1G</xref>). Notably, in contrast to Aag2 cells that have an intact RNAi, C6/36 cells have a dysfunctional RNAi pathway (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>). Thus, it is suggested that the replication defect of DENV2<sub>R94A</sub> cannot be rescued by the RNAi incompetency in C6/36 cells, and that the R94 residue of NS2A may be involved in viral RNA replication. Given that DENV2<sub>R94A</sub> appears to be irresponsive to the status of RNAi in infected cells, we did not include this mutant in the subsequent studies.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>VSR-deficient DENV2 induces vsiRNA production in human somatic cells</title><p>The vsiRNA production is recognized as the prerequisite of antiviral RNAi (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>).

Our data show that the production of either DENV2<sub>WT</sub>- or DENV2<sub>K135A</sub>-derived vsiRNAs was mostly abolished by the knockdown of <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> Dicer-2 (aaDcr2-KD) but not AGO2 (aaAGO2-KD) (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>, lanes 4 to 9, and fig.

In addition, since no anti-aaAGO2 antibody is available, we replaced endogenous aaAGO2 with a hemagglutinin (HA)&#x02013;tagged dmAGO2 by ectopically expressing HA-dmAGO2 in aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells. These cells were infected with DENV2<sub>WT</sub> or DENV2<sub>K135A</sub>, and the vsiRNAs derived from either virus were coimmunoprecipitated with dmAGO2 (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). In addition, previous studies have uncovered that the DDH motif, particularly its first aspartic acid (D597), of human AGO2 (hAGO2) is required for the slicing but not siRNA-loading activity of hAGO2. Given that this residue is also conserved in AGO proteins of other organisms, including fruit fly and <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito (fig. S5C), we generated the dmAGO2 mutant by substituting the first aspartic acid of the DDH motif to alanine (dmAGO2<sub>D965A</sub>). Our results show that vsiRNAs could also load into dmAGO2<sub>D965A</sub> in either WT or mutant DENV2&#x02013;infected aaAGO2-KD Aag2 cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Thus, these DENV2 vsiRNAs, either derived from WT or VSR-deficient mutant, are Dicer-2&#x02013;dependently produced from vRI-dsRNAs and can effectively load into AGO2 of the RISC to be functional in mosquito cells.</p><p>Next, we examined whether the VSR activity of NS2A facilitates DENV2 replication in Aag2 cells. Our data show that the viral RNA accumulation and virion production of DENV2<sub>K135A</sub> were significantly attenuated at 3 dpi in Aag2 cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>). Impairing RNAi by knocking down aaDicer2 or aaAGO2 or by inactivating the slicing activity of AGO2 (i.e., replacing aaAGO2 with dmAGO2<sub>D965A</sub>) successfully rescued the viral RNA accumulation and virion production of DENV2<sub>K135A</sub> to the similar levels of DENV2<sub>WT</sub> (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6, C and D</xref>), showing that the protective role of NS2A on DENV2 replication in mosquito cells is dependent on the RNAi pathway.

S2C), suggesting their commonalities in functions. Thus, we first examined whether NS2As from DENV serotype-1 to serotype-4 have the same VSR activities. Our data show that ectopically expressing any of the four NS2As showed similar in vitro RNAi suppression activities in both S2 (fig. S6, A and B) and Aag2 cells (fig. S6, C and D). After that, we further assessed the VSR activity of NS2A encoded by ZIKV, JEV, or WNV in 293T cells, in which RNAi is induced by an EGFP-specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA), and found that NS2As encoded by these viruses had similar in vitro RNAi suppression activities to restore EGFP mRNA and inhibit siRNA production (fig. S7). Thus, our data show a conserved role of NS2A as a potential VSR for all the DENV serotypes as well as multiple other flaviviruses.</p><p>It would be intriguing to investigate whether these flaviviruses also use NS2A as a bona fide VSR to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection. On the basis of the sequence alignment of flaviviral NS2As, the K135 of DENV2 NS2A corresponds to the R140 of JEV NS2A (fig. S2C), both of which are positively charged. Thus, we introduced the R140A mutation in the NS2A coding region of the infectious clone of the JEV strain SA-E70 (fig. S8A) and recovered the WT (JEV<sub>WT</sub>) and mutant (JEV<sub>R140A</sub>) viruses. The plaque morphology was examined in BHK-21 cells (fig. S8B). We further infected mosquito Aag2 or C6/36 cells and human 293T or 293T-NoDice cells with JEV<sub>WT</sub> or JEV<sub>R140A</sub> and examined viral replication. Consistent with the data obtained using WT and VSR-deficient DENV2 (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), JEV<sub>R140A</sub> exhibited a replication defect in the RNAi-competent Aag2 or 293T cells when being compared to JEV<sub>WT</sub> (fig.

On the other hand, impairing RNAi rescued the replication defect of JEV<sub>R140A</sub> in both mosquito and mammalian somatic cells, as the replication of JEV<sub>WT</sub> and JEV<sub>R140A</sub> in RNAi-incompetent C6/36 or 293T-NoDice cells showed no significant difference (fig. S8, D and F). These data imply that RNAi can exert antiviral effect against JEV infection in both mammalian and mosquito cells, and JEV NS2A also works as a bona fide VSR to antagonize antiviral RNAi during JEV infection of either host cells.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" disp-level="1"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Antiviral RNAi is an intrinsic immune defense mechanism conserved in diverse eukaryotic organisms. Vector-borne viruses, such as mosquito-borne flaviviruses, infect and replicate in both invertebrates and mammals. However, although flaviviruses have been previously revealed to induce vsiRNA production in insect cells (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>), it was unknown whether these viruses also induce vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi in differentiated mammalian cells and whether and how flaviviruses use certain strategy to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection in both mammals and mosquitoes.</p><p>Previous studies have implied that the unavailability of ample vsiRNAs in virus-infected&#x02013;differentiated mammalian cells is probably due to the presence of potent VSRs (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>), and thus, disabling VSR may be a useful way to assess whether RNAi exerts antiviral effect against certain viruses (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr"><italic>12</italic></xref>). Similar with the well-characterized VSR&#x02013;EV-A71 3A, flaviviral NS2A is also a small (~22 kDa) transmembrane protein, which participates in viral RNA replication and virion assembly, and antagonizes IFN response (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr"><italic>31</italic></xref>); and ZIKV NS2A has been recently found to interact with and deplete adherens junction proteins in radial glial cells (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr"><italic>32</italic></xref>). On the other hand, the VSR activity of flaviviral NS2A was not assessed before. In the current study, we first identified DENV2 NS2A as a potential VSR via a set of in vitro assays. Then, when NS2A&#x02019;s VSR activity was disabled by reverse genetics, VSR-deficient DENV2 induced abundant vsiRNA production and antiviral RNAi response in infected mammalian somatic cells, resulting in attenuated viral replication and infection compared to the WT. The replication defect caused by disabling VSR can be rescued by impairing the RNAi machinery in an IFN-irrespective manner, demonstrating that RNAi does exert antiviral effect against DENV2 infection in differentiated mammalian cells. NS2A also acts as a bona fide VSR during DENV2 infection of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito cells. Using NS2A as VSR is a common strategy for multiple flaviviruses to evade antiviral RNAi.</p><p>Previous studies have found that DENV NS2A is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and contains eight predicted transmembrane segments (pTMS1 to pTMS8) (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>). Moreover, scanning mutagenesis studies of NS2A implicated that the intermolecular interactions between pTMSs are critical in a DENV life cycle (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). Mutations of multiple conserved residues in different pTMSs, which are located inside or outside the ER lumen or within the ER membrane, showed different defect patterns (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr"><italic>33</italic></xref>). K135 of NS2A is predicted to locate in pTMS5 at the lumen side of ER (<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr"><italic>30</italic></xref>), which possibly involves NS2A VSR function by mediating pTMS interactions.</p><p>In addition to NS2A, an interesting question is whether flaviviruses encode another VSR(s). Previous studies have identified some flaviviral factors, including WNV subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) and DENV NS4B, that suppressed synthetic dsRNA- or shRNA-induced RNAi via in vitro assays (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr"><italic>34</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr"><italic>35</italic></xref>). Besides, Myles and colleagues genetically added a YFV capsid gene into the genome of Sindbis virus (SINV) and observed that the mutant SINV overexpressing YFV capsid exhibited enhanced viral replication and virulence in mosquito, while the mutant SINV overexpressing DENV NS4B or WNV sfRNA failed to do so (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>), suggesting that flaviviral capsid has the potential to be a VSR. However, these in vitro studies did not assess whether these flaviviral factors affect vsiRNA production or antiviral RNAi in the context of authentic flaviviral infection. Moreover, the assays relying on overexpressing a candidate VSR have an inherent caveat, as the overexpression of a protein with potent dsRNA-binding capacity may interfere with RNAi anyhow, which does not necessarily mean that it really works as a bona fide VSR during viral infection. On the other hand, it is expected that a virus can encode more than one antagonist of a given immune mechanism. For example, multiple flaviviral proteins have been found to be IFN antagonists (<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). Thus, the potential VSR activities of these flaviviral factors is worth further investigation in the context of viral infection in the future.</p><p>Although RNAi is conserved in all eukaryotes, a long-standing question is why infection with multiple WT viruses fails to trigger abundant vsiRNA production in differentiated mammalian cells but can readily do so in insect cells. A reasonable explanation is that insect has a stronger Dicer machinery to process vRI-dsRNA. However, previous findings using different insect viruses and mammalian viruses are inappropriate to be directly compared and cannot exclude a less likely possibility that mammalian viruses encode more potent VSRs to block vsiRNA production. Therefore, mosquito-borne flaviviruses, which have dual life cycles, are ideal models to study antiviral RNAi in the two distinct organisms. Moreover, it would be intriguing to know whether a flavivirus uses the same or different strategy to evade RNAi in mammals and insects. Our findings show that flaviviruses use the same strategy (NS2A as VSR) to antagonize RNAi in both organisms, and antiviral RNAi does seem more prominent in insect cells than in mammalian somatic cells.</p><p>Why does antiviral RNAi respond to the same flavivirus less effectively in differentiated mammalian cells than in insect cells? A probable mechanism is that mammalian Dicer bears some intrinsic inhibition(s). Factually, it has been found that the N-terminal helicase domain of hDicer can autoinhibit its siRNA processing activity (<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>), while dmDicer-2 could partially reconstitute dsRNA-induced RNAi in human somatic cells (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>);.the difference in the N termini of hDicer and dmDicer-2 may reflect their different capabilities in processing long dsRNA (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>). In addition, cellular signalings may also repress antiviral RNAi in certain circumstances (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr"><italic>40</italic></xref>). Maillard <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr"><italic>41</italic></xref>) have revealed that the IFN-I system inhibits dsRNA-induced RNAi in mammalian somatic cells via the association of the RIG-like receptor LGP2 with Dicer. However, inactivation of IFN-I response by depleting RIG-I and MDA5 is insufficient to enable vsiRNA production in human somatic cells infected with several WT RNA viruses (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr"><italic>42</italic></xref>), which we also observed in DENV2<sub>WT</sub>-infected IFNAR1-KO cells. Such a discrepancy is probably attributed to the interference of VSRs. A recent study by us uncovered that infection with WT ZIKV could induce the production of abundant vsiRNAs in hNPCs, which lack IFN-I response, but not in neurons differentiated from hNPCs, implying that hDicer machinery and antiviral RNAi are highly tunable and differently regulated during distinct stages of cell differentiation (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr"><italic>43</italic></xref>). Future studies should elucidate the cellular determinants of the different states of antiviral RNAi in detail.</p><p>To our best knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that a flavivirus can trigger abundant vsiRNA production and effective antiviral RNAi response in a Dicer-dependent manner in differentiated mammalian cells. Moreover, it provides the mechanistic insight into how flaviviruses act to evade antiviral RNAi in the context of viral infection of both mammals and mosquitoes. These findings extend our knowledge about the life and transmission cycles of mosquito-borne flaviviruses and shed light onto the interaction between this large group of pathogenic viruses and antiviral RNAi immunity, which may be amenable to antiviral therapy and would represent an exciting avenue for future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and <italic>A. aegypti</italic> cell line Aag2 [American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) CCL-125] were cultured at 27.5&#x000b0;C in Schneider&#x02019;s insect medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco).

Cell pellets were resuspended in binding buffer [20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 1.5% Triton X-100 and a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche). Cells were lysed by sonication, and then debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 11,000<italic>g</italic>. The proteins in the supernatant were purified using amylose resin (New England BioLabs) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s protocol and concentrated using Amicon Ultra-15 filters (Millipore).

After the binding reaction, the samples were analyzed via 6% native PAGE in 0.5&#x000d7; tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer and transferred to a Hybond-A nylon membrane (GE Healthcare). The membranes were incubated for 30 min with anti-DIG antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Roche).

After centrifugation, the postnuclear lysates were precleared via incubation with protein-A/G agarose beads (Roche) together with goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G at 4&#x000b0;C for 4 hours. Then, the precleared lysates were incubated with anti&#x02013;pan-AGO antibody, together with protein-A/G agarose beads (Roche) at 4&#x000b0;C for 12 hours.

The libraries were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2000 at RiboBio. The sequencing reads were mapped to the human genome (release hg19) or mosquito genome (AaeGL5.0) by using Bowite 2.2.5, and the cellular miRNA expression level was determined on the basis of the number of reads that was identical to the annotated miRNA sequences in miRBase version 18, only allowing &#x02212;2 or +2 nt to be templated by the corresponding genomic sequence at the 3&#x02032;-end. vsRNA reads that cannot be mapped to human genome were then mapped to DENV2 genome with 100% identity. The subsequent analysis of length and location of these vsRNAs were calculated using in-house Perl scripts. Pairs of complementary 22-nt vsRNAs in each library in different distance categories were computed using principles as previously described (<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr"><italic>16</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Mouse experiments</title><p>Groups of 3-week-old <italic>Ifnargr</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (AG6) mice or 1-day-old Balb/C mice were inoculated by intracerebral injection with 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> or 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> PFU of viruses, respectively.
