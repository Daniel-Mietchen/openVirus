<p>Zoonotic diseases - transmitted and shared between animals and humans, are nowadays receiving increased recognition. WHO estimates that more than 60% of all human pathogens are zoonotic, and that they represent 75% of all emerging pathogens during the past decade[
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They encompass a wide range of pathogens (viruses, bacteria, parasites) and modes of transmission: 
 <italic>via</italic> direct contact with infected animals or their secretions, the bite of arthropod vectors or indirect contact 
 <italic>via</italic> the environment[
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Given a close relationship between human, animal and environmental health (the “One Health” concept), human activities, climate and landscape changes influence significantly transmission and distribution of zoonoses[

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The number of zoonotic diseases has been increasing in the last two decades and the spreading trends are likely to continue in future years. For example, West Nile virus (WNV), one of the most widely distributed arboviruses has expanded its area of circulation in many European countries[
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In 2018, a large outbreak occurred across Southern and Central Europe with the number of confirmed human cases increasing up to 7.2-fold from the previous transmission season[
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A total of 2083 human cases and 285 outbreaks among equids were reported, including previously virus-free regions[
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In addition, geographical distribution of Zika virus (ZIKV) has steadily expanded. In 2015 and 2016, large outbreaks of ZIKA occurred in the Americas. In the USA and US Territories, 5168 and 36512 symptomatic ZIKV disease cases were reported in 2016[
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an important cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide, with an increasing incidence in Europe since 2010. The reported incidence over 10 years has grown by ten times: From 514 cases in 2005 to 5617 cases in 2015[
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. On the other hand, solid-organ transplant (SOT) population is expanding as a result of increasing transplant rates, improved post-transplant management and survival[
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In comparison to immunocompetent hosts, immunocompromised state of SOT recipients is an inevitable additional risk for the infection and unfavorable outcomes due to atypical presentation, possible delay in diagnostic tests (serology), more frequent presence of disseminated/advanced disease and prolonged treatment. Although majority of zoonotic infections develop in the post-transplant period, donor or transfusion transmitted zoonotic infections have been increasingly acknowledged as well. Therefore, the increasing trend of reports on zoonotic diseases in the transplant population over the past decade substantiates a need for a comprehensive review. This narrative review will cover two main groups of zoonotic infections; vector and non-vector borne infections and focus on major pathogens and their clinical manifestations in the transplant population (Table
