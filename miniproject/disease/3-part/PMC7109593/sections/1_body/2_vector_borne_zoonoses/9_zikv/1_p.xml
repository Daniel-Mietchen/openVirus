<p>ZIKV is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus. Before the large outbreak of ZIKV infection on Yap Island (Federated States of Micronesia), only sporadic cases were reported in Africa and Asia, but in 2007 ZIKV emerged as an important human pathogen[

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus)</italic>, however, non-vector borne transmission of ZIKV such as sexual and transplacental transmission was also reported[

Although symptoms associated with ZIKV infection are generally mild and the majority of infected persons do not develop any symptoms, ZIKV is also associated with severe neurological disorders, mainly Guillain-Barr√© syndrome. Diagnostic testing for ZIKV infection can be accomplished using molecular and serologic methods[

In 2015 and 2016, ZIKV infection was confirmed among 129 kidney transplants and 58 liver transplants tested in Brazil. All ZIKV-infected SOT recipients presented with complications, notably bacterial infections, and required hospitalization. Based on this small case series, it was not possible to assess the potential impact of ZIKV in the immunosuppressed SOT recipients, including infectious complications and graft rejection[
