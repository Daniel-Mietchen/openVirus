<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus widely distributed in the tropics and subtropics. In an urban cycle, the virus is transmitted from human to human by the bite of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes. Non-vectorial DENV transmission through SOT can also occur[
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The clinical presentations of DENV infection range from asymptomatic to severe illness with fatal outcome. The symptomatic cases are categorized as undifferentiated febrile illness, dengue fever, dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome[
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Etiologic diagnosis can be obtained by virus isolation, detection of NS1 antigen, DENV RNA or specific IgM and IgG antibodies[
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. SOT recipients showed a spectrum of clinical manifestations similar to the non-transplant population. However, the course of the illness can be prolonged with complications such as graft dysfunction. Fatal cases were also reported[

 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. A Thai study analyzed outcomes of DENV infection in a large cohort of kidney transplant recipients. Although a transient decline in allograft function occurs in some patients, the overall clinical and allograft outcomes seemed to be favorable[
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. A Colombian study on retrospective case series of SOT recipients with DENV infection showed that regarding the clinical course, 75% of patients had at least one warning sign, 45% were managed in the intensive care unit, and 30% had severe dengue. However, all patients had a full recovery after the infection[
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. In contrast, a study from India showed that early post-transplant DENV infection appears to be severe and associated with more complications in kidney transplant recipients[
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. There have been limited descriptions of possible DENV transmission through SOT, of which the majority are classified as possible transmission due to the lack of DENV RNA confirmation in the donor[
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. A case of DENV transmission from donor to the recipient after liver transplantation was described in India. The recipient developed dengue fever without showing any features of severe graft dysfunction and recovered fully[
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. Several studies in SOT recipients who developed dengue through organ transplantation showed that the liver was the main target organ in all patients, even in subjects that received heart and kidney transplantation. Transplant patients were more likely to present with elevated liver transaminases and hyperbilirubinemia, suggesting that the liver could be more susceptible to DENV or is generally more compromised in transplant recipients[

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. A recently published study from India presented the first report on the detection of DENV in the donor cornea indicating the risk of iatrogenic DENV transmission through corneal transplantation[
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. To avoid DENV transmission by organ or tissue transplantation, the donors should be screened in endemic areas.
