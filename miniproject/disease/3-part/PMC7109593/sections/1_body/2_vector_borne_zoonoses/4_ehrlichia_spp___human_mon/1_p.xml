<p>Human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is a tick-borne zoonosis caused by 
 <italic>Ehrlichia chaffeensis</italic> and less commonly, 
 <italic>E. ewingii</italic>. HME occurs across the south-central, south-eastern, and mid-Atlantic states, corresponding to areas where their reservoirs (white-tailed deer) and vectors (
 <italic>Amblyomma americanum</italic> ticks) both exist[
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The clinical manifestations of HME vary from a self-limited febrile illness to fatal multi-organ failure[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Severe manifestations such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary hemorrhages, meningoencephalitis, toxic shock-like, and septic shock-like syndromes have also been described[

 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The diagnosis can be confirmed by PCR or serology[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In some cases, morulae may be observed in leukocytes on Wright stained peripheral blood smear, particularly in immunocompromised hosts[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. There have been reports of HME transmission through SOT[
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], as well as through blood product transfusions[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Ehrlichiosis was described in kidney[
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>-
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], liver[
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], lung[
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] and heart transplant recipients[
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Immunocompromised persons, particularly SOT recipients, more frequently develop severe and prolonged manifestations of ehrlichiosis with higher case-fatality rates[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Furthermore, SOT recipients showed having a higher risk to develop acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome[
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, one report showed that 15 transplant patients with ehrlichiosis had similar and favorable outcomes compared with immunocompetent patients[
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Among SOT recipients, infected lung recipients showed more severe and progressive clinical course[
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Some reports, have also described re-infections in liver transplant recipients, suggesting that initial infection may not provide long-lasting immunity in patients on immunosuppressive therapy[
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>].
