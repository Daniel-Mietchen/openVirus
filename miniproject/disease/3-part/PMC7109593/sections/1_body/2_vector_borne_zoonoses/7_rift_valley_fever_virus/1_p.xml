<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a mosquito-borne phlebovirus. RVFV outbreaks in humans have been reported in Africa, the Indian Ocean islands, and the Arabian Peninsula[

The initial clinical presentation was characteristic for acute hepatitis and four weeks later, the patient presented with a meningoencephalitis. IgM and IgG antibodies were detected in CSF and blood up to 2 mo after symptoms onset, whereas in urine and semen, RVFV RNA was detected by RT-PCR up to three and four mo, respectively. The severity of clinical presentation may have been related to immunosuppression, which might also have slowed down the clearance of the virus[
