<p>Another highlighted issue regarded the role of the private healthcare system. Official data from the Ministry of Health [
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-02062" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] declared that 30.85% of the DF residents have private health insurance. The comparatively low number of cases reported by private hospitals and the reports of the interviewees seem to indicate private sector underreporting. However, the comparatively low number of cases reported might also be due to other factors, for example, a lower incidence of dengue among patients who rely on private healthcare, rather than underreporting of the private units. As a qualitative study, this work cannot provide statistical evidence of that.
