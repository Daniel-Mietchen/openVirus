<p>The Directory of Epidemiological Surveillance and each Unit of Epidemiological Surveillance of the health regions have one professional for data analysis for arbovirosis surveillance. The regional units are also responsible for digitalizing the papery notifications. As feedback, the Directory of Epidemiological Surveillance publishes a weekly bulletin during the epidemic period and a fortnightly bulletin during the inter-epidemic period. The competence of the professionals working with surveillance is perceived as a strength.</p>
