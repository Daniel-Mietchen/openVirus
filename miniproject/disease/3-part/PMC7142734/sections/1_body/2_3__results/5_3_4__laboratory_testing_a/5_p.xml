<p>Interviewees stated that the guidelines for the epidemic period are not implemented, with blood samples collected in almost 70% of the total cases. This corresponds to the SINAN database, where 69% of the cases are diagnosed through testing. According to the interviewees, this overburdens the laboratories, consumes resources, prolongs waiting lists, and hinders laboratory surveillance of other diseases, in a context with limited resources. The causes for guidelines not being implemented are the expectations of the patients (who often demand to be tested), the nescience of the guidelines, and the co-circulation of other arboviruses.</p>
