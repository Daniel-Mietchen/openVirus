<p id="par0075">Among the 22 nursery children tested, eight were infected with hMPV, with a co-infection rate of 75%. In winter, numerous viruses colonize the upper respiratory tract of children in communal settings

Owing to its high sensitivity, PCR may detect several pathogens, which introduces confusion since it cannot distinguish between causative pathogens and other potentially infectious agents or residual pathogenic signatures of prior infections. However, healthy portage of hMPV is exceptional
