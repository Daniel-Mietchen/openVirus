<p>Noteworthy, CIV-H3N2 further acquired the ability to naturally infect cats, as first reported in a Korean animal shelter (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Hence, this indicates that cats may play an intermediate host role in transmitting the H3N2 virus among feline and canine species.
