<p>Influenza is an acute infectious respiratory disease caused, in humans, by influenza type A or type B viruses. While the latter type circulates only among humans, influenza A viruses (IAV) can also be isolated from a wide variety of animal species. Wild migratory birds and bats are main natural reservoirs, from where virus uses to spill over into other animal hosts like ducks, chickens, horses, pigs, whales, cats, dogs, etc. IAVs viruses commonly exhibit restricted host range, but occasionally transmit from one species to another host (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), this review aims at providing an up-to-date picture of the epidemiology of IAV in dogs and cats and their transmission modes. Their evolution and the consequences of genetic reassortments of IAV are further discussed, leading us to provide recommendations on surveillance tools and on the role that diagnostic tools could play in the “One Health” concept approach.
