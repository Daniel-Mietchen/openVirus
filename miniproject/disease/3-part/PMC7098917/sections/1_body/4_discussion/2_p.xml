<p>Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that dogs and cats should be considered as mixing vessels for the reassortment of novel influenza viruses. Notably, canine influenza viruses, and more particularly those of the CIV-H3N2 subtype, have reassorted multiple times with avian- and mammalian- adapted influenza viruses since their time of emergence, clearly showing that the gene pool of avian, human, and canine viruses is indeed compatible. These new viruses could further spread widely among household dogs and cats and may therefore represent a threat for human health. Up to date only one case of interspecific cat-to-human spill-over has been reported, and this occurred after prolonged and unprotected exposure to ill cats and their respiratory secretions, which indicates that risk for cat-to-human transmission is low (

Rather infected humans may be the source of pet infection, and the combination of reverse zoonosis (from humans to pets), potential co-infections and gene reassortment may provide a favorable ecosystem for crossing species barrier between pets and humans.
