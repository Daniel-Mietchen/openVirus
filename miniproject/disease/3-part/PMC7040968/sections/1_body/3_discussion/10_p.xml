<p>For the preparation of vaccine seed viruses, reverse genetics can be used as well as clinical specimens. When a novel respiratory virus emerges that can replicate well in MDCK cells with influenza viruses, it might be difficult to prepare seed viruses from clinical specimens. In this situation, reverse genetics is useful because plasmids with no virus are starting materials to produce influenza viruses.</p>
