<p>We anticipated that in the case of co‐infection, a negative correlation would be observed frequently because the first viral infection would activate interferon signaling and interfere with the second viral infection. However, our study detected significant co‐suppression only in INFA‐INFB and INFB‐CVEV. Influenza viruses did not exhibit remarkable association with most of the other respiratory viruses. One possible explanation for this could be the attenuation of interferon signaling by virally encoded proteins such as influenza virus NS1. It is also possible that the required sample size was larger than that in the present study for detection of more significant associations between influenza viruses and other viruses. These results suggest that co‐existence of influenza virus with other viruses in clinical specimens should not be ignored, and it would thus be necessary to select cell substrates that can eliminate the contaminating viruses and amplify influenza viruses.</p>
