<p>Viral nucleic acids in each sample were extracted using the QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) or QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN). The ResPlex II v2.0 kit (QIAGEN) was used, according to the manufacturer's instructions, to detect 18 human respiratory viruses as follows: respiratory syncytial virus type A (RSVA), respiratory syncytial virus type B (RSVB), influenza A virus (INFA), influenza B virus (INFB), parainfluenza virus type 1, parainfluenza virus type 2, parainfluenza virus type 3, parainfluenza virus type 4, human metapneumoviruses A and B, coxsackievirus/echovirus (CVEV), rhinovirus (RHV), adenovirus type B (ADVB), adenovirus type E, coronavirus NL63 (NL63), coronavirus HKU1, coronavirus 229E (229E), coronavirus OC43 (OC43), and bocavirus (BocV). The principle of this assay is based on multiplex RT‚ÄêPCR in combination with fluorescence detection of specific PCR amplicons on the LiquiChip 200 Workstation using QIAplex MDD software.
