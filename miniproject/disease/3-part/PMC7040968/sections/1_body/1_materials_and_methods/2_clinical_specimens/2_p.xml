<p>We selected 341 clinical specimens from the patients diagnosed as having influenza or influenza‐like illness based on their clinical symptoms and/or the results of rapid tests for influenza. These patients visited the hospitals during the 2006/2007 influenza season (from January 2007 to May 2007), 2007/2008 influenza season (from December 2007 to April 2008), or 2008/2009 influenza season (from September 2008 to February 2009) in Japan. Nasal or pharyngeal samples were collected using UTM 360C kits (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy) or transport medium consisting of minimum essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 0.5% gelatin, 100 units/mL of penicillin, and 100 µg/mL of streptomycin. These specimens were aliquoted and stored at −80°C until use. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan.</p>
