 <xref rid="irv12694-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> Suspension cells are superior to adherent cells owing to the following advantages: simpler culture process without micro‐carrier beads, lower cost, and higher virus yield. Therefore, MDCK‐S could be a suitable substrate for influenza vaccine seed preparation.
