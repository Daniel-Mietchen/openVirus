<p>Different lineages of H5N2 AIVs emerged in Taiwan during the period 2003â€“2015, with each lineage showing distinct pathogenicity and high frequencies of sequence variations in the NS gene (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). The present study aimed to explore the relationship between the sequence divergence of the NS gene with viral pathogenicity. Our results revealed for the first time that substitution of NS gene affects viral progeny yield, cytokine modulation, and viral RdRp function.
