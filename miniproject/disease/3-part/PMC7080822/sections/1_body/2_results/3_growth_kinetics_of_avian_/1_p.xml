<p>Next, an analysis of RG-AIV growth kinetics was conducted in MDCK and DF-1 cells to evaluate the impact of NS gene substitution. The two types of cells were infected with each of the four reassortant viruses at a MOI of 0.01, and the yield of progeny virus was determined every 12 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). In general, infection of all RG-AIVs was more efficient in DF-1 than MDCK, as indicated by the higher yield of viral progenies. Of note, infection of NS1031 in DF1 cells produced the lowest overall yield of viral progeny among the four RG-AIVs, significantly lower than NS0702 at later stages of infection (36 and 48 hpi) despite an initial significantly greater replication rate at 12 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). In MDCK cells, the yields of NS1680 and NS1031 progeny were significantly lower than those of parental NS0702 at later stages of infection (i.e., 24, 36, and 48 hpi; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>), and NS683 was not significantly different from NS0702 at any time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>). A consistent trend of viral yield was noted in human alveolar basal epithelial cells, A549 cells at 12 and 24 hpi, despite that overall the viral titer was lower than that produced in MDCK cells (
