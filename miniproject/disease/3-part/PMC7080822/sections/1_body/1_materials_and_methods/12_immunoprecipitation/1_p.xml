<p>The immunoprecipitation protocol was modified from a previous report (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). In brief, cells expressing NS1 tagged with FLAG were harvested in lysis buffer containing proteinase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). After clarification by centrifugation, one tenth of the whole-cell lysate (WCL) was kept as the input control. The remaining WCL was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gels (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, United States) at 4Â°C overnight. On the next day, the gel was washed 10 times with wash buffer [50 mM of Tris (pH 7.4) and 150 mM of NaCl]. Target proteins were then eluted in SDS sample dye and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by Western blot analysis.
