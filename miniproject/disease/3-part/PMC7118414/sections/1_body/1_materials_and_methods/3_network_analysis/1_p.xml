<p>The investigation of variation among different sequences, evolutionary pattern and origin of the virus on the basis of divergence of new strains from the parent strain (first isolated strains from 1953 isolates) was also done with all the 265 sequences. These evolutionary relationships were predicted using Network 5.0 software that involves convergent evolution, recombination polymorphism and microevolution in nucleotide sequences [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The median joining method was chosen to draw the network. The alignment file was prepared in DnaSP v. 5.10.01 for further use in network analysis [
