<p>The Shannon entropy analysis was done to identify the highly variable sites within the amino acid sequences with high entropy values. BioEdit (7.2.5) software was used for the Shannon entropy analysis [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A cut-off value of 0.2 was set and sites with values &gt;0.2 were considered to be variable [
 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
