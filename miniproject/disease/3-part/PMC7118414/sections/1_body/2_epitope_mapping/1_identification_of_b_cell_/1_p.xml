<p>The complete E1 sequence of the S27 prototype strain of CHIKV (AF369024) was used for the analysis. The IEDB (Immune Epitope DataBase) was used for the analysis of B-cell antigenicity [
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Prediction of linear epitopes in the amino acid sequence of E1 protein for B cells was done using six different propensity scale methods available with the IEDB.
