<p>The results of selection pressure analysis are summarised in 
 <xref rid="tab01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> with normalised dN/dS. The low dN/dS ratio (range is 0.143â€“0.187) suggested purifying selection in this region of the E1 gene. Nine amino acids were found to be positively selected by FEL (211, 226,291,297,304, 321, 344, 374 and 377). Seven positively selected positions (211, 269, 291, 304, 321, 374 and 377) were identified by IFEL method and four by SLAC method (211, 226, 304 and 321). Three amino acid positions (211, 304 and 321) were found to be under positive selection by all the three methods and two amino acids (226 and 377) by two different methods. Significantly, a mutation at 211 position was identified in most of the strains of all the three genotypes. Some of the mutations were identified to be genotype specific. We observed that three of the codon positions at 225, 304 and 377 mutated in most of the Asian genotypes, whereas the mutations at 226 and 284 positions were identified in most of the ECSA strains.
