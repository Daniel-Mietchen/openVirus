<p>The phylogenetic network showed distinct branching of all the three genotypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S1). All the CHIKV strains formed a network that is illustrated in panels a, b and c. Panel ‘a’ contains CHIKV strains reported from Tanzania in 1952 (first reported strain) and subsequent strains from Uganda, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Gabon, Tonga, Angola and Cameroon during1960s and 1970s. The Yawat strain happens to be the first isolate of ECSA genotype in India converged directly in the same group. The West African strains from Nigeria (1966), Cote d'ivoire (1981) and Senegal (1966) deviated slowly to branch out from these initial strains.
