<p>Phylogenetic analysis of sequences from 50 different countries during the last 65 years from 1952 to 2017 showed various clustering patterns in association with regions and year of circulation of the strains (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>, Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). The strains reported from countries like Nigeria, Senegal and Cote D'ivoire during 1964–2009 clustered in West African genotype. The Asian genotype consisted of the strains reported from India during 1963–2000 and the sequences from 1962 to 2017 from Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Micronesia. Recently reported strains from 2014 to 2017 from the Caribbean region, Columbia, Brazil and Mexico clustered in the Asian clade and were found similar to the strains circulating in Indonesia, China and the Philippines. The ECSA genotype is geographically more dominant and widely spread across the world. These include various countries in South, central and East Africa. Additionally, the reports of the circulation of these strains to many Asian countries have also been documented to start from the year 2004. However, the ECSA strains have entered the Americas as well as Europe during the recent past.
