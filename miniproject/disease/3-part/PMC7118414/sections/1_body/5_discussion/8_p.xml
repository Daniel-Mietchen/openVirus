<p>It may be noted that the present study describes the first report of detailed B- and T-cell epitope mapping of the E1 protein of CHIKV. All the selected potential peptides were present on the surface of the E1 protein. In addition, the peptides selected as likely epitopes for MHC-II molecules were present in domains I and III of the E1 protein. Domains I, II and III of the E1 protein were described in the crystal structure of the structural polyproteins of CHIKV [
