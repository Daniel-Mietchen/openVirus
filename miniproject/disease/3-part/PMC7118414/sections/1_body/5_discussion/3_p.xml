<p>The phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses of the global CHIKV sequences revealed interesting clustering of the sequences. Both the analyses suggested a similar branching pattern thereby delineating the spread of CHIKV in different geographic regions. The ECSA strains formed three clusters (I, II and III) whereas the Asian sequences formed two clusters (A and B). Cluster I consisted of the initial ECSA strains that were present in the African region during the 1950s and 1960s. Cluster II consisted of sequences from the African region that were circulating after the year 2000. Cluster III included all the strains of the 2004â€“09 epidemic in the Indian Ocean region including the IOL strains (Indian Ocean Lineage). In addition, this cluster also included the currently circulating ECSA strains of the Asian and American regions. Likewise, the Asian clade was sub-grouped into two clusters A and B. Cluster A grouped all the strains that circulated initially in the Asian region during the 1960s and 1970s. Group B included the strains that are recently circulating in regions like Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, etc. Further, some strains circulating in the Americas and Caribbean region also clustered in this group.</p>
