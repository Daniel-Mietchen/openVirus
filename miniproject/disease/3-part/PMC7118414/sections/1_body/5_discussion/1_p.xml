<p>CHIKV has been described from different geographical regions including autochthonous transmission and travel-associated cases. A few reports also relate to the evolutionary divergence of CHIKV in different parts of the world [
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Outbreaks of Chikungunya fever across the globe, spread of infection across a population and overall mutational load are the three main variables of the transmission. These variables may operate independently or collectively to give rise to a particular pattern of infection. The present study has attempted to gain an insight into the organisation, distribution and mutational load of the virus strains reported from different parts of the world. We evaluated the transmission dynamics of the CHIKV across the globe using phylogenetic, Network and Bayesian analysis focusing on all the three genotypes comprising West African, Asia and ECSA. The sequences were used from 50 different countries that showed well-established autochthonous transmission and some travel-associated cases from 1952 to 2017 encompassing 65 years. We undertook genetic characterisation of the viral strains by mutational analysis, variable sites, entropy, selection pressure and epitope mapping.
