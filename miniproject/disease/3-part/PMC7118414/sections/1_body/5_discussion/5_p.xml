<p>The Asian genotype of CHIKV was reported to have caused epidemics in many Asian countries from 1958 to 1973, subsequently followed by the reports of sporadic cases. Subsequently, the genotypic shift and introduction of ECSA strains in the Asian countries were initiated during 2004 [

The infection later on spilled over to the Indian Ocean region and Indian subcontinent leading to the epidemics in this region. The Eastward movement of ECSA strains was observed from Kenya to Comoros, Reunion Island covering the Indian subcontinent and subsequently to other Asian countries [
