<p>A detailed genetic characterisation of the global CHIKV strains was done using the variable sites, selection pressure and epitope mapping of the E1 protein. The neutral selection pressure, positively selected and variable sites have been determined for all the genotypes suggesting the stochastic process of evolution. Four of amino acid positions 211, 226, 304 and 321 were positively selected and had high entropy suggesting higher chances of mutation at these sites. The mutation at A226V was positively selected, had high entropy and was previously associated with the increased epidemic potential of the virus by enhancing the efficiency of mosquito transmission during 2004â€“09. The molecular along with the epidemiological studies can help in determining the importance of accumulation of these adaptive mutations in the selected genotypes/strains which might further affect the transmission of the virus to new territories [
