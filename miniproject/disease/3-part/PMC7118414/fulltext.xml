We attempted to gain an insight into the organisation, distribution and mutational load of the virus strains reported from different parts of the world. We describe transmission dynamics and genetic characterisation of CHIKV across the globe during the last 65 years from 1952 to 2017. The evolutionary pattern of CHIKV was analysed using the E1 protein gene through phylogenetic, Bayesian and Network methods with a dataset of 265 sequences from various countries. The time to most recent common ancestor of the virus was estimated to be 491 years ago with an evolutionary rate of 2.78 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> substitutions/site/year. Genetic characterisation of CHIKV strains was carried out in terms of variable sites, selection pressure and epitope mapping. The neutral selection pressure on the E1 gene of the virus suggested a stochastic process of evolution. We identified six potential epitope peptides in the E1 protein showing substantial interaction with human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. The present study augments global epidemiological and population dynamics of CHIKV warranting undertaking of appropriate control measures. The identification of epitopic peptides can be useful in the development of epitope-based vaccine strategies against this re-emerging viral pathogen.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Bayesian analysis</kwd><kwd>Chikungunya virus</kwd><kwd>docking</kwd><kwd>entropy</kwd><kwd>networking</kwd><kwd>phylogenetics</kwd><kwd>selection pressure</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="2"/><ref-count count="51"/><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chikungunya fever is caused by Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), an arboviral pathogen that has caused numerous outbreaks across the globe. It has been suggested that CHIKV probably originated in the Central/East Africa probably around 300&#x02013;500 years ago [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Phylogenetically, CHIKV consists of three separate clades namely (i) The &#x02018;West African&#x02019;, (ii) &#x02018;Asian&#x02019; and (iii) &#x02018;East Central South African&#x02019; (ECSA) [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].</p><p>CHIKV has now been recognised as a global pathogen due to its presence in a wide geographical range [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Increased global travel from CHIKV endemic regions has been the major cause of dispersal of the virus to non-endemic regions of the Americas and Europe. CHIKV has succeeded to maintain its mosquito&#x02013;human life cycle causing outbreaks of autochthonous cases in many geographical regions including the American continents. The virus has caused some autochthonous transmissions in a few parts of the USA during 2014&#x02013;15 [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. As the situation stands today, there is no local transmission of CHIKV in the USA currently. The virus has adapted itself to both <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> providing itself an alternate vector and introduction of the disease to previously unexposed populations [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The genomic analyses of CHIKV sequences reported from India during the 2009&#x02013;2010 outbreak revealed mutations in the structural and non-structural regions that contribute to the adaptations of the virus to locally available vector populations [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. CHIKV is currently circulating in around 100 countries worldwide as described by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). The virus has caused many epidemics with the co-circulation of ECSA (East Central and South African) and Asian genotypes, affecting millions of people [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The re-emergence of this virus is probably due to mutational changes, increased efficiency of vector transmission, immunologically naive populations, enhanced global dissemination, inadequate public health infrastructure, unforeseen environmental and social factors [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

This also included mutational analysis of the E1 gene, its variable sites and epitope mapping. We also desired to assess if there is a set pattern of the emergence of Chikungunya fever in different geographical regions. This information can be useful for the prevention and control of CHIKV outbreaks globally. Transmission and evolutionary analysis of the virus will help elucidate host&#x02013;pathogen dynamics during the course of CHIKV infections in humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials" id="sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2-1" sec-type="other"><title>DNA sequences</title><p>The sequences for the present study were taken from different countries at varying time intervals or from the same country at different times in order to avoid the repetition of similar sequences.

The strains reported from countries like Nigeria, Senegal and Cote D'ivoire during 1964&#x02013;2009 clustered in West African genotype. The Asian genotype consisted of the strains reported from India during 1963&#x02013;2000 and the sequences from 1962 to 2017 from Thailand, Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Micronesia. Recently reported strains from 2014 to 2017 from the Caribbean region, Columbia, Brazil and Mexico clustered in the Asian clade and were found similar to the strains circulating in Indonesia, China and the Philippines. The ECSA genotype is geographically more dominant and widely spread across the world. These include various countries in South, central and East Africa.

Seven positively selected positions (211, 269, 291, 304, 321, 374 and 377) were identified by IFEL method and four by SLAC method (211, 226, 304 and 321). Three amino acid positions (211, 304 and 321) were found to be under positive selection by all the three methods and two amino acids (226 and 377) by two different methods. Significantly, a mutation at 211 position was identified in most of the strains of all the three genotypes. Some of the mutations were identified to be genotype specific. We observed that three of the codon positions at 225, 304 and 377 mutated in most of the Asian genotypes, whereas the mutations at 226 and 284 positions were identified in most of the ECSA strains.

A few reports also relate to the evolutionary divergence of CHIKV in different parts of the world [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Outbreaks of Chikungunya fever across the globe, spread of infection across a population and overall mutational load are the three main variables of the transmission. These variables may operate independently or collectively to give rise to a particular pattern of infection. The present study has attempted to gain an insight into the organisation, distribution and mutational load of the virus strains reported from different parts of the world. We evaluated the transmission dynamics of the CHIKV across the globe using phylogenetic, Network and Bayesian analysis focusing on all the three genotypes comprising West African, Asia and ECSA. The sequences were used from 50 different countries that showed well-established autochthonous transmission and some travel-associated cases from 1952 to 2017 encompassing 65 years. We undertook genetic characterisation of the viral strains by mutational analysis, variable sites, entropy, selection pressure and epitope mapping.</p><p>The evidence of CHIKV occurrence in different geographical regions was reported as early as in the 1770s that was suggested by Carey in 1971 [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In 1779, Batavia recorded knuckle (joints) fever, in Cairo named as knee trouble, scarletina rheumatic in Calcutta, Madras and Gujarat in 1824&#x02013;25 [<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our data also supported that the CHIKV infection in humans originated around 491 years ago (1526). This tMRCA is similar to the reports that described the origin of CHIKV to be of 300&#x02013;500 years age [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The origin of the ECSA genotype was reported to be around 114 years ago (1903). Initially, this genotype was confined to the central, East and South African regions. Later on, the CHIKV diverged from these initial strains and were transmitted to other geographical regions that constituted the West African and Asian genotypes. The West African genotype originated from the Central African region around 61 years ago (1956). Whereas, the Asian strains descended 68 years ago (1949). The substitution rate was found to be 2.78&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> for the partial E1 gene compatible with other studies reporting 2.3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> to 4.6&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> for the complete E1 gene [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The phylogenetic and Bayesian analyses of the global CHIKV sequences revealed interesting clustering of the sequences. Both the analyses suggested a similar branching pattern thereby delineating the spread of CHIKV in different geographic regions. The ECSA strains formed three clusters (I, II and III) whereas the Asian sequences formed two clusters (A and B). Cluster I consisted of the initial ECSA strains that were present in the African region during the 1950s and 1960s. Cluster II consisted of sequences from the African region that were circulating after the year 2000. Cluster III included all the strains of the 2004&#x02013;09 epidemic in the Indian Ocean region including the IOL strains (Indian Ocean Lineage). In addition, this cluster also included the currently circulating ECSA strains of the Asian and American regions. Likewise, the Asian clade was sub-grouped into two clusters A and B. Cluster A grouped all the strains that circulated initially in the Asian region during the 1960s and 1970s. Group B included the strains that are recently circulating in regions like Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, etc. Further, some strains circulating in the Americas and Caribbean region also clustered in this group.</p><p>The Network analysis revealed that in the West African region, Nigerian CHIKV strain further diverged to Senegal and Cote D'ivoire [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This West African genotype was localised in this region from the late 1950s till 2009 that was not reported from other geographical regions. Our data also suggested that the emergence of the Asian genotype was from Thailand due to the first Asian epidemic in this region during 1958 [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Subsequently, the Asian genotype from Thailand diverged in three different directions. The first branch spread towards India, the second one continued circulating in Thailand and the third one moved to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. These strains in India and Thailand did not branch further and were observed until the 2004 epidemic. The third branch further diverged towards the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean region. We further analysed the divergence of this third branch of the Asian genotype in detail. The epidemic involving Asian strains started from Indonesia in 2010 causing the first outbreak in New Caledonia in 2011, Philippines, Yap Island (Micronesia) and China in 2012 [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This branch further moved towards other Pacific Ocean regions and French territories including Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Similar strains were also reported from East Timor, Moscow, France and the Caribbean Islands [<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The travel-associated spread of the virus in some areas of the Caribbean region lead to the establishment of mosquito&#x02013;human life cycle of the virus in these areas. Subsequently, many autochthonous cases were reported from these regions [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The virus then spread throughout the Caribbean region and then to Brazil, Mexico and French Polynesia [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The Asian genotype of CHIKV was reported to have caused epidemics in many Asian countries from 1958 to 1973, subsequently followed by the reports of sporadic cases. Subsequently, the genotypic shift and introduction of ECSA strains in the Asian countries were initiated during 2004 [<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. CHIKV initially circulated in major parts of Africa till 2004. The infection later on spilled over to the Indian Ocean region and Indian subcontinent leading to the epidemics in this region. The Eastward movement of ECSA strains was observed from Kenya to Comoros, Reunion Island covering the Indian subcontinent and subsequently to other Asian countries [<xref rid="ref42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. This progressive spread of CHIKV initiated an explosive epidemic that affected millions of inhabitants in this region including India during 2005&#x02013;2009 [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These epidemic strains branched independently from the node of initial ECSA strains and formed a separate branch known as IOL [<xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Subsequently, these strains spread to European countries including France, Italy and the Netherlands through travellers. This resulted in small outbreaks of autochthonous cases in these European countries [<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thus, the ECSA strains were reported from various geographical regions confirming its global spread.</p><p>The ECSA strains are presently circulating in many Asian countries namely India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, China, Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam that originated from a cluster of the epidemic strains [<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The other branch of the epidemic strains diverged into the sequences reported in recent years from Thailand, Sri Lanka and American regions (including Brazil, Mexico and USA). Thus, during recent years (2013&#x02013;14), ECSA has started a parallel circulation with Asian strains in the American continent and the Caribbean regions [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, the phylogenetic analysis of the ECSA genotype suggested a close similarity between these 2013&#x02013;17 strains reported from the USA and one particular travel-associated case that was imported from Angola to the USA [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These branching patterns of CHIKV strains across the globe based on the E1 gene reflect its gradual and consistent evolution.</p><p>A detailed genetic characterisation of the global CHIKV strains was done using the variable sites, selection pressure and epitope mapping of the E1 protein. The neutral selection pressure, positively selected and variable sites have been determined for all the genotypes suggesting the stochastic process of evolution. Four of amino acid positions 211, 226, 304 and 321 were positively selected and had high entropy suggesting higher chances of mutation at these sites. The mutation at A226V was positively selected, had high entropy and was previously associated with the increased epidemic potential of the virus by enhancing the efficiency of mosquito transmission during 2004&#x02013;09. The molecular along with the epidemiological studies can help in determining the importance of accumulation of these adaptive mutations in the selected genotypes/strains which might further affect the transmission of the virus to new territories [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>It may be noted that the present study describes the first report of detailed B- and T-cell epitope mapping of the E1 protein of CHIKV. All the selected potential peptides were present on the surface of the E1 protein. In addition, the peptides selected as likely epitopes for MHC-II molecules were present in domains I and III of the E1 protein. Domains I, II and III of the E1 protein were described in the crystal structure of the structural polyproteins of CHIKV [<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The T-cell epitopes induce long-lasting cell-mediated innate immune responses and thus vaccines against T-cell epitopes are considered to be most promising [<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. These <italic>in silico</italic> results need to be validated by future research. Taken together, the computational and experimental authentication of epitope mapping might contribute towards the formulation of effective vaccine strategies against this re-emerging viral pathogen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec7"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The reconstruction of the geographic distribution of CHIKV suggested a distinctive branching pattern owing to gradual alterations in the E1 gene. The recent movement of the virus to non-endemic regions of the world is associated with travel cases and its autochthonous transmission. Co-circulation of CHIKV with other arthropod-borne viruses like Dengue and Zika in many regions has been reported from different geographical regions. Overlapping clinical symptoms and limited diagnostic tests, particularly in underdeveloped countries, can complicate the accurate reporting of CHIKV infections. Therefore, a comprehensive surveillance of all the arthropod-borne viruses at both hospital and community levels would go a long way in determining the transmission dynamics of these pathogens. This is likely to provide intellectual enrichment on the global disease burden and the formulation of possible control measures for the prevention of these viral infections.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgement</title><p>Funding in our laboratory is supported by University Grants Commission (UGC) [41-1287/2012 (SR)], Council of Scientific and Research (CSIR) (37(1697)17/EMR-II), and Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine (CCRUM), Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy (AYUSH) (F.No.3-63/2019-CCRUM/Tech).
