  <p>Antibody response in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculated C57BL/6 mice. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS), CAF01 delivered RNA (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01), or RNA alone (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the right foot. Mock inoculated mice received 20 μl VP-SFM media or VP-SFM media containing 0.3 mg CAF01. Serum was harvested at various times post inoculation and titrated for IgM 
   <bold>(A)</bold> and IgG 
   <bold>(B,C)</bold> by ELISA. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Neutralizing antibody titers at day 30 post inoculation were examined. Each symbol represents the mean ± standard error from 5 to 6 mice. Statistical significance of IgM and IgG titers was analyzed by one-way ANOVA with Tukey posttests and neutralizing antibody titers by Kruskal–Wallis test with Dunn's posttests (groups indicated on the figure legend by the bar and *color). *
