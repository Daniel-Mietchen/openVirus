  <p>CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculation protects against CHIKV disease in the ipsilateral foot of C57BL/6 mice upon CHIKV-WT challenge. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated with viable virus particles (10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS), CAF01 delivered RNA (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01) or RNA alone (2 μg CHIKV-WT or CHIKV-NoLS RNA) subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the right foot. Mock inoculated mice received 20 μl VP-SFM media or VP-SFM media containing 0.3 mg CAF01. At 30 days post inoculation, mice were challenged with 10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT in the ventral/lateral side of the 
   <bold>(A,B)</bold> ipsilateral or 
   <bold>(C)</bold> contralateral foot and monitored daily for footpad swelling. Each symbol represents the mean ± standard error from five to six mice. Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>t</italic>-test between the groups indicated on the figure legend by the bar and *color, and 
   <italic>P</italic>-value.
