  <p>CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculated AG129 mice survive CHIKV-WT challenge and are protected from development of disease. AG129 mice were inoculated with 2 μg CHIKV-NoLS RNA complexed with 0.3 mg CAF01 in the ventral/lateral side of the right foot. Mock inoculated mice received 20 μl VP-SFM media or VP-SFM media containing 0.3 mg CAF01. Mice were challenged with 10
   <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the right (ipsilateral) foot 30 days post inoculation. Survival curves were constructed 
   <bold>(A)</bold> as mice were monitored for CHIKV-induced footpad swelling 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, the development of disease signs 
   <bold>(C)</bold> and changes in weight every 24 h. Disease signs in inoculated AG129 mice were scored on a scale of 0–4 where 4 is humane endpoint. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Serum was collected on days 1–5 post challenge and virus titrated by plaque assay. Each symbol represents the mean ± standard error from five to six mice. Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>t</italic>-test.
