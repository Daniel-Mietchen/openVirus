<p>The CAF01 adjuvant was manufactured as previously described by the thin-film hydration method (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). The two components of CAF01, composed of the quaternary ammonium compound dimethyldioctadecylammonium (DDA) and the glycolipid trehalose 6,6′-dibehenate (TDB), were synthetically manufactured by Avanti® Polar Lipids, AL, USA. In brief, weighed amounts of DDA and TDB (5:1) were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (9:1, v/v), and the organic solvent subsequently was removed by a rotary evaporator, thereby forming a thin lipid film at the bottom of the flask. The lipid film was rehydrated in Milli-Q water (Millipore, 18.2 MΩ cm at 25°C) with 10% trehalose (w/w) by heating for 20 min at 60°C with stirring. Freshly prepared CAF01 was freeze-dried in glass vials as previously described (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The vials were frozen in dry ice, dissolved in acetone for 10 min, and placed on the plate of a freeze-dryer with a temperature of −40°C. At the end of the freeze-drying process, the glass vials containing CAF01 were stored at 4°C until use. The average zeta potential and size of CAF01 alone and complexed with RNA were measured at 25°C using a Nanosizer (Zetasizer Nano Series ZS, Malvern Instruments, UK) with disposable capillary cuvettes. The results are the average of triplicate independent measurements analyzed using Dispersion Technology Software (Malvern Instruments, UK).
