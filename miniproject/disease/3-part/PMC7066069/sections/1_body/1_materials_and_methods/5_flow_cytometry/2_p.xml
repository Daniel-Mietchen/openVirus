<p>Mice were sacrificed at day 6 post challenge and perfused intracardially with PBS, and feet collected. Bone marrow cells were flushed out using PBS, and feet were digested with collagenase IV (2 mg/ml, Worthington Biochemical Corporation) and DNase I (5 μg/ml, Sigma Aldrich) in RPMI and 10% FCS (Sigma Aldrich) and then filtered through 70- and 30-μm nylon meshes to obtain single-cell suspensions. Cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against CD3 (clone 17A2, BioLegend), CD4 (clone GK1.5, BioLegend), CD8 (clone 53-6.2, BD Biosciences), CD45 (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences), TCRβ (clone H57-597, eBiosciences), CD11b (clone M1/70, BD Biosciences), MHCII (M5/114, eBioscience), and LIVE/DEAD. Sphero™ Blank Calibration Particles (BD Biosciences) were used as counting beads. Cells were analyzed using flow cytometry on a BD LSR II Fortessa Cell Analyser. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo software (v10.6; Treestar, Inc.).</p>
