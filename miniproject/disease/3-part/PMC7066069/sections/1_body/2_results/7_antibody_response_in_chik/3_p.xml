<p>Inoculation of mice with CHIKV-NoLS vaccine formulations induced antibodies that were able to neutralize CHIKV-WT. Plaque reduction neutralizing antibody titer (PRNT) at day 30 post inoculation was expressed as the reciprocal of the serum dilution yielding a &gt;80% (PRNT
 <sub>80</sub>) or &gt;50% (PRNT
 <sub>50</sub>) reduction in the number of plaques. As a positive control, CHIKV-WT-infected mice produced PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> of 507 and a PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> of 94 (

However, CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 and CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculation produced significantly lower amounts of neutralizing antibody compared to CHIKV-WT inoculation. CHIKV-NoLS inoculation produced a PRNT
 <sub>50</sub> of 193 and a PRNT
 <sub>80</sub> of 71 (

 <sub>50</sub> of 24 (

 <sub>50</sub> antibodies.
