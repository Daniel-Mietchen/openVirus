<p>CHIKV vaccine studies in mice and non-human primates indicate that neutralizing antibodies are the primary mediator of protection (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). We examined the humoral immunogenicity of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 in mice receiving a single vaccination, as described above, using virion-based ELISA and plaque reduction neutralization assay. All mice inoculated with virus particles, CAF01-delivered RNA, or RNA alone seroconverted after one dose (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7A,B</xref>). A significant difference between the IgM levels stimulated by CHIKV-NoLS and CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 was observed at day 6 post inoculation, with higher levels in CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice suggesting a more rapid IgM response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7A</xref>). IgM levels peaked at day 6 in CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice, whereas in CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice, IgM levels peaked at day 13 post inoculation. IgM was first detected in CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice at day 13 post inoculation, suggesting a delayed IgM response in these mice. CAF01 stimulates a more rapid IgM response than delivery of RNA alone, with almost no IgM detected at day 6 post inoculation in both CHIKV-WT RNA and CHIKV-NoLS RNA compared to higher levels in CHIKV-WT CAF01 and CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice maintained a high level of IgG, similar to that observed in CHIKV-WT-infected mice, at days 13, 21, and 29 post inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7B</xref>). CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice developed only low levels of IgG, similar to CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice (
