<p>CHIKV-WT, CHIKV-NoLS, CHIKV-WT CAF01, and CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated mice rapidly developed intense footpad swelling by day 2 post inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E,F</xref>). In CHIKV-NoLS, CAF01-inoculated mice, footpad swelling began to recover by day 5 post inoculation and resolved close to mock-infected levels, beginning to plateau, at day 13 post inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2E</xref>). A degree of footpad swelling was observed in mock-CAF01-inoculated mice in the days following inoculation. This swelling was, however, minimal compared to that observed in other groups with no significant difference compared to mock-inoculated mice from day 12 post inoculation (
