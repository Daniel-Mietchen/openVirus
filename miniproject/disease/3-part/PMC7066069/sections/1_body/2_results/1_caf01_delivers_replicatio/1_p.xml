<p>To overcome potential production limits for our CHIKV vaccine candidate (CHIKV-NoLS), we developed a liposomal approach to deliver the replication-competent RNA genome of the live-attenuated vaccine. As proof of principle, CHIKV-WT RNA was 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed from infectious cDNA clones (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>) and packaged with CAF01 liposomes. The surface charge and average size of CAF01 complexed with RNA were measured by dynamic light scattering. CAF01 in VP-SFM solution had a surface charge (zeta potential) of 23.4 mV. CAF01 with 2 μg RNA in VP-SFM had a zeta potential of −21.8 mV. The average size of CAF01–RNA complexes was 616.9 ± 67.45 nm, with a polydispersity index of 0.62 ± 13.35.
