<p>Two peaks of footpad swelling were observed in CHIKV-WT-infected mice, at approximately days 2 and 8 post infection, as reported previously (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). As expected, CHIKV-NoLS-inoculated mice developed no footpad swelling (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Mock-infected mice and CHIKV-WT RNA- and CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice also developed no footpad swelling. All mice inoculated with CAF01, including mock CAF01, developed a high degree of footpad swelling between days 2 and 12 post inoculation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>). After this time, swelling began to resolve close to mock-infected levels, with near-complete resolution of swelling by day 28. No footpad swelling was observed in the contralateral foot of any group (
