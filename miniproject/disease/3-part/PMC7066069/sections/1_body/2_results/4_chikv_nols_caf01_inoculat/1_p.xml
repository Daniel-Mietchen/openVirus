<p>As CHIKV-NoLS CAF01-inoculated AG129 mice survived, AG129 mice were used as a lethal challenge model to test the vaccine efficacy of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01. AG129 mice were inoculated with CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 or mock infected with VP-SFM alone or VP-SFM containing 0.3 mg of CAF01 subcutaneously in the ventral/lateral side of the foot. At 30 days post immunization, mice were challenged with 10
 <sup>4</sup> pfu CHIKV-WT in the ventral/lateral side of the ipsilateral (immunized) foot and monitored daily for clinical signs of disease, weight loss, and footpad swelling. Mock-immunized mice reached endpoint between days 1 and 3 post challenge. Mice immunized with CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 survived the challenge (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3B</xref>) or clinical signs of disease (
