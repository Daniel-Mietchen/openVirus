<p>To further understand the immune mechanisms responsible for early-onset disease and the local protective effect of CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 inoculation, flow cytometry was used to determine immune cell infiltration in the feet. To determine whether CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 provides local or systemic protection after CHIKV-WT challenge, mice were inoculated in the ipsilateral foot with CHIKV-NoLS CAF01 and subsequently challenged 30 days later with CHIKV-WT in both the ipsilateral and contralateral feet. The composition of immune cell infiltrates was assessed at day 6 post challenge in the ipsilateral and contralateral feet. The number of CD11b

CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculated mice, which displayed early onset of severe swelling when challenged with CHIKV-WT, showed a marked increase in all cell types in both the ipsilateral and contralateral feet compared to mock-infected and challenged controls. The number of activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes was significantly higher in both ipsilateral and contralateral feet of CHIKV-NoLS RNA-inoculated mice compared to mock-infected controls following CHIKV challenge (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6B,C</xref>). For both activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, the number of cells in unchallenged controls was low and similar to cell numbers in the CHIKV-WT-inoculated group, which was protected from development of swelling upon CHIKV challenge. This suggests that activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are involved in local CHIKV-induced inflammation upon challenge. That activated neutrophil and inflammatory monocyte cell numbers were high in both mock-challenged groups compared to unchallenged controls also emphasizes their involvement in CHIKV disease. Together, these data suggest that cellular infiltrates, particularly activated neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes, are involved in the early onset of severe CHIKV disease in CHIKV-NoLS RNA-challenged mice.
