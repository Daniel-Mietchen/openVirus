<p>The main exotic equine encephalitis viruses are vector-borne, either transmitted by mosquitoes or flying midges (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00023-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). They encompass viruses belonging to three genera, flaviviruses in the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family (Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), Saint-Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV)), alphaviruses in the 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> family (eastern, western and venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses, EEEV, WEEV and VEEV respectively) and orbiviruses in the 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family (equine encephalosis virus, EEV) [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Most of them, with the exception of EEV, are zoonotic. During such zoonotic infections, humans and equines will generally not develop viremia elevated enough to infect na√Øve mosquitoes and they are considered as dead end hosts; horses can however effectively replicate epizootic strains of VEEV, I-AB and I-C variants, developing high viremia for an average of 4 days and serving as virus reservoir for mosquito transmission to animals or humans [
