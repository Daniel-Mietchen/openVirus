<p>EEEV, WEEV, and VEEV are alphaviruses regularly identified in equine encephalitis in America. These enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA viruses encode two polyprotein gene clusters, driving the translation of four non-structural proteins (NSP1-4) and virus structural proteins (and in particular two Envelop proteins, E1 and E2) at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00023-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Epidemics or epizootics of EEE, WEE, and VEE have been recognized at irregular intervals since 1831, 1847, and 1939, respectively, in different regions of America (

 <xref rid="B171-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. The last documented human WEE case in North America occurred in 1994 and the virus has not been detected in mosquito pools since 2008, while severe epizootics involving more than 41 horses have been identified in 2019 in Mexico (Promed archive 20190406.6407111) [

 <xref rid="B172-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. The most severe forms of alphavirus equine encephalitis are associated with EEEV and VEEV epizootic variants. VEEV strains are classified into six subtypes (subtypes I-VI), with subtype I including five antigenic variants (A, B, C, D, E, and F) and epizootic strains corresponding to I-AB and C strains only. All other subtypes and other subtype I variants are endemic strains and seldom cause encephalitis in horses. Epizootic I-AB and C strains were shown to arise from E2 mutations of enzootic I-D or E variants leading to increased protein positive charges and in particular from T213R/K substitution [

 <xref rid="B174-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. VEEV enzootic strains are mostly maintained in birds and rodents belonging to

 <italic>Zygodontomys</italic>, 
 <italic>Heteromys</italic> and 
 <italic>Proechimys</italic> genus and in 
 <italic>Culex melanoconion</italic> mosquitoes, while epizootic variants are transmitted by more diverse mosquito species (

 <italic>Psorophora</italic> genus) [

 <xref rid="B177-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. Alternate infection of birds and

 <italic>Aedes</italic> bridge vectors are involved in EEEV transmission to humans and horses [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. EEEV clinical infections in horses are highly lethal, with 70% to 90% case fatality rate reported in the literature, in comparison with 20% to 50% for WEEV and 40% to 80% for VEEV (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). EEEV equine epizootics are regularly observed in the United States and in Canada, Ontario and in this respect, 2019 has sustained active transmission in North America, with more than 18 states from Eastern United States (the western limit being delineated by Minnesota and Louisiana) having reported more than 99 EEEV horse cases from early spring (end of March-April) to late autumn [
