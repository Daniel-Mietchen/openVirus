<p>Viruses: Flaviviruses, belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, are enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded and positive-sense RNA viruses. Their genome of approximately 11 kb encodes three structural proteins (capsid C, preMembrane prM and Envelop E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) involved in virus replication and counteractive of immune responses (

Notably, flaviviruses belonging to the Japanese Encephalitis serocomplex (such as WNV, Japanese, Saint-Louis and Murray Valley encephalitis viruses) express an additional non-structural protein, NS1′, resulting from ribosomal frameshift occurring at a specific heptanucleotide motif close to the beginning of the NS2A gene [
