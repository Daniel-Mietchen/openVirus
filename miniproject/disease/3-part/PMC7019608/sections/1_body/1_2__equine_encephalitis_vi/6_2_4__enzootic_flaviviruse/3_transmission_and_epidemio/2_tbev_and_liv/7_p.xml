<p>Prevention and control: There is no specific treatment for flaviviruses and disease control primarily relies on integrated virus surveillance and on vector control, with strategies and methodologies differing between European countries [

 <xref rid="B157-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>]. The canarypox vector performs an abortive replication cycle in mammalian cells where the inserted gene product (transgene) is expressed [

Finally, the Equilis West Nile vaccine from Intervet consists of the yellow fever virus (YFV) 17D vaccine strain where the prM and E genes of YFV have been replaced by those of WNV. This recombinant vaccine is injected under an inactivated form [
