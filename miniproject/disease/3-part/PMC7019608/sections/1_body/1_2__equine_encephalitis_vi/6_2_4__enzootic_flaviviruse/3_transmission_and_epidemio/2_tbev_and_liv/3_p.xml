<p>Pathogenesis and clinical disease: TBEV, LIV and WNV induce severe neurological syndromes, through pathogenic mechanisms that are still largely unknown. The majority of WNV and TBEV studies were done in vitro on transformed cells lines and in vivo on mouse experimental models [
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The exact mechanism of WNV and TBEV CNS invasion is unclear, but five models have been proposed that rely on the anatomy of the blood-brain barrier (BBB): (i) entry through the BBB via infected leukocytes (a so-called Trojan horse mechanism, demonstrated for WNV) [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]; (ii) a direct passage of the hemato meningeal barrier after its integrity has been compromised by the action of cytokines (TNFα) or metalloproteinases (MMP9) inducing changes in capillary permeability (WNV) [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]; (iii) direct infection of the brain microvascular endothelial cells without effect on cells integrity (WNV and TBEV) [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]; (iiii) infection or passive transport through the epithelial cells of choroid plexuses, whose function is the production of CSF (WNV) [
 <xref rid="B146-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]; (iiiii) infection via the neuronal pathway by the infection of olfactory neurons and/or axonal transport in the retrograde direction (mechanisms demonstrated for WNV only) [
 <xref rid="B147-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>]. This latter axonal transport promotes entry into the CNS from peripheral inoculation near nerve connections and acute flaccid paralysis of a limb. In an experimental model of infection of hamster, WNV was present 4–5 days after infection in multiple sites of the brain and spinal cord. Foci of neuronal infection were observed in the cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia or the anterior horn of the spinal cord [
 <xref rid="B148-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Neurons and astrocytes are infected with WNV and TBEV [

 <xref rid="B150-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. Following neuronal cell death, inflammatory molecules (such as IL1-β, IL6, IL8 and TNFα) have potentially toxic effects on uninfected neurons. Later, during infection, lymphoid infiltration can be observed in the infected regions with cells releasing proinflammatory cytokines destroying flavivirus-infected cells but also contributing to the pathogenesis of the virus by their cytotoxic action in the CNS [
