<p>The question of whether BoDV is a human pathogen has been debated for years. Several studies showed it may be a cause for some psychiatric disorders [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>], and possible responsible mechanisms have been proposed [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], but others have suspected that contamination occurred in initial studies [

 <xref rid="B108-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>]. How humans have been infected remains to be elucidated but the proximity of BoDV sequences from humans, shrews and horses leads to suspect a zoonotic risk.
