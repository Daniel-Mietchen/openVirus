<p>Diagnosis: The diagnostic of BoDV infection is particularly difficult. Clinical signs are not specific and low titres of antibodies in infected horses and low viremia (the virus is confined within the brain) does not allow a reliable diagnostic from serum or cerebrospinal fluids, even when the most sensitive serological or molecular tests are used. Standardized tests, validated by inter-laboratory assays, does not exist. Although intra-vitam studies give useful indicators, only 
 <italic>post-mortem</italic> analyses performed in brain, the tissue with the highest viral load, will confirm a definitive diagnostic (
