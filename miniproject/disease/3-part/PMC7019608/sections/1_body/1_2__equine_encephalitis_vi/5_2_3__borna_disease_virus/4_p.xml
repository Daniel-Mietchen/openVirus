<p>The bicolored white-toothed shrew, 
 <italic>Crocidura leucodon</italic>, is recognized as the natural reservoir host of BoDV [
 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>,
 <xref rid="B94-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>,
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. In this host, the virus replicates in numerous tissues, neural and non-neural, without causing clinical symptoms or pathological lesions. It is secreted in saliva, urine, skin, tears, and feces [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Horses may be infected via the olfactory route, as the presence of BoDV antigen and RNA, as well as inflammation and edema, have been found in the olfactory bulb of naturally infected horses early in the course of the disease [
 <xref rid="B97-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. This is supported by successful experimental intranasal infection of rats, mice, sheep, and horses (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]). In horses, the virus is mostly confined into the brain and, although BoDV RNA was found in oral, nasal and conjunctival fluids of naturally infected horses, infectious virus was rarely detected [
 <xref rid="B98-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>], indicating that transmission from horse to horse in stables is unlikely. Vertical transmission may be possible as viral RNA was detected in the brain of a pregnant mare and her fetus [
 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>] and was shown to occur experimentally in mice [
