<p>The Borna disease virus (BDV, renamed BoDV), 
 <italic>Mammalian 1 orthobornavirus</italic> according to ICTV nomenclature [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], is the prototype member of the 
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic> family, within the order 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic> [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. For years, it was the only member of this family, but since 2008 new bornaviruses were discovered in birds, reptiles, and mammals (reviewed in [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]). Amongst them, an avian borna virus (ABV), the Psittaciform 1 orthobornavirus, was shown to be responsible for the proventricular dilatation disease [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], and a mammal Bornavirus, the Variegated squirrel 1 bornavirus (VSBV-1), recently reappointed 
 <italic>Mammalian 2 orthobornavirus</italic>, was associated with fatal encephalitis in humans [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. This expansion of the 
 <italic>Bornaviridae</italic> family and the association of the new viruses with animal and human diseases revived the interest for this family and called for new classification [
 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>].
