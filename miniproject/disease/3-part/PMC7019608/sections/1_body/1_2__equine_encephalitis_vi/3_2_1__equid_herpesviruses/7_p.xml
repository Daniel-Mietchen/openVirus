<p>Diagnosis: Over the past 15 years, diagnosis tools have been improved (

 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The use of this powerful diagnostic assay has to nevertheless be considered with all the clinical information available by the practitioner, in particular the time of completion of the sampling (nasal swab and blood). Indeed, the viral load observed during EHM is generally much lower than the one observed during abortions. Given that EHV-1 latently infects leukocytes, PCR results obtained from blood samples should be interpreted with care. It is important for samples taken a few days after the observation of neurological clinical signs, not to exclude the possibility of an infection with EHV-1â€”even when a negative PCR result was obtained. Monitoring contact horses with PCR tests performed on nasopharyngeal swabs is then recommended. The discriminatory test between the neuropathogenic and non-neuropathogenic strains is also used in many laboratories (SNP PCR A/G2254), but regardless of the results of the SNP PCR, the practitioners will have to apply equivalent EHV-1 management measures. Virus isolation, serological testing (virus neutralization) and post-mortem examination are still informative.
