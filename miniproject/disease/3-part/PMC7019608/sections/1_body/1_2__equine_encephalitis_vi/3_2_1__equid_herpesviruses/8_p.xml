<p>Prevention and control: Practitioners need to identify quickly EHV-1 infections and to apply strict sanitary measures to stop virus spreading. Isolation and quarantine measures have to be applied according to high-risk groups. There is an urgent need to screen and separate potential virus shedders (either confirmed to be infected with EHV-1 or exposed) from non-exposed and healthy animals. Specific staff caregivers would be affected to each group and would have specific supplies (gloves, coats, calots, boots and footbath). A three weeks’ quarantine starts as soon as the last reported case is declared. At the end of the infected period, an eight days’ crawlspace, after carrying out cleaning and disinfection of boxes, is needed.</p>
