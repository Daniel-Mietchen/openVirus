<p>Equid alphaherpesvirus 1 (EHV-1) was recognized as a neuropathogenic virus in horses in 1966 [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Within the last 20 years, EHM has been considered as an uncommon sequela of EHV-1 infection in horses that led the USDA to classify EHM as a re-emerging disease. If different cases of EHM caused by EHV-4 were strongly suspected, no cases have been reported in the literature up to now. Although EHV-1 and EHV-4 share a high degree of genetic and antigenic similarities, differential virus tropism (the former virus being more endotheliotropic than EHV-4) and ability to interfere with the innate immune response could explain the differences in host range and pathogenicity between EHV-1 and EHV-4, as suggested by Ma et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, similar to sporadic cases of EHV-4 abortion, it cannot be ruled out that neurological cases may occur with EHV-4.
