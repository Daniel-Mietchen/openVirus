<p>Interestingly, Nuggent et al. and Allen et al. showed in 2006 that a single point mutation of adenine to guanine at nucleotide position 2254 in the catalytic subunit of the gene encoding DNA polymerase (ORF30) was often associated with EHV-1 neuropathogenicity (in 83% to 86% of cases), while absent in the majority of EHV-1 abortion outbreaks [

The non-synonymous A to G substitution at nucleotide position 2254 results in the replacement of asparagine (N) in position 752 (N752→D752). Experimental infections with recombinant viruses performed by Goodman et al. (2007) demonstrated that the N752 sequence variant of EHV-1 DNA Pol, when compared to the D752 variant, generated a low level of viremia in natural hosts and presented with reduced overall pathogenicity and capacity to induce neurological signs [
