<p>Diagnosis: Confirmatory diagnosis is preferably undertaken through virus identification by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) test, direct rapid immunohistochemistry test (dRIT), or pan-lyssavirus RT-PCR assays [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. DFA test, dRIT, and RT-PCR provide a reliable diagnosis in 98% to 100% of cases for all lyssavirus strains if an appropriate conjugate or primer/probe is used [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. For a large number of samples, conventional and real-time PCR can provide rapid results in equipped laboratories. Histological techniques such as Seller staining (evidencing Negri bodies) are no longer recommended for diagnosis. In case of inconclusive results from primary diagnosis tests (DFA test, dRIT, or pan-Lyssavirus RT-PCR), further confirmatory tests (molecular tests, cell culture or mouse inoculation tests) on the same sample or repeated tests on additional samples are recommended. Wherever possible, virus isolation in cell culture should replace mouse inoculation tests.
