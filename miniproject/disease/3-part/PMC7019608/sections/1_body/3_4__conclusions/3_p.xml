<p>Arboviruses are the most important cause of encephalitis in horses and many of these viruses are also significant human pathogens. Some of these arboviruses have recently emerged or resurged, such as WNV, JEV, SLEV, EEEV or EEV and an increased rate of emergence of vector-borne diseases can be inferred from recent studies [
 <xref rid="B188-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. A high diversity of mosquito species have been reported in Europe (mainly from 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Culiseta</italic> genera), and highly invasive 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. japonicus</italic> have rapidly established in several European countries over the last decade [

 <xref rid="B190-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>]. Vector competence of native and invasive European mosquito species for equine encephalitis viruses, other than WNV and JEV, has been unfrequently evaluated [

 <xref rid="B192-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>,
 <xref rid="B193-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>]. Consequently, identification of European regions at risk for the spread of exotic equine encephalitis viruses is difficult and mainly relies on information on mosquito and animal hosts density and on records of opportunistic mosquito species [
 <xref rid="B160-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>]. On-time control of vector-borne infections relies on the use of sentinel systems, including horses or sentinel chicken flocks for example, to provide warning of virus activity and initiate mosquito control measures [
