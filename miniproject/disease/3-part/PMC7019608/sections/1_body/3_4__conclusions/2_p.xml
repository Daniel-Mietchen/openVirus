<p>Clinical signs of viral equine encephalitis are not specific and overlapping geographical areas can make virus identification very challenging. One recent and striking example of delayed identification of emerging arboviruses due to similarities in clinical presentation and cross-reactive diagnostic tools was given during WNV introduction in the United States, when WNV was initially misdiagnosed with the closely related SLEV [
 <xref rid="B183-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Bearing in mind that three flaviviruses responsible for equine encephalitis are described in Europe, and that serological cross-reactivity is frequently observed in flavivirus indirect diagnosis assays, the development of multiplex approaches that allow the comparison of serological reactions against a wide range of pathogens appear to be valuable options [

 <xref rid="B185-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Furthermore, because in about one-half of infectious equine encephalitis, no known pathogen can be evidenced [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], identification of unknown neuropathogenic viruses by classical (electron microscopy) and more recent high-throughput techniques (next generation sequencing for example) is highly desirable [

 <xref rid="B187-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. In these two recent studies, three viruses, Shuni virus, horse parvovirus-CSF and eqcopivirus, have been identified as potential causes of neurologic disease in horses through unbiased detection from different tissues or body fluids; the demonstration of infectious virus from the brain of sick horses establish Shuni virus as a novel equine neuropathogenic virus [
 <xref rid="B186-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>], while for the other two viruses for which genomic DNA was detected in CSF and/or plasma [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-12-00023" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>], comparison of virus prevalence in the CSF of healthy horses (case-control study) would be required before a conclusion on the aetiology of equine encephalitis can be reached.
