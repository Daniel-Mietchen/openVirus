<p>Another polymorphism with a considerable effect on ERAP2 protein expression is rs10044354 (C/T), where homozygosity for the C allele results in very decreased levels of ERAP2 [

 <xref rid="B36-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In particular, the G allele of rs7586269 resulted in a decreased ERAP2 protein expression and a higher ERAP1 expression, suggesting the possibility of a concerted regulation of the expression of both genes by this polymorphism.
