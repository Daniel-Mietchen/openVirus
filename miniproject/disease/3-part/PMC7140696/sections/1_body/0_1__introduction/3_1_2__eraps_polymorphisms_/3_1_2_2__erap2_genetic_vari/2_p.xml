<p>As a consequence of the strong LD between the G allele of rs2248374 and the N392 variant of the rs2549782 SNP, K392 allotype is almost exclusively present in a number of different populations. An exception is represented by Chileans, where the two SNPs were not found in LD, thereby emphasizing the complexity of the ERAP2 locus in different populations [

Furthermore, it is conceivable that individuals who are homozygous for HapB—about 25%—do not produce the protein; conversely, the ones who are homozygous for the HapA haplotype present about 50% more enzyme in comparison to individuals with the heterozygous haplotype. Although the total absence of ERAP2 protein seems not to disable the cellular life and more broadly the immune system response, further studies are needed to identify the molecular reasons behind the maintenance of such apparently useless haplotype at 50% frequency [
