<p>Contrariwise, ERAP2 presents a marked preference for the positively charged arginine and lysine residues situated at the N-terminal and shows a greater efficiency toward shorter peptides that ERAP1 processes poorly [

Evnouchidou and colleagues verified that heterodimer formation changes enzymatic features and increases peptide-trimming efficiency, thus allowing the generation of a wider and more immunogenic antigenic repertoire [
