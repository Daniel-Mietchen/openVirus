<p>Another recent case-control study assessed the impact of ERAP1 allotypes on virus-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell response in a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B*27:05
 <sup>+</sup> individual with acute HCV-infection [
 <xref rid="B47-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Despite the patient displayed favorable prognostic indicators—symptomatic course of infection, IL28B/IFNL4 CC genotype and HLA-B*27 expression—he did not succeed in clearing the virus and developed persistent low-level infection with HCV [
 <xref rid="B47-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In-depth analyses showed that this individual carried two hypoactive ERAP1 allotypes and his CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells targeted subdominant epitopes longer than the classical 9-mer ones, never described previously. The authors, therefore, concluded that ERAP1 allotype deeply affect the virus specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell repertoire in vivo, shaping epitopes of different lengths which elicit qualitatively diverse CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell responses. Although there was no direct evidence of a cause-and-effect correlation between the hypoactive ERAP1 variants and the generation of an alternative antigenic repertoire, it is known that ERAP1 peptide trimming activity is modulated by ERAP allotypes, which in turn condition HCV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells recruitment. Taken together these results suggest an association between the process of antigen shaping by ERAP1 and the outcome of HCV infection [
