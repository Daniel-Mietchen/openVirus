<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection—for which a preventive vaccine is not yet available and which has infected about 71 million people worldwide—is one of the major causes of acute and chronic liver diseases and results in chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A percentage of people who contract the infection does not develop chronic hepatitis, spontaneously clearing the virus; conversely about 30% of chronically infected individuals develops one of the above-mentioned conditions [

Fortunately, the availability of highly efficient direct-acting antivirals has revolutionized the treatment landscape with over 95% cure rates as accurately reviewed in [
