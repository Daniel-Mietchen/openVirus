<p>An effective immune system aims to eliminate the infected cells owing to the presentation on their surface of antigenic peptides, bound and exposed by MHC class I molecules. As ERAP1 and ERAP2 play a critical role in shaping these suitable-sized peptides, polymorphisms in their gene sequence can significantly affect the produced antigenic repertoire, thus conditioning infection chronicity as demonstrated for HCV infection [
