<p>A more recent study focused onto another HCMV miRNA, miR-UL112-5p, whose function resembles the one played by miR-US4-1. Indeed, miR-UL112-5p directly targets the 3’ UTR of ERAP1-A SNP variant, thus downregulating its mRNA expression and altering the presentation of many HCMV-derived antigenic peptides to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
