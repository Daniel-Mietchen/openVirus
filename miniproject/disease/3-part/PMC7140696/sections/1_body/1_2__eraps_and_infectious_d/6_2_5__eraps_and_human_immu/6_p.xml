<p>L. Chen et al. demonstrated that ERAP1 silencing reduced the presentation of the HIV-Gag immunodominant HLA-B27 epitope, KK10 [

Furthermore, they observed that cells expressing the Arg528 ERAP1 variant, which has an in vitro slower substrate-trimming rate compared with the WT one, were less susceptible to CTL lysis compared to those expressing WT ERAP1, despite equivalent amount of ERAP1 expression. Overall, these results suggest that ERAP1 silencing or the presence of less efficient ERAP variants reduce functional presentation of a naturally occurring HLA-B27 epitope to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, therefore modifying the antigen repertoire and activation of the immune system [
