<p>Since ERAPs shape the final repertoire of peptide antigens presented by MHC class I molecules to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, the two aminopeptidases have been investigated as potential targets and/or modulators of HIV-1 infection and virus-host interaction. One of the first studies in this field showed the involvement of ERAPs in the creation of a specific HIV-1 CTL response hierarchy and epitope abundance [

Actually, structural and functional analyses demonstrated that antigen cleavage process modulates the number and length of epitope-containing peptides, thereby affecting the response avidity and clonality of T cells. Another link between ERAPs and HIV-infection was evidenced in 2004 by R. Draenert et al. [
 <xref rid="B109-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. The authors demonstrated that in HLA-B57
 <sup>+</sup> HIV- infected individuals there is a mutation at residue 146 (alanine to proline) of the HIV Gag protein immediately before the NH2 terminus of a dominant HLA-B57-restricted CTL epitope. This mutation was found to prevent the NH2-terminal cleavage by ERAP1, leading to decreased HIV-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell immune response. Notably, these results show that allele-associated sequence alteration within the flanking region of CTL epitopes can modify antigen processing and are consistent with the observation that HLA-B57
 <sup>+</sup> patients often exhibit a strong and protective CTL response [
