<p>In 2010, R. Cagliani et al. demonstrated an association between ERAPs polymorphisms and HIV-1 infection [
 <xref rid="B110-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Thus, the authors showed that long-standing balancing selection has maintained genetic variability at human ERAP1 and ERAP2 genes. Additional results indicated that the rs2549782-G ERAP2 polymorphism is significantly more represented in an Italian cohort of HESN (HIV exposed seronegative individuals) subjects who, despite repeated exposure to HIV-1 infection, do not seroconvert [

Moreover, HLA-B typing indicated that the HLA-B*57 allele, which has been associated with both delayed progression to AIDS and decreased susceptibility to HIV-infection, is significantly more common than expected among HESN homozygous for rs2549782-G [

Notably, by analyzing HIV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects carrying different ERAP2 alleles the authors also detected an alteration of the antigen processing/presenting machinery, which presumably results into a quantitative and/or qualitative variation in MHC class I complexes presented on target cells [
