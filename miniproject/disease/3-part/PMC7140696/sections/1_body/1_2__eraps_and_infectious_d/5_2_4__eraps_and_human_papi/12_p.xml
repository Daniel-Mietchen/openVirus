<p>The most recent study seeking possible correlations between HPV infection and ERAP1 has been conducted in 2019 by E. Reeves et al. whose work aimed at investigating the association between ERAP1 allotypes and the degree of lymphocyte infiltration in HPV-induced tumors [

 <sup>+</sup> T cells—are related to better clinical outcome in various cancers [

 <xref rid="B102-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. In some HPV-derived cancers—cervical squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC)—the specificity of tumor-infiltrating CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes (CD8
 <sup>+</sup>TILs) for HPV epitopes has been demonstrated. In particular, analyses showed that peripheral and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> TILs recognize epitopes originating from the E6/E7 proteins expressed by the viral genome [

 <xref rid="B104-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Moreover, a correlation between TIL infiltrates and a better survival was shown in OPSCC [

 <xref rid="B105-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Because of ERAP1’s pivotal role in the antigen processing pathway, the authors verified if ERAP1 allotypes correlate with the amount of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> TILs in 22 patients with HPV
 <sup>+</sup> OPSCC, grouped into three different categories (low, intermediate, high CD8
 <sup>+</sup> TIL levels). Although many allotypes were shared between the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> TIL groups, some differences were observed in their trimming capacity. Indeed, ERAP1 allotype pairs in the CD8
 <sup>+</sup> TIL
 <sup>high</sup> group had a major trimming capacity compared to the one expressed by individuals with low CD8
 <sup>+</sup> TIL numbers. This finding suggests the idea that ERAP1 function correlates with the quality of anti-HPV T-cell response which, in turn, modulates tumor outcome [
