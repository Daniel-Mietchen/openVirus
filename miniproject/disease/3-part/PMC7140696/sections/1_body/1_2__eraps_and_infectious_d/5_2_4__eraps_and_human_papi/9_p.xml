<p>To further investigate the contribution of genetic variations in the APM to HPV-induced cervical carcinoma risk, A.M Mehta et al. in 2015 conducted a further study on the genotype and genotype interactions of 11 previously identified SNPs in seven genes coding for some APM components, including ERAP1 [

Results showed that, as in the Dutch population, APM genetic variability is correlated with cervical carcinoma risk, but patterns of association differ between the two populations. In particular, while in Javanese a strong association between cervical carcinoma risk and ERAP1-575 locus on chromosome 5 and the TAP2-379 and TAP2-651 SNPs on chromosome 6 could be established, only the TAP2-651 locus correlated with carcinoma risk in Balineses [

 <xref rid="B89-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Indeed, these two Indonesian areas show a different oncogenic HPV subtypes distribution suggesting that distinct HPV subtypes may evade the immune system by hijacking different host genetic factors, providing also an explanation for the distinct association patterns in the Dutch population [
