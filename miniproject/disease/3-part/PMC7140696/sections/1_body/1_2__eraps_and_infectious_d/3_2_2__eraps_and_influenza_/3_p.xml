<p>Given the known link between HLA-B27 and ERAPs in conferring genetic predisposition to ankylosing spondylitis (AS) [

 <xref rid="B51-cells-09-00720" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>], A. Akram et al. performed a study on double transgenic (Tg) mice (i.e., B27/ERAP−/− and B7/ERAP−/−), in order to further investigate the correlation between ERAP and different MHC I alleles. In particular, considering that flu immunodominant epitopes (nucleoprotein (NP) 383–391 for HLA-B27
 <sup>+</sup> and NP418–426 for HLA-B7
 <sup>+</sup>) are well characterized, the study was conducted on flu-infected mice. Results demonstrated that ERAP activity is deeply influenced by its MHC-I context, highlighting how significant is the cooperation between HLA-B27 and ERAP in peptide shaping and presentation. In fact, while in association with HLA-B7 the presence or absence of ERAP did not affect the immune response, its lack in combination with HLA-B27 resulted into a substantial decrease of CTL response toward NP383-391 epitope during flu infection. Such defect was possibly secondary to a decreased ability to trim the N-terminally extended NP383–391 peptides in absence of ERAP, resulting in a reduced quantity of B27/NP383-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in B27/ERAP−/− mice [
