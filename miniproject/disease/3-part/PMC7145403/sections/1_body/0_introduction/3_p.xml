<p>In 2015 the Russian Government released a “State Strategy to Combat the Spread of HIV” with goals to expand HIV screening, increase antiretroviral availability and reduce new HIV infections as well as mortality related to AIDS and co-morbid infections, specifically viral hepatitis and TB (

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Seventy-two percent of PWID in the Russian Federation are infected with HCV (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), but contemporary Russia now faces the additional challenge of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB). Thirty-four percent of all cases of TB in the Russian Federation are MDR-TB making it the third-highest burdened country in the world (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). PWID are the highest risk group for the acquisition of TB and MDR-TB in the Russian Federation, and co-infection with HIV increases treatment failure 7-fold and risk of death 3-fold (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Eastern Europe also confronts similar challenges with MDR-TB (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, each country of the former Soviet Union has unique political and social landscapes that make it unwise to consider Eastern Europe and Central Asia as a distinct epidemiologic expanse without more localized data.
