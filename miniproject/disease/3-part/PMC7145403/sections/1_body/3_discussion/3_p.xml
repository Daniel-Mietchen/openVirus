<p>Relatedly, a low proportion of all articles from the Russian Federation (3.5%) were tagged with the theme of prisoners/ incarceration. Yet the Russian Federation has the highest incarceration rate of any country in Eastern Europe (446 per 100,000), second in the world to the United States (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and prisons are one of the main settings for the convergence of HIV, HCV and TB acquisition, all amplified by patterns of IDU (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the Russian Federation, the HIV prevalence in prisons is six times higher than the general population (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Meanwhile increases in incarceration rates have been shown to account for increases in TB incidence, and TB outbreaks in the community have been linked to TB outbreaks in prisons (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). While children co-infected with HIV and HCV in the Russian Federation had the highest treatment rate (61%) for HCV of 4 other European countries in one report (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), this trend has not been noted in Russian adults. For instance, only 3% of patients with known HCV reported ever receiving HCV treatment in a cohort of PWID in St. Petersburg (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Given the significant treatment success rate for HCV achieved with contemporary direct acting antiviral agents for HCV (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), comparable increases in HIV/HCV research output would have been expected. While we observed a proportional increase in HCV themed research in the Russian Federation over the bibliographic time period, the increase was more pronounced for countries of the former Soviet Union.
