<p>This geospatial bibliometric review of HIV/AIDS related scientific literature in the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union shows a lower than expected publication rate in the Russian Federation in response to a massive and growing HIV epidemic. Differences in research themes between the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union and lagging publication rates among Russian federal districts with high HIV prevalence may indicate opportunities for new research priorities to guide future HIV interventions, in conjunction with those currently proposed by the Russian government. Our findings suggest such focus to include the federal districts of Volga, Ural and Siberia with expansion of interventional research in HIV-related TB and viral hepatitis, and among higher risk populations, such as PWID. An interactive web-map displaying these findings was successfully developed and is now available as a tool for researchers and policymakers.</p>
