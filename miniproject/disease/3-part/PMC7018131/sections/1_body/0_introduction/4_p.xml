 <xref rid="pone.0228346.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] indicates that dengue is responsible for about 390 million infections per year, of which 96 million are apparent cases (clinically manifest). A growing incidence and geographic expansion of dengue outbreaks and epidemics in associated with the lack of effective vector control, lifestyle changes, population growth, urbanization, globalization and international human mobility [
