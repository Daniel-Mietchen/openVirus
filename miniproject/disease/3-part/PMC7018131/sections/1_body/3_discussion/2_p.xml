<p>In the period between 1990 and 2016, there was an increase in the incidence and consequent increase of dengue burden and the increase in the Disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) of Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs).Dengue represented the third highest proportion of DALY in the period and the main cause among NTDs in 2016, with the highest absolute number of new cases in Brazil [
