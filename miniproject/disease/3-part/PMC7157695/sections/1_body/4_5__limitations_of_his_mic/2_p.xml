<p>HIS mouse model limitations vary, specifically when considering which aspects of the immune response can be investigated in disease. For example, although human immune cells can react natively to viruses surveyed from their surroundings or introduced through infection of the immune cells, human CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell interaction with murine parenchymal cells is severely limited in most HIS models. Without the expression of human MHC I on mouse cells, an important part of the antiviral immune response by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells is absent. Non-hematopoietic cells in these mouse models are often antigen-positive for virus. Especially common is the infection of endothelial cells [
