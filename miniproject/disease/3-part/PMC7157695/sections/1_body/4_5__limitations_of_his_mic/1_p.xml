<p>Introducing human cells into mice using any of the approaches described to date does not result in the same proportions of immune cells as seen in humans. Transgenic expression of human cytokines in HIS mice [

Furthermore, regardless of the model, generation of HIS mice results in experimental subjects that often differ in their immune system composition, introducing complex variability into experiments. Donor material can also vary from batch to batch and from institution to institution. The presence of these confounding variables is challenging for study design and data interpretation, requiring more test subjects. Despite these challenges, the possibility of studying immune systems of differing human genetic backgrounds is also a great advantage of humanized mouse models. Another powerful feature of HIS mice is that multiple genetically identical animals can be produced from the human-sourced tissue, providing a means for experimentation using multiple “clones” of a single human immune system.
