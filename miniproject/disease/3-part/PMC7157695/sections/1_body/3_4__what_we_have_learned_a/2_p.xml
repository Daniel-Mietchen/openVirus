<p>HIS mouse studies to date have shown value in investigating individual immune pathways, but have not provided a definitive answer regarding the most important events in human disease, nor a complete system to examine interrelated events. These events include dendritic cell and macrophage infection; immune target cell dysregulation; antigen presentation to CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells; involvement of B cells and antibody responses; infection of parenchymal cells; and killing of infected cells by CTL or NK cells. The interactions that can be investigated vary dramatically depending on the mouse model. For example, adding thymus xenografts to the HIS model allows T cells to be educated on the human thymus and to recognize antigens presented by human antigen presenting cells. On the other hand, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells only incidentally interact with murine MHC I but provide a more complete picture of the early events in which dendritic cells, macrophages, and monocytes are infected or take up antigen and present antigen to T cells and B cells, thereby activating these cells. While not an accurate model of VHF disease course from beginning to end, HIS mice provide a more faithful human immune system to examine specific features in a hypothesis-driven manner. For example, by comparing various viruses using the BLT system we have found that differences in dendritic cell and T cell responses exist and can be characterized even between closely related viruses [
