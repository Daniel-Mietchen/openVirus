<p>The initially intended application of HIS mice to VHF research was two-fold: to establish a small animal model that more faithfully recapitulated human disease, and to advance investigations into the role of the immune system in infection and disease. We have learned that engraftment of human immune cells and tissues is not sufficient to completely mirror human disease and that the lack of a direct interaction between human immune cells and the murine parenchyma may be the primary limitation in modeling pathology. Still, much has been learned and remains to be investigated regarding the involvement of the immune response in VHF disease, components of which can be studied using HIS mice. Currently, no vaccine evaluations in HIS mice for the viruses discussed here have been reported. However, given the infancy of the field, continuing to understand the models, particularly for VHFs, is necessary for designing and interpreting any putative vaccine work in the future. Studies to date have highlighted the challenges and complexities of HIS mouse studies. Nonetheless, the use of HIS mice in VHF research has been informative. Current and newly developed HIS models will continue to enable the study of complex immune interactions that occur in vivo upon infection and provide valuable insight into the human immune response to VHFs.</p>
