<p>Many questions remain about VHF diseases that may be addressed in HIS mice. The factors that differentiate why some people develop subclinical infection while others develop severe or fatal disease are unknown, for example. Using different donors for humanized mouse generation could be helpful in revealing whether underlying donor differences in the immune system could be responsible for such strongly divergent outcomes of infection. Additionally, some VHFs have yet to be investigated in HIS mice, including, notably, arenaviruses. The family 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> includes many hemorrhagic fever-causing species [
 <xref rid="B90-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] that are predominantly spread by small rodents, but few aspects of human immune responses to these viruses are known. For example, most immunological knowledge of humans with Lassa fever, the most characterized arenaviral disease, is based on a few case studies of single patients [

 <xref rid="B94-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], leaving large sets of immunological analyses still unexplored. NHPs [
