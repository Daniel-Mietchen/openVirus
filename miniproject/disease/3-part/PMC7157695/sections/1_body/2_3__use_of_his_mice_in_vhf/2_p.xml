<p>HIS mouse models are beginning to address a knowledge gap in VHF research, enabling investigations of human immune cell reactions in vivo during productive infection. While research using HIS mice has increased, relatively few VHF studies have been published to date, and these are limited to only a subset of the known high-containment viruses (
