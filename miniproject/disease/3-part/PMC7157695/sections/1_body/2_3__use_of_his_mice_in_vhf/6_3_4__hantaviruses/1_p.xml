<p>Hantaviruses are harbored by rodents, shrews, and bats, but only rodent-borne hantaviruses have been reported to cause hemorrhagic syndromes in humans [
 <xref rid="B74-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Hantavirus research using HIS mice is limited. The only study to date compared human HSC-engrafted NSG mice (hu-NSG) with hu-NSG-A2 mice in regard to possible cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-induced immunopathologies during infection with Hantaan virus (HTNV; family 
 <italic>Hantaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Orthohantavirus</italic>) [
 <xref rid="B45-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. HTNV-induced disease progression was accelerated in the HLA-A2-expressing hu-NSG-A2 mice compared to hu-NGS mice that did not express transgenic human MHC I, despite similar viral replication in both models. Endothelial cells are considered the primary target cells of hantaviruses [
 <xref rid="B75-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Expression of human HLA-A2 on murine endothelia in the hu-HLA-A2 mouse would allow them to be targeted by CTLs, possibly contributing to the accelerated pathology observed in this model. HTNV infection caused a reduction in human platelet counts in hu-NSG-A2 mice while murine platelets remained unaffected. While a clear explanation for this phenomenon is missing, elimination of virally infected human megakaryocytes or platelets in HLA-A2-expressing mice or differing human and murine Î²3 integrin interactions with hantaviruses on activated platelets could be responsible [
