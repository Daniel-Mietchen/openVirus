<p>Ticks of the genus 
 <italic>Hyalomma</italic> are the main vector Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV; family 
 <italic>Nairoviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Orthonairovirus</italic>) throughout regions of Mediterranean Europe, Balkans, Middle East, Asia, and Africa. Livestock are prone to infection but remain asymptomatic while still being important for transmitting the virus to humans. In humans, symptoms range from subclinical infection to hemorrhagic syndromes, with fatal outcomes in 5â€“30% of cases [

 <xref rid="B68-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. These mice show a very rapid and highly lethal disease progression [

 <xref rid="B70-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], which is likely largely due to their genetically defective antiviral response rather than a faithful recapitulation of human Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF)-pathogenesis [
