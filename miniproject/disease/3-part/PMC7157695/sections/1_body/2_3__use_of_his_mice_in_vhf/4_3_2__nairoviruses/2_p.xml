<p>To date, there is only one report on CCHFV in HIS mice. Hu-NSG-SGM3 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with one of two virus strains: infection with CCHFV-Turkey was uniformly lethal, while CCHFV-Oman-infected mice all survived. Reports of human CCHF case fatality rates suggest that CCHFV is less pathogenic in Turkey than in Oman, but this may be due in part to under-reporting of mild cases in Oman [

Importantly, while the difference in outcome is notable, these studies were initiated to evaluate outcome in the model and not designed as a direct comparison of strain pathogenicity. Overall, disease progression in hu-NSG-SGM3 mice was slower than in IFN-deficient models, and thus more comparable to human disease. Within inflammatory foci, CCHFV immune reactivity was mostly localized in endothelial cells and immune cells like histiocytes, multinucleated giant macrophages, and Kupffer cells [

The main histological finding in lethally CCHFV-Turkey-infected hu-NSG-SGM3 mice was evidence of a neurotropic infection, resulting in meningitis, infection of astrocytes and glial cells, and infiltration of immune cells into the brain [
 <xref rid="B43-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Neurological signs in human CCHF have been reported, but are uncommon. The relevance of these findings to human disease remains unclear, as does the mechanism by which the presence of human immune cells may have conferred susceptibility to infection. Investigating CCHFV in HIS mice remains very preliminary. While fatal disease in hu-NSG-SGM3 mice is a promising outcome, additional studies using these and other HIS mice are needed, focusing on the role of the immune response in disease. Such studies will aid in determining the utility of HIS mice in CCHF research.
