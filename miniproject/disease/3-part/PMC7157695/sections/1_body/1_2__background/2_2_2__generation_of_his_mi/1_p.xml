<p>A variety of background mouse strains are used to generate HIS mice, but all background strains need to be immunodeficient in order to prevent rejection of the human xenograft by the murine immune system. The earliest models took advantage of the severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (
 <italic>Pkrdc</italic>
 <sup>scid</sup>) strain devoid of B and T cells that would otherwise mediate rejection of the human graft [

 <italic>Rag</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup>) strains are also useful B and T cell-deficient HIS hosts [

 <xref rid="B8-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Back-crossing SCID mice to the NOD strain [

 <italic>

 <sup>−/−</sup>) [
 <xref rid="B10-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] on both NOD/SCID [

 <italic>Rag</italic>
 <sup>−/−</sup> [
 <xref rid="B12-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] backgrounds further improved human graft acceptance, primarily by eliminating natural killer (NK) cell-mediated graft rejection. Additionally, the NOD allele of the inhibitory SIRP
 <italic>α</italic> receptor recognizes CD47 on human cells, thereby preventing phagocytosis of the xenograft by the murine myeloid compartment in NOD/SCID mice [
 <xref rid="B13-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Myeloid-mediated graft rejection in other HIS strains has been surmounted either by knocking in the human 
 <italic>Sirpα</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B14-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] or by knocking out the murine 
 <italic>Cd47</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B15-vaccines-08-00098" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], resulting in a human xenograft-tolerant phagocytic compartment. With each improvement in overall immunosuppression and tolerance within the murine hosts, human immune engraftment and reconstitution levels have increased both in cell number and repertoire in HIS models.
