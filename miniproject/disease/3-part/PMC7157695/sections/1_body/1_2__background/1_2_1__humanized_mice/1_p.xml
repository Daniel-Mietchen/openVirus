<p>The term “humanized mice” encompasses a wide range of mouse models that have been manipulated to express human genes, or to support engraftment or transplantation of human cells and/or tissues. “HIS mice” are a subset of humanized mice that are generated by xeno-engrafting human immune cells or tissues and/or their progenitors into immunodeficient mice, and contain viable components of a human immune system. Both the background mouse strain and the humanization procedure contribute to the resulting level of human immune reconstitution and immune system functionality. Overall, HIS models continue to improve as background strains become more immunocompromised and as knowledge of the factors that allow for robust humanization within the xenogeneic murine environment increase. </p>
