<p>VHFs are the result of direct virus-mediated effects and, to varying degrees, of both direct and indirect effects of the immune response to infection. Therefore, investigating the immune response during infection is critical for understanding the underlying mechanisms of pathogenesis. However, patient samples are often limited in number and type (restricted to sera or peripheral blood mononuclear cell preparations), particularly for studying early stages of infection, as samples are typically obtained during disease or convalescence. Animal model development aims to characterize species that develop clinical signs and pathology that at least partially recapitulate the clinical course of disease in humans, with the hope that they also mimic the underlying mechanisms of disease. Importantly, animal models can serve as a tool to comprehensively examine immune responses over the course of virus infection. </p>
