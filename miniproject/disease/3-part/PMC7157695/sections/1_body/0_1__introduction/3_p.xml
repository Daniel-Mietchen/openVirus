<p>Several mouse models have been developed to study VHFs, most of which rely on serially passaging virus to generate a disease-inducing variant or on the use of immunodeficient mouse strains. While there are advantages to studies using mice, the utility of the data generated from these models for understanding human disease is not always clear. To improve the translational quality of mouse models and to facilitate immunological and disease investigations, mice can be engrafted with human cells using a variety of approaches. However, the use of humanized mouse models brings unique disadvantages along with utility. Here, we provide an overview of recent use of human immune system (HIS) mice to study high-containment VHFs, with a focus on filoviruses, nairoviruses, phenuiviruses, and hantaviruses. Herein, we review the work to date involving HIS mice and the knowledge garnered from these models. We then address the complexities of designing and interpreting HIS mouse studies and discuss additional knowledge that can still be gained.</p>
