<p id="p0110">Few of our patients (2.6%) admitted with community-acquired infections received palivizumab-based antiviral prophylaxis prior to the onset of the infection. However, the retrospective evaluation of the medical files of all RSV-infected inpatients revealed that no other patient required palivizumab according to the 2007 French and the 2014 American guidelines [

Our results suggest that guidelines of antiviral prophylaxis are appropriately applied in our center but that most of the patients admitted for RSV infections (and most of those admitted to pediatric ICU), did not fall into the recognized indications for RSV prophylaxis, as recently reported by Ghazaly etÂ al. [

In light with the ongoing research into the development of new and more cost-effective strategies against RSV infections than palivizumab (including long acting monoclonal antibodies and vaccines), further larger studies defining the characteristics of patients hospitalized with severe RSV infections, may help to rethink the guidelines of RSV prophylactic strategies.
