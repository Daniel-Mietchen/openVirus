<p id="p0120">Interestingly, our study suggests that the efficacy of this infection control strategy may be less effective in adult than in pediatric wards. Indeed, nosocomial infections were proportionately more frequently diagnosed in adults than community-acquired ALRIs (p &lt; 0.0001) and the total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial RSV infection was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11%, p &lt; 0.0001). Similarly, Kestler M et al. recently described that RSV acquisition was frequently nosocomial or healthcare-related in adults during flu season [

Although we did not observe the high RSV-related mortality described in adults by Kestler (14.7%), we described longer length of hospital stay in case of nosocomial versus community-acquired infections in adults. Our results suggest that, despite a low rate of nosocomial infections observed in adults (0.15% of inpatients), our multifaceted infection control strategy may be reinforced in adults wards in order to obtain similar results seen in pediatric units. Because of the low number of nosocomial infections during the 2018/2019 RSV epidemic, it could be interesting to repeat this study during several successive seasonal epidemics in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our bundle of measures in a larger population.
