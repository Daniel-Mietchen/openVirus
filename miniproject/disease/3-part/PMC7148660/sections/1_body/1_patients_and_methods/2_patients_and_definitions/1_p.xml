<p id="p0030">We performed a prospective observational study in adult and pediatric patients admitted to Necker hospital between October 1, 2018 and February 28, 2019, with a minimum hospital stay of 2 days and a diagnosis of RSV-associated ALRI. RSV-infected patients were identified from the data provided by the virology laboratory. RSV-associated ALRI was defined as diagnosis of pneumonia, bronchiolitis, bronchitis or bronchial hyper-reactivity with concomitant detection of RSV in upper respiratory (nose/throat swabs) or lower respiratory (bronchial aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid) samples using PCR (RSV/hMPV r-gene®-Argene®, bioMérieux, Marcy l’Etoile, France). Patients with isolated upper respiratory tract infection and those without respiratory symptoms were excluded from this analysis, even if RSV was detected from their clinical samples.</p>
