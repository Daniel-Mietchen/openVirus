<p>Since the discovery of the ADCC phenomenon in 1965 by Erna Moeller [
 <xref rid="B65-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], multiple assays have been developed to measure ADCC activity for different purposes and are extensively employed in vaccine study and drug discovery. To measure ADCC activities 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, virus-infected target cells, antibodies, and effector cells are needed. The various assays differ in the type of effector cells used or the way to measure the cytotoxicity, which have contributed to high variability among the assays. Considering the complex mechanism of ADCC, it remains questionable which assays are the most physiologically relevant to predict the
