<p>This bioluminescent reporter assay is designed to determine ADCC activities by the measurement of firefly luciferase expression in effector cells [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. A modified Jurkat stable cell line expressing FcγRIIIa is used as effector cells and expresses firefly luciferase when activated by nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-response element during the time when FcγRs are bound by Fc portion of the antibody. This cell line is developed in a simple thaw-and-use format which reduces the high inter-assay variability and greatly increases the throughput. This commercially available assay has been employed to quantify ADCC activities against influenza infections [
