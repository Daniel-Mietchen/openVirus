<p>Previous antibody protective efficiency was measured by their capability to prevent HA binding via neutralization assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay [

 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], antibodies without these functions were less well defined. However, increasing evidence suggests that non-neutralizing antibodies (nnAbs) can confer protection via multiple mechanisms without disturbing virus entry or membrane fusion, such as activating complement, increasing phagocytosis, targeting internal viral proteins and eliciting fragment crystallizable (Fc)-effector functions [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Unlike neutralizing antibodies, nnAbs do not bind to the RBS in the HA head and fail to inhibit hemagglutination. Therefore, these antibodies demonstrate no detectable

Nonetheless, recent studies have validated that nnAbs can also contribute to the vaccine-elicited protection against influenza virus infection

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The protective mechanisms employed by nnAbs depend on the engagement with effector cells and consist of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), and antibody-dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis (ADCP). ADCP also assists in the elimination of virus-infected cells and protects against influenza virus infection in a mouse model [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Jegaskanda et al. showed that ADCC-mediated antibodies (ADCC-Abs) can be induced from monovalent inactivated influenza A(H1N1) virus vaccine, high titers of ADCC-Abs can contribute to lower virus replication and reduced clinical symptoms [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Zhong and colleagues demonstrated that both ADCC-Abs and neutralizing antibodies can be elicited by influenza vaccination [
