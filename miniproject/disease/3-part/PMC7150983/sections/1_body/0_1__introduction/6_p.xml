<p>The mechanism of the antibody-triggered Fc-effector functions is well understood. The antibody Fc region interacts with the FcÎ³RIIIa (CD16a) on the surface of the Fc receptor-bearing cells, primarily natural killer cells (NK cells). After the antibodies bind to their target viral proteins, the combined interactions activate these effector cells. The C-terminal immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in effector cells is subsequently activated to stimulate the release of granzyme B and perforin by activating signal-transduction molecules and various pathways, such as calcium-dependent pathways and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (originally known as extracellular signal-regulated kinases pathway) [
