<p>The HA and NA proteins are also highly immunogenic and antibodies targeting both glycoproteins can be isolated after natural infection or vaccination. Through binding to viral surface proteins HA and NA, antibodies can block the essential steps in the virus replication cycle, thereby limiting the spread of infection. Due to the host immune pressure and error-prone RNA polymerase, HA and NA are very plastic and display difference in antigenic properties. According to the antigenic difference, influenza A virus can divide into 18 HA (H1–H18) and 11 NA (N1–N11) subtypes [
