<p>Although mouse FcγRs and their counterparts in humans are named similarly, they may differ substantially in their expression pattern, antibody subclass binding affinities and

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some FcγRs, such as FcγRIIa, FcγRIIc, and FcγRIIIb, are expressed in human immune cells but not in mice cells [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and FcγRIV is expressed in mice immune cells but not in human cells [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Therefore, a transgenic mouse model consistently expressing human FcRs is needed when investigating human antibody-mediated Fc-effector functions and the human FcγR contribution to antiviral response. Smith et al. generated a mouse model without any murine FcγRs and human FcγRs genes were inserted into the mouse genome to express functional human FcγRs [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. These human FcγRs were validated to mediate the cytotoxic effects of human IgG antibodies, providing a valuable platform for therapeutic IgG antibodies studies [
