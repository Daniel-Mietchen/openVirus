<p>The protective efficacy of influenza vaccines largely depends on the stimulation of neutralizing antibodies. For a long period of time, vaccine efficacy has been evaluated by HI titers of neutralizing antibodies, which correlate fairly well with traditional views on vaccine-conferred protection. Recently it is becoming increasingly apparent that nnAbs also play a critical role in combating influenza infection even though

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, future evaluation of vaccine efficacy should take Fc-dependent antiviral functions into consideration to optimize vaccine efficacy. In this review, we have summarized multiple anti-viral mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies with ADCC function and reveal that ADCC can overlap substantially with other mechanisms to confer heterosubtypic protection against seasonal and pandemic influenza. The characterization of identified nnAbs constitutes a novel pathway that mayraise hope for the design of universal vaccines. However, there are still questions about ADCC-Abs need to be addressed.
