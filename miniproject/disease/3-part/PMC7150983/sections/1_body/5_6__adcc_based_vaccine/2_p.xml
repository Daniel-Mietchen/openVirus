<p>The ADCC activity serves as a protective mechanism of HA stalk-binding antibodies and ADCC-Abs also exhibit much greater cross-reactivity than classic neutralizing antibodies, defining a promising direction to universal influenza vaccines. Various animal models are used to assess the protective capacity of ADCC based vaccines, including mouse, ferret, and non-human primates. Florek et al. reported that the ADCC-Abs induced by vaccination are capable of inhibiting influenza virus shedding in cynomolgus macaques [

A study focusing on severe human infection cases in China and Australia suggested that antibodies from severe influenza survivors were more likely to exhibit potent ADCC activity, which highlights critical role of ADCC in combating influenza virus infections [
