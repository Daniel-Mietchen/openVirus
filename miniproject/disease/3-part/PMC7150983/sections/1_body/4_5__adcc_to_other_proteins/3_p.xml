<p>The M2 conducts the proton flux into the virion in the process of virus entry and equilibrates pH across the trans-Golgi network in the viral maturation stage [

 <xref rid="B116-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. M2e raises the hope for the universal vaccine because of its highly conserved sequence and antibodies targeting M2e with broad protective effects in animal models [

 <xref rid="B117-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>]. These studies indicate that M2e-based vaccines evoke cross-protective responses in an FcÎ³R-dependent manner. Generation and characterization of mAbs against M2e can provide critical insights for the development of novel therapeutics against influenza virus infection.
