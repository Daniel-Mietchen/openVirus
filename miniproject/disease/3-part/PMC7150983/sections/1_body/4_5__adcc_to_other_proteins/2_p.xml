<p>The NA functions to cleave host SA receptors in the viral life cycle allowing the release of nascent viruses and NA-targeted mAbs have shown a protective effect in animal models by blocking this release mechanism [
 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Antibodies targeting NA are induced at lower level than antibodies targeting HA after vaccination, which may be due to the relatively less expression of NA on infected cells [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Some NA-targeted antibodies require Fc-FcγR interactions to induce protection [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. DiLillio et al. reported that the broadly neutralizing NA-reactive antibodies, 3C05, can induce protective immunity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> in an FcγR-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B100-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Recently, Stadlbauer et al. showed that one monoclonal antibody generated from plasmablasts isolated from a human donor naturally infected with the H3N2 virus, designated 1G01, showed the broadest reactive spectrum to a variety of neuraminidases ranging from influenza A group 1 and group 2, to both influenza B virus lineages [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. These antibodies exhibited multiple anti-viral activities including the blockade of virus particle release and ADCC. The combination of two anti-viral mechanisms contributed to the broad protection from lethal challenges 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> by these antibodies targeting neuraminidase antigen.
