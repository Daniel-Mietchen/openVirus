<p>Three influenza proteins are expressed on the viral membrane; HA, NA, and the Matrix 2 protein (M2) and are targets for ADCC-Abs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00276-f004">Figure 4</xref>). Although still critical in the viral life cycle, compared to HA, NA and M2 proteins have relatively lower expression on the viral surface and are not heavily targeted by the immune response. For this reason, NA and M2 are similarly less immunogenic and have a slower antigenic drift rate. This makes them attractive vaccine targets and recently more studies have been exploring this avenue [
