<p>As stated above, HA stalk-targeted monoclonal antibodies and HA head-targeted antibodies with no detectable HI titer may evoke potent ADCC activities both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, HI-positive antibodies that block RBS are commonly demonstrated not to induce robust ADCC activities [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. This failure in inducing potent ADCC activity by HI-positive antibodies might be explained by a model proposed by Leon and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. In this model, two synapses between the effector cell and the virus-infected cells are essential for a robust ADCC response (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00276-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). The binding between Fc and FcγRIIIa serves as the first synapse and the interaction between viral HA head and the SA on the effector cell forms the second synapse. These two synapses cooperatively reinforce the connection between the target cell and the effector cell, which mediate robust ADCC activity. The Fc-FcγRIIIa interaction alone is insufficient to induce potent ADCC activity and the interaction of HA to SA on the effector cell is required to induce potent ADCC function [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. However, it remains obscure whether the SA-binding of HA activates a signaling pathway to induce ADCC or stabilizes the interaction between antibody and innate immune leukocytes [
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. HI-positive antibodies may compete with the SA on the effector cell in binding to the HA head domain, which as a result may impair the second synapse and hence lead to the reduced ADCC activity eventually (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00276-f003">Figure 3</xref>C). It was reported that the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ADCC activity induced by a stalk-reactive antibody is diminished after the addition of a HI-positive antibody [
 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. The blocked or diminished ADCC activity may be due to the competitive role of neutralizing (HI-positive) antibody in binding to the HA. Vaccination can induce both neutralizing mAbs and nnAbs, future vaccine design should consider this delicate balance to achieve the optimal vaccine efficacy.
