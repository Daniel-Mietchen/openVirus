<p>It is worth noting that neutralization and ADCC are not mutually exclusive. Antibodies with both anti-viral mechanisms have also been identified and characterized in recent studies, which demonstrated that ADCC activity could occur concurrently with a neutralization response [

 <xref rid="B106-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. Shen et al. reported that one HA head-targeted antibody, C12G6, can not only neutralize Yamagata, Victoria and earlier lineages of influenza B viruses, but also inhibits the membrane fusion, virus egress, and induces an ADCC response [

Notably, they also demonstrated that the potency of C12G6-mediated ADCC activity against different viruses followed an opposite trend to its HI activity, in which higher HI titer was found to be associated with relatively lower ADCC activity, and vice versa.
