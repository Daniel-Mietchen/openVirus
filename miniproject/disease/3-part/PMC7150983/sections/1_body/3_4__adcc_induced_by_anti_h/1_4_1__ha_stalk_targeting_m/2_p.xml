<p>Through inhibiting conformational changes essential to the membrane fusion, HA stalk-binding antibodies can disarm influenza virus infectivity [
 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Headless HA and chimeric HA are the two strategies to elicit HA stalk-reactive antibodies [
 <xref rid="B86-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. These stalk-reactive antibodies exhibit higher protective potency 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> than 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> since these antibodies may be capable of engaging FcÎ³R-bearing cells to confer Fc-dependent protection [

 <xref rid="B99-viruses-12-00276" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. Unfortunately, clinical outcomes of HA stalk-based vaccines are not encouraging so further clinical study was recently discontinued, which emphasizes a critical need to discover novel vaccines that are capable of inducing potent cross-subtype protective antibodies with ADCC activity (
