<p>The anti-stalk antibodies can induce ADCC activities through engaging FcγRs on NK cells, but the role of anti-HA head mAbs in inducing ADCC remains unclear. Dilillo et al. used an FcγR knock-out mice model to show that only anti-HA stalk mAbs can bind to FcγRs and induce ADCC potently whereas anti-HA head mAbs inefficiently induce ADCC activity due to poor engagement of FcγRs on the NK cell surface [

Recent studies suggested that some HA-head reactive antibodies (HI-negative) could also engage FcγRIIIa on NK cells and mediate ADCC activity (
