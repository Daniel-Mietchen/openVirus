<p>The Demographic and Health Survey Programme is a programme that conducts national, population-level DHSs worldwide, in which individuals are interviewed about a wide range of behavioural, socioeconomic, and epidemiological parameters. The AISs and many DHSs include voluntary HIV testing in adults. Approximately 350 sample locations (primary sampling units) are randomly sampled throughout the country of interest, and at each location residents of about 25 households are sampled. All individuals that were at home during one of the visits and were between 15 and 49 years of age (women) or 54 years of age (men) were eligible for the survey. GPS coordinates of sample locations are randomly displaced up to 2 km for urban and up to 5 km for rural sample locations, to ensure confidentiality of participants. Sample weights are incorporated in the DHS to translate unbalanced sampling into national representative data. In our study, we used these sample weights to estimate national HIV prevalence among adults and young adults for all 7 countries. For the other analyses, we combined data of multiple countries and explored local-level variances and thus did not use the sampling weights. More details on survey protocols and questionnaires can be found on the DHS website (
