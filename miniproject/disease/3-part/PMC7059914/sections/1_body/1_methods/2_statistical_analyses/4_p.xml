<p>Next to the main analyses, we also performed an internal validation of our regression models and an external validation of our kriging results. The internal validation was done using nonrandom cross-validation [

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] to check, for each country individually, how much heterogeneity (indicated by the conditional

 <xref rid="pmed.1003042.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], situated in one of the countries of our study. We compared our predicted HIV prevalence among young adults, obtained through kriging, to the estimates from these cohorts.
