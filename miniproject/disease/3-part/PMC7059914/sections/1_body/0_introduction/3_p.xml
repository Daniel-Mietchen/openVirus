<p>We identified areas of high HIV prevalence in young adults (women 15–24 years and men 15–29 years) for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), using geolocated HIV prevalence data from demographic and health surveys (DHSs) and AIDS indicator surveys (AISs). Next, we explored to what extent sexual behavioural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors explain the geospatial heterogeneity in young adults, as well as what heterogeneity remains unexplained.</p>
