<p>This work attempts to map 'hotspots' for young adults (proxy for higher transmission hotspots for targeting) in seven countries in Eastern and Southern Africa, specifically identify significant clustering and associated determinants potentially explaining the underlying heterogeneity observed. The work I believe makes a sufficient contribution/step forward to the existing body of literature in this area, is well written and should be useful for policy makers in these countries. I have some comments and suggestions below that need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted.</p>
