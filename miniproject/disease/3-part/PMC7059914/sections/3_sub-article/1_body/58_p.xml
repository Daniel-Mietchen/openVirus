<p>5) Population attributability - it may be worth considering a Poisson model with robust variance to estimate relative risks and the leverage prevalence of exposure to various risk factors to estimate population attributable fractions for each in addition to the effect sizes currently presented. This may reveal some additional subtle differences across the countries and within. Additional a decomposition type approach (e.g. Shapley) using a generalised linear framework could also be used to estimate the relative importance of the various covariates.</p>
