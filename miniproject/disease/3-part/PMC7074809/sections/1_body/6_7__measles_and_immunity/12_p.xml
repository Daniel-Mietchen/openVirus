<p>As already mentioned, the syncytium mechanism is responsible for an impairment of the immune system alike. The syncytia induced by the measles virus expressing the viral glycoproteins HA and F on their surfaces are able to suppress allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction between dendritic cells and T cells. In fact, cell contacts between MV-infected dendritic cells and T cells and/or uninfected dendritic cells are necessary to block allogeneic T-cell proliferation [
