<p>In fact, the measles virus in the early stages of infection, through interactions with antigen-presenting cell proteins, inhibits the transcription and translation of genes coding for IFNs, thus resulting in a longer lasting preclinical phase. During this period, the patient is contagious even without having yet expressed the clinical characteristics, which are manifest only after the inflammatory signaling cascades are activated and plasma levels of NFκB-induced proteins IL-6 and IL-8/CXCL8 and inflammasome products IL-1β and IL-18 are increased [

The rapid spread of the virus in various areas of the body is favored by the target cells that transport it to the various areas of the body and by the fact that the immune response is altered early. Mechanisms by which the virus evades the immune system are twofold. On one hand, it directly damages the T helper response whereas, on the other hand, it acts as a dysregulator of the chemotactic response.
