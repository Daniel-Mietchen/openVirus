<p>MV binds to several receptors of the host cells. In the respiratory tract, MV attaches to the epithelial cells through the interaction of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein (MV-H) with cellular receptors. From in vitro studies, it has been seen as the MV non-wild virus (vaccine and lab-adapted virus strains) can also use CD46 (a protein that is ubiquitously expressed on all human nucleated cells) and CD150 (signaling lymphocyte activation molecule) to infect cells, but this evidence has never been demonstrated for wild strains [
