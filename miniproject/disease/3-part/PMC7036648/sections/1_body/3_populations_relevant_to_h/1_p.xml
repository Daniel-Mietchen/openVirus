<p>The story of the earliest days of the US HIV epidemic is well documented (

 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). At the time the MACS was planned (before the antibody test for HIV was available), the investigators focused on recruiting men who have sex with men, representing the group with highest risk, to permit meaningful longitudinal inquiry in a reasonable period of time (
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The subsequent discovery of the virus enhanced understanding of its routes of transmission and allowed for a better picture of how HIV was acquired among other populations. In 1996, women accounted for 20% of AIDS cases, up from 7% reported in 1984 (

In 1999, African Americans, despite representing only 13% of the US population, accounted for 49% of US AIDS-related deaths, a rate 10 times that for white Americans (

The populations most vulnerable to HIV are those with unequal opportunities and/or social exclusion, who have poor access to services coupled with the overlapping epidemics of substance abuse and incarceration. Incarcerated persons who inject drugs, for example, have 6 times the prevalence of HIV compared with noninjecting prisoner populations (
