<p>A second consideration for including HIV-uninfected individuals has been the inclusion of a comparison group for the PLWH. MACS and WIHS recruitment efforts for individuals free of HIV have attempted to minimize differences from PLWH by using specified eligibility criteria (e.g., reported high-risk behaviors) and/or recruitment from similar geographic locations (e.g., sexually transmitted diseases clinics). However, epidemiologic confounding might occur because uninfected adults might be different in terms of various factors that we cannot control for at the time of recruitment (e.g., comorbidities and demographic, lifestyle, and socioeconomic factors). These differences must be accounted for in the design and analysis in order to produce valid inferences of the impact of treated HIV on age-related comorbidities (
