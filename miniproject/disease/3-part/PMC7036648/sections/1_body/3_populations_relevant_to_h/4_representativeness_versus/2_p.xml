<p>On the other hand, the MWCCS is a research study with a broad set of specific aims that focus on heart, lung, blood, and sleep comorbidities as well as other conditions known to co-occur with HIV disease, including mental and neurologic illnesses, diabetes, kidney failure, liver diseases, and certain cancers. The study is striving to characterize the occurrence and predictors of these conditions with sufficient statistical power. Broad inclusion criteria for reenrollment could result in recruitment of key populations, such transgender people, people who inject drugs, and prisoners, whose epidemiology might be dissimilar from the majority of the cohort. While understanding HIV among these populations is of high importance, the overall statistical strength of the cohort might be diminished if only small numbers of persons with these characteristics are enrolled.</p>
