<p>While lifespan and quality of life have increased for PLWH, there is increasing awareness that HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk for a range of outcomes not previously appreciated. (
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>) The outcomes we measure among PLWH have changed as a range of chronic morbidities has been shown to be elevated among HIV-infected individuals, including many outcomes not historically seen among individuals with HIV who, early in the epidemic, died prior to developing these age-related outcomes. Examples include cardiovascular disease (
