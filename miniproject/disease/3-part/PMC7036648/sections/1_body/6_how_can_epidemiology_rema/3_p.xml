<p>The type and level of measurement relevant to those at risk for HIV and PLWH has expanded considerably, and assessing measurement validity and reliability will be key contributions by epidemiologists. Studying HIV will require the adaptation of evolving tools to a host of new measurements, such as those that reflect the social environment as well as those derived from wearable devices and mobile phone applications. For example, e-health apps were shown in recent randomized trials to increase HIV knowledge and motivate safer behaviors among men who have sex with men, as shown by lower incidence of sexually transmitted infections (
