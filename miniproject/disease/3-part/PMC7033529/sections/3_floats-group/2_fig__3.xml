  <p>Purification and conformational characterization of secreted rZNS1-His. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Nickel affinity chromatography purification of rZNS1-His from 10X dialyzed supernatant of 1E4-C9 cells treated with 50 nM rapamycin and incubated in serum-free media for 9 days. Fractions collected were visualized by Coomassie brilliant blue staining. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Western blot analysis with anti-ZNS1 monoclonal antibody of 1E4-C9 supernatant processing steps prior to purification by nickel affinity chromatography. Coomassie brilliant blue staining was used as loading control. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Dot blot analysis with ZNS1 mouse polyclonal sera of 1E4-C9 supernatant, and 10 × 1E4-C9 supernatant or permeate fractions obtained by ultrafiltration with a 100 kDa MWCO disc membrane. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Immunoblot analysis with anti-ZNS1 monoclonal antibody of purified rZNS1-His subjected or not to heat (5 min 100 °C) and/or 100 mM DTT pretreatment. (
   <bold>E</bold>) Gel filtration chromatography of rZNS1-His showing a molecular mass corresponding to a hexameric quaternary structure (upper panel), and Western blot analysis with anti-His tag monoclonal antibody of the eluted fractions corresponding to rZNS1-His peak (lower panel). 
   <bold>(F)</bold> In vitro cross-linking of rZNS1-His with different concentrations of glutaraldehyde (GA) analyzed by Western blot with anti-His tag monoclonal antibody (left panel) and with Coomassie brilliant blue staining (right panel). In 
   <bold>(A,B,E)</bold> filled arrowheads show rZNS1-His position whereas in 
   <bold>(B)</bold> hollow arrowheads show the remaining bovine serum albumin contained in the serum-free culture media following a PBS washing step, and in 
   <bold>(A,B,D,E,F)</bold>, the positions of the molecular mass standards are indicated on the left.
