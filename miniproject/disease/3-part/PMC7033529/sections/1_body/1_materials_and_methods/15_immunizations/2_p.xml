<p id="par0120">Mice were obtained from our own breeding facility and were housed under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions. 6- to 7-week-old male BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with 20 μg of rZNS1-His emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Booster injections of 10 μg of rZNS1-His in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were applied 23 and 44 days after the first immunization. The humoral response of a test bleed performed 7 days after the final immunization was assessed by indirect-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (iELISA) (see 
 <italic>2.12. Indirect-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay</italic>). Mice were monitored daily on weekdays. There were no deaths associated to immunizations or care.
