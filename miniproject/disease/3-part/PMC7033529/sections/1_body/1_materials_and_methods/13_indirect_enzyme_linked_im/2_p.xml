<p id="par0110">Microtiter plates (Nunc Maxisorp 96-well ELISA plates) were coated with 100 μl of rZNS1-His (400 ng/well) in coating buffer (0.1 M Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub> buffer pH 9.5) for 18 h at 4 °C. Following incubation in blocking buffer (5 % skimmed milk in TBS) for 1 h at 37 °C, the plates were further incubated with human sera at a 1:100 dilution, or with mouse polyclonal sera at the indicated dilutions, for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer. Following four washing steps in TBS Tween-20 0.05 %, plates were further incubated in HRP rabbit anti-human IgG secondary antibody (Dako) at a 1:4000 dilution, or with HRP goat anti-mouse IgG Fcγ fragment specific secondary antibody (Jackson Immunoresearch) at a 1:2000 dilution, for 1 h at RT in blocking buffer. Finally, plates were washed four times in TBS Tween-20 0.05 % and after incubation with the substrate [0.3 % H

 <sub>2</sub>, 0.1 % 3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) in 0.1 M citric acid pH 5] for 15–20 min at RT, the reaction was stopped with 0.2 M H
