<p id="par0035">As with many other mosquito-borne flavivirus diseases, ZIKV epidemics usually occur in low resource populations, where 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes thrive under precarious infrastructure. Given that most of these regions do not have access to expensive equipment for traditional diagnostic methods ―such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)―, as well as stable power to operate the system, a rapid, accurate, sensitive and accessible diagnostic technique is urgently needed for the early detection of ZIKV infected patients [

 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], and the current lack of vaccine and effective treatments available, early diagnosis can save valuable time for patients that are being treated symptomatically and is critical in preventing ZIKV propagation and in the control of future outbreaks. In this context, development of diagnostic methods based on the detection of NS1 in the blood of infected individuals combined with the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies in a dual test is preferred for an accurate diagnosis [
