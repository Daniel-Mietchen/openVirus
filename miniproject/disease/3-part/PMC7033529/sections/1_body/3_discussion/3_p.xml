<p id="par0165">Enhancement of protein expression can significantly reduce time and/or cost in the manufacture of many therapeutic proteins. Several reports have shown that an increase in protein production in mammalian cells can be achieved by engineering the host cell, optimizing the culture medium, culturing the cells at low temperature or by the addition of SME to the media [

 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0315" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>]. With this in mind, we tested whether 1E4-C9 secretion of hexameric rZNS1-His could be upregulated by culture medium optimization and SME addition strategies. Serum starvation has been previously used as a medium optimization strategy for increased protein expression purposes [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. We established that the incubation with serum-free media for 9 days yielded the maximum rZNS1-His protein levels. Next, we studied the potential enhancement impact of SME addition to the serum-free media on the already increased rZNS1-His protein levels. The enhancing compound DMSO or hypotonic medium treatment did not affect rZNS1-His secretion. DMSO is an antioxidant that has been reported to increase IL-1β protein production and secretion through transcriptional upregulation [
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. On the other hand, hypotonic medium treatment has been shown to enhance protein expression in a similar mechanism by increasing transcriptional machinery accessibility to the chromatin [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Therefore, our results suggest that rZNS1-His production and secretion in 1E4-C9 cells is not affected by a transcriptional pathway boost. Nevertheless, we determined that 50 nM and 100 nM rapamycin treatment followed by incubation for 9 days in serum-free culture medium was able to significantly increase rZNS1-His protein secretion in our mammalian expression system. We presume that this effect occurred in response to rapamycin's ability to reduce the overall cellular biosynthetic burden [

 <xref rid="bib0330" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>], which apparently did not affect our recombinant protein expression. On the other hand, rapamycin is involved in the regulation of a plethora of cellular functions, such as promoting or inhibiting cellular apoptosis [
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In a previous study, it was reported that rapamycin treatment significantly delayed cell death and enhanced monoclonal antibody production in the CRL 1606 hybridoma cell line [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. We observed that rapamycin treatment did not prevent serum starvation associated cell death, in line with the notion that the effects of SME rely on the working conditions and the cell lines utilized [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Furthermore, rapamycin is a well documented autophagy inducer. Autophagy is a common innate host defense response after viral infection, although it has been reported that this catabolic process can also be utilized by some flavivirus to enhance their replication [
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. In line with this, several studies have indicated that ZIKV induces autophagy by triggering ER stress induction [
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">[74]</xref>]. Consistent with these findings, in the current study, rapamycin treatment and subsequent nutrient deprivation through serum-free media incubation, promoted rZNS1-His secretion in 1E4-C9 HEK293 cells. Similar results were obtained by Dupont et. al., who described that IL-1β secretion was upregulated in response to serum deprivation and rapamycin treatment, through an unconventional autophagy-based secretory pathway [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. As an alternative to rapamycin treatment, we determined that serum starvation following incubation with EBSS ―a saline solution with physiological pH that is usually used to induce autophagy through starvation pressure―, also increased rZNS1-His secretion in 1E4-C9 HEK293 cells. Further experiments should be performed to unravel if rZNS1-His increased secretion following rapamycin and serum-free media incubation is caused by an enhancement of the autophagic flux.
