<p id="par0140">In order to obtain stable rZNS1-His-expressing HEK293 cells, we first developed the pLB-ZNS1 vector by cloning the rZNS1-His mammalian codon-optimized fragment ―encoding a chimeric protein composed of a Kozak sequence, followed by the signal peptide of the G protein of VSV, the sequence of MR 766 ZIKV isolate comprising amino acids 791–1142 that correspond to the NS1 polyprotein, and the C-terminal 6xHis tag― into the lentiviral transfer vector pLB (Supplementary Fig. 1). Lentivirus were generated by cotransfecting the resulting pLB-NS1 vector with the packaging vector pSPAX2 and the VSV glycoprotein vector pMD2.G into HEK293E cells. HEK293 transduction was carried out by infecting HEK293 cells with the produced lentivirus. rZNS1-His expression was evaluated by immunostaining (

 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Next, to further characterize the rZNS1-His expression pattern in the clonal cell lines, we performed Western blot assays to determine the intracellular and secreted rZNS1-His protein levels. The results revealed that 1E4-C9 cells presented the highest intracellular (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C) and extracellular secreted (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D) expression of rZNS1-His protein. Hence, despite the similar percentages of positive rZNS1-expressing cells between 1E4-C9 and 1E4-D11 clonal cell lines observed by flow cytometry, we continued working with 1E4-C9 cells for their significantly higher intracellular and secreted rZNS1-His protein levels.
