<p id="par0145">Given that we sought to purify rZNS1-His in its hexameric conformation, which is the conformation of soluble NS1 secreted into the bloodstream of ZIKV patients during the acute phase of the disease [
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we studied if rZNS1-His protein secretion could be enhanced in 1E4-C9 cells. Previous studies have shown that an increase in protein production in mammalian cells can be achieved by optimizing the culture medium or by the addition of small molecule enhancers (SME) to the media [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. First, we assessed whether modifications in the culture medium could have an effect on rZNS1-His secretion in 1E4-C9 cells. Considering that several reports have described that serum starvation induces protein expression in human lung A549 epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], we tested if serum depletion was capable of enhancing the recombinant protein secretion in our stable HEK293 rZNS1-His-expressing cells. To this purpose, 1E4-C9 cells were incubated in 10 % FBS or serum-free culture medium ―without media replacement― for 5 or 9 days. Under serum depletion conditions, we observed an upregulation of rZNS1-His protein levels in the supernatant of 1E4-C9 cells following 5 and 9 days of incubation by immunoblot assays (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A). To further obtain quantitative data of the enhancement effect of serum depletion on 1E4-C9 cells rZNS1-His secretion, we carried out a Western blot assay of supernatants collected at different days after serum-free media addition (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). The results showed that significantly higher rZNS1-His accumulation in the culture media started at day 5, with a maximum at day 9 (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). The time-course analysis of rZNS1-His secretion was performed until day 9 because cell viability was reduced to 38 % at that time point, as assessed by MTT reduction assay (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D). The reduced cell viability was expected since serum starvation is considered an 'environmental stress' that is responsible for inducing cell death [
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Next, we studied whether addition of SME could further induce rZNS1-His secretion to the supernatant in serum-starved 1E4-C9 cells. To assess this, we tested the effect of two reported SME that enhance protein production in cultured mammalian cells: rapamycin and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>]. In addition, we analyzed if chromatin relaxation through hypotonic medium treatment ―a well-documented chromatin-modifying agent― [
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>], might render the chromatin structure more accessible to the transcriptional machinery, resulting in increased transcriptional activity and rZNS1-His protein production in 1E4-C9 cells. We performed Western blot assays to determine rZNS1-His protein levels in the supernatant of 1E4-C9 cells harvested 5 or 9 days after rapamycin, DMSO or hypotonic shock treatment followed by incubation in serum-free culture medium. The results revealed a significant 2.4-fold and 2.5-fold increase in rZNS1-His protein secretion in response to the exposure to 50 nM and 100 nM rapamycin at day 9, respectively (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>E). Addition of DMSO or hypotonic medium treatment did not enhance rZNS1-His production in serum starved 1E4-C9 cells. In previous work, Balcarcel and coworkers reported that rapamycin treatment significantly delayed cell death and enhanced monoclonal antibody production in a hybridoma cell line [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. To address whether rapamycin could prevent cell death in response to serum depletion in 1E4-C9 cells, we measured cell survival by MTT reduction assay 9 days following 50 nM rapamycin treatment and incubation in serum-free media. We observed that rapamycin treatment did not affect the reduction in cell viability observed for serum starvation (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>F). As an alternative to rapamycin ―a pharmacological reagent involved in the regulation of a plethora of cellular pathways such as autophagy induction―, we tested whether EBSS ―a solution with physiological pH that also triggers cellular autophagy― [
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] had the same effect on rZNS1-His secretion in 1E4-C9 cells. We observed that EBSS led to a similar increase to rapamycin treatment in rZNS1-His secretion at day 9 in serum starved 1E4-C9 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). Taken together, these results indicate that rZNS1-His protein secretion can be enhanced through at least 50 nM rapamycin or starvation treatment followed by serum-free media incubation for 9 days in 1E4-C9 HEK293 cells.
