<p>Influenza B and metapneumovirus almost always had overlapping peaks and showed very similar trends in synchrony with RSV and overall timing. Both viruses typically peaked in February or March, but shifted to autumn during the 2010–2011 season. The wavelet analysis confirmed this phase shift, as well as showing a shift out of phase by enterovirus. The uneven pattern in enterovirus corresponds to shifts in peak timing from September to July, and then back to September. Pandemic influenza years (2009–2010) and seasons with high levels of H1N1 (2013–2014) coincided with more volatility in enterovirus and metapneumovirus synchronization.</p>
