<p>Wavelet analysis and change point models are complementary methods we implemented to investigate the timing and patterns of epidemics. For our purposes, the strength of change point models over others, such as SIR models or circular statistics, is that they give more precise estimates of when different phases of a past epidemic began and terminated. Wavelet analysis compares epidemic timing in a way that allows for the behavior of the epidemic to change in different years. This would be more difficult if using methods that employ sine waves to estimate epidemic curves. We can therefore make direct comparisons of the historical characteristics of the epidemics (via change point models) and their synchrony with one another (wavelet analysis), using our selected methods. We recognize that there are many other methods that would lend different insights into the epidemic patterns described, but we deemed these two sufficient for the current study.</p>
