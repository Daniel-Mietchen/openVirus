<p>Wavelet analysis is nuanced but has many features that are similar to other wave decomposition methods. It has been shown to be a useful tool in comparing infectious disease rates in several studies [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00275" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Its strength is in allowing the timing of the epidemic curves to change from year to year by using a wavelet instead of something more regular such as a sine curve. This allowed for greater flexibility and precision in identifying epidemic trends that may change from year to year.
