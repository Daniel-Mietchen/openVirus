<p>Data are lacking for metapneumovirus prior to January 2007 and for rhinovirus prior to November 2007. Enterovirus is shown in a separate line plot due to its having a significantly lower mean count than the five other viruses, and it is plotted on a 1 January to 31 December cycle rather than the regular seasonal year.</p>
