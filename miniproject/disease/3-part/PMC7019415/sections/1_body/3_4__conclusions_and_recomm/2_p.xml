<p>We highlight the urgent need for raising awareness among healthcare providers, researchers, and policymakers about the issue of arboviral infections, building the capacity of Sudan biomedical laboratories, and increasing the funding for research, particularly to investigate the burden of infectious diseases. Also, improving surveillance, diagnostics, and strengthening the health system overall by adopting a multisectoral approach to control will help in detecting the early emergence of these infections to take action to mediate massive epidemics. Particular attention needs to be paid to reducing the threat of arboviral diseases in the most vulnerable groups in the community, including people living in humanitarian crisis settings, informal settlements, refugees and nomads, and generally, impoverished people throughout Sudan.</p>
