<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV; Phenuiviridae) is endemic with frequent outbreaks in Sudan, mainly in the central region and rich Savannah area, with continuous active transmission in both humans and animals [

 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. RVFV infections have been reported in 50% (9/18) of Sudanese States (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00081-f006">Figure 6</xref>). RVFV was first detected in central Sudan in the 1930 s, then reported from southern Sudan in 1959 [

 <xref rid="B68-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Several epizootics and epidemics took place in 1973, 1976–7, 1984, 2001, 2007–8, 2010, and 2016 [

 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is hypothesized that RVFV has been introduced into Egypt from Sudan through animal exportation [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. The circulation of RVFV was reported in central and northern Sudan [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Two major outbreaks occurred in Sudan in 2007 and 2010. In 2007, the outbreak was most devastating, with more than 700 confirmed human cases and a case fatality rate of 30.8%; estimated infections were up to 75,000, resulting in a great economic loss due to banning of livestock trade. Direct contact with infected animals and the use of unpasteurized or uncooked animal products were major risk factors [

 <xref rid="B80-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. RVFV infection was strongly associated with developing renal disease, with renal impairment reported from 60% of the 194 RVF patients admitted to Wad Medani Teaching hospital in 2007 [
 <xref rid="B81-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The limited phylogenetic investigations carried out in the 2007 and 2010 epidemics suggested multiple introductions into Sudan. All of the introduced strains clustered in the Kenya 1 and 2 sublineages, with the possible presence of other lineages or additional virus introduction events [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. A case of vertical RVFV transmission was reported from the Khartoum teaching hospital [
 <xref rid="B82-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Furthermore, miscarriage in humans was strongly associated with RVF [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. RVFV was detected in larval and adult stages of several species of mosquitoes (

 <italic>Ae. vexans</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles arabiensis</italic>,

 <italic>Culex quinquefasciatus</italic>) during an outbreak of RVFV in Sudan, suggesting vertical transmission, but the relative importance of each species in transmission was not determined [

 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. A serological survey showed that the circulation of RVFV persists among the animal populations of Khartoum [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Human risk factors associated with RVF include close contact with infected animals, and consumption of products from sick animals, heavy rainfall, and the type of soil and land topography [

 <xref rid="B85-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Unfortunately, most animal breeders do not report suspected infections to the veterinary or health authority to avoid the culling of their herds without compensation as a control measure for epizootics [
