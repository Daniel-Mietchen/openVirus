<p>Yellow fever virus (YFV; Flaviviridae) is endemic in Sudan and infections occur throughout the country (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00081-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Early studies suggested that yellow fever (YF) has been endemic in the middle and western regions of the country since the 1800s [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The world’s worst recorded outbreak of YF, with more than 40,000 cases and 1500 deaths, was reported from 1940 to 1941. YFV was detected in humans, non-human primates, wild and domestic animals in 1941, 1952, and 1953 [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. A survey in 1973 confirmed the active circulation of YFV in the area and indicated a high prevalence of prior exposure (95%) among the nonvaccinated population of central Sudan [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. YFV was detected in the Northern Province of Sudan in 1989 with high infection rates (39%) during an epidemic of febrile illness following heavy rainfall and flooding [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Other outbreaks took place in southern and western Sudan in 2005 and 2012–13, respectively. The low vaccine coverage prior to the 2005 outbreak and heavy rain were associated with the re-emergence of YF in western Sudan [

The 2012 epidemic, considered the worst in Africa in almost quarter of a century (1992–2016, only superseded by the Angola epidemic in 2016) with more than 800 confirmed cases and about 200 related deaths, primarily affected refugees living in camps. Case fatality rates ranged between 20% and 32% [

Unfortunately, the lack of a local arbovirology reference laboratory not only delayed the official confirmation of the outbreak but left the epidemic to grow exponentially with the local community unaware of the public health risk. Further, it allowed the virus to spill over into the neighboring country of Chad [
