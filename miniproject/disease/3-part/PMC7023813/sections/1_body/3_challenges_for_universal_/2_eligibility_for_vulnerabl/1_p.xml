<p id="Par71">Elderly people often have more serious complications from influenza infections and a less robust immune response to vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Currently, high dose or adjuvanted IIVs are recommended for people 65 years and older, while LAIV is only approved for healthy adults up to the age of 49. On the other end of the spectrum, maternally-derived antibodies generated from inoculation during pregnancy are expected to provide protection for infants &lt; 6 months, so vaccination that elicit a predominantly cell-mediated immune response are unlikely to be of use. Novel strategies for a universal flu vaccine will have to take into account differences in immune response from specific populations that are at higher risk for influenza complications.
