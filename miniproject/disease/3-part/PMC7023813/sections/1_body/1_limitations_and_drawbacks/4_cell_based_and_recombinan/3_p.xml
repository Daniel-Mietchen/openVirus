<p id="Par49">For recombinant HA production in insect cells, the baculovirus expression system is utilized to manufacture recombinant HA, which is then purified and formulated into HA trimer “rosettes” [

This not only has the same benefits of speed, flexibility and scalability as cell-based IIV, but also eliminates the reliance on influenza virus replication for vaccine production and the time-consuming process of strain selection. FluBlok, a recombinant HA vaccine developed by Sanofi Pasteur, was found to be 30% more efficacious than traditional IIV for people ≧50 years old [
