<p id="Par67">ACAM-FLU-A is an influenza M2 ectodomain vaccine developed by Acambis (now Sanofi Pasteur). Due to overlapping nucleotides with M1, the M2 ectodomain is highly conserved in influenza A viruses, but poorly immunogenic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. ACAM-FLU-A utilizes the Hepatitis B core (HBc) as a carrier to fuse three tandem repeats of the M2 ectodomain onto each HBc subunit, creating an immunogenic virus-like particle (VLP). Initial results showed intramuscular injection of the vaccine was able to generate anti-M2 ectodomain seroconversion in 90% of healthy volunteers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>], so combination with the other antigens or adjuvants might be necessary.
