<p id="Par65">M2SR is an M2 deficient single-replication LAIV being developed by FluGen. In this strategy the M2 sequence in the viral genome (critical for viral uncoating and assembly) is largely deleted, but viruses are produced in M2-expressing cells to generate infective virions. Therefore, after inoculation into a host the attenuated virus is unable to propagate infective progeny, limiting the infection to a single round of replication [
