<p id="Par66">Inovio has made efforts to apply their Syncon® synthetic DNA vaccine platform to influenza. By sequence alignment and cluster grouping of HA they have generated four “micro-consensus” sequences within an influenza subtype, which were then cloned onto expression vectors and delivered to the vaccine recipient via in vivo electroporation [
