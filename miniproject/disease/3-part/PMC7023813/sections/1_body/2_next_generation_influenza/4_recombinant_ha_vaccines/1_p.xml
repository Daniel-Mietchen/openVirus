<p id="Par60">An adjuvanted recombinant HA trivalent nanoparticle influenza vaccine (tNIV) has been developed by Novavax using the baculovirus expression system to produce recombinant HAs, which were then purified and mixed with polysorbate 80 to form protein-detergent nanoparticles of 2~7 HA trimers [

The administration of this tNIV with a saponin adjuvant (Matrix-M) in ferrets induced higher levels of neutralizing antibodies against a panel of A (H3N2) strains than a commercial inactivated vaccine (trivalent Fluzone). A Phase I/II clinical trial showed similar results in patients, where tNIV induced significantly greater HAI responses compared to trivalent Fluzone against not only previous strains, but a forward-drifted A/Singapore variant [
