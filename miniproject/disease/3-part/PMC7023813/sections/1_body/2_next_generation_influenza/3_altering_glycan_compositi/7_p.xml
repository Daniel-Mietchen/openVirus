<p id="Par59">Like the recombinant HA
 <sub>mg</sub> before, monoglycosylated split inactivated influenza vaccines produced by kifunensine and endoglycosidase H treatment were shown to have higher neutralization and cross-neutralization activity, higher hemagglutination inhibition (HAI), more HA stem selectivity, and higher antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) (Fig.
