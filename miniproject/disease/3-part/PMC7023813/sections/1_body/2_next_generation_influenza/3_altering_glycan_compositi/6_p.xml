<p id="Par58">While a recombinant HA
 <sub>mg</sub> vaccine would have all the advantages of a cell culture production system including speed, flexibility and safety, egg-based production remains the mainstay of influenza vaccine manufacture today. Devising a simple method to apply the monoglycosylation concept to egg-based vaccines with minimal modification will allow this procedure to be integrated into established production methods. Extensive testing found that kifunensine, an Î±-mannosidase I inhibitor, can be injected into embryonated eggs to convert influenza virus membrane glycoproteins to a uniformly high mannose composition. After harvesting these virions their high mannose N-glycans were then trimmed with endoglycosidase H to create intact monoglycosylated virus particles, and all participating reagents are removed in subsequent purification steps [
