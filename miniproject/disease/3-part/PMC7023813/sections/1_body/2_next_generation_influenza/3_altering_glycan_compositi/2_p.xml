<p id="Par54">When H1N1 first emerged in 1918, it carried only one conserved glycosylation site at position 104 (H1 numbering) on the HA head. But as the virus continued circulating in the human population up to the 1950s, it sequentially acquired glycans at positions 144, 172 and 177, all at or adjacent to the major antigenic site Sa on the HA head. This was followed by a 20-year hiatus as H1N1 was supplanted by H2N2, before re-emerging in 1977 carrying the same three acquired and one conserved glycosylation sites as before. The following decades saw N144 replaced by N142, the disappearance of N172, and the acquisition of N71 before the glycan shield was ultimately reset due to the emergence of 2009 pandemic H1N1, carrying only the original conserved glycosylation site on 104 [

Evidence that these acquired N-glycans provide a shielding effect comes from not only the observation that they tend to appear on or near major antigenic sites, but also studies have shown the acquisition of sites 177 and 142 on H1N1 slow genetic drift in the shielded areas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and the introduction of five recent glycosylation sites at positions 63, 122, 126, 133 and 246 allowed a 1968 H3N2 strain to evade polyclonal human serum raised against it [
