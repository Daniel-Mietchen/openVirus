<p id="Par57">Antibodies raised against HA
 <sub>mg</sub> inoculation demonstrated better binding affinity, neutralization and cross-reactivity than the unprocessed HA (fully glycosylated HA, or HA
 <sub>fg</sub>) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. HA
 <sub>mg</sub> also induced the maturation of dendritic cells, more splenic granzyme B-secreting CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and elicited a more diverse HA-specific B-cell repertoire than that of HA
 <sub>fg</sub> when used as a vaccine (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). In terms of cross-protection, inoculation with an H1N1 pre-pandemic Bris/07 HA
 <sub>mg</sub> not only provided better protection in mice against laboratory strains WSN and PR8, but also offered 70% protection against a pandemic strain [
