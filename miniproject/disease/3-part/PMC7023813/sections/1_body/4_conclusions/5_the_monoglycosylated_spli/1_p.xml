<p id="Par77">Although a more diversified criteria encompassing CMI, neutralization assays and NA antibodies is encouraged, traditional serological assays remain the gold standard for regulatory approval. By incorporating our monoglycosylation technology onto the existing inactivated split vaccine platform, we could invoke a similar humoral response as conventional IIVs. Serological surrogates of vaccine efficacy such as HAI or SRH can be measured and non-inferiority comparisons with conventional vaccines can be made, opening up a well-trodden path towards licensure.</p>
