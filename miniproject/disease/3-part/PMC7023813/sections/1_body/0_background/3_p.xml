<p id="Par37">Unfortunately, current seasonal influenza vaccines are strain-specific and have a very narrow range of coverage, meaning extensive surveillance, accurate predictions and annual vaccination are needed as circulating strains evolve continuously over time. This task is coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO) Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), which gathers year-round data from hundreds of national influenza centers around the world and issue vaccine formulation recommendations for each upcoming flu season [
