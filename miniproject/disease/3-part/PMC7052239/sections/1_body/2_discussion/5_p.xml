 </sup> argue that vertical transmission is more frequent in eggs allowed to hatch after longer periods, probably because of an increase in viral copy numbers in the eggs. It seems, therefore, that unfavorable environmental conditions, such as low availability of water, and the consequent increase in the time required for the eggs to hatch, favor vertical transmission. This may explain our findings of DENV-3 in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> during spring 2014 and autumn 2015, when there was lower rainfall (spring 2014: 5.1 mm; autumn 2015: 3.3 mm) than in the other periods (spring 2015: 26.5 mm; autumn 2016: 15.0 mm)
