<p id="Par3">In the Americas, the dengue cycle is essentially urban, having as fundamental elements of its transmission dynamics the etiological agent (DENV), the anthropophilic diurnal mosquito 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and the vertebrate host

 </sup> (humans). 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> is considered an exophilic mosquito with eclectic feeding behavior
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>
 </sup>, but some degree of anthropophily has recently been shown for this species
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>
 </sup>. Because of its vector competence under laboratory conditions, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> is considered a potential vector of DENV
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>
 </sup>. The species has already been found naturally infected with DENV in a pineapple plantation in Costa Rica
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>
 </sup>, but this evidence is not sufficient for it to be considered an actual vector.
