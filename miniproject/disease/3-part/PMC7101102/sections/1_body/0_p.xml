<p>In recent decades, pathogenic flaviviruses (yellow fever virus, dengue [DENV], and Zika [ZIKV]) and the alphavirus chikungunya (CHIKV) have become the most common agents of emerging arbovirus diseases among humans. Their geographic distribution, epidemiologic patterns, and modes of transmission overlap considerably, and because of increased human travel and migration, outbreaks have been reported in non–arbovirus-endemic areas. Proposed drivers of virus epidemics include factors that may affect vector distribution, such as climate change, wars/social change, and poverty (decreased vector control measures) (
