<p>Despite study limitations, we present some aspects of a large series of imported arbovirus infections diagnosed at specialized centers in Spain. Those imported infections may pose a risk for further transmission in areas where competent 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes are established, as illustrated by the recent diagnosis of autochthonous DENV and CHIKV infections in several southern European countries such as France, Italy, Croatia, and Spain (
