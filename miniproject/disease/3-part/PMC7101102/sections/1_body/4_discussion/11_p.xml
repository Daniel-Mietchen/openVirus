<p>These cases highlight the value of having a high index of suspicion and the need for rapid diagnosis of arbovirus infections, which may be aided in specific settings (e.g., emergency departments) by the availability of rapid diagnostic tests to detect specific antigens such as the NS1 DENV antigen. Early detection of imported infections in viremic patients could enhance the study of virus genomics through virus sequencing and phylogenetics, which may be used to investigate infectious disease outbreaks and contribute to transmission chain tracking. Viremic patients could also be instructed to protect themselves from insect bites to prevent further transmission in areas where competent vectors are established. </p>
