<p>As expected, most cases overall were caused by DENV, although in recent years, and coinciding with the introduction of CHIKV and ZIKV in the Western Hemisphere, increased infections caused by CHIKV and ZIKV have been registered. In our study, CHIKV accounted for most of the arbovirus infections diagnosed during 2015, and ZIKV caused most of the arbovirus infections diagnosed during 2016, mirroring the epidemiologic situation and public concern at the time (ZIKV infection could account for some of the asymptomatic patients who may have sought care for reasons such as preconception or predelivery testing on return from travel) (

Although the network’s catchment area had increased over the years, the proportion of arbovirus infections compared with the total was considered, and increased arbovirus infections were observed during 2015–2017; a downward trend in 2018 reflected global epidemics and increased awareness of these infections.
