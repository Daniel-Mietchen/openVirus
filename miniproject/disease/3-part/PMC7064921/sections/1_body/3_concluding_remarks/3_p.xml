<p>At the epidemiological level, co‐infections by CHIKV and 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites can be underestimated in human populations due to the immunosuppressive nature of malaria which can result in the development of asymptomatic CHIKV infections without compromised joints. The absence of alphavirus screening in confirmed malaria cases might also contribute to a higher burden of asymptomatic CHIKV carriers.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0087" ref-type="ref">87</xref> On the other hand, reduced viremia upon co‐infection could impact CHIKV transmission dynamics by reducing the number of successfully infected mosquitoes after a blood meal. These observations highlight the need for the incorporation of alphavirus diagnosis in malaria intervention programs.
