<p>Inflammatory cytokines such as IFNγ, IFNα, IL‐2, IL‐2R, IL‐6, IL‐7, IL‐12, IL‐15, IL‐17, and IL‐18 have been shown to be upregulated during acute CHIKF.

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> IL‐2R (produced upon T cell activation),

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0032" ref-type="ref">32</xref> suggested the involvement of T cell responses during the acute phase of disease. Transcriptomics analysis in CHIKV mouse models revealed overlapping pro‐inflammatory gene expression signatures with RA patients.

 <sup>+</sup> helper T cells have been associated with acute CHIKF and RA. It has been shown that CHIKV infection triggers strong IFNγ‐producing CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses (Th1).

 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> Collectively, these observations supported the idea that CHIKV‐induced joint swelling and RA could be mediated by pathogenic host immune responses in a similar fashion.
