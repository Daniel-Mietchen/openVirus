<p>CHIKV‐neutralizing antibody responses are known to play a pivotal role in the control of CHIKV infection. Lum et al
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0152" ref-type="ref">152</xref> reported that CHIKV infection in mice lacking functional B cells resulted in high‐level viremia that lasted for more than a year. Notably, co‐infection experiments (in both sequential and concurrent settings) revealed delayed virus clearance from footpad tissues.
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0119" ref-type="ref">119</xref> In further support of this, circulating levels of CHIKV‐specific IgM and IgG and their virus‐neutralizing capacities were found to be reduced at 15 dpi upon concurrent co‐infection. Complementary experiments allowed us to identify the spleen as the main site of B cell dysregulation as co‐infection in splenectomized mice led to similar CHIKV‐specific antibody levels and tissue virus clearance at the later time‐points of the disease than non‐splenectomized animals.

 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infections on T cell‐dependent enhancement of B cell responses. Millington et al
 <xref rid="imr12825-bib-0138" ref-type="ref">138</xref> reported that helper T cells activated by hemozoin‐loaded DCs displayed reduced migration to B cell compartments in lymphoid‐organ follicles leading to defective B cell expansion and antibody production in mice. Similarly, severe malaria infections in mouse models were linked to impaired T follicular helper cells (Tfh) maturation and dysregulation of GC responses.
