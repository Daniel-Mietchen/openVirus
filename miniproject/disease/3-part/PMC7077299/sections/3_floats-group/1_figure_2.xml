  <p>In vitro characterization of KPF1-Antx hMAb. (
   <bold>A,B</bold>) Purity and mobility of the KPF1-HEK and KPF1-Antx hMAbs: Equal amount of KPF1 hMAbs (2.500, 1.250, 0.625, and 0.313 μg) generated from either HEK293T cells (KPF1-HEK) or tobacco plants (KPF1-Antx) were separated by SDS-PAGE and evaluated by Coomassie blue staining (A) or Western blot using an anti-human IgG HRP-conjugated Ab (B). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Recombinant HA binding of KPF1-HEK and the KPF1-Antx hMAbs: Binding to 1 μg /mL of indicated HA proteins was determined for serially diluted hMAbs by ELISA. n.s.: no significance. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Avidity: Binding of hMAbs in the presence of increasing concentrations of urea was determined by ELISA. The statistical analysis between KPF1-HEK and KPF1-Antx (markers above the lines; between 1 μg/mL of KPF1-HEK and KPF1-Antx, marker below the lines: between 0.1 µg/mL of KPF1-HEK, and KPF1-Antx), *
