  <p>Prophylactic activity of KPF1-Antx hMAb in guinea pigs against pH1N1. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the experimental approach: Female Hartley guinea pigs (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3) were treated (i.p.) with 20 mg/kg of KPF1-Antx hMAb, or with 20 mg/kg of an IgG isotype control (isotype-Antx). Six h post-treatment, guinea pigs were infected (i.n.) with 10
   <sup>3</sup> PFU of pH1N1 and monitored daily for 8 days. At 2 d p.i., sentinel guinea pigs were introduced into the same cage of infected guinea pigs, allowing direct contact between the animals. (
   <bold>B,C</bold>) Viral titers from nasal washes: Viral titers in the nasal washes of infected (B) and sentinel (C) guinea pigs were determined at 2, 4, 6, and 8 d p.i. by IFA (FFU/mL). The dotted line represents the limit of detection of the assay. * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, or no significance (n.s.). (
   <bold>D</bold>,
   <bold>E</bold>) Gross observation of lung pathology: All animals were euthanized at 8 d p.i. and lungs were collected from infected (D) or sentinel (E) guinea pigs to observe gross pathological changes such as congestion and atelectasis (arrows). Scale bars = 1 cm. (
   <bold>F</bold>) Macroscopic pathology scoring: Distributions of pathologic lesion such as consolidation, congestion, and atelectasis were measured using ImageJ and are represented as the percent of the total lung surface area (%). *
