<p>HAI assays were performed to determine the HA-neutralizing capability of KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK hMAbs, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, KPF1-Antx or KPF1-HEK hMAbs were 2-fold serially diluted (starting concentration of 200 µg/mL) in 96 well V-bottom plates and mixed 1:1 with four hemagglutinating units (HAU) of Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, NC/H1N1, PR8/H1N1, WI/H1N1, GA/H1N1, or Brisbane/H3N2 for 60 min at room temperature. HAI titers were determined by adding 0.5% turkey red blood cells (RBCs) to the virus–hMAb mixtures for 30 min on ice. HAI titers were defined as the minimum amount of hMAb that completely inhibited hemagglutination.
