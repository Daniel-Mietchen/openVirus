<p>Binding of KPF1-HEK or KPF1-Antx hMAbs to H1N1 or H3N2 HA proteins was performed using standard ELISA, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Briefly, ELISA plates (Nunc Maxisorp, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY, USA) were coated overnight with 1 µg/mL of the indicated recombinant HA proteins obtained from the Biodefense and Emerging Infectious Research Resources Repository (BEI Resources, Manassas, VA) and incubated with 10-fold serially diluted HEK- or Antx-produced KPF1 hMAbs in PBS (starting concentration of 10 µg/mL). Binding was detected with HRP-conjugated anti-human IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, Pennsylvania, PA, USA). Plant-produced isotype control (Isotype-Antx) and mammalian HEK293T-produced isotype control (Isotype-HEK) were included as negative controls. In selected ELISAs, increasing concentrations of urea (ranging from 0 to 8 M) were added and the plates were incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to detection with anti-IgG-HRP to evaluate avidity.
