<p>Four week old female Hartley guinea pigs were purchased from Charles River Laboratory and maintained in the animal care facility at the University of Rochester under specific pathogen-free conditions. All animal protocols were approved by the University of Rochester Committee of Animal Resources and complied with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Research Council [

 <sup>3</sup> PFU of pH1N1 in 100 Î¼L of PBS. After viral infection, animals were monitored daily for morbidity (body weight loss) and mortality (survival) (data not shown). To determine the prophylactic efficacy of KPF1-Antx hMAb, guinea pigs in two groups (N = 3/group) were weighed and administered (i.p.) 20 mg/kg of KPF1-Antx hMAb or isotype control hMAb (isotype-Antx), and kept in separated cages. After 6 h, guinea pigs were infected (i.n.) with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU of pH1N1. One day post-infection (d p.i.), sentinel guinea pigs (N = 3/group) were introduced into the cages of infected guinea pigs and monitored for seven days. Viral replication in nasal washes at 2, 4, 6, and 8 d p.i. was determined by immunofocus assay (fluorescent focus-forming units, FFU/mL) using an anti-NP MAb (HB-65) and a FITC-conjugated anti-mouse secondary Ab (Dako). Geometric mean titers and data representation were calculated using GraphPad Prism, v7.0. For therapeutic efficacy, guinea pigs in two groups (N = 3/group) were infected (i.n.) with 10
 <sup>3</sup> PFU pH1N1 and kept in separated cages, followed by administration of KPF1-Antx or isotype-Antx hMAbs at 1 d p.i. One day after administration of hMAbs, sentinel guinea pigs (N = 3/group) were introduced into the cages of infected guinea pigs and monitored for 7 days. Viral replication in nasal washes collected at 2, 3, 5, 7, and 9 d p.i. was determined by immunofocus assays as described above. At the completion of the study, guinea pigs were humanely euthanized by administration of a lethal dose of avertin and exsanguination, and lungs were collected for gross observation. Macroscopic pathology scoring was evaluated using ImageJ software to determine the percent of the total surface area of the lung (dorsal and ventral view) affected by consolidation, congestion, and atelectasis, as previously described [
