<p>To characterize the ability of the KPF1-HEK and KPF1-Antx hMAbs to recognize native IAV HA proteins, MDCK cells were infected (MOI 10) with Brisbane/H1N1, pH1N1, NC/H1N1, PR8 /H1N1, WI/H1N1, GA/H1N1, or Brisbane/H3N2 and binding was evaluated and quantified by IFA (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). This result indicated that KPF1-Antx hMAb possesses similar broad cross-reactivity and ability to recognize HA from H1N1 IAV-infected MDCK cells as those observed with the mammalian HEK-produced KPF1 hMAb.
