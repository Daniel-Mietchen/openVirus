<p>In a previous study, we described a HEK293T-produced KPF1 hMAb (KPF1-HEK) that showed broad binding and neutralizing activity against H1N1 IAV isolates in vitro and potent prophylactic and therapeutic activities in vivo [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], because of its ability to bind to a conserved residue in the H1 hemagglutinin globular head of IAV [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In our current study, we examined the efficacy of a plant-produced KPF1 hMAb (KPF1-Antx) that possessed similar in vitro properties to KPF1-HEK hMAb and prevented influenza infection and transmission in guinea pigs. KPF1-Antx was produced in

 <sup>®</sup> platform (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), where four week old plants were infiltrated with Agrobacteria containing expression vectors. Purified hMAb was recovered just 7 days after infiltration from the foliage using standard antibody purification techniques. SDS-PAGE (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) revealed that KPF1-Antx and KPF1-HEK were highly similar. KPF1-Antx was engineered to have predominantly one glycan species—GnGn (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f003">Figure 3</xref>, respectively). Importantly, KPF1-Antx hMAb showed neutralization and HAI activities similar to those of KPF1-HEK hMAb (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00167-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), highlighting that KPF1-Antx hMAb possesses and maintains similar avidity and affinity properties as the mammalian-produced KPF1 hMAb. Notably, judging by the potent binding affinity for recent isolates, such as ChCh/H1N1 and St. Petersburg27/H1N1 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00167-f002">Figure 2</xref>), KPF1 hMAb covers a substantial antiviral breadth, including recent H1 isolates (
