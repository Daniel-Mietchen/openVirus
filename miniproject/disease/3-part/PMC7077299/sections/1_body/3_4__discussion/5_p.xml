<p>Altogether, we substantiated the clinical potential of KPF1 to prevent and treat H1N1 infection in a second animal model, the guinea pig, including its potent ability to prevent transmission, and, for the first time, demonstrated the feasibility of using a plant-produced hMAb for the prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of influenza infections. Plant-produced hMAbs could represent an excellent option for the treatment and control of influenza viruses against which vaccines are not effective (e.g., seasonal) or available (e.g., pandemic), or for which FDA-approved antivirals are ineffective. Moreover, our results also suggest the feasibility of implementing hMAbs produced in tobacco plants for the treatment of other viral infections. However, further investigation will be needed to properly evaluate the safety and efficacy of using such plant-produced hMAbs in humans.</p>
