<p>Previous studies have described tobacco-derived plantibodies that showed potent therapeutic activity against multiple viruses such as EBOV, HBV, HIV, PEDV, RABV, WNV, and others in small animal models of infection, e.g., mice [

 <xref rid="B46-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the ability of plantibodies to protect against influenza viral infections. Concerns exist that plantibodies can be immunogenic and/or allergenic in animals and humans because of a non-mammalian glycosylation pattern [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In view of that, a proprietary 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plant line, KDFX, with knock-down of β1,2-xylosyltransferase and α1,3-fucosyltransfere, was used to reduce the addition of plant-specific glycan species. As a result, no plant-specific sugars were detected (

 <sup>®</sup> platform could be used to tailor the N-glycan profile (i.e., addition of galactose and/or α1,6-fucose). Follow-up studies to directly and extensively compare mammalian-produced to plant-produced influenza specific antibodies for the impact of potential N-glycan differences on their activity or pharmacodynamics could be done to discern this further. Notably, none of the hMAb KPF1-Antx- or isotype-Antx-treated guinea pigs showed any adverse side effects and/or clinical signs in any of the in vivo experiments at a dose of 20 mg/kg.
