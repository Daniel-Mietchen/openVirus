<p>Currently, FDA vaccines and antivirals are available for the prevention and treatment, respectively, of influenza viral infections in humans. Influenza vaccines contain viral antigens representing the prevalent H3N2 and H1N1 IAVs as well as one (trivalent) or two (quadrivalent) lineages (Victoria or Yamagata) of IBV currently circulating in humans [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and are provided as inactivated or live-attenuated forms. However, although influenza vaccines are able to induce immunity, they have several limitations. These include their lack of effectiveness against drifted seasonal viruses, as recently illustrated by the pandemic H1N1 virus in 2009, the lag time (~2 weeks) to establish an effective immune responses after exposure, and their limited, if any, protection against shifted pandemic viruses. Moreover, yearly formulations are required to protect against constantly changing IAV and/or IBV. In terms of antivirals, three major classes of drugs are FDA-approved for the treatment of influenza infections: NA inhibitors (oseltamivir, zanamivirm and peramivir), matrix protein 2 (M2) inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), and polymerase acid (PA) endonuclease inhibitors (Baloxavir, marboxil, or Xofluza) [

 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, influenza antiviral drugs have several limitations, including the lack of antiviral activity of M2 inhibitors against IBV, the emergence of drug resistant variants [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and a limited antiviral effect due to rapid metabolism and elimination of the inhibitor [

 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Thus, there is an urgent need to find alternative approaches for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections in humans.
