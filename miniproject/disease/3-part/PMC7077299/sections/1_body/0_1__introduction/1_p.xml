<p>Influenza viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family and are responsible for severe respiratory disease in humans [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Influenza viruses cause both seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics of great consequence when novel viruses are introduced into the human population [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Although Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-licensed inactivated and live-attenuated influenza vaccines have been used for over seventy years, yearly seasonal influenza viral infections are still responsible for an estimated of 3 to 5 million severe cases of illness and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 annual deaths [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Influenza virus public health concerns are further aggravated by their ability to efficiently transmit and by the limited available antivirals [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Influenza viruses are divided into types A, B, C, and D [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Influenza A viruses (IAV) are further classified into different subtypes based on the antigenic surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA; eighteen subtypes) and neuraminidase (NA; eleven subtypes) [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Among these, HA subtypes are classified into group 1 (H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, H9, H11, H12, H13, and H16â€“18) and group 2 (H3, H4, H7, H10, H14, and H15) subtypes [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Currently, H1N1 and H3N2 IAV and influenza B viruses (IBV) are circulating in the human population and are responsible for seasonal influenza [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00167" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Among the different influenza viruses, H1N1 IAVs are the most important subtype and have been responsible for causing pandemics with enormous impact on both human health and the economy, as illustrated by the 1918 and 2009 pandemics [
