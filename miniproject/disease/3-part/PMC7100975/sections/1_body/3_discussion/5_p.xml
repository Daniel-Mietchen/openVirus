<p>CHIKV has been shown to damage cartilage [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] and synovial tissue [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. In view of this, we make the hypothesis that patients suffering from dehydration at the onset of the disease are at higher risk of subsequently developing damaged cartilage, which may lead to more severe joint injury, slower recovery, and chronic injury. While it has been suggested that the intensity of symptoms at presentation is predictive of CCA [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], our results do not allow us to formally respond to the hypothesis we have formulated: dehydration during the acute phase of CHIKV infection is a cause of CCA. Indeed, we did not report on the occurrence of dehydration per se. Future studies should explicitly test this hypothesis (i) by accurately quantifying the volume of liquid ingested by patients during the acute phase in prospective studies; (ii) by conducting a randomized clinical trial comparing high intravenous and oral rehydration versus rehydration advice with subsequent quantification. Lastly, dehydration may contribute to the increase in viremia through serum concentration, as some studies have reported higher CHIKV plasma viral loads in CCA patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. However, we did not investigate this parameter in our study due to a lack of funding.
