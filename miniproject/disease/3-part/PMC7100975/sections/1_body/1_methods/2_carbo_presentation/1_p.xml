<p>In June 2010, the Department of Infectious Diseases at the Hospital of Fort de France initiated a descriptive and prognostic study of dengue in the French West Indies and French Guiana known as the “DAG” Study. This study was based on a hospital cohort of children and adults with suspected dengue and had as its main objective to identify the predictive factors of severe dengue. Following the introduction of CHIKV in Martinique, the inclusion criteria of the DAG study were extended to chikungunya cases, and the protocol was adjusted accordingly (namely by including a broad description of rheumatic disorders specific to chikungunya disease). In May 2014, the “DAG” study became the “DAG-2” study, and included a cohort composed of 2 groups: the dengue group and the chikungunya group. This study is registered on clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01099852). The DAG-2 study is still ongoing (the duration of follow-up is 36 months), and the present analysis was conducted at 12 months of follow-up.</p>
