<p>A predictive set of factors associated with CCA were selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, after multiple imputations with chained equations to address missing data for variable selection. The penalty term required by the LASSO method was selected using 5-fold cross-validation. Factors with less than 10% of missing data were considered for the analysis. Factors selected by LASSO have non-null coefficient. A final non-regularized logistic regression was conducted on factors with non-null coefficient, in which the effect of each factor was reported as an adjusted odds-ratio with 95% confidence interval.</p>
