<p>Characteristics at disease onset in the 2 groups (no CCA and CCA) were compared to identify initial predictive factors for CCA. These characteristics are detailed in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007327.s003">S1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007327.s004">S2</xref> Tables. Significant results are listed in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. CCA patients were mainly women aged over 50 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007327.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Overall, 58% (61/106) of the women developed CCA, versus 41% (24/59) of the men (sex data available for 165 patients). In univariate analysis (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the probability of being CCA increased with age (RD 9.62, 95% CI, 4.87;14.38, p&lt;0.0001); female sex (RD 15.5, 95% CI, 1.03;30.0, p = 0.04); and some clinical signs at disease onset, namely headache (RD 15.42, 95% CI, 0.65;30.18 p = 0.04), vertigo (RD 15.33, 95% CI, 1.47;29.19, p = 0.03), vomiting (RD 12.89, 95% CI, 1.54;24.24, p = 0.03), dyspnea (RD 13.53, 95% CI, 0.73;26.33, p = 0.04), and intravenous rehydration (RD -16.12, 95% CI, -31.58; -0.66 p = 0.04). Biologically, the increase of urea (RD 0.66, 95% CI, 0.12; 1.20, p = 0.02) was significantly associated with the development of CCA. For the subpopulation with data on joint involvement in the acute phase, the risk factors significantly associated with CCA in univariate analysis were at least one enthesitis (RD 16.7, 95%CI, 2.8;30.7, p = 0.02) and at least one tenosynovitis (RD 16.8, 95% CI, 1.4â€“32.2, p = 0.04) (

 <xref rid="pntd.0007327.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Impact on quality of life, as measured by the EQ5D scale in the acute phase, was not significantly different between CCA and no CCA patients (
