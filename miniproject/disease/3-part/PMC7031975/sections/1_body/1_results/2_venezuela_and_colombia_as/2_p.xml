<p id="Par34">Two full genome datasets (a smaller one consisting of ~ 100 genomes and a larger one consisting of ~ 300 genomes) and one E gene dataset per DENV serotype were used in Bayesian analyses to investigate the impact of data size and data type on the temporal and spatial tree inferences. Interestingly, while full genome Bayesian Evolutionary Analysis by Sampling Trees (BEAST) analyses of both small (BEASTFGD1.small, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) and large (BEASTFGD1.large, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) datasets for DENV1 produced concordant results pertaining to the majority of introductions, some discrepancies were observed. In the BEASTFGD1.small (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>) MCC tree, the country of origin of the first introduction into Ecuador was suggested to be Colombia rather than Venezuela. However, this location probability was lower compared to the one from the large dataset. In general this was true for most location probabilities when comparing the small and the large dataset inferences (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>). E gene analyses of DENV1 also confirmed most viral introductions estimated by the full genome analyses, but showed discrepancies in the introductions into Ecuador, indicating Colombia as the source of both introductions (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Since more genomes were available for the E gene analyses, these also suggested viral dissemination from Venezuela into Mexico, Barbados, Guyana, as well as indicated that the dissemination from Venezuela into Brazil resulted in further spread and circulation of this DENV1 strain between Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay.
