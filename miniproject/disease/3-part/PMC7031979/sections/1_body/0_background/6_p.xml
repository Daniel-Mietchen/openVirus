<p id="Par32">The 2016–2017 YFV epidemic in Brazil accounted for 1659 epizootics, 779 confirmed cases of human YF, and 262 deaths, with most occurring in Southeast Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The epidemic persisted in 2018–2019, but this period was characterized by low transmission in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Phylogenetic studies showed that viral isolates of this outbreak were within the same cluster of modern Brazilian strains, which confirmed previous observations. This led to the suspicion that there was no introduction of a new genotype in the country and that only pre-existing strains were transmitted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Indeed, surveillance of epizootic diseases within the surveillance system in previous years has shown the need for monitoring as a tool not only for preventing the spread of the virus within territories but also for improving containment barriers. This previous knowledge led to the intensification of the monitoring response during the 2017 and 2018 outbreaks in Brazil. In order to contribute to the surveillance of YF, the aim of the present study is to describe the laboratory findings of epizootics that occurred in the states of Rio de Janeiro (RJ), Minas Gerais (MG), Espírito Santo (ES), and Bahia (BA) during 2017 and 2018.
