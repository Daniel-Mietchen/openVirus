<p id="Par43">A descriptive study from 2008–2009 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] reported that although cases of 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> mortality have been observed, laboratory confirmation was available only for species of the genus 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic>. This may be due to the lower sensitivity of laboratory methods available that time, which were not able to detect low viremia in the specimens of 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>. An important result when comparing the genera 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> and 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> was that significant differences in median viral load were detected. 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> spp. show a lower viral load, do not develop a fatal YFV infection similar to that reported in humans, and can somehow persist and maintain the possibility of urbanization of YFV. The difference in median values of Cq observed between 
 <italic>Callitrix</italic> and 
 <italic>Allouatta</italic> in this study was also reported in PNHs from the State of São Paulo in south-eastern Brazil [
