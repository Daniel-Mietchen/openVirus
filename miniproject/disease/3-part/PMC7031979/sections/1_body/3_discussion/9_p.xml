<p id="Par50">Interestingly, out of 288 NHPs from BA, 75 tested positive for YF, while no human cases were confirmed. In total, 42% of these NHPs were from the genus 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>, and only 1% were 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> spp.; the remaining 57% had missing genus identification. The role of LABFLA in the Ministry of Health (MoH) network is to investigate epizootics and human cases suspected of yellow fever infection. In this regard, it was not possible to state the relationship between the absence of human cases with the greater presence of monkeys the genus 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>. However, this is an observation that deserves further investigation considering the low viremia found in species of this genus. In the natural forest habitats of NHPs, mosquitoes transmit arboviruses from infected to naive animals 
 <italic>via</italic> sylvatic transmission cycles (NHP-mosquito-NHP-mosquito, etc.) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Due to the importance of these sylvatic cycles, future investigations are needed into the roles of hosts and vectors in the epidemiology of diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Unlike the DENV virus in the sylvatic cycle in Southeast Asia and Africa, which have different ecological and evolutionary lineages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], YFV in Brazil does not seem to present the same problem according to molecular epidemiological reports carried out in the NHPs of BA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is always important to consider the possible presence of another pathogen (herpes virus, malaria or 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>) in these animals when infected with the yellow fever virus that can contribute to the death of these animals. Perhaps the low YFV viremia alone cannot cause death of 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> spp. Considering that the viruses found in different regions and in the NHP and in humans did not show evolutionary differences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we reinforce the need for more focused observation of species of this genus, co-infections and their role in the YF outbreaks in Brazil.
