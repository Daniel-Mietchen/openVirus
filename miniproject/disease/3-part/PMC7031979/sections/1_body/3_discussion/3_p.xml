<p id="Par44">Interaction between marmosets and residents of urban and peri-urban areas is currently restricted to forested areas and urban parks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, deforestation areas coupled with increased interaction between urban residents and wild species could be a risk factor for the re-emergence of urban YFV epidemics in South America. Anthropophilic mosquitoes 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> are highly susceptible to American and African YFV strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, further studies are required to determine whether the genus 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> imposes a possible relevant risk for the maintenance of sylvatic YF.
