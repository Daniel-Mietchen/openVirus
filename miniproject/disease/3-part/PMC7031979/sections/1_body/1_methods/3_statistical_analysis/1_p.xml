<p id="Par36">Baseline characteristics are presented as frequencies of positivity (%) and as medians and means for non-normally distributed continuous data (Cq values). The NHP genus and state of collection were treated as grouping variables. A dataset was composed using an Excel datasheet, reviewed by the researchers to avoid potential misinterpretation, and exported to the R environment. Differences in the median Cq values across the NHP genera were assessed using the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance. We also used the Mann-Whitney U-test to compare the Cq distribution between the pairs of genera. All statistical tests were two-sided, and 
 <italic>P</italic>-values &lt; 0.05 were interpreted as statistically significant.
