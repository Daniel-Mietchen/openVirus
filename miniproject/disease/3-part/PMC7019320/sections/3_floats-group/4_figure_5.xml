  <p>EBOV NP position 111 influences viral transcription and replication. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic of monocistronic minigenome (1MG) and tetracistronic minigenome (4MG) systems. Compared to live virus genome (top), 1MG only encodes the EBOV leader and trailer sequences (middle), whereas the 4MG encodes the structural proteins VP40, GP, and VP24 (bottom). In both cases, the replication complex proteins (NP, VP35, VP30, and L) are expressed from plasmids in trans. Tan line indicates the position of NP-R111, and the dashed line indicates the position of GP-A82 (encoded on 4MG but not 1MG); (
   <bold>B</bold>) 1MG assay. We expressed NP mutants or ancestral NP-R111 in HEK 293T cells in the presence of the EBOV replication complex (L, VP35, VP30), and measured transcription and replication (txn/rep) of the 1MG minigenome encoding firefly luciferase (FLuc) relative to a 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RLuc) loading control (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological replicates). We normalized values to NP-R111. Absence of L, VP30, or 1MG abolished FLuc signal. Both NP-R111E and NP-K109E/K110E/R111E charge-reversal mutants significantly decreased 1MG activity (ANOVA-Dunnett’s test). Error bars indicate mean ± SEM; (
   <bold>C</bold>) P0 producer cells of 4MG assay. We expressed transcription- and replication-competent (tr)VLPs harboring GP-A82 (left) or GP-A82V (right) and NP mutants in HEK 293T cells, and measured 4MG minigenome activity (RLuc) relative to an FLuc loading control (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3–9 biological replicates). We normalized values to GP-A82/NP-R111 and assessed statistical significance by ANOVA with Tukey’s test (ANOVA-Tukey’s test) to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM; (
   <bold>D</bold>) Target P1 and P2 cells of 4MG assay. We expressed the EBOV replication complex in P1 Huh7 cells, and then infected P1 cells with P0 trVLPs, and measured 4MG activity. We repeated the process by expressing the EBOV replication complex in P2 Huh7 cells, infecting P2 cells with P1 trVLPs, and measuring 4MG activity again (
   <italic>n</italic> = 3–9 biological replicates). We normalized values for cells in each biological replicate to its own P0 activity and assessed statistical significance by ANOVA-Tukey’s test. Solid lines and filled circles indicate GP-A82, whereas dashed lines and open squares indicate GP-A82V. Error bars indicate mean ± SEM.
