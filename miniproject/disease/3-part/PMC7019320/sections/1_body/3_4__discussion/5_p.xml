<p>Our data point to a complex interplay between NP oligomerization and NPâ€™s roles in structure and replication, and highlight the importance of developing reporter assays for viruses, especially pathogens of high consequence. Many viral proteins are highly multi-functional, making study of individual mutations challenging without robust assays that are sensitive to subtle changes in viral phenotype. Since luciferase-based reporter systems fit the aforementioned requirements, we took advantage of these systems to develop a BRET assay for NP oligomerization and a VLP detection assay, which offer a number of advantages over existing methods. Previous attempts to assess NP oligomerization typically used biochemical methods with purified protein [

 <xref rid="B71-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. In our BRET assay, the NLuc substrate and HaloTag ligand have minimal cytotoxicity and readily diffuse into live cells, key features that minimized spurious interactions and allowed us to assess oligomerization over a range of physiologically-relevant EBOV NP concentrations (
