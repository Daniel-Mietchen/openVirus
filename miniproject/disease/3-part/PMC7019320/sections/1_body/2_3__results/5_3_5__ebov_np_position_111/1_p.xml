<p>The mechanism by which changes in NP’s structural phenotypes (e.g., oligomerization, budding) affect viral transcription and replication is not obvious because NP is highly multi-functional. NP’s ability to oligomerize can influence its ability to bind RNA and modulate transcription and replication, though the direction and size of this effect are not always clear [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. In each assay, we expressed the components of the EBOV ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex (NP, VP35, VP30, and L) in cells in the presence of a minigenome encoding a luciferase reporter flanked by the EBOV promoter-like leader and trailer sequences. Transcription is essential for minimal luciferase activity; replication is further required to achieve maximum signal [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], the second system uses a tetracistronic minigenome (4MG) to produce transcription- and replication-competent VLPs (trVLPs) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f005">Figure 5</xref>A). These 4MG trVLPs can be further ‘passaged’ as a measure of ability to infect target cells and complete the viral life cycle [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00105" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. As a positive control, we further tested the 4MG system in the presence of the GP-A82V mutation, which increases viral infectivity in cell culture [
