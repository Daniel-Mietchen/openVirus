<p>For the VP35 inhibition experiment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>C), we reverse-transfected cells in each well with 2 ng of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-NLuc and 10 ng of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-HaloTag. To test a range of VP35[NPBP] expression, we co-transfected cells with 0, 7.5, 30, or 120 ng of pcDNA3.3-WPRE/eGFP-P2A-VP35[NPBP] plasmid. To ensure that cells in each well received the same total amount of DNA, we serially diluted pcDNA3.3-WPRE/eGFP-P2A-VP35(NPBP) in control plasmid pcDNA3.3-WPRE/mTagBFP2, as described in the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. We performed the remainder of the standard BRET protocol as described above.
