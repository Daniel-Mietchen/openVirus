<p>We grew cells to near confluency, harvested by trypsinization, reverse-transfected, and plated cells in poly-D-lysine-coated, 96-well black/clear flat-bottom plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA). We reverse-transfected cells in each well with 10 ng of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-NLuc or pNL1.1/NLuc (Promega) negative control and 100 ng of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-HaloTag or pcDNA3.3/eGFP negative control. At the start of transfection, we also added HaloTag NanoBRET 618 ligand (NanoBRET Nano-Glo Detection System, Promega) diluted in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) at a final concentration of 100 nM or DMSO vehicle control (no HaloTag ligand) to cell culture media.</p>
