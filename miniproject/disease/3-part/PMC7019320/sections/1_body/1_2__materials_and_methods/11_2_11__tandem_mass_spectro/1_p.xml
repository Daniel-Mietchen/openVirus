<p>To assess protein–protein interactions of NP (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S5</xref>), we scaled up our co-IP protocol. We grew two 15 cm
 <sup>2</sup> plates of cells to 40–60% confluency and transfected cells with 32 μg of pGL4.23-CMV/NP-myc encoding either NP-R111 or NP-K109E/K110E/R111E. After 48 h, we harvested cells by scraping in 1.2% (
