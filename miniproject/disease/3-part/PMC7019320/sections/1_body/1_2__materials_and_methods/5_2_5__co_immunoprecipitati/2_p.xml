<p>We loaded the specified amount of input into denaturing 10% polyacrylamide (PAGE) gels, and performed electrophoresis at 180 V until complete. We transferred proteins to Immun-Blot PVDF Membranes (Bio-Rad) in a wet tank either at 200 mA for 1.5 h at 4 °C, or at 40 V overnight at 4 °C. We blocked membranes by rocking in blocking buffer consisting of 5% non-fat dry milk (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) dissolved in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T) for 1 h at room temperature. We incubated membranes with primary antibody in blocking buffer for 45 min, washed three times in TBS-T buffer, incubated the membrane with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody in blocking buffer for 1 h, and washed three additional times. We activated chemiluminesence with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and imaged with an AlphaInnotech ChemiImager (ProteinSimple, San Jose, CA, USA) or FluorChem E (ProteinSimple).</p>
