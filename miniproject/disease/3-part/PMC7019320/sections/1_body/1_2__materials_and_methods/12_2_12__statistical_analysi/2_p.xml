<p>For the VP35 inhibition experiment using BRET (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00105-f003">Figure 3</xref>C), we expressed varying amounts of VP35[NPBP] in cells in the presence of NP-NLuc and NP-HaloTag for 4 amounts of pcDNA3.3-WPRE/eGFP-P2A-VP35[NPBP] plasmid (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological replicates each). We fitted the data to an inverse function using the ‘nls’ function in R:
 <disp-formula>BRET ~ scale/(VP35[NPBP] + max) + min,
  <label>(1)</label>
 </disp-formula> in which VP35[NPBP] expression was the independent variable, BRET was the dependent variable, and scale, max, and min were constants to be fitted. Using non-linear regression, we fitted the parameters scale = 1.9 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>, max = 3.4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>, and min = 0.49. In the absence of VP35 (VP35[NPBP] = 0), the maximum BRET signal would be 5.80; with very high expression (VP35[NPBP] → ∞), the minimum BRET signal would be 0.49. We used the ‘nlstools’ package to generate 999 bootstrap pseudoreplicates, inferred parameters for each pseudoreplicate, and plotted the central 95% of values as a shaded region.
