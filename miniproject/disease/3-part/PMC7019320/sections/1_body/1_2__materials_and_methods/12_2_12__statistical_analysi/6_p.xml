<p>To determine whether heating disrupted VLPs (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00105">Supplementary Figure S3B</xref>), we expressed NLuc-VP40 in cells, and heated cell culture supernatant to 4, 22, 37.1, 43.8, 60.2, or 95 °C either before or after purifying VLPs via ultracentrifugation (
 <italic>n</italic> = 3 biological replicates in a repeated-measures design). We normalized NLuc values for all temperatures to the 4 °C value for each replicate, log-transformed the normalized values, and fitted the data to sigmoidal curves using the ‘nls’ function in R:
 <disp-formula>log
  <sub>10</sub>(NLuc.Norm) ~ min + max/(1 + 
  <italic>e</italic>
  <sup>(midpt - temp)</sup>/scale),
  <label>(3)</label>
 </disp-formula> in which temperature was the independent variable, NLuc.Norm was the dependent variable, and min, max, midpt, and scale were all constants to be fitted. Additionally, we tested whether NLuc luminescence differed following heating the supernatant to 60.2 °C either before or after purifying VLPs with a paired 
 <italic>t</italic>-test using Prism 7.
