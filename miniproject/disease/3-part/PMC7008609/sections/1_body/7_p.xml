<p>Disease prevention relies on vector control and personal protection measures (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Case management of MAYV relies solely on the treatment of symptoms with analgesics. Efforts to develop other control methods have been recorded. For example, the antiviral effects of thienopyridine derivatives have been evaluated and found to affect the late early and late stages of MAYV replication (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). One study demonstrated that these substances could potentially act as a new class of antiviral drugs due to their bioavailability and low cytotoxicity (

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). A synthetic DNA envelope vaccine has also been evaluated in mice (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). T cell immunity and antibody immune responses were induced by the vaccine, and mice challenged with live MAYV after receiving the vaccine were protected against the disease (
