<p>Due to the generic nature of the symptoms of alphaviruses, misdiagnosis can occur. Diagnosis of MAYV relies on clinical diagnosis, which may contribute to the misclassification of MAYV cases for dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, or other arboviruses (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The diagnostic procedures for MAYV include serological detection through the detection of antibodies in the host serum; molecular detection through reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); and viral isolation in a cell culture (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The reference standard for MAYV diagnosis is viral isolation (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Enzyme-immune assays, hemagglutination inhibition, immunofluorescence, or neutralization methods are useful serological methods for the detection of antibodies (

 <italic>Alphavirus</italic> genus due to cross-reactivity among viruses with common antigenic sites (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Further, the short viremic period of MAYV may make it difficult to accurately isolate the virus from blood (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). As a result, the exact number of MAYV cases is difficult to determine in both clinical and serological detection outside of well-equipped laboratories (
