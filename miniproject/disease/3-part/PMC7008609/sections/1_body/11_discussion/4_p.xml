<p>Data constraints must be considered when evaluating the outcomes of this research. The first limitation to this research includes the potential overestimation of the total number of presumptive MAYV cases found in academic literature due to serological cross-reaction between alphaviruses. Cross-reaction could also be a concern since diagnostic techniques were not uniform throughout the studies we included. Finally, many cases of MAYV may be unaccounted for both due to similarities between the clinical symptoms of MAYV and other arboviral diseases and coinfection.</p>
