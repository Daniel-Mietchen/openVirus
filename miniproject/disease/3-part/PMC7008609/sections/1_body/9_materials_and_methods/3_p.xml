<p>We included in our analysis journal articles and other publications that were published between 1954 and 2019 and that provided a historical overview of Mayaro, hosts, transmission mechanisms of the virus, clinical manifestation, geographical distribution and epidemiology of the disease, diagnostic methods, case management, surveillance efforts, known risk factors, and prevention and control techniques. Studies were excluded from the report if they were unable to add to the overall understanding of MAYV in Latin America and the Caribbean, including studies that were too broad or too heavily focused on the microbiological and virological components of MAYV or did not contribute data to the analysis.</p>
