<p>Further evidence of the virusâ€™s potential to emerge in new areas was provided when sheep, caiman, and equids were sampled from 16 cattle ranches across the Pantanal region of Brazil from October 2009 through January 2011 (

Results from the study showed that 10 of the 748 equids were seropositive for MAYV, demonstrating the first evidence of MAYV circulation in the southern Pantanal. Since equids tested negative for MAYV in previous investigations, the authors of the study suggested that MAYV circulation in the Pantanal might be a recent occurrence. More research is needed to identify amplifier hosts and vectors, and to understand the ecology of the transmission of the virus (
