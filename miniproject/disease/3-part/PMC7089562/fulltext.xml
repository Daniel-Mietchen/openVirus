The infection is characterized by abortions in pregnant animals, high mortality in neonates as well as febrile illness in humans that develop in 1% of cases encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever. There is presently no specific antiviral treatment for RVFV infection available. In this study, two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), raised against glycoprotein Gn, were applied in a therapeutic study. Treatment of RVFV infected mice with neutralizing mAb Gn3 alone at two different time points (30 minutes before or 30 minutes after virus challenge) showed only moderate efficacy of about 58.3% survival in both applications. However, a combination therapy together with non-neutralizing mAb Gn32 demonstrated complete protection (100% survival) when applied 30 minutes after the lethal challenge dose. The increase of mAb efficacy is probably based on cooperative neutralization effects. These data suggest that a combination therapy with mAbs Gn3 and Gn32 could be an effective treatment option against RVFV infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Rift Valley fever virus represents an acute viral disease affecting animals especially livestock and humans and is responsible for widespread outbreaks throughout Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula.

During Rift Valley fever virus infection in mice, the applied neutralizing antibody alone showed only partial protection. In contrast, a combined application with both antibodies, lead to a complete protection in one treatment group (100% survival).

It consists of three segments that code for nucleocapsid protein (S-segment), two glycoproteins Gn, Gc (M-segment) and a RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L-segment). In addition, two non-structural proteins are encoded by the S-segment (NSs) and M-segment (NSm), respectively [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. More than 50 mosquito species including <italic>Anopheles</italic>, <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex spp</italic>. have been associated with RVFV transmission, either by isolation of the virus from field-collected mosquitoes or by successful experimental transmission in laboratory setting [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].During inter-epizootic periods, the virus may persist by vertical transmission in <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and the deposition of infected eggs. Subsequent heavy rainfalls and flooding lead to hatching of RVFV infected vectors causing epidemics. The virus emerged during the 1970ths and 1980ths throughout Africa and entered the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Main focus with re-occurrent epidemics are Sub-Saharan countries (e.g. Mauritania), South-Africa, Tanzania, Kenya and Egypt [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Based on this emergence and due to numerous susceptible mosquito species that are also found in Europe, there is a significant risk for introduction and subsequent dissemination of RVFV in Europe [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Especially in pregnant ruminants (sheep, goats and cattle), the virus causes high abortion rates up to 100% in sheep and displays a similar mortality in infected newborn lambs. Generally increasing age reduces susceptibility, but adult animals can also be affected and suffer from weakness, anorexia, diarrhea, bloody nasal discharge and jaundice [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Apart from abortions, no clinical symptoms can be observed in camels; however, (hyper) acute clinical courses are described in an outbreak in Northern Mauritania [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Human infection mainly results from direct contact or inhalation during the handling of infected animals and tissues. Most infections display non-specific flu-like symptoms [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Severe cases are associated mostly with ocular complications (e.g. retinitis, reduced vision) and in 1&#x02013;2% of the cases with jaundice and hemorrhagic manifestations. The course is normally preceded by a febrile phase of 3 to 4 days including temporal recovery or long-lasting fever up to 10 days [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Severe complications can be also associated with encephalitis [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Up to now no approved antiviral therapeutics nor approved vaccine for Rift Valley fever is available [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Known antivirals like Ribavirin or Favipiravir showed only limited efficacy in animal models [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Additional small molecules are currently still under development [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most recently, rabbit and human derived monoclonal antibodies against glycoprotein Gn were shown to be protective in mice against Rift Valley fever infections [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Gn is a type I transmembrane protein which forms together with glycoprotein Gc non-covalently linked heterodimers on the lipid bilayer envelope of the virion and allows virus attachment, uptake into cells and Gc mediated cell fusion. The Gn protein consists of an N-terminal ectodomain and a C-terminal transmembrane domain followed by a cytoplasmic tail. The ectodomain is main target for neutralizing antibodies and composed of three domains including an N-terminal helical domain, followed by a &#x003b2;-ribbon and a small globular domain [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In our study, we analyzed the therapeutic application of two murine mAbs raised against glycoprotein Gn in a mouse model for Rift Valley fever. The combined application of a neutralizing with a non-neutralizing antibody led to complete protection against an otherwise lethal dose of RVFV attributed to cooperative interference. These results open up new therapeutic treatment possibilities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Both antibodies were generated by immunization of BALB/c mice with bacterial expressed glycoprotein Gn which encompasses 429 amino acids of the ectodomain (residues 154&#x02013;582, UniProt accession no.

They exhibited a more subacute hepatitis with more pronounced infiltrates of macrophages and heterophils, and an acute, focal to multifocal, necrotizing polioencephalitis. Notably there was no RVFV antigen in the livers of these mice at the time of necropsy but in the lesioned areas within the brain. These mice also display lymphatic apoptosis, necrosis and depletion in the spleen.</p><p>Pattern C was observed in surviving animals and is characterized mainly by no obvious findings or low-grade, subacute, multifocal, periportal and randomized, lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with infrequent heterophils in the liver. Furthermore, some of these mice displayed low- to moderate follicular hyperplasia of the white pulp in the spleen. These findings were observed in the combi groups, especially the T1 group. Mice of the T2 group showed a significant lower incidence of hepatitis or were asymptomatic. Both groups exhibited a considerably lower antigen signal in liver, a lower incidence of lymphoid depletion but a significant higher incidence of follicular hyperplasia compared to the PBS group.

It is the first trial about <italic>in vivo</italic> protection of cooperative mouse monoclonal antibodies against RVF. Similar antibody prevention studies against RVF were carried out very recently by applying human [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] or rabbit [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] derived mAbs. Furthermore, we conducted a detailed in-depth molecular and histo-pathological analysis of antibody treatment in infected mice.</p><p>MAbs Gn3 and Gn32 (as well as mixtures of both) showed high binding affinity to Gn in ELISA which are in the same EC<sub>50</sub> range as RVFV-neutralizing rabbit mAbs [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, neutralizing activity exhibited IC<sub>50</sub> values of about 100&#x003bc;g/ml that are significantly lower compared to rabbit antibodies (~3.0&#x003bc;g/ml) and human antibodies which were effective in the nanogram range [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, the values are only comparable to a limited extent, since different neutralization or alternative assays were used (SNT vs plaque reduction neutralization test vs FACS based assays). In both reported cases, single mAb application led to protection against RVFV infection similar to the combined mAb treatment outlined here. Interestingly, for an efficient neutralization of virulent challenge strain 35/74 a distinctly higher antibody concentration was needed compared to vaccine strain MP-12, although both strains exhibited only 4 amino acid differences within glycoprotein Gn sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008143.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These different amino acids are not located near the Gn32 derived epitope but three out of 4 amino acids induce slight modifications within the secondary structure of the strains, which could be responsible for the observed differences.</p><p>Via Pepscan analysis the main epitope of non-neutralizing mAb Gn32 could be successfully elucidated. The corresponding sequence PGKGHNYIDGMT is located in domain I of Gn and directly neighbors antigenic site A described in Wang et al. (16). Gn3 showed no distinct signal in Pepscan, indicating a conformational epitope. Even though Gn32 has no neutralizing activity <italic>in vitro</italic>, it increases significantly the neutralizing potency of Gn3. This synergistic effect was supported by the CompuSyn software with values of a CI of 0.39/ 0.31 and a DRI of 2.59/ 3.17. Similar effects were already described from studies with mAbs targeting other viruses, e.g. HIV triple and quadriple mAb combinations with CI of 0.2&#x02013;0.8 and DRI of 2&#x02013;39.9 [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Synergistic effects of RVFV neutralizing antibodies were previously reported from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>We therefor hypothesize that the mechanistic basis for this &#x0201c;cooperative neutralization&#x0201d; [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] is based on the binding of Gn32 to glycoprotein Gn which induces a conformational change and makes the epitope of mAb Gn3 more accessible. Thus, the induced conformational change allows a comprehensive and more effective binding of mAb Gn3. A similar cooperative effect of non-neutralizing mAbs that improve the activity of otherwise poorly neutralizing mAbs has been originally described for mAbs against HIV [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In any case, domain I of RVFV Gn plays an important role in antibody-mediated neutralization and protection, since additional neutralizing mAbs against RVFV cluster in this domain [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Application of Gn3 alone protected more than half of the group against a severe RVFV infection. In combination with non-neutralizing Gn32, 83% of the T1 group survived, whereas treatment 30 min after infection (T2) provided complete protection.</p><p>Complete protection was correlated with a significant reduction of viral load in all tested tissues and the incapability of further replication. The combined T2 antibody regimen could even completely eliminate the virus from the liver, which represents the main target organ of RVFV. Especially in the unprotected PBS group, strain 35/74 causes an infection with marked liver tropism, leading to a fulminant acute diffuse necrotizing hepatitis that has already been shown with other RVFV strains in mice [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Importantly, all antibody treated groups showed a decrease and shortening in viremia. PBS group showed a viremia from 2&#x02013;6 dpi, as reported earlier [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Especially in combi groups, viremia was clearly reduced, shortened and further delayed.</p><p>Our findings are principally consistent with two previous publications, where complete protection was reported by monoclonal antibodies but with significant differences regarding sources and mode of action [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In the first case rabbit monoclonal antibodies were generated with high neutralizing activity targeting an epitope at domain B of Gn glycoprotein (corresponding to Gn domain II), which probably interferes with Gn/Gc heterodimer formation and subsequent cell fusion. In contrast, Wu et al. [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] isolated monoclonal antibodies from a recovered human patient that targeted epitopes at domain I of Gn glycoprotein and inhibited attachment of the virion to the cells.</p><p>Therefor further detailed studies are needed to elucidate the molecular Gn3/Gn32 mechanism of neutralization e.g. by measuring the binding kinetics of the antibody-antigen interaction and determining the crystal structure of corresponding mAb in complex with glycoprotein Gn.</p><p>Detailed histopathological and immunohistological analyses elucidated specific differences during the course of RVFV infection. In acute cases, coalescing to diffuse RVFV antigen was detectable mainly in hepatocytes, but also in multifocal macrophages and follicular dendritic cells in the spleen. The livers displayed characteristic severe, acute, coalescing to diffuse necrotizing hepatitis, and many hepatocytes displayed morphological changes reminiscent of apoptotic cell death as well as intranuclear Cowdry type B inclusion bodies [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. These typical findings in the liver and spleen have been already noted during studies with other RVFV strains [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Furthermore, a moderate lymphoid depletion in the spleen was seen, which may lead to lymphopenia, and is probably part of a fatal systemic inflammatory response syndrome as a consequence of fulminant hepatitis. Lymphocyte apoptosis in spleens of infected mice that had died 3 dpi was reported previously [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. These findings, which mainly occurred in the PBS group, were confirmed by a strong positive correlation between lymphoid depletion and the incidence of hepatitis (Pearson product moment correlation, r = 0.922; p = 0.0258* (*significant p&#x0003c;0.05)), RVFV-positive liver (r = 0.815; p = 0.0927) and cruor (r = 0.877; p = 0.0509).</p><p>MAb application indeed revealed a clearly differentiated picture of disease progression: Mice that survived the RVFV infection showed mainly only low-grade, multifocal, lymphohistiocytic lesions in the liver, together with follicular hyperplasia in the spleen. MAbs could not completely neutralize the virus, but minimized viral replication, which could be successfully repelled by a successful and strong immune response in the mouse. This led to lymphocytosis as found in vaccine [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and mouse infection studies [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in form of follicular hyperplasia. Therefore antibody treatment is characterized by a strong positive correlation between follicular hyperplasia and positive ELISA (r = 0.975; p = 0.00484*) and SNT (r = 0.921; p = 0.0261*) values and by a negative correlation with hepatitis (r = - 0.888; p = 0.0445*), virus replication in liver (r = - 0.925; p = 0.0242*) and viremia (r = - 0.93; p = 0.0219*). These findings were mainly seen in the combi groups, where a significantly low-grade hepatitis and frequent follicular hyperplasia was observed.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated an efficient protection against RVFV by application of a combined mAb regimen in a RVF mouse challenge model. Further studies will now try to determine the specific epitope of Gn3 antibody to find a comprehensive molecular explanation for the cooperative and protective effects. In addition, both murine mAbs will be converted into humanized or fully human variants to finally evaluate them in other species and to assess well-known side effects and treatment failures [<xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec017"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008143.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Clinical score sheet for daily examination of infected mice.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008143.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008143.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>Virus replication from PCR positive tissues, determined as virus titer (log[TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml]).</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008143.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008143.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><p><bold>Liver, spleen, brain and lung were examined for virus in IHC (A) and histopathology (B).</bold> The organs of each mouse were evaluated according to a score between 0 and 3.
