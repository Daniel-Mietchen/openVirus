<p>A peptide library of RVFV Gn was generated by synthesizing oligopeptides with 20 amino acid length and 12 amino acid overlap by JPT (Berlin, Germany). Peptide assay was similar performed as already described in Lagatie et al. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008143.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In short, NUNC Immobilizer Streptavidin plates (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, USA) were coated with 2.5μM/well peptides at 4°C overnight. After that, plates were blocked with 3% skimmed milk for 1h, room temperature. Furthermore, plates were incubated with monoclonal antibodies (1:100 diluted in blocking buffer) for 1h, 37°C. After that, secondary goat anti mouse HRP antibody (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) was used as detection of specific binding mAbs and incubated for 1h, 37°C. Finally, TMB (3.3′,5.5′-Tetramethylbenzidin) was added and incubated for 10min. Reaction was stopped with 1M sulphuric acid and read out in an ELISA reader at 450nm. Threefold washing steps with tris- buffered saline and 0.1% Tween 20 was done between single steps.
