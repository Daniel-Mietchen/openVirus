<p>In summary, this study demonstrated an efficient protection against RVFV by application of a combined mAb regimen in a RVF mouse challenge model. Further studies will now try to determine the specific epitope of Gn3 antibody to find a comprehensive molecular explanation for the cooperative and protective effects. In addition, both murine mAbs will be converted into humanized or fully human variants to finally evaluate them in other species and to assess well-known side effects and treatment failures [
