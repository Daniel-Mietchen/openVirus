<p id="p0150">A future can be imagined in which people use a paper for diagnosing malicious diseases like cancer at home in a simple kit, similar to the pregnancy test kits available in today’s market. Moreover, these devices will be cheap compared to the ones available now, and also easily disposable. On the other hand, scaffolds used in Tissue Engineering can be used to test drugs using cells obtained from the person requiring the drug. Drugs then will be patient-specific with negligible side effects. Also, the development and deployment of these drugs to the market will be faster compared to today’s standards, as clinical trials could be performed faster using the cells from the patients. Thus, reducing the development time and cost at the same time.</p>
