<p id="p0155">In conclusion, more research is required to access the change in analytical performance of the various surface modification done on the paper substrate; the effect of temperature and other environmental factors on the biosensors and non-enzymatic approaches must be explored in near future. In the field of paper-based cultures and scaffolds, more research in cell viability in the cultures and scaffolds must be done. Also, more research is required to compare the available cytotoxic results done on 2D cell cultures with the new 3D cell cultures.</p>
