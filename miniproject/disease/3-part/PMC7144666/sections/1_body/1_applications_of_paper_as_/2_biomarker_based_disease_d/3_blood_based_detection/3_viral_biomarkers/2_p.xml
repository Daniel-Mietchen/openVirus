<p id="p0040">According to a report published by Economic Times India, 80% of the population in some villages in the North-Western region of India, especially Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh, is suffering from Hepatitis C [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Hence early diagnosis is necessary to cure this disease. Generally, the Hepatitis-C virus (HCV) [
 <xref rid="bib86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>] is diagnosed in a two-step process; first, detection of IgG against anti-HCV using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and second, recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) to confirm the diagnostic result, as ELISA might give a false-positive result. However, in 2014, Mu et al developed a multiplex microfluidic paper-based immunoassay to detect the human IgG antibody against HCV (anti-HCV) [
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. They used a technique called Craft Punch Patterning (CPP) to fabricate the multiple test zones on Nitro-Cellulose paper substrate; as NC is highly flammable. Hence, the developed microfluidic paper-based immunoassay harnessed the 'irreplaceable' merits of paper to integrate the lengthy, costly, and segmented assays rapidly and economically. Then, in 2016, Chen and Xinyu developed a much advance μPAD to detect HCV and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) together in under 20 min with high accuracy and sensitivity as well as low Limit-Of-Detection (LOD) to existing sensors [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. They claim to be the first to integrate μPAD for low-cost diagnosis of HIV/HCV co-infection. It had eight electrochemical immunosensors capable of carrying out "ELISAs in parallel and testing multiple serum samples for both HIV and HCV antibody marker”. Moreover, it could transmit the data to a host computer or smartphone via wireless transmission. In another instance, Bedin et al. to develop a wax printed MF1-based-μPAD for the detection of the dengue and Zika NS1 (Non-Structural) viral proteins in blood plasma. The presence of glass fiber enables the separation of plasma from red blood cells [

If NS1 is present, it is captured by the anti-NS1 antibody and a blue band appears in the test. If NS1 is absent, there is no signal. The μPAD take 4–6 min to analyze the sample and a smartphone application is used to interpret the results. The μPAD performed better than a commercially available Lateral-Flow-Assay (LFA), both in terms of Limit-Of-Detection (LOD) and of time-to-result.
