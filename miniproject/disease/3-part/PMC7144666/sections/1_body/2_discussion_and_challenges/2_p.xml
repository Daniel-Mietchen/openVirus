However, the devices were only able to give the user, a qualitative response; rather than a quantitative one; i.e. a yes or no, rather than an estimation of the concentration of the analyte. Microfluidic- Paper-based-Analytical-Device (μPAD) sensors bought a paradigm shift in the field of biosensors and showed its potential to revolutionize the diagnosis [

These sensors were not only able to give a colorimetric response but also give an estimation of the concentration of the analyte. On the other hand, the paper has also found its applications in developing paper-based-cultures and scaffolds which mimicked the 3D cellular environment of tissues. Both these technologies have to overcome many hurdles to become a mainstream technology to be used as biosensors and tissue scaffolds. Also, μPADs are being used as sensors to test milk quality, or to test the presence of drugs like Ketamine or to detect and quantify nucleic acid [
