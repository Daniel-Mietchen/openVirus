<p id="p0130">On the other hand, paper on its own is not an optimal material for culturing cells, as it lacks cell adhesion moieties [
 <xref rid="bib68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. To develop the ‘heart on paper’, Li Wang and his group cultured the hiPSCs on the paper array pre-coated with gelatine and Matrigel to facilitate the proper proliferation of cells. Similarly, Yaqing Wang and his group pre-coated their paper-substrates with a thin layer of 100 μg/ml rat tail collagen type I for better cell proliferation in the substrate. Hence, optimum surface modification was required for proper cell adhesion and proliferation. In a recent study, Ng et al compared three paper-substrate modification techniques, namely dip coating, hydrogel modification, and electro-spinning over Filter Paper (FP) (Whatman grade 114) using human foetal osteoblast (hFOB) [

Dip coating provided the least favorable cellular response, also resulted in reduced porosity; thus decreasing the number of anchoring spots for the cells and limiting the overall cell penetration. In the case of hydrogels; the high molecular weight polymers did not obstruct cell penetration and distribution within the scaffold. But, Electro-spin- Polycaprolactone coating over FP (ES-PCL/FP) proved to be superior in cell viability and mechanical properties due to better surface morphology and higher porosity of ES-PCL/FP. PCL and paper complemented each other, resulting in the highest metabolic and ALP activity. Also, these culture systems must be disassembled before analysis, thus preventing the taking of measurements as gradients formed. To this, a potential solution was developed Matthew et al to measure spatial and temporal information about oxygen gradients, without disassembling the layers by using a luminescent thin-film sensor [
