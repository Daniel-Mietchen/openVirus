<p>We find a hierarchical viral propagation network of LPAIV H9N2 being active since the past twenty years. Overall, there is a strong evidence of geographically structured viral diffusions both at the global and the regional scale. Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Iraq are likely to have played a dominant role in driving the global diffusions of LPAIV H9N2, which was supported by its highest probability as being the transmission sources and multiple transmission events to the rest of the world. This predominant role may potentially be due to its specific location, i.e., in the intersection of the Central Asian and Black Sea-Mediterranean flyways (
