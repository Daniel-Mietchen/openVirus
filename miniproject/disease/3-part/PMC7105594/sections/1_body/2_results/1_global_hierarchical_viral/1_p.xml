<p>Our reconstruction of the H9N2 transmission pathways shows that the propagation network of H9N2 is highly structured, with significant inter-regional expansions with distinct source-sink dynamics (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Amongst these regions investigated, Middle East 1 was shown to be a major inter-regional transmission hub of H9N2 viruses, as indicated by the much higher posterior probability (&gt;70%), linking viruses isolated from all other regions (except for Egypt). Similarly, Iran was also shown to be important in the global spread and maintenance of H9N2, although not in the same magnitude as Middle East 1. By contrast, the lack of posterior probability support for Middle East 2, Egypt and North Africa suggests that they are less likely to act as sources of H9N2 in other regions. Furthermore, bi-directional transmissions were inferred between some regions, i.e., North Africa and Middle East 2, and Middle East 1 and Iran, which may due primarily to their spatial adjacency. In particular, Egyptian viruses were closely related to those isolated from Jordan, Lebanon and Israel, with bi-directional viral migrations between these two regions (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref> and given the sample size (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>)], the Egyptian H9N2 was most likely introduced via Israel around mid 2009 (95% HPD: March 2009–October 2009). Subsequently, H9N2 was back-transmitted from Egypt to Israel ca. 2015 (95% HPD: December 12, 2014–December 30, 2015).
