<p>In this paper, we present a potential method of indirectly detecting specific anti-stalk serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies against conserved epitopes among group 1 and group 2 influenza A viruses by measuring the difference between the HA head and total HA response; this method, based on a re-adaptation of a competitive ELISA, allows for the discrimination and the quantification of antibodies that are directed against the head and stalk subunits. The construction of a stable headless HA would be an important step both for universal vaccine studies and serological assay use. There have been several studies [

In this study, we evaluate the performance of the assay by measuring anti-head and anti-stalk responses in a small panel of human serum samples (adults and children) taken before and after vaccination in the 2009/2010 season.
