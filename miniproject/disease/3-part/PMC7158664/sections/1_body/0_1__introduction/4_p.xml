<p>Classically, antibody-mediated immune responses after influenza vaccination or natural infection are assessed by standard serological assays such as hemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial hemolysis (SRH), and micro-neutralization (MN) [
 <xref rid="B19-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These methods are recommended by regulatory authorities and are considered the gold standard in detecting the immune response in serum samples. The HI assay detects antibodies that bind to the viral HA and prevent the agglutination of red blood cells (RBCs) by blocking the receptor binding site. The MN assay identifies functional neutralizing antibodies, including those that recognize epitopes in the stalk region of HA, which are conserved among different subtypes of influenza A viruses. The SRH assay may recognize not only antibodies against the surface glycoproteins but also those against the internal antigens [

However, these assays are generally insufficient to detect the immune response after immunization with LAIVs or conserved epitope-based vaccines. Moreover, HI titers are not always able to predict the right degree of protection from a disease, especially in children [
