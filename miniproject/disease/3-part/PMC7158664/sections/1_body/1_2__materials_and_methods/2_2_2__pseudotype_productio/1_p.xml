<p>Lentiviral pseudo-virus particles (PVs) were produced by co-transfecting Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) 293T/17 (ATCC® CRL-11268™) cells with phCMV1-H11 (H11 from A/ruddy turnstone/New Jersey/650653/2002 (H11N9)) and pI.18-N1Cal/09, as previously described. The H11 plasmid was added to make the NA more stable and to increase PV release and production. Briefly, 1 µg of HA, 1 µg of NA and 1.5 µg pNLLuc4.3 plasmids were transfected into HEK293T/17 cell lines by means of Endofectin™ Lenti (3µL/µg). The medium was changed 24 hours after transfection, and PVs were harvested after 48 hours. The titration of the NA activity of each PV was performed in an enzyme-linked lectin assay (ELLA), as in the protocol reported by Biuso et al. [
