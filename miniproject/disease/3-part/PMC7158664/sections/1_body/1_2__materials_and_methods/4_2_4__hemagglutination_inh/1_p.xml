<p>Serum samples were pre-treated with a receptor-destroying enzyme (RDE—Denka Seiken) for 18 hours at 37 °C in a water bath and then heat-inactivated for 1 hour at 56 °C in a water bath. At the end of incubation, all serum samples were treated with a 10% turkey RBCs (TRBCs) solution in order to remove non-specific inhibitors, and they were run in the HI assay by using the A/California/7/2009 H1N1pdm09 influenza strain, as described elsewhere [
