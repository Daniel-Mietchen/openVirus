<p>In conclusion, the competitive ELISA described in here, when supported by parallel assays such as neutralization, SRH, NA inhibition and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reporter (ADCC), is able to accurately distinguish differences in individual immune responses, thereby allowing the mode of action of different (next-generation) influenza vaccine approaches to be interpreted. Specifically, as reported in several studies [

 <xref rid="B53-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B54-vaccines-08-00043" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], the ADCC assay can reflect the functionality of the antibodies that are detected by ELISA. The results presented here confirm that the classical serological assays that are generally used to evaluate the immunogenicity of HA-based intramuscular/intradermal seasonal influenza vaccines are still valid. However, they could be insufficient in the evaluation of the immune response of next-generation influenza vaccines, especially if used alone.
