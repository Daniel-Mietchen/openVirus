  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) Serum samples from adult subjects tested by ELISA, hemagglutination inhibition (HI), single radial hemolysis (SRH), micro-neutralization (MN) and enzyme-linked lectin (ELLA) assays; (
   <bold>B</bold>) Serum samples from adults tested by ELISA and HI assays. The HI titer of each sample is indicated below the x-axis. Blue bars = head signal, and green bars = stalk signal. Asterisks indicate statistical significance; a black asterisk indicates a significant increase in the HA signal; a blue asterisk indicates a significant increase in the head signal; a green asterisk indicates a significant increase in the stalk signal. Error standard bars are reported both for the head and stalk signals.
