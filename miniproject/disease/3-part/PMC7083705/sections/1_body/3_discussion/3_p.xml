<p>Although our model captured the data fairly well, when the model fit incidence as well as possible, it underestimated the rate of spatial spread. When it fits the rate of spatial spread well, it overestimated incidence. Thus, the structure of our model lacked an important unknown process in the spread of ASFV in wild boar populations. Because our modeling framework accounts for well‐documented spatial contact (Podgórski et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>) and dispersal distances (Keuling et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>; Podgórski, Scandura, et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>), our difficulty with concurrently fitting incidence and distance trajectories could be due to long‐distance movements occurring often enough to seed infection outside the daily home range or dispersal movements. These results come as no surprise, as the human‐mediated spread of ASFV continues to play a large epidemiological role in the area (EFSA et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). One possible source is hunters that may contaminate hunting equipment when processing infectious carcasses and then introduce the infectious fomites at another site (Wieland et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0065" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). Implementing enhanced hunting biosecurity policies could help reduce the spatial spread of ASFV by hunters. A second possibility is other species which have contact with infectious carcasses, for example, scavenging carnivores, birds, and flies, and subsequently disperse contaminated tissue. Although the role of mechanical vectors in ASFV epidemiology remains unknown, they are known to enhance spread of many diseases (Siembieda, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0058" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), suggesting that this mechanism could be worth further investigation.
