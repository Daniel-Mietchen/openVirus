<p>The first wild boar case of ASF in Poland was detected in February 2014 in the northeastern part of the country (53°19′33ʺN, 23°45′31ʺE), less than 1 km from the border with Belarus (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Following the first occurrence of ASF in Poland, an intensive surveillance program was implemented in the affected area. The strategy was based on laboratory tests of all wild boar found dead and killed in road accidents (passive surveillance) and all hunted wild boar (active surveillance). A total of 4,625 boar were hunted, and 271 dead carcasses were sampled in Poland during 2014–2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Samples, collected by veterinary services and hunters, were submitted to the National Reference Laboratory for ASFV diagnostics at the National Veterinary Research Institute in Puławy, Poland. We used surveillance data from 8 administrative districts in Poland where ASFV was detected between 2014 and 2015 (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). During this time frame, 139 of 2,761 total wild boar samples tested positive for ASFV in a region spanning ~100 km along the border (Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The furthest case from the border was the 139th case which occurred in late 2015, 34.5 km from the border. Since sampling was strictly linked to hunting activities and the random discovery of carcasses, surveillance data were irregular and seasonally variable. A detailed description of laboratory procedures and tests can be found in Woźniakowski et al.,
