<p>Numerous studies demonstrate that animals in the family Suidae are extremely susceptible to multiple strains of ASFV with nearly 100% of domestic pigs and wild boar succumbing to disease within approximately 8–20 days postexposure (Blome, Gabriel, Dietze, Breithaupt, &amp; Beer, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>; Gallardo et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Infection can also present in a chronic form with viral shedding lasting more than 6 weeks; however, attenuated viral strains that promote chronic infections have never been reported in the Eastern European region (Sanchez‐Vizcaino, Mur, Gomez‐Villamandos, &amp; Carrasco, 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Considering host competence in surviving wild boar is largely unknown, and only a small fraction of individuals are likely to survive viral exposure, we assume ASF is 100% lethal in wild boar. Periods of latent and infectious disease in live hosts were Poisson random variables (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). We tied viral persistence time in carcasses to carcass decay rates to give uninfected and infected carcasses the same opportunity to be sampled (and we could not find data to suggest otherwise). Therefore, infected carcasses were assumed to remain infectious for the entire duration they persisted in the environment. The infectious period of carcasses was assumed to vary seasonally based on field measures of carcass persistence in Eastern Poland (Table
