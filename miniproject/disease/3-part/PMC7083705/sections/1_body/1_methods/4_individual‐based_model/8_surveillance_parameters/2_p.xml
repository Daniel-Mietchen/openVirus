<p>Because hunter harvests made up most of the sampling (94.5%) and hunter harvesting is thought to be a primary regulator of population density (Keuling et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>; Massei et al., 
 <xref rid="ece36100-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>), we included it as a source of mortality in our model in addition to using it as our observation model. In 2014, average wild boar densities were estimated at 1.5–2.5 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup>, locally ranging from 0.5–1 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup> to 3–5 boar/km
 <sup>2</sup> (Regional Directorate of State Forests). However, because we had no data on how the absolute number of boar sampled related to the underlying density, we added parameters

 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). First, we calculated the relative number of boar sampled daily by each surveillance method (number sampled on day t/maximum ever sampled on any given day) to produce seasonal trends in the proportion of the population sampled (Figure

 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>). Next, we multiplied the seasonal trend data for each surveillance method by the scaling factors (

 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>; Figure 
 <xref rid="ece36100-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>) to determine the daily proportion of boar that would be sampled by hunter harvesting or from dead carcasses. The product of the trend data and the scaling factor can be thought of as a daily detection probability. We assumed that boar &lt;6 months of age would not be hunted (typically not targeted by hunters) and that boar &lt;3 months of age would not be sampled by the dead carcass method (because they are unlikely to be found). We recorded the disease status for all boar that were sampled and then immediately removed them from the landscape permanently.
