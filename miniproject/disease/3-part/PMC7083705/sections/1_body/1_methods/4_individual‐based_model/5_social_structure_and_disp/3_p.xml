<p>The dispersal process (natal or other relocation) was as follows: (a) for each 45 degree angle from the home range centroid, a new possible set of [x,y] coordinates was obtained using the dispersal distance value assigned at random to the group (Table 
 <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>; i.e. 
 <italic>x</italic> = distance x cos(angle) + current x coordinate, 
 <italic>y</italic> = distance x sin(angle) + current y coordinate). If at least one of these potential locations were valid (i.e., in a grid cell with fewer boars than the carrying capacity or a location off the grid), then a valid potential location was chosen at random and boar(s) were relocated there. Boars that traveled off the grid were lost permanently. If there were no valid locations, the distance value was doubled and the process repeated until a valid location was obtained.
