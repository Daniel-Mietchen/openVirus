  <p>Model fit (patchy landscape). Trajectory of new cases (a) and maximum distance from the border (b) for observed (red) and predicted (black). Shaded areas indicate 95% prediction intervals from 1,000 simulations from the posterior distributions of parameters. Solid lines indicate the data that were used for parameter estimation whereas dotted lines show the out‐of‐sample predictions. c and d show the observed versus predicted points (where each point is the median across all simulations at each time step) for monthly cases (c) and maximum distance from the border (d). In‐sample points (2014–2015) are in black, out‐of‐sample points (2016) are in gray. The gray dotted line indicates the expected fit of the points (1:1 ratio of observed and predicted points)</p>
