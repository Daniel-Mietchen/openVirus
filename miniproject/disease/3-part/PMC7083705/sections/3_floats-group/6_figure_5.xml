  <p>Effects of host density and persistence mechanisms. Colors show the probability that ASFV will persist with dark red representing high probability, yellow representing moderately high probability, light blue representing moderate probability, and dark blue representing low probability. Axes show the values of the three persistence processes we examined: (1) between‐group direct transmission probability (
   <italic>β
    <sub>d</sub>
   </italic>), (2) between‐group carcass‐based transmission probability (
   <italic>β
    <sub>c</sub>
   </italic>), and (3) introduction frequency (
   <italic>ϕ</italic>) as indicated. For each two‐way plot, the third parameter (
   <italic>β
    <sub>d</sub>
   </italic>, 
   <italic>β
    <sub>c</sub>
   </italic>, or 
   <italic>ϕ</italic>) was fixed at 0 in order to disentangle each two‐way interaction. Within‐group transmission probabilities were fixed at 10 times their respective between‐group transmission probabilities. Other parameters estimated by the model were fixed at biologically realistic values: 
   <italic>ρ
    <sub>h</sub>
   </italic> = 0.015, 
   <italic>ρ
    <sub>c</sub>
   </italic> = 0.025, 
   <italic>π</italic> = 1, 
   <italic>θ</italic> = 2, 
   <italic>λ</italic> = 1.5; other parameters were as in Table 
   <xref rid="ece36100-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Each plot shows results for a different host density. The mean values in black show means for the entire plot, giving an overall effect of the landscape on spatial spread
