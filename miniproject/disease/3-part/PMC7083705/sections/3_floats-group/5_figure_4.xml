  <p>Proportion of transmission events that are from direct transmission. Shaded lines are 95% prediction intervals for 1,000 simulations from posterior distributions of each model. Red indicates &gt;50% of transmission events are carcass‐based; blue indicates that &gt;50% are direct. The different lines show results for different landscapes (heterogeneous vs. the three homogenous landscapes of different densities). Note, parameter estimates were different depending on the landscape (Table
