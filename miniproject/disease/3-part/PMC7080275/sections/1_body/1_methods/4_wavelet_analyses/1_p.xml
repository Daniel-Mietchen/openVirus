<p>As dengue dynamics in French Polynesia are very non-stationary, wavelet analyses were performed to explore dengue incidence periodicity [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Wavelet analysis enables investigation and quantification of the temporal evolution of time series with different rhythmic components. The Morlet wavelet was used and all analyses were performed with Matlab software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. All dengue incidence time series were square root transformed and all series were normalized and the trend was suppressed before the computation of the wavelet power spectrum by removing the periodic components greater than 16 years by using a classical low pass filter [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] to quantify the similarity between the wavelet power spectra of all time series. This approach built cluster trees that grouped the wavelet power spectra based on the similarity of their timeâ€“frequency patterns using maximum covariance analysis [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Technically, the wavelet spectra are compared using a procedure based on the maximum covariance analysis that enables construction of a matrix of dissimilarities between wavelet power spectra over which a hierarchical clustering algorithm is applied. Then to quantify the synchrony in each subdivision, wavelet mean field (WMF) methodology was applied [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The magnitude of the WMF measures the strength of synchrony at both time period and frequency (periodic components). It is computed as a weighted average of normalized wavelet transforms of each time series [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008110.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Using WMF can characterize common periodic components and their potential time changes, then potential synchrony and its evolution. Significance levels of all different wavelet quantities were based on 1000 data-driven bootstrapped series with characteristics in agreement with those of the observed dataset [
