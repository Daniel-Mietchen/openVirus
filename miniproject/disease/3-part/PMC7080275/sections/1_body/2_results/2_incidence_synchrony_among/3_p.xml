<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008110.g007">Fig 7</xref>, there was an increase in the correlation of monthly incidence rate with increasing population exchange, using air travel data from 2010 (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008110.s012">S4 Table</xref>). As indicated by different colours representing island correlations within subdivision (and black being among subdivision island correlations), the relationship was not influenced by subdivision 
 <italic>per se</italic> but the extent of population exchange. Furthermore, the correlation (of CCF with population movement) was greater at months lag-1, lag-2 than at lag 0; this highlights the overall lack of immediate synchrony of the dengue incidence rate across connected populations.
