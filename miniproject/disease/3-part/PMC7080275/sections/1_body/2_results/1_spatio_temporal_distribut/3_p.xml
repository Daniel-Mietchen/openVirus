<p>Across the entire time period of 435 months, an absence of reported dengue cases for more than 1 month throughout French Polynesia was recorded on only 16 occasions (range 2–9 months), totalling 59 months (

In Tahiti, the most populated island, there were no dengue cases for two or more consecutive months on only 17 occasions (range 2–14 months), totalling 76 months absence. From November 1988 until May 2011 dengue cases were observed at least every other month somewhere across French Polynesia. To assess the Critical community size (CCS) permitting continuous circulation of DENV, we plotted the number of months per year with no dengue per island and the corresponding island size. Classically, the CCS is taken as the point at which the regression line crosses the zero month absence point on the Y-axis. However, because DENV is mosquito-borne and can persist in the infected mosquito until it dies without being detectable in the human population, we relaxed the CCS definition to crossing the one month dengue absence per year Y axis point. The CCS is estimated to exceed 175 000 individuals (Linear regression. P&lt;0.001; 40.9% variance explained) (
