<p>Over the 35-year period we defined eight epidemics (12 392 cases) and six inter-epidemic periods (1 990 cases) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008110.g003">Fig 3</xref>. Until 2013, DENV circulation was monotypic with very few occasions of co-circulation of more than one serotype at any one time. The majority of the co-circulation events occurred during the initial phases of the invasion of a novel serotype. Although islands from all subdivisions registered at least one incidence-month of dengue from the start of the 35-year period, an increasing number of islands reported cases over time, particularly in the less populated subdivisions, but which did not necessarily correspond to the amplitude of the dengue incidence. However, the overall number of cases was strongly positively correlated with the number of islands having at least one case during the month (Loglinear regression. Relative Risk (RR) per island number increase = 1.32, 95% Confidence intervals (CI) 1.30â€“1.34, P&lt;0.001;
