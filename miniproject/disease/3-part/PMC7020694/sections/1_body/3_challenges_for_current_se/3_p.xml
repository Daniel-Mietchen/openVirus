<p>A vast majority of seasonal influenza vaccines are manufactured in eggs. Occasionally, during vaccine production, egg adaptive mutations can arise that alter the antigenicity of the virus and, as a result, can reduce vaccine effectiveness against circulating strains. H3N2 strains in particular have been associated with increased egg-based mutations that result in reduced antigenicity of the vaccine strain, negatively impacting the protection afforded by the vaccine (

Consequently, egg grown vaccines must be monitored to ensure that the vaccine strain incorporated into the vaccine matches the seed strain chosen at the start of manufacturing. The risk of adaptive mutations and reduced antigenicity is mitigated in recombinant protein vaccines, which are grown in insect cells, or by producing the vaccine strains in mammalian cell lines. However, the cost associated with large-scale production of cell-culture grown vaccine strains remains high as compared to ones produced in eggs (
