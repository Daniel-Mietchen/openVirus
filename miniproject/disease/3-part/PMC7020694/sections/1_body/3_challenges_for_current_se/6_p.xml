<p>The most significant challenge for the seasonal influenza vaccine production strategy involves ensuring that the vaccine strains match the dominant circulating strains in the population. There have been significant efforts to improve upon methods of monitoring and identifying newly evolved influenza strains worldwide, including the incorporation of modeling techniques such as antigenic cartography (

Despite these efforts, the screening process is imperfect, and as result, it is not unusual to see the emergence of a variant strain after selection of another strain for vaccine production. Neutralizing antibodies induced upon vaccination predominantly target the highly immunogenic head domain of HA and provide potent protection against matching strains by blocking virus attachment to cells (
 <xref rid="ref62" ref-type="bibr">Knossow et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, these highly immunogenic regions in the head domain are prone to high mutation rates due to immune selection pressure from neutralizing antibodies. In a circulating strain, accumulation of mutations in the head domain over time leads to changes in antigenic properties (antigenic drift) and can render vaccine-induced immunity ineffective against them. In addition, these variant strains can cause epidemics in populations lacking immunity to the newly evolved strain (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Fields et al., 2013</xref>). Antigenic drift is the major driving force behind the need to reformulate influenza vaccines each year and poses a significant challenge for vaccine development. Furthermore, seasonal influenza virus vaccines fail to provide protection against the novel strains transmitted from zoonotic reservoirs.
