<p>While the universal vaccine approaches described above demonstrate novel methods of improving protection against influenza virus infection, a concern that is often overlooked involves the degree to which pre-existing immunity impacts the antibody response to influenza infection and vaccination. This is true for all of the vaccination approaches, including HA, NA, M2e, and T-cell-directed approaches. This concept, referred to as “original antigenic sin,” suggests that the first influenza virus variant an individual encounters impacts the immune response to subsequent influenza virus variants (

It is important to note that most of the animal studies done to validate these vaccination approaches are done in naïve animals that lack any previous influenza virus exposure. While unavoidable, this serves to highlight the importance of experiments that more accurately recapitulate the complexity of pre-existing antibody responses in humans as well as thorough clinical trials in order to fully assess the potential for new vaccines to provide broad and long-lasting protection within the population.
