<p>As described above, the antigenic variation of the HA1 domain and its resulting antigenic drift is the major reason for reformulating seasonal influenza vaccines with new strains every year. To address this challenge, several vaccine strategies based on conserved sequences in HA have been developed. Once such approach involves a novel computational-based antigen design methodology. This approach, termed computationally optimized broadly reactive antigen (COBRA), was used to generate a consensus H5 HA sequence by aligning 129 unique HA sequences from clade 2 H5N1 viruses isolated from 2004 to 2006 (

Following vaccination of mice and ferrets, the COBRA H5N1 VLP vaccines induced increased hemagglutinin inhibition titers and provided enhanced protection against lethal challenge with different clade 2 H5N1 viruses when compared to a VLP vaccine containing an HA derived from a primary isolate (
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">Giles and Ross, 2011</xref>). The improved efficacy of COBRA vaccine approaches have been supported by studies in a non-human primate model (cynomolgus macaques) with the COBRA HA H5N1 VLPs (
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Giles et al., 2012</xref>). The sera from vaccinated macaques demonstrated hemagglutinin inhibition titers against a wider range of H5N1 strains than animals vaccinated with contemporary H5N1 HA VLPs (
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Giles et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, vaccinated macaques were protected against viral challenge as well as exhibiting reduced lung inflammation (
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">Giles et al., 2012</xref>). Following the same methodology used for the generation of COBRA HA H5N1 VLPs, COBRA HA H3N2 and COBRA HA H1N1 VLPS have been generated using consensus sequences from both modern and historical H3N2 and H1N1 strains. These COBRA VLP vaccines provided broad protection against a wide range of H3N2 and H1N1 strains (
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">Carter et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref118" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, the COBRA H1 and H3 antigens, along with the AF03 adjuvant (squalene-in-water emulsion), induced protective responses in ferrets, with ferrets exhibiting decreased viral shedding (
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2018</xref>). By generating more broadly reactive HAs, the COBRA approach provides an intriguing solution to overcome the challenges posed by antigenic drift of circulating strains, as COBRA-based seasonal vaccine has the potential to provide protection even during mismatch. However, as protection afforded by COBRA vaccines is only against specific HA subtypes, COBRA vaccines still fall short of serving as a true universal influenza vaccine.
