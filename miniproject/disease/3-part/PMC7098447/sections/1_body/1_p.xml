<p>Many studies reported that influenza virus infection was associated with cardiac injury (

 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A recent study found that at least 70.8% of critically ill patients with H7N9 viral infection had cardiac injury (
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Cardiac injuries, such as an ejection fraction (EF) lower than 50% and elevated troponin I (TNI), were associated with higher mortality during the 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) (
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Mortality caused by cardiac injury increases significantly during influenza epidemics (
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and cardiac injuries are more common in fatal cases of influenza (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, the relationship between cardiac injury and risk of mortality among people infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus has not been clearly elucidated.
