A recent case report showed one death after H7N9 virus infection in late March 2019, and potential reemergence of the highly pathogenic zoonotic viral strain may cause public health concern (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Even though we know that infection with H7N9 virus can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pneumonia, acute kidney injury (AKI), shock, and rhabdomyolysis (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), we still know little about cardiac injury after H7N9 viral infection.</p><p>Many studies reported that influenza virus infection was associated with cardiac injury (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). A recent study found that at least 70.8% of critically ill patients with H7N9 viral infection had cardiac injury (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Cardiac injuries, such as an ejection fraction (EF) lower than 50% and elevated troponin I (TNI), were associated with higher mortality during the 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Mortality caused by cardiac injury increases significantly during influenza epidemics (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and cardiac injuries are more common in fatal cases of influenza (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). However, the relationship between cardiac injury and risk of mortality among people infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus has not been clearly elucidated.</p><p>These findings highlight the need to understand more about the link between H7N9 viral infection and cardiac injury and whether cardiac injury in such patients is associated with mortality. The present multicenter study collected data from several clinical centers in mainland China to examine the potential association between cardiac injury and mortality among patients with laboratory-confirmed avian influenza A (H7N9) viral infection.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study Participants</title><p>The Chinese Surveillance System for Pneumonia was used to retrospectively collect data of inpatients with laboratory-confirmed avian influenza from hospitals throughout China.

In brief, based on the database, copies of original medical records of 338 patients from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of mainland China between January 22, 2015, and June 16, 2017, were available. For each hospital, the collaborators contributed all the patients with H7N9 viral infection from their hospital. H7N9 viral infection was confirmed by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral isolation, or serologic testing (<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Cardiac testing was ordered by the treating physicians. If there was more than one test for a single patient, all the results were captured. Patients were followed up from admission to death during hospitalization or hospital discharge. Loss to follow-up was defined as the survival status that cannot be ascertained.</p><p>This study was approved by the National Health Commission of China and the institutional review boards at China-Japan Friendship Hospital (Beijing, China).

Clinical data were reviewed by trained physicians of pulmonary and critical care medicine to determine the accuracy of diagnoses. Demographic characteristics (age and gender), clinical characteristics (comorbidities, laboratory findings, severity of illness scores, treatments, complications, and outcomes), and results of cardiac examinations (cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiography, and echocardiography) for participants during hospitalization were collected and independently entered into the computer database by two analysts. Results of cardiac biomarkers included values of TNI and creatinine kinase-myocardial band (CK-MB). Results of electrocardiography included heart rate, heart rhythm, and waveform change of P, QRS, and ST-T. Results of echocardiography included value of EF, ventricular wall motion assessment, pericardial effusion, and mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm).</p><p>The number of patients for each type of cardiac examinations was counted and the time of first test for each examination was recorded. As the different normal range of testing equipment in different hospitals, the ratio of the detected value to the upper limit of the normal range was used as a unified evaluation index. For any discrepancies between the two datasets, the original medical records were checked to make sure the data accuracy.</p><p>All the clinical data were collected till discharge or death. Data of cardiac test collected within 28 days after influenza illness onset were used to evaluate cardiac injury (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), which was assessed on the basis of cardiac biomarkers (TNI and CK-MB), electrocardiography, and echocardiography.</p><p>Cardiac injury was defined as one or more of the following (<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>): blood levels of cardiac biomarkers (TNI or CK-MB) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), new abnormalities in electrocardiography, including supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, bundle branch block, ST-segment elevation/depression, T-wave flattening/inversion, and QT interval prolongation (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>), new abnormalities in echocardiography, including decreased EF value (EF &#x0003c; 50%) or a worsening of the underlying state (patients with basal state of EF &#x0003c;50%), regional/global ventricular wall motion abnormalities, the presence of pericardial effusion, and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>).

In this retrospective multicenter study, a high proportion (63.2%) of cardiac injury was found in hospitalized patients with influenza A (H7N9) viral infection. We found that cardiac injury was independently associated with increased risk of mortality during hospitalization among patients infected with H7N9 virus.</p><p>Cardiac injury was also common in the infection caused by other subtypes of influenza virus (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A retrospective studies found that about 54% individuals infected during the severe H1N1 pandemic in 2009 had cardiac injury (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). A study of 600 U.S. patients who underwent cardiac biomarker testing within 30 days after a laboratory-confirmed influenza infection specimen collection showed that 143 (24%) had elevated TNI and/or CK-MB (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Severe infections, ARDS, and related mechanical ventilation settings were associated with cardiac injury (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These common conditions in patients with H7N9 viral infection may partly explain the high proportion of cardiac injury (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with H7N9 viral infection is still uncertain. In one study, autopsy of two patients who died after H7N9 viral infection failed to detect the virus in heart tissue (<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated the association between influenza infection and cardiac complications as well as higher risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and myocardial necrosis (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Influenza viral antigen was demonstrated in the cardiocytes of mice by immunofluorescence (<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). Case reports indicated the presence of influenza A (H1N1) in pericardial and myocardial tissues of influenza patients (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These studies suggest the potential of direct viral invasion as the cause of infection-associated cardiac injury (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Alternatively, severe influenza infection may trigger an exaggerated immune response, with many individuals with severe influenza infection showing increased serum cytokines (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The activation or enhanced release of various inflammatory cytokines, or transient hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, may aggravate the impairment of intracellular calcium function, which may result in abnormal electrocardiography and echocardiography (<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In the present study, the proportion of patients with detectable viral RNA until discharge or death was significantly higher among patients with cardiac injury than among uninjured patients. Because influenza A (H7N9) virus can cause severe infection, we hypothesize that it promotes cardiac injury by up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), but this needs to be further explored.</p><p>Studies have shown that during influenza epidemics, cardiac injury was associated with increased mortality (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and was more prevalent among infected individuals who died (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Study of a cohort from the severe H1N1 pandemic in 2009 showed that elevated TNI and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (EF &#x0003c; 50%) were associated with high mortality (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Autopsies of influenza-infected patients who experienced sudden death show typical inflammatory infiltration and myocardial necrosis that occurred before death (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Consistent with this result, 69% of patients who died of influenza B viral infection in one study showed pathologic evidence of cardiac injury (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Our study is the first to identify cardiac injury as an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality. Cardiac injury in influenza-infected patients may contribute to mortality in part by causing hemodynamic deterioration. Indeed, many of our patients with cardiac injury were on vasopressor therapy. This deterioration may be due to cytokines released after severe infection. Cytokines can suppress cardiac output, and cytokine storms inhibit oxygen use by mitochondria, and contribute to the occurrence of acute heart failure in patients with severe infection (<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>).</p><p>Our study is limited by its retrospective nature, and by the fact that we could not include all patients in mainland China with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H7N9) viral infection. Nevertheless, we included patients from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the characteristics of our patients were similar to those for the general population of patients with H7N9 viral infection, based on data from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Second, because patients varied between when they had their first cardiac examination and when infection manifested, we were not able to find the risk interval between H7N9 viral infection and cardiac injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Cardiac injury is a frequent condition among hospitalized patients infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus, and it is associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality. The association between H7N9 virus and cardiac injury needs further exploration, and clinicians should be aware of the potential of cardiac injury in H7N9 virus&#x02013;infected patients. Such patients should require more extensive and frequent monitoring.</p></sec><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We appreciate the substantial efforts of the National Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China in coordinating data collection.
