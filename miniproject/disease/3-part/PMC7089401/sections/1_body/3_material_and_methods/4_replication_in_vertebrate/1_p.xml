<p>Replication in vertebrate cells was assessed in a range of cell lines (A6, 3CPK, 1LV, Vero, DF-1, RK-13, MDBK, MEF
 <sub>WT</sub>, MEF
 <sub>IFNAR-/-</sub>, MEF
 <sub>RNL-/-</sub>, JU56, VSW, 3CPL, MDCK, PK15, LLCPK1, ST, OK, BHK, BSR, HEK293 and SW13) including a C6/36 control following the method described in Colmant 
 <italic>et al</italic>., 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Cells were inoculated with virus in triplicates in 24-well plates at a MOI 1 with 200μL of inoculum, rocked at RT for 30 minutes then incubated at 28°C or 37°C depending on the cell line for one hour. The inoculum was removed, and the cells washed three times with sterile PBS, topped up with 2% FBS growth media and incubated at 28°C or 37°C for five days. The cell culture supernatants were harvested and stored at -80°C, then titrated on C6/36 cells by TCID
 <sub>50</sub> as described below.
