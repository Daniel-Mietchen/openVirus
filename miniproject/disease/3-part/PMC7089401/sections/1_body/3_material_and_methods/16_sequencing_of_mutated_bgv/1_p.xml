<p>RNA was extracted from selected samples from P5 of the passaging experiment and from the original C6/36-derived BgV stock using the Macherey Nagel Nucleospin RNA Virus isolation kit, following the manufacturer’s protocol–without carrier RNA. This RNA was sequenced as described in the earlier section detailing the sequencing of BgV/WNV-prME on a NextSeg 500 (see above). The reads were assembled to the published sequence of BgV (KU308380.1) using Geneious 8.1.9 with default parameters.</p>
