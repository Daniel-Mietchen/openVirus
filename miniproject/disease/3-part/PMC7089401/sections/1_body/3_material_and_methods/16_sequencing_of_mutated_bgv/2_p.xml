<p>RNA was extracted from all other BgV positive supernatants using the same kit following manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The mutation sites were amplified by RT-PCR using SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and BgV specific primers (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008166.s002">S1 Table</xref>). The resulting PCR products were resolved on a 1% agarose gel, excised and gel purified using Nucleospin gel and PCR clean up kit (Macherey Nagel), before they were sent for Sanger sequencing at the AGRF. The sequences were aligned to a BgV reference and each other in Geneious 8.1.9.
