<p>Cells were seeded at 2x10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well of a 24 well plate, in triplicate wells for each virus at each time point and each temperature. Cells were inoculated with virus at a MOI of 0.1 with 500μL of virus, incubated at 28/34/37°C for 1h 30min. The inoculum was removed, and the cells washed three times with sterile PBS, topped up with 2% FBS growth media and incubated at 28/34/37°C for five days. Supernatant was harvested at each time point from the dedicated well and stored at -80°C. The supernatants were titrated on C6/36 cells and TCID
 <sub>50</sub> titres were determined by fixed-cell ELISA as described above. Replication kinetics curves were plotted with average and standard deviation of the triplicate values for each sample.
