<p>Our initial studies on BgV suggested that the virus was narrowly host-restricted in vertebrates with limited replication in vertebrate cells and in immunocompetent mice [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008166.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We show that BgV host-restriction is temperature-dependent, with all vertebrate cell lines permissive to BgV replication at 34°C, but only a subset of these cells are permissive at 37°C. This phenotype was confirmed to be independent of any potential thermal instability of the virus particles. In addition, recent reports have revealed that the antiviral effects of IFN-I and RNAse L responses could be significantly lower at cooler temperatures than in warmer environments [

 <sub>RNL-/-</sub>), indicating that BgV host-restriction was not only due to IFN-I- or RNAse L-dependent mechanisms. Despite our data showing that the IFN-I pathways were not likely to be involved in BgV host-restriction, it should be noted that certain IFN-stimulated genes can be activated in the absence of IFN-I stimulus following flavivirus infection [
