<p>While components of the mechanisms involved in BgV host-restriction were elucidated in this study, it is pertinent to consider how these may be relevant to the ecology of this virus. It is possible that BgV might be amplified and horizontally transmitted by a cryptic vertebrate host in the wild, potentially a species with a lower core body temperature, based on our results showing higher levels of replication at lower temperatures in all tested vertebrate cell lines. Therefore, the lack of viral replication we observe in avian models (DF-1 cells, embryonated eggs and live sparrows), could be due to the higher core body temperature of these animals. However, no evidence was found that BgV was able to replicate efficiently in reptiles or amphibians despite their lower core body temperature. Our previous publications suggest that BgV may preferentially replicate in marsupial hosts, on which

 <italic>Tachyglossus aculeatus</italic>), which have a significantly lower core body temperature compared to other mammals [
