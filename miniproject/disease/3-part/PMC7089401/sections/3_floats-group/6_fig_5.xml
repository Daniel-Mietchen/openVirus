  <p>A. Summary of seropositive mice inoculated with BgV-derived viruses and mice with neutralising antibodies. Seroconversion was determined by fixed-cell ELISA using doubling dilutions of sera on BgV infected and fixed C6/36 cells. B. Levels of seroconversion obtained from BgV-derived viruses-injected mice. The dotted lines represent the lower and higher limits of detection. Sera from WNV/BgV-prME-injected mice were only diluted to 1/160 as opposed to the rest of the sera, diluted up to 1/512. The sample size of each group can be found in (A). C. Levels of neutralising antibodies in BgV-derived viruses-injected mice sera as determined by microneutralisation assay. The dotted lines represent the lower and higher limit of detection. The sample size of each group can be found in (A). D. Summary of virus positive mice brains three and 5 five days p.i.. The left brain hemisphere was harvested from three mice per time point in each group, stored at -80Â°C, weighed, homogenised in a 20% w/v mixture with RPMI, titrated on C6/36 cells and analysed by fixed-cell ELISA. E. Levels of detected virus in mice brains as determined by titration on C6/36 cells, see protocol in (D). The dotted line represents the lower limit of detection.</p>
