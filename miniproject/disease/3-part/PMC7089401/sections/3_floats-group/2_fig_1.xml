  <p>A. Schematic representation of the genome composition of CPER-generated BgV-derived chimeric viruses. Black shading indicates WNV
   <sub>KUN</sub> genes while red shading indicates BgV genes. The prME genes were swapped for each virus, generating a chimera with BgV “backbone” sequence and WNV
   <sub>KUN</sub> prME: BgV/WNV-prME and the reverse chimera with WNV backbone sequence and BgV prME: WNV/BgV-prME. B. Replication kinetics of parental prototype viruses and CPER-generated chimeras and infectious clones in C6/36 cells over five days. The insect cells were inoculated with each virus at MOI 0.1 in triplicates for 1h 30min, the inoculum removed and the cells washed before incubating the replenished cultures at 28°C. The supernatants were harvested at 2, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours p.i., stored at -80°C until they were titrated on C6/36 cells and the titres determined by fixed-cell ELISA. Error bars represent the standard deviation and the dotted lines represent the lower limit of detection. C. Visualisation of virus replication in vertebrate cells by IFA. The cells were inoculated at MOI 1 with WNV, BgV, WNV/BgV-prME, BgV/WNV-prME or mock inoculated, in triplicates, the inoculum removed and the cells washed before incubating at 37°C (all vertebrate cells) or 28°C (C6/36 cells). The cells were fixed five days post-inoculation and stained with pan-flavivirus mAb 4G2 by IFA.
