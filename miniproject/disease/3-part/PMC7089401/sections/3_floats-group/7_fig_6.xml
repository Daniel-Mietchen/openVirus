  <title>Microphotographs of meningo-encephalitis in the brains of mice IC-injected with mutant chimera BgV
   <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME.
  </title>
  <p>A. Brain section from mouse culled at day 3 p.i. showing widespread infiltration of neutrophils and monocytes in the neuropil accompanied by gliosis (overall marked increase in cellularity). B. Brain section from mouse culled at day 5 p.i. showing extension of inflammation into other parts of the brain distant from the injection site. C. Brain section from animal culled on day 22 p.i. where evidence of severe meningo-encephalitis is still present with perivascular cuffing and leukocyte infiltrates in the meninges (arrows). D. Brain section from mouse culled on day 22 p.i. and demonstrating persistent severe inflammation throughout the neuropil. Hematoxylin and eosin staining.</p>
