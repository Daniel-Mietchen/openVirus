  <title>Immunohistochemistry of brain sections from mice injected with BgV-derived viruses.</title>
  <p>Virus positive cells appear with a red signal. A. Pericytes and leukocytes infiltrating in the Virchowâ€™s space around cerebral blood vessels are positive for viral antigen in mouse culled on day 22 post-IC-inoculation of mutant chimera BgV
   <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME. B. Virus antigen positive cells amongst the leukocyte infiltrating the meninges in mouse culled on day 22 post-IC-inoculation with BgV
   <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME. C. Scattered neurons are positive for viral antigen, which is mainly located to the peri-nuclear Golgi-region (insert). Mouse culled on day 22 post-IC-inoculation of BgV
   <sub>T-AT</sub>/WNV-prME. D. Widespread cytoplasmic signal for viral antigen in brain of mouse IC-inoculated with WNV/BgV-prME and culled 8 days p.i..
