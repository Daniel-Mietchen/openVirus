   <p>Amino acids are numbered with regard to the HA0 protein, and HA1 as well as HA2 subunits are indicated. The vaccine strains to which the isolates were compared are given in red for each lineage. Isolates from this study are labeled as vaccinated with trivalent vaccine (triangle), vaccinated with tetravalent vaccine (square), randomly selected case without vaccination history (circle), fatal cases (black filled symbols). Symbols represent the main antigenic sites, 120-loop (A; amino acids 116–137, 38, 56, 75, 177, 179–181), 150-loop (B; amino acids 141–150), 160-loop (C; amino acids 162–167) and 190-helix (D; amino acids 194–202). *For the Yamagata-lineage, 48 strains, that were identical at amino acid level, are depicted as a pool and contain patients with the following characteristics: 15x○; 15x●; 3x□, 1x■, 14x△.</p>
