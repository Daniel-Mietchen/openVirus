<p id="p0090">Another factor contributing to the severity of the season might be the patient population itself. Both the attack rate and the relative illness ratio of influenza B are highest for children and decrease with age

 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the major difference that was seen for the season 2017/18 was the higher proportion of adult patients. The age-subgroups themselves, being pediatric patients and adult patients, were not different in their clinical characteristics between 2017/18 and the two previous seasons. However, the adult population that was seen had a high proportion of comorbidities and risk factors that might have contributed to a severe outcome of the influenza disease, as it is known for example for cardiac insufficiency

 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. A shift towards the adult population thus increases the impact on the public health system and may explain the severity of this season with a high number of excess consultations. An interpretation of the presented clinical data, however, needs to be done with caution as there may be a bias towards severe disease courses in a hospital setting. A fatality rate of 11.2% of the adult population of this study can thus not be transferred to the general population.
