<p id="p0100">Since 2000, changes in the antigenic sites are dominantly located in the 120-loop and 190-helix regions, indicating main targets for immune pressure. With regard to the vaccine strain B/Phuket/3073/2013 the main antigenic regions were only affected in 9 strains and occurred mainly in the 120-loop region, followed by the 160-loop region for the analyzed Yamagata strains. In contrast, all analyzed Victoria strains had at least one amino acid change in the 120-loop region with regard to the vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008. It is therefore surprising that the Yamagata-lineage that circulated in the population for three consecutive seasons was able to cause such a major epidemic.</p>
