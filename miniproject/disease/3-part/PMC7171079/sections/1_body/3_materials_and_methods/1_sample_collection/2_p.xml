<p id="Par25">In 1999, 24 stool specimens were collected from twelve AFP patients (2 specimens per person) in support of polio eradication activities in Tibet. World Health Organization requires at least 150 stool samples to be tested every year in order to maintain the detection ability of poliovirus, since there are very few AFP Cases in Tibet every year, stool specimens of healthy children need to be collected to maintain the detection ability. For this reason, 298 stool specimens were collected from 298 healthy children under 5 year old (1 specimen per child) in Tibet in 1999.</p>
