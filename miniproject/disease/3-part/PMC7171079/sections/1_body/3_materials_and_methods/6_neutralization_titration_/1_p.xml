<p id="Par34">Six Tibet EV-B83 strains were purified by plaque assay, and the titres of them were measured three times, and the average value was taken. The strain with the highest titre, 99258, was selected for the neutralization test. We selected 51 serum samples from children in Tibet for inactivation at 56 °C for 30 minutes, diluted the inactivated serum into five gradients (1:4, 1:16, 1:64, 1:256, 1:1024), and added 50 μL of each serum dilution to a 96-well plate in duplicate. Then, 50 μL of the virus dilution (100 CCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was added to each well, and the 96-well plate was placed in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator at 36 °C. After neutralizing for 2 h, 100 μL RD cell solution was added to each well. Serum control (1:4 serum dilution without virus) and cell control were set up in the experiment. A back titration of challenging virus is included in each test to allow calculation of the titre of virus actually present in that test. After all cells were added, the 96-well plates were placed in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator and cultured at 36 °C. After continuous observation for 7 days, the highest serum dilution showing protection from CPE in 50% of cultures was determined. If a neutralizing antibody titre was observed at a serum dilution &gt; 1:8, the serum sample was considered positive and the geometric mean titre (GMT) was calculated. We also used SPSS Statistics software (v19.0) (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for statistical analysis and selected the chi-square test to compare differences in seroprevalence between Lhasa and Shigatse.
