<p id="Par21">The serum neutralization test is greatly important for studying virus prevalence. The change in serum antibody is a dynamic process that can objectively evaluate the prevalence and spread of the virus

 </sup>. According to serum neutralization test results for children in Lhasa and Shigatse, the seroprevalence and GMT of EV-B83 are higher than those of previously reported enteroviruses, such as EV-B106, EV-A90, and EV-B80

 </sup>, indicating that EV-B83 is more widespread than some of previously discovered enteroviruses and may result in potential outbreaks and mass epidemics. The temperature sensitivity test is a good indicator of virulence and contagiousness

 </sup>. The six Tibet EV-B83 strains showed resistance to temperature changes, indicating that they have high virulence and potential contagiousness. This is consistent with our previous suggestion that EV-B83 is more common than other EV (EV-B106, EV-A90).
