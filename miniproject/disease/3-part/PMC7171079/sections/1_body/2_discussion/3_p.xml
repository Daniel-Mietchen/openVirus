<p id="Par19">A phylogenetic tree constructed based on all available 
 <italic>VP1</italic> regions (633 nt in length) of EV-B83 illustrated an interesting phenomenon: the six Tibet EV-B83 strains form an independent evolutionary branch and are far from the two EV-B83 strains isolated from Yunnan, China, indicating that EV-B83 has two different evolutionary branches in China

 </sup>. We divided all EV-B83 into four genotypes, A, B, C, and D, based on nucleotide diversity in the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region. This division of genotypes clarifies and simplifies the evolutionary relationship of EV-B83.
