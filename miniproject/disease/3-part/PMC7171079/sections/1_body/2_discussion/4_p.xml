 </sup>. We know that recombination and nucleotide mutations promote the evolution of enteroviruses and new type emergence. Recombinant analysis is also crucial in epidemiological studies. We found that six Tibet EV-B83 strains and many previously discovered new enteroviruses (EV-B80, EV-B106, etc.) have reliable recombination in multiple genomic regions.
