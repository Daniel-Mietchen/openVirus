<p id="Par15">We randomly selected serum samples from 51 children in the Tibet (39 in Lhasa and 12 in Shigatse) for sero-epidemiology study. Serum control and cell control are all normal. The results showed that 30 of 51 serum samples were seropositive (&gt;1:80) at a positive rate of 58.8%, and the GMT of the positive samples was 1:19.70. The composition ratios of neutralization antibody titters of &lt;1:8, 1:8–1:64, and &gt;1:64 were 41.2%, 56.9%, and 1.9%, respectively. Compared with other EV-B (such as EV-B106 and EV-B80) previously reported in China

 </sup>, positive EV-B83 rates were higher among children of the same age. There were 19 positive samples in Lhasa with a 48.7% positive rate and GMT of 1:22.22. In Shigatse, there were 11 positive samples with a 91.7% positive rate and GMT of 1:16. Further analysis by the chi-square test (
