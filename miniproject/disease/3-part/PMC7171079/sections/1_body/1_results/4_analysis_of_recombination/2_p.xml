<p id="Par12">First, we performed recombinant analysis while excluding CV-A9 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). The BootScan results showed that when Tibet EV-B83 was used as the query sequence for analysis, there was a strong recombination signal in the 
 <italic>5</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> and 
 <italic>VP4</italic> partial regions between EV-B106 and the Tibet EV-B83 group. In the 
 <italic>P2</italic> regions, the CV-B4, EV-B80, and Tibet EV-B83 groups showed a smaller range of recombination in 
 <italic>2B</italic> and 
 <italic>2 C</italic>, respectively. In the 
 <italic>P3</italic> regions, the CV-B4 and Tibet EV-B83 groups had high recombination in the 
 <italic>3D</italic> regions. This result had a high support value, which is consistent with the results of RDP4.
