<p id="Par13">Second, recombination analysis was performed while excluding CV-B4 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The BootScan results showed that EV-B106 and EV-B83 had a strong recombination signal in the 
 <italic>5</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> and 
 <italic>VP4</italic> regions when Tibet EV-B83 was used as the query sequence for analysis. In the 
 <italic>P2</italic> regions, the EV-B80, EV-B106, and Tibet EV-B83 groups had a smaller range of recombination signals in 
 <italic>2C</italic> and 
 <italic>3C</italic>, which also verified the above recombination results. The CV-A9 and Tibet EV-B83 groups had a wide range of reorganization, which covered most regions of 
 <italic>2A–2C</italic> and 
 <italic>3D</italic> and small regions of 
 <italic>3B</italic> and 
 <italic>3C</italic>.
