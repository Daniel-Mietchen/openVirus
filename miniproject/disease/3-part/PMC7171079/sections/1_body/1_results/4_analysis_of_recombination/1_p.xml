 </sup>. The breakpoint positions of three Tibet EV-B83 strains (
 <italic>99258</italic>, 99268, 99275) are mainly located in 397–627 and 3428–7272, covering part or all of the 
 <italic>5</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> and 
 <italic>2A</italic>–
 <italic>3D</italic> regions of the genome. The breakpoint positions of the other three Tibet strains (99245, 99267, 99269) are located in 392(384)–628(627), 3428(3427)–7272(7324), and 5564(5524)–6166, covering part or all of the 
 <italic>5</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic>, 
 <italic>2A</italic>–
 <italic>3D</italic>, and 
 <italic>3</italic>′
 <italic>-UTR</italic> genomic regions, respectively (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Although the recombination analysis results of the six Tibetan strains showed some differences at the breakpoint positions, considering the high sequence similarities, we still selected all primary and secondary potential parents (CV-B1, E-30, CV-B4, EV-B80, CV-B, CV-A, EV-B106) for recombination analysis using the SimPlot program (v3.5.1)

 </sup>. The results of SimPlot and BootScan, the maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree, and the high similarity of recombination sites of the CV-A9, CV-B4, and Tibet EV-B83 strains led to the determination that EV-B106, EV-B80 (GenBank accession number JX644073), partial CV-A9 in the GenBank, and some CV-B4 strains were recombined with the six Tibet EV-B83 strains. Because the recombination sites of the CV-A9, CV-B4, and Tibet EV-B83 strains were very similar, we used the SimPlot program to analyse the Tibet EV-B83 strains in two methods.
