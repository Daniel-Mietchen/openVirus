<p id="Par9">The phylogenetic tree based on the partial 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region (633 nt) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) showed that the 
 <italic>VP1</italic> region greatly differed in genetic distance compared to other regions, and the selected EV-B83 sequences were further divided into genotypes. We named the prototype strain (CA76-10392/USA/1976) of EV-B83 isolated in the United States in 1976 as genotype A, and the rest were divided according to the time of isolation. EV-B83 isolated from Cambodia (GenBank accession number KX197452) was classified as genotype C, the six Tibet EV-B83 strains were classified as genotype D, and the remaining EV-B83 including Chinese Yunnan strains, Indian strains, and French strain composed genotype B. We verified genotype classification by analysing inter-group and intra-group distances and found that the average distance between the four groups was 21–25%, which met the criteria of 15–25% for defining genotype by nucleotide differences in enteroviruses
