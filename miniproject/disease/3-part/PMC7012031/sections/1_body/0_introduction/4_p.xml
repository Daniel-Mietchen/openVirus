<p>In 2009, in response to the pandemic Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, the public health department at the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia established its first case-based Influenza surveillance system. Healthcare facilities, including the private sector, were required to test all suspected cases and report the clinical details of all confirmed cases using unified data collection forms. Public health measures, as recommended by the WHO pandemic guidelines at that time, incorporated thermal screening at the points of entry, tracing and screening all contacts, follow-up of direct contacts, and strict infection control measures. The aim of this study was to describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016.</p>
