 </sup> Influenza viruses can be transmitted through aerosols, large droplets, or direct contact with secretions (or fomites). Seasonal influenza viruses can cause a wide range of symptoms from mild to severe illness, which can lead to death, particularly in persons at increased risk for severe disease, including pregnant women, the very young and very old, immunocompromised people, and people with chronic underlying medical conditions.

 </sup> Seasonal influenza viruses evolve continuously, which means that people can be infected multiple times throughout their lives.

 </sup> Therefore, the components of seasonal influenza vaccines are reviewed frequently (currently biannually) and updated periodically to ensure the continued effectiveness of the vaccines.
