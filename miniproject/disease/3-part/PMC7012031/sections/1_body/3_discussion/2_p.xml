<p>Previously, influenza was not a mandatory reportable disease in Saudi Arabia. The scope of the surveillance system covered all health facilities and was computerized in its early phases with strict active and supportive supervision. Compliance of reporting was questionable in some regions and at different levels, which resulted in under-reporting of suspected cases. The guidelines stated testing all admitted cases for influenza A(H1N1) pdm09; hence the system accommodated all positive influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases and deaths.</p>
