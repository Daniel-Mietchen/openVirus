<p>According to our model, no counties within the 50 states sustained transmission beyond the first winter (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, panel D; 
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 8), although Miami-Dade and Broward counties in Florida sustained transmission as late as February in a fraction of simulations. Only Puerto Rico, Hawaii, and select counties, primarily in Florida and Texas, supported any transmission from the index cases occurring outside of the late spring through early autumn months (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 9, 10). Within the 50 states, only Miami-Dade County had evidence of transmission as early as February, and outbreaks there were limited in size (median 2 cases).
