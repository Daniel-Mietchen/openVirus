<p>Across the United States, when an infectious Zika virus–infected person was introduced during peak 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> abundance for each county (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Figure 2), the model predicted at least minimal transmission (defined as 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>1 transmission event in 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>0.05% of simulations) in 86% of US counties (

 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquito distribution (
