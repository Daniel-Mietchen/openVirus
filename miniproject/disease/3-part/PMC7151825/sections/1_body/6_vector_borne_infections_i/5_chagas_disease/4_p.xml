<p id="p0600">Reactivation of CD in immunocompromised patients has been described, predominantly in the setting of advanced HIV infection, where it commonly affects the central nervous system causing single or multiple space-occupying lesions or a severe meningoencephalitis. Cardiac involvement or worsening of previous cardiomyopathy may also occur [
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Data on CD in rheumatology patients treated with biological therapies or JAK inhibitors remain sparse; however, a case of relapsed CD has been reported in a patient treated with infliximab, although the patient did not develop severe symptoms and relapse was detected via a higher quantifiable PCR result [
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. One case series looked at immunosuppressed patients with chronic CD and included three patients with autoimmune disorders treated with regimens that included biologics. None of these patients suffered a reactivation or severe manifestation of their CD [

Although the effect of biological therapies on the course of CD remains unknown, expert opinion favors screening patients with serological testing prior to treatment if their mothers were born in endemic areas, they have lived in endemic areas for prolonged periods, or they have received a blood transfusion in an endemic country [
