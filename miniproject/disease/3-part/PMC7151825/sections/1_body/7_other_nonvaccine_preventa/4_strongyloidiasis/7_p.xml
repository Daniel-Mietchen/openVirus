<p id="p0710">Diagnosis can be made via stool microscopy for ova, cysts, and parasites and a blood test for strongyloides serology. Hyperinfection may be suspected due to the presence of pulmonary infiltrates on chest X-ray and filariform larvae may be found in bodily fluids, for example on bronchoalveolar lavage. Eosinophilia may be absent [

Treatment of hyperinfection includes ivermectin, reduction of immunosuppression where possible, and supportive care including organ support and antibiotics. An infectious disease specialist should always be consulted in the management of these patients.
