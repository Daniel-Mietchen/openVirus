<p id="p0700">Immunosuppressed patients may develop life-threatening strongyloides hyperinfection syndrome. This can occur when patients with previously unrecognized chronic strongyloidiasis become immunosuppressed or when an already immunosuppressed patient develops acute infection. Hyperinfection syndrome develops due to accelerated autoinfection and typically presents as intestinal or pulmonary failure. Disseminated strongyloidiasis may occur with parasitic spread to any organ including the central nervous and cardiovascular systems. The syndrome has been well documented in patients with human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 infection and patients treated with steroids. Mortality approaches 100% without treatment [
