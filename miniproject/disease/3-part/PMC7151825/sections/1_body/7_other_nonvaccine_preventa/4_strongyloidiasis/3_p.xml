<p id="p0690">Infection is acquired via direct contact with contaminated soil, often when walking barefoot. It is therefore a disease of poor sanitation and poverty. Larvae invade the skin, usually of the feet, and travel via the venous system to the lungs where they are expectorated and swallowed. The larvae then hatch into adult females in the gut. These are able to reproduce asexually and release more eggs into the gastrointestinal tract. Some of these eggs hatch into larvae that are released into the stool, facilitating onward infection. Unlike most other parasites 
 <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> is also able to set up a cycle of autoinfection within its original host. Some of the larvae that hatch in the gut are able to reinvade the intestinal wall, travel to the lungs and begin the cycle again [

 <italic>S. stercoralis</italic> infection is able to persist for many years in the same host. Cases have been reported up to 75 years following exposure [
