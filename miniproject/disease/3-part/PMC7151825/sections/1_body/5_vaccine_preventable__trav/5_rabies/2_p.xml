<p id="p0435">Rabies is an infectious disease caused by neurotropic viruses of the genus 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic>. A total 99% of human cases are caused by rabies virus genotype 1. Dogs are the main vector for human rabies; however, other terrestrial mammals including foxes, monkeys, and cats may also transmit the disease. Rabies is most commonly spread by the bite of an infected animal, although transmission can also occur via scratches or when the saliva of an infected animal comes into contact with broken skin or mucus membranes. Infection does not occur if the skin is intact [
