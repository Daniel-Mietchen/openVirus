<p id="p0495">Human influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal outbreaks of influenza or “flu” worldwide. Influenza A viruses can also cause major global pandemics. Influenza is a predominantly respiratory illness that is self-limiting in most cases; however, severe disease with complications such as pneumonia can occur. Severe cases can be life-threatening or fatal. People at higher risk of severe disease include the elderly, young children, pregnant women, those with certain chronic conditions, and immunosuppressed individuals. Influenza viruses are mainly spread by droplet transmission but may also be transmitted via touching contaminated surfaces.</p>
