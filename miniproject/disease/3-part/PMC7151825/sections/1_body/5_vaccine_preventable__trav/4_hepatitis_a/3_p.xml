<p id="p0425">Different hepatitis A vaccines are available; there is a monovalent vaccine as well as polyvalent vaccines combined with hepatitis B or typhoid. All the vaccines are inactivated and may be safely given to immunosuppressed travelers. As with other vaccinations, there may be an impaired serological response with immunosuppression. In travelers with normal immune function a first vaccine dose provides adequate protection prior to travel. A second booster dose is given at 6–12 months to provide longer-lasting immunity that can last up to 25 years or longer [

In immunosuppressed travelers, studies have shown that one vaccine dose does not reliably result in protection; however, a second dose provides adequate protection in the majority of patients. These travelers should therefore receive two doses of vaccine before travel. Intramuscular immunoglobulin is available and may be considered for those who do not mount a protective serological response [
