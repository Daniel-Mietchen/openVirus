<p id="p0505">Japanese encephalitis (JE) is caused by a flavivirus spread by 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitos. It is endemic in many Asian countries where it is considered a predominantly rural disease. Most infections are asymptomatic or cause a mild febrile illness; however, in less than 1% of cases it can cause severe encephalitis. This has a high case fatality rate and long-term neurological sequelae are common among survivors. Despite being the leading cause of childhood encephalitis in Asia [
