<p id="p0210">Secondary immunodeficiencies are caused by a disease or other environmental factor that impairs the immune response. One such factor may be treatment given to a patient for a medical condition. It may either be the intended consequence of the treatment, for example immunosuppression in transplant recipients to prevent rejection, or a side effect of a treatment given for another reason, for example anti-inflammatory treatments given for autoimmune disease. The exact immune defect and resulting risk of infection depends on the specific immunosuppressive agent used. In order to understand the needs of the immunosuppressed traveler, it is important to understand the basis of their immune defect.</p>
