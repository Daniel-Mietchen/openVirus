<p id="p0245">Glucocorticoids such as prednisolone or prednisone have been used for decades for their anti-inflammatory properties. They diffuse across the cell membrane and bind to the intracellular glucocorticoid receptor. This creates a complex that enters the cell nucleus and influences gene transcription. This mechanism of action means that steroids have a broad range of effects on the immune system in contrast to the more specific effects of the biologic drugs. One major way that glucocorticoids influence immune function is by preventing the access of neutrophils to sites of inflammation [

Importantly, some of the immune effects of the glucocorticoids are dose-dependent, therefore higher doses, &gt;40 mg a day for more than a week or &gt;20 mg a day for over 2 weeks in adults, are more likely to be associated with significant immune deficits. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy is associated with a wide range of bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.
