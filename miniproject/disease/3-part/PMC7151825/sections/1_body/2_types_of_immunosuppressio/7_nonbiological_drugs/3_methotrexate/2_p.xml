<p id="p0250">Methotrexate is another nonbiological therapy used in autoimmune disease. It was first developed as a chemotherapy agent and is known to act as a folate antagonist and inhibit synthesis of purines and pyrimidines.

It is used at low doses for long-term therapy in rheumatoid arthritis unlike in malignancy where it is used at much higher doses.
