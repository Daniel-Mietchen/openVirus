<p>Influenza vaccines are available in different forms: inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). IIVs are produced to protect against three (trivalent) or four (quadrivalent) influenza viruses; whereas LAIVs are produced as quadrivalent only. IIVs can be manufactured in different ways. IIVs can be made from a whole virus that is chemically inactivated, concentrated, and then purified. Further processing can create split virus vaccines, which are treated with detergent to separate the viral envelope and expose the interior viral proteins and subviral elements.

 </sup> Further purification can create subunit vaccines in which the HA protein is enriched. Since the 1970s, most vaccines are split virus or subunit because they have comparable effectiveness with fewer adverse reactions. The split virus and subunit vaccines are less immunogenic in populations that have not been exposed to influenza vaccines; in a seasonal setting, two doses of these vaccines are needed for young children.

 </sup> To improve the immunogenicity in certain populations such as the elderly, a high-dose version of the trivalent vaccine was approved for use in 2010 that has four times the standard HA dose.

 </sup> Adjuvants—substances that increase immune responses to an antigen—can be added to influenza antigens to improve vaccine immunogenicity, particularly for vulnerable populations. An influenza vaccine with MF59 adjuvant, which is a squalene oil-in-water emulsion system, is licensed in the United States, Europe, and some countries in the Asia pacific region including Australia for persons aged 65 years and older who do not have a history of severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its components.

 </sup> A number of adjuvants are used in pandemic influenza vaccines including aluminum salt, MF59, and AS03.
