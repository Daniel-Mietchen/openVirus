<p>Another type of manufacturing process is in development that uses plants to produce vaccines. This process, like the insect cell process above, also uses a virus that encodes for the DNA sequence of a chosen HA. The virus infects the host plant and again both the noninfluenza viral proteins and the selected HA protein are expressed.

 </sup> Very similar to the previous process, the HA is purified from the host cells and this purified HA acts as the relevant influenza component of the vaccine.

 </sup> The production process can produce a vaccine in 5–6 weeks.
