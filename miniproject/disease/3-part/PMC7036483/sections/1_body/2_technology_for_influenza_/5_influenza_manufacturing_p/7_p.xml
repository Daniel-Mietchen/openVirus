 </sup> The WHO Collaborating Centre data for influenza have been analyzed to determine the match of circulating viruses between the 2003 and the 2017–2018 season to selected MDCK-derived and egg-derived viruses, some of which were chosen for the vaccine in the respective season. A retrospective analysis showed that a substantially higher proportion of the MDCK propagated viruses matched the circulating influenza A/H3N2 viruses than the egg-propagated viruses.
