<p>Seasonal influenza outbreaks and epidemics are a regular part of our modern world. Influenza vaccines are important in minimizing the effects of what can be a devastating disease. Although vaccines have been available for many years, the traditional manufacturing process, which relies on fertilized hensâ€™ eggs is logistically complicated and egg-derived manufacturing may encounter extended delays due to the need for a continuous and large supply of eggs. In addition, egg-based vaccines are often affected by egg adaptation (particularly for H3N2) in seed strains, which may lead to a decrease in vaccine effectiveness.</p>
