<p>The new process of cell-based isolation and manufacturing offers some advantages including an improved production process that may allow for faster development and a minimization of egg-adaptation. Studies indicate that viruses produced in a cell-based process more closely match the circulating virus than those produced in an egg-based process, and observational data from the 2017 to 2018 season provides some supportive evidence of potential improved effectiveness. As a result, both cell-based and other nonegg technologies used for the production of influenza vaccines will likely further reduce the burden of disease as investigators continue to search for the holy grail of a universal influenza vaccine.</p>
