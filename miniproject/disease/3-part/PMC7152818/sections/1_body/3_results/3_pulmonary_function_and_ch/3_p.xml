<p id="para0028">A total of 56 A(H7N9) patients underwent pulmonary function testing at follow-up visits. Results of pulmonary function testing for A(H7N9) patients are reported in 
 <xref rid="tbl0002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. A restrictive pattern of lung disease was most prevalent and observed in 38·1% (8/21) of patients at the three-month visit with slow resolution over the follow-up period. An obstructive pattern was noted in 14·3% (3/21) at the three-month visit that generally persisted through 12-months of follow-up, and a mixed pattern was observed from 4·8% (1/21) at the three-month visit to 16·7% (2/12) at the 18-month visit. Abnormal DLCO was detected in 75·0% (9/12) of A(H7N9) patients at the three-month, 57·1% (4/7) at the 18-month, and in all three A(H7N9) patients at the 64-month visits, suggesting persistent impairment in the alveolar diffusion pathway. When pulmonary dysfunction was compared among A(H7N9) patients with and without pneumonia, these were not significantly different by visit duration or types of dysfunction, although ventilation and diffusion dysfunction were more prevalent in pneumonia patients at all follow-up visits (
