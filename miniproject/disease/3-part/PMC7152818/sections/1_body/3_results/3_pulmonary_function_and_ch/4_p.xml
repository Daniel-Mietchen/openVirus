<p id="para0029">A total of 59 A(H7N9) patients underwent chest CT scans at follow-up visits. The CT scan images were assessed for pattern, extent, and distribution of opacities. The predominant chest CT findings at presentation consisted of bilateral opacities, categorized as fibrosis, nodular opacities, pleural thickening, and bullous cysts. Details of chest radiographic and CT findings for A(H7N9) patients are shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl0003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. The most common sequelae of A(H7N9)-related pneumonia were bilateral regions of ground-glass opacities (GGO), nodules, or bullous cysts. The pleurae were involved with small fluid accumulation and later pleural thickening. Fibrosis and pleural thickening were also observed through the 12 to 18-month visits. Representative radiographic findings of four A(H7N9) patients are shown in
