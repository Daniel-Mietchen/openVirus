<p id="para0032">At the end of follow-up, 38Â·5% of A(H7N9) patients had persistent dysfunctional ventilation capacity. Dyspnea assessment and chest auscultation findings improved gradually over 12 months after illness onset. Overall, pulmonary dysfunction appeared to be greater in A(H7N9) patients who were hospitalized with pneumonia than those without pneumonia, although there were no statistically significant differences, perhaps limited by the small sample size. A(H7N9) patients with respiratory failure at hospital admission had increased risk of persistent pulmonary dysfunction.</p>
