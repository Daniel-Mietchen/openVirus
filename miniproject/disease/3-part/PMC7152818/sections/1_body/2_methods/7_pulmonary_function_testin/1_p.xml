<p id="para0020">Lung ventilation and diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO) testing was performed for A(H7N9) survivors during the follow-up period. Spirometry indicators included forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and FEV1 to FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC). Pulmonary function testing results were expressed as percentages of predicted normal values. FEV1, FVC, and DLCO were considered abnormal if they were below 80% of the predicted values, FEV1/FVC was considered abnormal if less than 70% [

 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. If pulmonary function and DLCO testing were within normal ranges, no further testing was performed at the next follow-up visit. Abnormal pulmonary function was interpreted as “restrictive” pattern, “obstructive” pattern or “mixed dysfunction” pattern. Restrictive dysfunction was defined as a reduced FVC with a normal FEV1/FVC; obstructive dysfunction was defined as a reduced FEV1 with a low FEV1/FVC
