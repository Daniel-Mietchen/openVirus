<p>Generally, local lytic TVEC infection in tumor cells leads to the release of various proteins, such as interferons, chemokines, danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP), and pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP). These can provide more favorable surroundings for stimulation of anti-tumor immune responses [

Cancer cell lysis discharges tumor-associated neoantigens for processing by dendritic cells, which are activated by TVEC-encoded GMâ€“CSF. This could lead to stimulation of anti-tumor CD8+ T-cell responses against unrecognized antigens and this effect has been clinically demonstrated [
