<p>In attempts to improve efficacy and to provide tumor targeting, SFV particles were encapsulated in liposomes [

Intravenous administration of encapsulated SFV particles expressing IL-12 (LipoVIL12) enhanced IL-12 plasma levels by 10-fold in a phase I clinical trial in kidney carcinoma and melanoma patients. The encapsulation enhanced tumor targeting as well as prevented recognition by the host immune system, which allowed re-administration without evoking immune responses against SFV [

Additional clinical trials have been conducted with alphaviruses for various cancer types and viral diseases, demonstrating good safety of the immunization process, although further dose optimization is still required. This represents a promising aspect for further development of alphavirus applications in melanoma treatment.
