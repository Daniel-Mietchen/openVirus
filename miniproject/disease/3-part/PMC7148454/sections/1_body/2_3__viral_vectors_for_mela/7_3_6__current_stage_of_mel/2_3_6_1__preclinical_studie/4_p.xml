<p>RNA-based delivery has also proven efficient in vaccine development [
 <xref rid="B58-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. It has been reported that a single intramuscular injection of 0.1 µg SFV-LacZ replicon RNA generated antigen-specific antibody and CD8+ T cell responses in vaccinated animals [

In another approach, a SIN RNA replicon expressing the rabies virus glycoprotein gene was applied for immunization of mice using only 10 µg of SIN-Rab-G RNA [
