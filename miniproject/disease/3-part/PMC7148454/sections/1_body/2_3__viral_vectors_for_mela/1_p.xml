<p>As previously described, a broad range of oncolytic viruses have been evaluated for cancer gene therapy [
 <xref rid="B107-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>]. The specific targeting and killing of tumor cells and the simultaneous stimulation of the immune system have made oncolytic viruses attractive delivery vehicles [

 <xref rid="B109-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B110-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. This dual action promotes tumor regression as well as the induction of immune responses through innate and adaptive components. On the other hand, naturally occurring, ubiquitous, non-enveloped dsRNA viruses have shown generally mild infection in humans, and specific replication and cytopathogenicity in transformed cells, which possess active Ras signaling pathways [

 <xref rid="B112-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. Their specificity for Ras transformed cells and their relatively non-pathogenic nature in humans make them attractive anticancer therapy candidates [
