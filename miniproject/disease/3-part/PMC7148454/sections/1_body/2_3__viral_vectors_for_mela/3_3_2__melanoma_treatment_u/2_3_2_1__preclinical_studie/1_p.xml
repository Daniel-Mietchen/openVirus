<p>Although retroviruses have demonstrated potential for treating chronic diseases such as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in children [
 <xref rid="B126-biomedicines-08-00060" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>], fewer studies have been conducted for cancer. For instance, recombinant retrovirus vectors expressing GMâ€“CSF and IL-4 showed high-level expression in cultured primary glioma cells, which lasted for 14 days and could therefore present an attractive approach for immunotherapy [

For instance, a lentivirus carrying the EGFP reporter gene provided long-term expression in DU145 and PC3 human prostate cell lines and in vivo in pre-established and orthotopic tumors [

In another study, a lentivirus vector expressing RNAi sequences targeting the MAT2B gene, the regulatory subunit of methionine adenosyltransferase resulted in suppressed growth, colony formation and induced apoptosis in A375 and Mel-RM malignant melanoma cell lines, and affected tumor growth in a xenograft model in vivo [

Moreover, antisense non-coding mitochondrial RNA (ASncmtRNAs) was downregulated by a lentivirus vector expressing short hairpin RNA (shRNA), which induced apoptosis in murine B16F10 and human A375 melanoma cell lines, significantly reduced B16F10 tumor growth in vivo, and reduced the number of lung metastases in a tail vein assay [
