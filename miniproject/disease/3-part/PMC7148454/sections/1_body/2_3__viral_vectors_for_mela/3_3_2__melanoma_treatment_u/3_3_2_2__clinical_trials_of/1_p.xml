<p>Related to lentivirus-based clinical trials, 30 children and adults with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were treated with a lentiviral vector-based chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T), targeting CD19 (CTL019), which resulted in sustained remission with a 6-month event-free survival rate of 67% and an overall survival rate of 78% [

In preparation for lentivirus-based clinical trials, monocyte-derived conventional dendritic cells (ConvDCs) were transduced using a tricistronic lentivirus vector, expressing GM–CSF, IL-4 and the melanoma antigen tyrosine-related protein 2 (TRP2), to overcome the difficulties in manufacturing and potency of ConvDCs [

The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated with monocytes from five advanced melanoma patients indicating that a simpler GMP-compliant method for manufacturing individualized DC vaccines with a higher specificity against melanoma is possible. In another approach, to improve ex vivo manufacturing of engineered T cells, isolated human CD8+ T cells from healthy donors were transduced with a lentivirus vector expressing the gp100-specific tumor antigen-specific T cell receptor (TCR) in the presence of a novel chemical lentiviral transduction enhancer (Lentiboost) [

It was demonstrated that antigen-specific secretion of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) occurred in the transduced cells and significant cytotoxicity was detected in the antigen-positive tumor cells, showing the potential of lentivirus-based cancer immunotherapy.
