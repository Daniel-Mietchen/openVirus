<p>In summary, oncolytic viruses have proven powerful in several preclinical tumor models and clinical studies. They have provided suppression of tumor growth and regression as well as increased quality of life in patients (

The range of oncolytic viruses (adenoviruses, AAV, HSV, Coxsackievirus, NDV, retroviruses, etc.) allows modifications related to expression, packaging and host range tropism. However, further improvements in dose optimization and therapeutic efficacy are needed, especially in the area of melanoma therapy. Today, many virus vectors have demonstrated promising efficacy in combination with standard melanoma therapy, including immunotherapy, either in the form of MEK and BRAF inhibitors or in combination with chemotherapy (dacarbazine and cisplatin). It seems that no single-virus vector system shows superiority and, therefore, development of different expression systems in parallel is recommended. In conclusion, advances in gene therapy and the approval of several drugs will contribute to virus-based therapy potentially becoming a key asset in modern clinical applications, including related to malignant melanoma.
