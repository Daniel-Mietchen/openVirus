<p>Culture medium from the infected cells was collected and centrifuged at 17,000× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 1 min at room temperature to remove the cell debris. The cleared culture medium supernatant was then mixed with 0.3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich). Ten-fold serial dilutions of culture medium was prepared and each dilution was used as inoculum to infect the confluent monolayers of MDCK cells in a 48-well culture plate (Corning) for 1 h at 35 °C. After removing the viral inoculum, cells were overlaid with serum-free MEM supplemented with 1 µg/mL TPCK-trypsin and 0.8% Avicel (RC-581, FMC Biopolymer), and incubated back at 35 °C for 18 to 24 h. The overlay was removed from the cells and cells were fixed with 4% formalin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 20 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then stained with mouse anti-NP antibody (1:1000; #MAB8251, Millipore) followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:1000; #626520, Life Technologies). Finally, plaques were visualized by adding the TrueBlue peroxidase substrate (KPL).
