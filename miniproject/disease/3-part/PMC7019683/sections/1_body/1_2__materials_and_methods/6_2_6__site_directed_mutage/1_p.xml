<p>The Asp → Glu substitution in each putative caspase cleavage motif was done by a single point mutation (GAT → GAA or GAC → GAG) using the site-directed ligase-independent mutagenesis (SLIM) approach described elsewhere [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Briefly, four primers (two long, containing the desired mutation and two short) were designed for creating each mutation. A PCR reaction was then performed using these primers, GFP-cortactin plasmid template and AccuPrime Pfx DNA polymerase (Life Technologies). The PCR product was then subjected to a series of reactions: DpnI (New England Biolabs) digestion, denaturation, and hybridization. Finally, the hybridized PCR product was transformed to 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5α cells, colonies were screened, and point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The correct plasmids were then further amplified, purified, and used for ectopic expression followed by western blotting screening.
