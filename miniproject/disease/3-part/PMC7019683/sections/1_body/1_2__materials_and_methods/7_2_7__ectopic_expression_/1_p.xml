<p>The plasmids were delivered to cells by reverse transfection using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies) by following the manufacturers’ suggested protocol. Briefly, plasmid DNA (2 µg) and Lipofectamine 2000 (3 µL) were diluted separately in an OptiMEM I medium (Life Technologies), mixed together, and incubated for at least 15 min at room temperature. The plasmid DNA-Lipofectamine 2000 complex was then mixed with cell suspension which was then transferred to a cell culture plate. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 48 h before further processing or infection. </p>
