  <p>The depletion of caspase-3 rescued cortactin polypeptide degradation in IAV-infected cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) A549 cells were transfected with 10 nM of control (Ctrl), caspase-3 (Cas3), caspase-6 (Cas6), or caspase-7 (Cas7) siRNA for 72 h. Cells were then infected with WSN at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3.0. After 24 h, total cell lysates of uninfected (UNI) and infected (INF) cells were prepared, and cortactin, actin, and viral NP polypeptides were detected by WB. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The cortactin and actin bands were quantified and normalized with actin as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>B. Then, the normalized level of cortactin in the respective uninfected sample was considered 100% to determine its level in the corresponding infected sample. (
   <bold>C</bold>) The caspase-3, -6, or -7 mRNA levels in A549 cells transfected with control or caspase-3, -6 or -7 siRNA, were detected and normalized with actin mRNA level as described in 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00087-f001">Figure 1</xref>C. Then, the normalized level of caspase-3, -6, or -7 mRNA in control siRNA transfected cells was considered 100% to determine their levels in caspase-3, -6, or -7 siRNA transfected cells, respectively. Error bar represents the means Â± standard errors of the means of three biological replicates. The asterisks represent 
   <italic>p</italic>-values mentioned in the text calculated by ANOVA and indicate the significant differences in means; ns: Nonsignificant.
