 <caption>
  <p>WB profile of the ectopically expressed GFP-cortactin polypeptide. MDCK cells were transfected with plasmid expressing the GFP-cortactin fusion for 48 h and subsequently infected with WSN at a MOI of 3.0. After 24 h, total cell lysates of uninfected (UNI) and infected (INF) cells were prepared, and cortactin polypeptide was detected by WB using either anti-cortactin antibody (
   <bold>A</bold>) or anti-GFP antibody (
   <bold>B</bold>). Exp: ectopically expressed cortactin; End: endogenously expressed cortactin. Letters a, b, c, and d indicate cleaved cortactin fragments.
