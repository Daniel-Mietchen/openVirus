<p>We used the A549 and CEF cell lines to examine H7N9 virus infection, since these are commonly cell model systems to examine influenza virus infection in human and avian cell backgrounds respectively. A549 and CEF cells were infected with influenza A virus subtype H7N9 using an MOI of 5 and at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 hpi the virus-infected cells were stained with anti-NP and examined by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy (

 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At 4 hpi, we observed a low level of anti-NP staining in the virus-infected A549 cells, which appeared to be localized in the nucleus. The anti-NP staining intensity increased up to 10 hpi, with greater than 95 % of the cells showing anti-NP staining. Anti-NP staining in virus-infected CEF cells was only detected from 6 hpi onwards, but at 10 hpi greater than 95% of the cells showed anti-NP staining. At 10 hpi anti-NP staining was observed in both the nucleus area and the cytoplasm, and the staining was consistent with efficient nuclear export of the RNP complexes in both A549 and CEF cells infected with the H7N9 virus. The H7N9 virus was either untreated or irradiated with UV light, and then used to infect A549 and MDCK cells. MDCK cells are susceptible to all influenza virus subtypes and are commonly used to study influenza virus infection. The anti-NP stained cells were examined using IF microscopy and anti-NP staining was only observed in the cells infected with the untreated virus (

The absence of anti-NP staining confirmed the inactivation of the H7N9 virus by UV irradiation, and indicated that this would be an appropriate control with which to examine the host response to infection using the microarray analysis. Our analysis also indicated that a time-point of infection at 2 and 10 hpi would be suitable times to compare the host cell response to H7N9 virus infection at early and late times of infection in these cells. In addition, it suggested that 10 hpi would be suitable time to compare host responses in these cell lines with other representative avian influenza subtypes.
