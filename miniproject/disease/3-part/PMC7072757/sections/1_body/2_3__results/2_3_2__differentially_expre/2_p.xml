<p>We selected specific host genes in cytokine expression and interferon (IFN) signaling (IFNβ1, IL28a, CCL5), and IFN-stimulated expression [2′,5′-oligoadenylate synthase (OAS2), Myxovirus 1 (MX1), RSAD2 (radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2) that are commonly up-regulated in influenza virus-infected cells for further study. Their FC in gene expression using microarray analysis was confirmed by using qPCR targeting the respective host gene (normalization to the housekeeping gene, EF) (

Although immunoblot analysis revealed reduced levels of the Signal Transducer Activator of Transcription 1 (STAT1) protein in H7N9 virus-infected cells, the presence of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) in H7N9 virus-infected A549 cells was consistent with the induction of IFN expression. The pSTAT1 protein was not detected in mock-infection or infection with UV-treated virus. Taken together, our findings indicated that infection of A549 cells with the H7N9 virus can cause significant global gene expression changes, with the most significant changes observed at 10 hpi.
