<p>We used microarray analysis to investigate the effect of H7N9 virus infection on each host cell transcriptome by comparing the host response with representative strains of LPAI virus and human virus subtypes. The H7N9 virus infection was able to induce a significant down-regulation of gene expression in A549 cells at 10 hpi, similar to what was observed with the human strain, H1N1-WSN (

In contrast, the H7N9 virus induced a distinct expression pattern in CEF cells at 10 hpi, compared to other human or avian virus subtypes. The findings in the current study showed that H7N9 virus could elicit a unique and stronger cytokine host gene expression response in A549 and CEF cells that is significantly different from the human H1N1 WSN strain and the LPAI H5 viruses (

The H7N9 virus host response profile resembled that of HPAI viruses, such as the H5N1 subtype, but not LPAI H9N2 subtype, and suggested that the cytokine storm could explain the reason behind the severity of human infection caused by the H7N9 virus infection.
