<p>Influenza A viruses can bind to 2 types of host receptors which are linked to sialic acid (NeuAc): human-type NeuAc α2,6 galactose are found predominantly on mammalian cells and avian-type NeuAc α2,6 galactose on avian cells; whereas, the canine cell line contains both types of receptors. H7N9 virus can bind to both types of receptors found in Human Airway Epithelial (HAE) cells [

 <xref rid="B28-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The HAE cells from the lower respiratory tract possess mainly α-2,6- and α-2,3-linked NeuAc galactose receptors. Our studies showed that the H7N9 virus was able to infect all three cell lines from different origins, canine (MDCK), avian (CEF), and human (A549). This finding confirmed the findings that the H7N9 virus can bind to both types of sialic acid receptors [

Our findings suggested that the H7N9 virus behaved like an avian virus, despite the evidence that this H7N9 Anhui strain was isolated from an infected patient during the first wave of the epidemic in 2013. However, as the avian α-2,3-linked galactose NeuAc receptors were also found in the human bronchiolar and alveolar cells of the lower respiratory tract in human, the preference of H7N9 to the avian receptors also suggested that the H7N9 virus could bind to the lower respiratory tract to inflict severe manifestation in the same manner as that reported for the H5N1 virus [
