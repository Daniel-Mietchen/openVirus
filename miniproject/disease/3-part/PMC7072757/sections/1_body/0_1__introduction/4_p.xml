<p>Our previous studies on different influenza A virus subtypes with human lung airway epithelial (A549) cells and chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells have suggested virus-specific replication characteristics and anti-virus signaling [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we infected both A549 and CEF cells with the H7N9 virus, and performed a system-based approach to compare the infected host transcriptome with other previously reported influenza A virus subtypes. Bioinformatics tools were applied to annotate probes and human ortholog mapping (

 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>) as described [
 <xref rid="B21-cells-09-00448" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Ortholog mapping of host genes identified significant down-regulation of several pathways between H7N9 and another influenza A virus subtypes, in infected A549 and CEF cells. This agreed with our previous findings that the replication characteristic of different influenza A virus subtypes in infected A549 or CEF cells, are unique and virus-specific.
