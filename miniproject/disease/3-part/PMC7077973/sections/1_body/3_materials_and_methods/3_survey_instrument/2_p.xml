<p>The first domain included questions regarding demographics and engagement in health services, while the second addressed HIV/STI status and testing history. Third, a sexual behavior domain incorporated the HIV Incidence Risk Index for men who have sex with men (HIRI-MSM), a validated tool for quantifying HIV risk in gbMSM.

 </sup> The fourth domain addressed knowledge and opinions related to HIV/STI risk and prevention strategies. The fifth section incorporated validated psychometric scales to screen for depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-2 score ≥4),
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </sup> problem alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-C score ≥4),
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 </sup> and problem substance use (Drug Use Disorders Identification Test score ≥25)
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 </sup>; these cutpoints are associated with sensitivities and specificities of 0.62 and 0.95,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
 </sup> 0.86 and 0.72,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
 </sup> and 0.90 and 0.88,
 <sup>
  <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
 </sup> respectively. We included these scales because prior literature has demonstrated mental health and substance use syndemics to be associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition among gbMSM.

 </sup> The final domain included a Discrete Choice Experiment assessing participant preferences for sexual health services; results of this component will be reported separately.
