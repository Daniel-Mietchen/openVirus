<p>Indeed, continuous disease surveillance, along with realistic epidemiological modelling (which needs the engagement of local communities; Fischer et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), could facilitate choosing the best context-specific strategy, including vaccination frequency, spatial setting of vaccinations, target species, and quick and timely diagnosis. In this regard, either based upon immunological response or direct antigen detection, several specific and sensitive laboratory methods with rapid turn-around are available for confirmation of PPRV infection (Santhamani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0061" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Mahapatra et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In fact, accurate and advanced disease diagnostic techniques and vaccine constructs targeting the prevalent strain are essential for effective disease control.
