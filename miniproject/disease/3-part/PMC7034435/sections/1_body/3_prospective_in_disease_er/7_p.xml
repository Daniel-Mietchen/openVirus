<p>Disease surveillance programs need to be further extended and strengthened to include usual and unusual hosts. Awareness of disease in large ruminants and unusual hosts should be imparted to farmers, particularly those living in disease-enzootic regions. In this regard, particular attention should be given by national and international authorities (such as the FAO/OIE) under the programme on Global Framework for the Progressive Control of Transboundary Animal Diseases (GF-TADs). This will enable better comprehension coordination among local veterinary authorities and the subsequent implementation of disease control/eradication programmes.</p>
