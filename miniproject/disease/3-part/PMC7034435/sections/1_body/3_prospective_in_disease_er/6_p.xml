<p>To explore the impact of PPR on nature conservation, in terms of the involvement of a wide range of species, a regular serological and clinical surveillance of PPR in all susceptible hosts should be employed. Regarding this subject, the FAO and OIE are currently working on strategies to make progress in international control under the PPR Global Eradication Programme (GEP-PPR), over the coming years and have set the goal of eradicating the disease by 2030. This review article will undeniably assist all scientific communities working on disease eradication and towards sustainable improvement in economy by livestock production. Additionally, these results will strengthen the livelihood resilience of rural societies and benefit food and nutrition security. Taken together, future regional and global programmes for the control of PPR will need to consider and resolve the issues raised here, and wildlife and livestock managers or authorities in PPR endemic countries may need to encourage the protective vaccination of small and large ruminants surrounding wild populations.</p>
