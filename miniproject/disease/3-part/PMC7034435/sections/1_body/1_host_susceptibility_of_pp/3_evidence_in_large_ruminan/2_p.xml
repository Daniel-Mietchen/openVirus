<p>Several studies have reported seroconversion to PPRV in cattle worldwide, and water buffalo and yaks in Asia (see 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for an overview). To the best of our knowledge, only one report of clinical PPRV infection in large ruminants exists: an outbreak in domestic water buffalo (
 <italic>Bubalus bubalis</italic>) in India (Govindarajan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). In this case, the clinical presentation was characterised by fever, conjunctival congestion, hypersalivation and depression, resembling what is seen in sheep and goats. Morbidity was roughly 13% with a very high case fatality rate (96%) that was not age-related (Govindarajan et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). The disease was experimentally reproducible in buffalo calves, thus confirming the ability of PPRV to induce clinical disease in this species.
