<p>It is suggested that PPRV has the potential to switch hosts as is postulated in other morbilliviruses (De Swart et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Until now, there is a paucity of data related to the clinical infection and transmission of PPRV in unusual hosts including pigs, dogs and Asiatic lion. An experimental investigation revealed a subclinical infection of PPRV in pigs with no shedding and transmission of viruses to a native host (Nawathe and Taylor 
 <xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">1979</xref>). On the other hand, recent experimental investigations highlighted the epidemiological role of pig and wild boar in inter- and intra-species transmission of PPRV (Schulz et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0062" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). As a virus amplifier, pigs pose potential health risks for other susceptible species and may create hurdles to the eradication of the disease, particularly in disease-endemic countries where free-roaming pigs and communal grazing of sheep and goats are common. Future investigations are imperative to explore the possible role of pigs in virus transmission to domestic small and large ruminants, wild ungulates and other susceptible species. Owing to persistent transhumance and pastoralism among susceptible species, the spill-over of PPRV has utmost significance in cross-species transmission, which leads to constraints in disease eradication.
