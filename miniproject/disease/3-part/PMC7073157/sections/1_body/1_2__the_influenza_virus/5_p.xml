<p>Structurally, the influenza virion (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01511-f001">Figure 1</xref>) has an envelope formed by a lipid bilayer embedded with the glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) which allows the virus to bind to a host cell. M2 is a transmembrane protein that forms proton channels in the viral envelope [
 <xref rid="B32-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The viral matrix protein M1 is membrane associated and forms a rigid matrix layer under the viral envelope. It mediates the encapsidation of RNA-nucleoprotein cores into the membrane envelope. Inside the virion particle, the viral proteins are organized into super-coiled viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) comprising the eight, negative sense, single-stranded ribonucleic acids (RNAs) segments plus a trimeric assembly, the viral polymerase (VP), which includes the polymerase basic protein 1 (PB1), polymerase basic protein 2 (PB2), and polymerase acidic protein (PA). These vRNPs are the central elements in the virus life cycle which are complemented by the host cellular processes [
