<p>As previously mentioned, influenza A viruses are divided into subtypes based on two proteins on the surface of the virus: hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Human influenza viruses are named according to their type, subtype, strain number, place, and year of isolation. According to their HA and NA antigenic properties, virus subtypes are named as a combination of 18 different HA subtypes and 11 different NA subtypes, such as HxNy [
