<p>Among the different types of influenza, influenza A viruses (IAV) are the most pathogenic for humans. Thus, IAV are the main target for the development of seasonal vaccines to control morbidity and mortality in at-risk populations. IAV have a vast array of hosts including poultry, swine, horses, aquatic mammals, bats, cats, dogs, and birds. Adding to the broad range of species that IAV infect, through antigenic drift and antigenic shift, IAV can acquire the ability to surpass the species barrier. This can allow the emergence of new strains that become a threat to humans [
