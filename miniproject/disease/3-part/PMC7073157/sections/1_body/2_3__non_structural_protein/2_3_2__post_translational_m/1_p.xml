<p>Several post-translational modifications (PTMs) have been identified in NS1, in particular, phosphorylation, SUMOylation, and ISGylation [
 <xref rid="B54-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. NS1 features several phosphorylation sites, namely Thr215, Ser42, and Ser48. From a functional point of view, these PTMs remain to be fully understood. Although phosphorylation in general does not appear to greatly affect viral replication and it is strain dependent, Ser42 phosphorylation makes binding of dsRNA more difficult, and thereby decreases viral replication rates [

 <xref rid="B57-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Recent studies showed that phosphorylation may also occur at Thr49, which inhibits NS1â€™s association to TRIM25 and decreases NS1 ability to interfere with the IFN cascade [

 <xref rid="B59-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Some H5N1 subtype strains display a mutation in Asp92 to Glu92 which reduces the strength of the hydrogen bonding interaction between Glu92 Ser195 and Thr197. These two residues (Ser195 and Thr197) are then available to further interact or be phosphorylated which translates into a more virulent strain [
 <xref rid="B42-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Moreover, Thr215 can also be phosphorylated and, since, this is nuclear localization signal 2 (NLS2) region, it could lead to disruption of NS1 nuclear location [
