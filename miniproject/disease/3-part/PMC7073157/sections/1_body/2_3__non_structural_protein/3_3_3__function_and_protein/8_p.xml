<p>For a more holistic understanding of the multitude of virus–host interactions, data intensive approaches such as interactomics will play a role. Shapira and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B103-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>] found that NS1 promotes up-regulation of 45 virus-specific regulated genes (VSRGs) from which 24 have an important role in viral replication or the host’s IFN response. DeChassey and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B104-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] got an extensive interactome of both NS1 and NS2, identifying more than 560 interactions and 33 proteins that interacted only with NS1. These intricate interaction network maps help to delineate novel strategies to use NS1 as a potential therapeutic target. Raman and coworkers [
 <xref rid="B105-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>] developed an interactome of NS1 in pigs which could be evaluated for human applicability. They identified 192 proteins (92 already documented), some were new interactors like heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein particles (hnRNPs) C, K and U, interleukin enhancer-binding factor 3 (ILF3), and ATP-dependent RNA helicase (DDX1), while others like PABPI, DEAx box helicase 9 (DHX9), DDX21, and Crk-like protein L (CrkL) got confirmation in this study. Recently, another interactome analysis of NS1 showed that, in addition to all the PPIs already described, NS1 is involved in the splicing the pre-mRNA through binding to the pre-mRNA-processing factor 19 (PRP19). This new interaction should be further studied in order to assess its relevance for viral pathogenicity, since the same study showed that cells without endogenous PRP19 also showed decreased IAV replication [
