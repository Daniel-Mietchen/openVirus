<p>Additionally, NS1 also attenuates the expression of host genes by interfering with the pre-mRNA processing machinery [
 <xref rid="B82-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. NS1 binds CPSF30 preventing polyadenylation of the host’s IFN pre-mRNA, leading to its accumulation in the nucleus and inhibiting expression of the IFN genes or IFN-related genes [
 <xref rid="B83-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The polyadenylation of the viral mRNAs is not affected since it relies on the viral polymerase [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Binding to CPSF30 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-21-01511-f006">Figure 6</xref>) also enables inhibition of mRNA transport from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and mRNA splicing [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. It was suggested that the build-up of pre-mRNA in the nucleus is a source for cap snatching by the viral polymerase [
 <xref rid="B86-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. NS1 has a globally hydrophobic pocket comprising residues Lys110, Ile117, Ile119, Gln121, Val180, Gly183, Gly184 and Trp187, where NS1 binds to two (F2 and F3) of the five zinc fingers of CPSF30 [
 <xref rid="B40-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Outside of this binding pocket, two residues, Phe103 and Met106, maintain the stability of the interaction [
 <xref rid="B87-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. As a consequence of the binding to CPSF30, NS1’s Trp187 is inaccessible, blocking NS1’s ED-ED dimerization [
 <xref rid="B60-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Residues in the CTT mediate PABPII binding [
 <xref rid="B88-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], preventing poly-adenine tail extension of mRNAs, and thus preventing nuclear export [
 <xref rid="B89-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Other nuclear mRNA export factors, such as NXF1, p15, Rae1, E1B-AP5, and Nup98, have also been reported to bind to NS1 [
 <xref rid="B90-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Taking into account all these interactions, it becomes clear the relevance of NS1 in inhibiting the antiviral response of the host cell, as well as, the interference on the effective communication between neighboring cells.
