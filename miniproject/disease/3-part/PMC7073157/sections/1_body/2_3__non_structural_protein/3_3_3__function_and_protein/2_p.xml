<p>Hindering of the IFN induction cell signaling is critical in influenza’s infection since production of cytokines like type I interferons is the hosts innate immune prime response to withhold the infection [
 <xref rid="B55-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. IFN induction starts by activation of several processes in a cascade and NS1 counteracts them in different ways. RIG-I is active after identification of viral dsRNA leading to ubiquitination of TRIM 25 (tripartite motif-containing protein 25) [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. As a consequence of this event, RIG-I constitutes an important sensor of influenza’s infection [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. RIG-I binds to NS1 in the same RBD highly conserved site comprising amino acids Arg38 and Lys41, where dsRNA also binds, as depicted in

 <xref rid="B74-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Although, RIG-I and NS1 form a complex observable by immunoprecipitation, their structural relationship remains unclear [

 <xref rid="B72-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Jureka and coworkers recently presented results that show the importance of NS1 Arg21 in RIG-I’s activation and that its mutation to glutamine inhibits RIG-I binding. Nonetheless, this point mutation has no effect on TRIM25 nor dsRNA binding [
