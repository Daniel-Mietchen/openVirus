<p>Although NS1 establishes interactions with multiple molecular partners, the interaction between NS1 and dsRNA is one of the most explored. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy calculations have been used to understand the molecular basis of dsRNA recognition by NS1 [
 <xref rid="B153-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Free energy calculations can be performed by combining molecular mechanics with Poissonâˆ’Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) or generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) calculations. This approach allows the estimation of ligand-binding affinities by combining molecular mechanics and continuum solvation models [
