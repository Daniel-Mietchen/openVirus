<p>Rational discovery and design of new lead compounds for therapy development is significantly helped by the knowledge of the high-resolution three-dimensional structure of the therapeutic target. In the case of NS1, several structures of the full-length protein and its functional domains (RBD and ED) are available at the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [
 <xref rid="B134-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Among the 44 NS1 structures available to date (February 2020), several are in complex with different molecular partnersâ€”dsRNA or other proteins. This multitude of examples helps in the identification of NS1 main interaction sites and thus in the discovery and design of inhibitors of these interactions. Both experimental and in silico methods may be used to identify suitable ligands for NS1 by blocking NS1 activity or preventing some key interaction, and thus allowing the identification of potential lead compounds and drug candidates [
