<p>Virtual screenings have also helped in the discovery of hit compounds. CPSF30 is involved in direct pre-mRNA processing and has its activity altered due to NS1 [
 <xref rid="B149-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>]. On the basis of this assumption, a study was conducted using molecular docking and molecular dynamics, starting with more than 30,000 initial compounds [
 <xref rid="B150-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. This study allowed the selection of two compounds capable of inhibiting the activity of NS1 related to CPSF30. Another study performed a docking-based screening of 200,000 compounds with AUTODOCK [
 <xref rid="B151-ijms-21-01511" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. The authors picked two compounds to proceed out of 17 hits with positive outcome. These compounds displayed the ability to inhibit the activation of an antiviral pathway by interfering with NS1â€™s interaction with dsRNA [
