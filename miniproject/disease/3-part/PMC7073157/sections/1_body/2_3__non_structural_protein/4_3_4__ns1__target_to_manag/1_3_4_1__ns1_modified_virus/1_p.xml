<p>NS1 has been related to increased pathogenicity and virulence of influenza. Viruses that fail to express NS1 may cause less severe symptoms and show decreased ability to proliferate. For example, the IFN cascade is not as affected and will perform normally under lack of NS1 expression in the host’s cells. NS gene truncations or deletions translate into attenuated viruses [

Following this study, serum and nasal wash analysis for IgA revealed that it can neutralize influenza’s viruses not only from the subtype H1N1, but also from H3N2 and H5N1 subtypes. IgG, on the other hand, is only effective on the subtype tested, H1N1 [
