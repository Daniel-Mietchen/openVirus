<p>Non-structural protein 1 (NS1), the subject of this review, plays a key role in influenza virus biology and mechanisms of infection through a multitude of molecular interaction partners, host cell activities, and structural plasticity or polymorphism. These multiple functions are mediated by multiple molecular interactions and various binding spots or pockets that could be targeted to develop novel antiviral therapies. NS1-directed antivirals could eventually be used in monotherapy or as part of combination therapies allowing synergistic effects against resistant strains [
