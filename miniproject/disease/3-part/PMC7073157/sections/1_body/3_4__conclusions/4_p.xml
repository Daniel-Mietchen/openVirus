<p>Progresses in the structural and functional characterization of influenza’s NS1 should pave the way for a more holistic understanding of this protein, and thus chart new paths for more efficacious ways of combating influenza outbreaks. Lead and tool compounds directed to NS1 have been identified, allowing validation of the protein as a potential therapeutic target. The coming years will see the discovery of new compounds and eventually the progress to the clinical setting of inhibitors of influenza’s NS1.</p>
