<p>Both BRSV and BCoV can be easily transmitted between herds, and epidemics with rapid spread between herds within a region have been reported (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Modes of transmission are either directly through live animal contact (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) or indirectly via contaminated personnel or utensils brought between herds (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Herds with limited or no purchase of cattle may also experience outbreaks of BRD, most likely due to introduction of infectious agents by indirect routes, and/or that the causative pathogen was already circulating in the herd (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). Indirect transmission depends upon the stability of the viruses outside the host, which is generally short for enveloped RNA viruses such as BRSV and BCoV. However, there are uncertainties regarding the stability of both viruses. Under laboratory conditions, BCoV remained infective for 2 weeks under cool and moist conditions (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>). For both BRSV and BCoV, temporary carriage of virus on fomites has been shown: infective BCoV was detected on fomites (clothes, boots and equipment) 24 h after exposure to virus-shedding calves, while for BRSV, only viral RNA, and no infectious virus, was detected (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). The same study found that personnel in contact with virus-shedding calves carried both BCoV and BRSV RNA on nasal mucosa, but none were positive for infective virions. It was therefore concluded that transmission of virus via human nasal mucosa is likely limited (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Airborne transmission for BRSV and BCoV has been shown indoors (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>) but is most likely restricted to droplet and aerosol spread. Airborne transmission across longer distances, i.e., between farms, has not been described and is likely of limited importance. Transmission of virus from other species to cattle has never been demonstrated and is likely to be of minor importance under normal circumstances.
