<p>In a longitudinal study, repeated sampling of dairy herds showed that 32–42% of the herds changed their BRSV antibody status from positive to negative based on pooled calf sera during a 6-month time period (
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Similar results have been found for both BRSV and BCoV in Swedish dairy herds (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). This indicates rapid self-clearance of virus from herds without specific interventions. Molecular epidemiology supports this view—virus varies both temporally and spatially between outbreaks, suggesting that outbreaks are caused by introduction of new virus rather than through reactivation or the existence of carrier animals (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>–
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). This implies that with the current herd size and management conditions in the Nordic countries, herds can self-clear from virus if new introduction is avoided.
