<p>The herd-sensitivity and herd-specificity of a diagnostic test is influenced by the basic performance of the test, the within-herd prevalence and the number of animals tested. Misclassification can arise as a result of imperfect test performance or changes in status after testing. Imperfect test performance could also be due to a suboptimal test-regime with regard to which, and how many, animals are tested.</p>
