<p>The recently launched Norwegian BRSV and BCoV control program is presented as an example of a national level control program based on systematic improvement of external biosecurity at the herd level. The program contains no vaccination or mass-treatment. A brief description of cattle production in Norway is included for context, followed by an outline of the chosen method for herd classification and the applied biosecurity measures.</p>
