<p>Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a worldwide health concern in cattle and is one of the most common diseases in calves and young stock in all production systems. The disease is multifactorial and develops in complex interaction between factors associated with the host, the pathogens and the environment. The existing preventive measures therefore include a wide range of strategies. Despite advances of newer and better therapeutic and preventive medications, as well as efforts to improve management and optimize the environment to prevent BRD, the morbidity and mortality rates have not declined. A recent review of evolving views on BRD control measures concludes that blanket vaccination and mass treatment provides inconstant control for BRD and highlights the need to reappraise the use of these measures (
