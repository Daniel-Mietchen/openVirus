<p>Stakeholders and producers are obviously concerned with the costs related to a control program; is it worth it? The financial losses due to BRSV and BCoV in Norway were analyzed by the industry prior to onset of the program. This included the available knowledge of the viruses' effect on BRD and winter dysentery, and the costs of running a control program were weighted against the impact (not published). It was concluded that controlling BRSV and BCoV would be cost-efficient and should be prioritized. There are several uncertainties in such an analysis. In a study from France, the authors assumed that a reduction of BRD incidence between 20 and 50% was a realistic outcome to expect from improvements in farm biosecurity (
