<p>Generally, the requirements for initiating a control program will differ according to biological factors (species affected, zoonotic potential, reservoir, population structure and basic characteristics of the infectious agents etc.), possible control measures (movement control, stampingâ€“out, isolation, vaccination etc.), availability of technical tools (diagnostics tests, treatment) and socioeconomic considerations (

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>) concluded that for successful control of bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), three elements are necessary: basic biosecurity, elimination of virus from infected herds and monitoring to evaluate progress and detect new infections/reinfections. Despite considerable biological differences between BVDV and BRSV/BCoV, the same three same elements are also fundamental in the control of BRSV and BCoV.
