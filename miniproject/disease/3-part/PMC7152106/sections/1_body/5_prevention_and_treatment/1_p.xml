<p id="p0245">Yearly vaccines against influenza virus are produced twice a year for the Northern and Southern Hemispheres containing the predominant lineages of H3N2, H1N1, and B viruses. The use in LMICs is limited due to the high cost and the need for annual revaccination. A live oral Adenovirus serotype 4 and 7 vaccine is used for military recruits in the USA, but is not in use for the general population or outside of the USA.</p>
