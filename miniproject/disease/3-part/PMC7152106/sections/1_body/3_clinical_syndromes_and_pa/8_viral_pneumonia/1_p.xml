<p id="p0210">Development of primary viral pneumonia is defined by dysfunctional gas exchange accompanying inflammation of the lung parenchyma, usually resulting in radiographic changes. There is acute generalized illness and a dry cough; rhinitis and conjunctivitis may be present. An increased respiratory rate is an early feature, with cyanosis developing in very severe disease. Viruses reach the small airways either through continuous spread or by inhalation of aerosols. Mucosal infection leads to destruction of epithelial cells, submucosal hyperemia, edema of the airways, and hemorrhaging. Additional cellular infiltration and fibrin depositions may further compromise respiratory volume and gas exchange surface.</p>
