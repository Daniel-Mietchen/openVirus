<p id="p0205">Bronchiolitis is a distinct syndrome of infants and young children. The major symptom is wheezing, accompanied by flaring of the nostrils, use of accessory respiratory muscles, and cyanosis in more severe cases. Direct viral infection of the bronchiolar epithelial cells followed by increased mucus secretion results in the formation of dense plugs of debris that cause impediment of expiratory airflow. Children may experience repeated episodes of wheezing after recovery. Associations with development of asthma and a causative role of the immune system in pathogenesis have been suggested.</p>
