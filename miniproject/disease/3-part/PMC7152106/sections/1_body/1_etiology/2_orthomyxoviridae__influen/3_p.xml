<p id="p0070">New lineages of influenza A virus emerge every few decades, resulting in global pandemics with varying severity due to the absence of immunity in the human population. New human viruses have emerged through antigenic drift in avian viruses (1918 Spanish flu: H1N1, 40–100 million deaths) or through reassortment of gene segments in animal hosts infected with two different viruses (antigenic shift; 1957 Asian flu: H2N2, 2 million deaths; 1968 Hong Kong flu: H3N2, 500,000 deaths). After such an introduction, the new virus becomes the dominant circulating lineage. Two notable exceptions were the reintroduction of H1N1 in the human population in 1977, possibly caused by an escape from a research laboratory, and the introduction in 2009 of a novel lineage of H1N1 influenza A virus, most likely from pigs, in North America, causing a relatively mild pandemic (with an estimated 100,000–400,000 deaths) and generating massive attention from both the public health communities and the general public and replacing only the 1977 H1N1 lineage. Currently, H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 influenza A virus are co-circulating with influenza B viruses and continue to cause yearly seasonal epidemics worldwide. The timing, extent, and direction of either “drift” or “shift” have so far been completely unpredictable. With no animal reservoirs to provide such new antigens, shift does not occur in influenza B and thus major epidemics do not occur (
