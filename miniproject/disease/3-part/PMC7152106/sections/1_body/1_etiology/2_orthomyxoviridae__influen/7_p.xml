<p id="p0090">Despite their worldwide presence for many years and the huge humanâ€“animal interface in Asia, no efficient human-to-human transmission episodes have been recorded for either. However, the continuous evolution and reassortment in these viruses (e.g., H5N8 viruses have spread globally within a few years among birds, without human cases, and H5N6 has become dominant among birds in parts of Asia and infected 19 humans in China, 6 of whom died) remains a cause for concern and warrants continuous monitoring and surveillance of these viruses in domestic poultry and wild birds.
