<p id="p0100">Infections are very common, and virtually all children will have been infected with RSV by 2 years of age and by hMPV at 5 years of age. Immunity is incomplete, although reinfections tend to be milder. Severe disease is common from RSV and hMPV in the first year of life. Reinfection with RSV or parainfluenza viruses is also a common cause of pneumonia in elderly and immunocompromised patients.</p>
