<p id="p0050">The most important etiologic agents of severe LRTI are bacteria such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections (RTIs) and in bronchiolitis in children, whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia, especially in adults. Despite this, RTIs—because of the difficulty of making a rapid diagnosis of the etiologic agent—are often treated with antibiotics and are responsible for a large part of inappropriate and appropriate use of antibiotics in humans. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably, and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral RTI.
