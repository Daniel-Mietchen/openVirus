<p id="p0045">Childhood pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in children under 5 and has an incidence of 0.29 episodes per child-year in LMICs and 0.05 in high-income countries. This translates into 156 million new episodes annually worldwide, of which 151 million are in LMICs. Pneumonia killed 920,136 children under 5 in 2015, accounting for 16% of all deaths of children under 5. On the other side of the age spectrum, pneumonia is also a major cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, with an annual incidence for non-institutionalized patients at 25 to 44 per 1000, up to four times that of patients under 65.</p>
