<p>Species introduction can alter virus communities through the introduction of new pathogens and though introduced hosts providing reservoirs for existing pathogens [

 <italic>Varroa destructor,</italic> affected virus spread and infection levels in honey bees [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] but also caused pathogen shifts in other pollinators and bee predators, such as wasps [

 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. In New Zealand, the invasive Argentine ant (
 <italic>Linepithema humile</italic>) has been hypothesized to form such a reservoir for honey bee viruses [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Three bee viruses have been identified in this ant species [
