<p>Coinfections and interactions between viral species within the host can play a key factor in the epidemiology and evolution of viruses [
 <xref rid="B67-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Many insects that we analysed tested positive for multiple viruses. Interactions within hosts and, for example, the order in which pathogens are acquired may have a large positive or negative effect on a secondary infection [

 <xref rid="B69-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In some cases, infection with one virus can prevent infection with another: Consequently, this makes the infection beneficial if it is less damaging or virulent than the other [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Thereby interactions can be strain specific and affect parasite evolution and genetic diversity within virus populations [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00358" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Future work is needed to understand co-infections and interactions among viruses in addition to the commonly studied hostâ€“parasite interactions [
