<p>The phylogenetic analysis showed that DWV sequences found in New Zealand in this study clustered within the DWV-A clade and formed a monophyletic group with a sequence from 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> from New Zealand (MF623172) and 
 <italic>Vespa carbo</italic> from Italy (KY909333) (posterior probability (pp) = 0.539, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00358-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This group is dated to the year 2013 (95% highest posterior density (hdp) 2010–2016). However, when not including the sampling date in the phylogeny, sequences derived in this study clustered with a broader group of European DWV sequences (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Figure S2</xref>). Two DWV strains from Pakistan (KP734706, KP734705) represented a relatively old clade (pp = 1) that was estimated to have separated from other DWV sequences around 1977 (95% hdp = 1965–1989) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00358-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The DWV phylogeny further split into two sister groups (pp = 0.95, dated to 1986, 95% hdp = 1979–1994), one from Asia and Europe, which includes the DWV-A variant Kakugo virus, and the other with strains from Europe, North and South America, and New Zealand (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Figure S2</xref>, non-dated phylogeny). Within this group, samples from New Zealand all occupy a different clade than samples from the Americas, including Hawaii, and both share these with Europe (pp = 1, dated to 1999, 95% hdp = 1998–2001, 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00358-f002">Figure 2</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00358">Figure S2</xref>, non-dated phylogeny). Interestingly the two strains collected from Australia (KP734699, KP734632) did not cluster together or with strains from New Zealand.
