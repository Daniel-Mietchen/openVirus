Ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps emit mainly 254&#x02009;nm ultraviolet light C (UVC) with about 10% power of Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) light at 185&#x02009;nm. The combination of UVC and VUV can inactivate airborne pathogens by disrupting the genetic materials or generation of reactive oxygen species, respectively. In this study, inactivation of common bacteria including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922 (<italic>E. coli</italic>), Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> (ESBL), Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), and that of influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2 under the radiation from ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps was examined. Log reduction values at different treatment durations were determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In vitro tests were carried out. Various bacterium and virus suspensions were added onto nitrocellulose filter papers and subjected to the illumination from ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps. The extents of pathogen inactivation at different illumination times were investigated by conducting a series of experiments with increasing duration of illumination. log10 reduction in CFU/ml and reduction at log10(TCID<sub>50</sub>) were respectively measured for bacteria and viruses. The disinfection effectiveness of this type of lamps against the pathogens under the environment with a moderate barrier to light was therefore evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">Ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamp successfully inactivated these human pathogens. Nevertheless, among these pathogens, disinfection of MTB required more intense treatment. In the best tested situation, 3-log10 inactivation of pathogens can be achieved with &#x02264;10&#x02009;min of VUV treatment except MTB which needed about 20&#x02009;min. This demonstrated the high resistance against UV disinfection of MTB.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Following the criteria that valid germicidal results can be reflected with 3-log10 inactivation for bacteria, 4-log10 inactivation for viruses and 5-log10 inactivation for MTB, most of the bacteria required &#x02264;10&#x02009;min of VUV treatment, 20&#x02009;min for the influenza viruses while MTB needed about 30&#x02009;min VUV treatment.

It has been demonstrated that poor IAQ could jeopardize health and well-being, which in turn will affect the quality of work and ultimately lower the productivity of workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">One major source of indoor air pollution is the presence of micro-organisms, which could cause even more serious problems than some organic and inorganic air contaminants. This is particularly more phenomenal in cases of inadequate ventilation, as the condensation in ventilation system can act as a breeding ground for harmful bacteria which are dispensed through the ventilation ducts. Environmental airborne bacteria such as <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>Streptomyces albus</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and complex populations of micro-organisms within normal flora were all etiological agents to hypersensitivity pulmonary diseases. Several additional infectious agents such as <italic>Legionella pneumophila</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB) pose even more grave concerns to the IAQ, as these airborne pathogenic bacteria are known to cause severe illness in humans. Meanwhile, viruses such as influenza virus were originally thought to be only transmitted from person to person via aerosols of body fluids. However, in a recent study conducted by Weistein et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], the production of infectious droplet nuclei of diameter&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;5&#x02009;&#x003bc;m could remain suspended and disseminated by air current to infect a susceptible host. A good and reliable disinfection system, therefore, is required to disinfect the airborne microorganisms in order to maintain good IAQ.</p><p id="Par27">Adopting vacuum-UV (VUV) lamps, for instance, the ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps, can be an effective mean of disinfecting the airborne microorganisms. Many existing infection control products use low pressure mercury vapor lamps as light source. This is a source of high energy photons with low cost. Recently, pulsed xenon light source technology emitting a broad spectrum (200-300&#x02009;nm) of UV light is an emerging alternative to low pressure mercury vapor lamps that allows much faster surface disinfection because of the high peak power [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, the pulsed nature of this technology would limit its use in continuous air disinfection system. Electrical discharge of low pressure mercury vapor mainly emits 254&#x02009;nm ultraviolet light C (UVC) and 185&#x02009;nm VUV light. However, existing products mainly use the lamps with doped quartz envelope that absorbs 185&#x02009;nm photons to prevent the formation of potentially dangerous ozone. Nevertheless, ozone is also a powerful disinfectant and the valuable disinfection opportunity of the 185&#x02009;nm VUV light becomes waste heat.</p><p id="Par28">Ozone is an issue that bothers on safety if it remains in the output of an air treatment system. However, ozone can be easily destroyed before leaving the air treatment system if proper catalyst is adopted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Also, some photocatalysts can utilize and destroy ozone in addition to its photocatalytic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The 254&#x02009;nm UVC light adopted in conventional infection control products can disinfect the illuminated objects since the 254&#x02009;nm radiation can disrupt the genetic materials of airborne pathogens and render them inviable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].VUV has an even stronger ionizing power than UVC light and can generate high concentration reactive species such as ozone and OH radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In other words, apart from direct illumination, VUV can inactivate bacterial growth by the radicals generated during VUV irradiation. Therefore, adopting VUV lamps can enhance the air disinfection capability of air cleaning systems. A previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] conducted by Huang et al. demonstrated that 64% toluene removal with VUV irradiation alone and the use of photocatalyst enhanced the toluene removal from 64 to 82%. The experiment adopting UVC lamps and the use of photocatalyst removed only 14% of toluene. The result demonstrated that VUV light could be an effective measure for chemical degradation in ventilation systems. When it comes to disinfection, extensive research has been carried out on UVC light and effective destruction of both airborne [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and other human pathogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] has been shown. Nevertheless, disinfection using VUV light has attracted very little attention. This would be caused by the relative low prevalence of VUV light sources. Kim et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] found that the disinfection time required to attain the same extent of inactivation of aerosolized MS2 bacteriophage, using low pressure mercury vapor lamps with both 254&#x02009;nm UVC and 185&#x02009;nm VUV output was much shorter than the lamps with 254&#x02009;nm UVC only. The disinfection time of ozone only (without UV) process at ozone concentrations equivalent to the ozone level generated by the mercury vapor lamps was also significantly faster than using lamps with 254&#x02009;nm emission only. Besides, Huang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] reported the inactivation of <italic>E coli</italic> by low pressure mercury vapor lamps. Additionally, some researchers tested the disinfection of water with VUV light and it was reported that the efficiency was quite low compared to disinfection with UVC light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The reason is due to the low penetration power of VUV light in water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Moreover, the disinfection of human pathogens by VUV light was rarely reported. In our opinion, only Christofi et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] reported the disinfection of the microbial films of 3 types of pathogenic bacteria using ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps. Therefore, the effect of VUV light against human pathogens is yet to be elucidated. In this study, we evaluated the germicidal effect of VUV light on common bacteria including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> ATCC25922 (<italic>E. coli</italic>), Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing <italic>E. coli</italic> (ESBL), Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA) and <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (MTB), and that on influenza viruses H1N1 and H3N2. Influenza viruses and MTB are inherent airborne pathogens while <italic>E. coli</italic> ATCC25922 is always the first indicator organism to monitor disinfection efficacy. The more drug resistant ESBL and MRSA were chosen as examples to monitor disinfection efficacy on human pathogens. Some suspensions of these bacteria and viruses were absorbed into nitrocellulose filter papers during the experiments and the disinfection under the environment with a moderate barrier to light was evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>UV irradiation</title><p id="Par30">To evaluate the biocidal effect of VUV light, bacteria and viruses were irradiated with a pair of hot cathode low pressure mercury vapor lamps.

It was only after 30&#x02009;min of disinfection that the required 5-log10 reduction of <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> viable bacterial load could be achieved regardless of the bacterial concentration.

A good and reliable disinfection system is a must to maintain good indoor air quality. Vacuum-UV lamps with ozone production were found to be effective for inactivating various human pathogens. With the best tested situation, 3-log10 inactivation of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing <italic>E. coli</italic>, Methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and seasonal influenza viruses can be achieved with &#x02264;10&#x02009;min of VUV treatment except <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> which needed about 20&#x02009;min. This demonstrated the high resistance against UV disinfection of MTB. Valid germicidal results, reflected with 3-log10 inactivation for bacteria, 4-log10 inactivation for viruses and 5-log10 inactivation for MTB, can be obtained with all tested pathogens. The duration of VUV treatment required for valid germicidal result of most of the bacteria was &#x02264;10&#x02009;min while MTB needed about 30&#x02009;min. 20&#x02009;min was adequate for the influenza viruses. This indicated that VUV light is an effective approach against different environmental and pathogenic microorganisms, and can potentially be used for air-purifying units in future ventilation systems.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec22"><p>
