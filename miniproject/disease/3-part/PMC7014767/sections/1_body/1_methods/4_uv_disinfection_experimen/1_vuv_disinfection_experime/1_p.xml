<p id="Par39">To analyze the bactericidal effect of VUV light, 2 mL of bacterial suspension was added onto the nitrocellulose filter and irradiated by VUV for 2, 5, 10 and 15 min at a distance of 5 cm at 25 °C. This distance was selected based on the consideration of the time of disinfection and temperature rise of the agar during the course of experiments. As each experiment was carried out inside a Level-2 Biosafety Cabinet, the 2 mL added suspension was carefully adjusted so that the filter remained moisted at the end of irradiation as dryness will reduce the viable count recovered from the filter.</p>
