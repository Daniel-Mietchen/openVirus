<p id="Par43">The illuminated bacterial suspension and nitrocellulose filter were vigorously washed by 10 mL PBS, and the suspension was serially diluted (10
 <sup>0</sup>–10
 <sup>− 4</sup>). A total of 100 μL of each diluted bacterial suspension was spread onto selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar supplemented with 10% oleic albumin dextrose (OADC), 200,000 unit/L Polymyxin B, 50 mg/L Carbenicillin, 10 mg/L Amphotericin B and 20 mg/L Trimethoprim Lactate. Bacterial inoculum without VUV illumination was used as MTB growth control and to determine the original viable bacterial count. Each test set was conducted in triplicate.
