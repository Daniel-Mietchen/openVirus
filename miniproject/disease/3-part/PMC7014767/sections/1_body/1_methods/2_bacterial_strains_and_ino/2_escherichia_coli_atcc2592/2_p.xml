 <italic>E. coli</italic> and MRSA were inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton agar (BD Bioscience, CA, USA) plates and incubated overnight at 37 °C to yield single colonies. Overnight cultures were prepared by inoculating single colonies of each bacterial strain into Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) broth (BD Bioscience, CA, USA). Bacterial suspension at early exponential phase was inoculated into BHI broth at 37 °C for 2 h. The concentration of the bacterial suspension was then visually adjusted to McFarland standard 0.5. Test suspension was prepared by diluting the 0.5 McFarland standard inoculum by 10-fold and 100-fold. Actual bacterial count was calculated by back titration of the inoculum suspension. Purity of MRSA was checked by ChromID® MRSA agar plate (BioMérieux SA, France) and the purities of 
 <italic>E.coli</italic> and ESBL-producing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> were confirmed by MacConkey agar plate (Oxoid™, Thermo Scientific, Massachusetts, United States).
