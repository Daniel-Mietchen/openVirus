<p id="Par35">MTB was first inoculated onto non-selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar (BD Bioscience, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% Oleic acid-Albumin-Dextrose-Catalase (OADC) and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until single colonies were obtained. Mycobacterial colonies were resuspended into glass-bead Phospate-Buffered Saline with 0.1% Tween 80. Inoculum was vortexed for 30 s to homogenize the bacterial suspension. Bacterial concentration was then adjusted to optical density at 600 nm = 0.15–0.17, which is equivalent to 0.5 McFarland standard. Two test suspensions were prepared, which were 0.5 McFarland standard inoculum and 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland suspensions. Actual MTB count was calculated by back titration of the inoculum suspension on Middlebrook 7H11 agar. Purity of MTB was checked by culturing the inoculums on blood agar to ensure no fungal and bacterial contamination, and on non-selective Middlebrook 7H11 agar to ensure there was no contamination by nontuberculous mycobacteria.
