<p id="Par54">Meanwhile for viral disinfection, test results were considered acceptable when the viral-induced cytotoxic effect is indistinguishable from test agent-induced cytotoxic effects. VUV light disinfection time against viruses would be considered sufficient when a minimum of 3-log10 reduction in viral-induced cytotoxicity in titer was achieved. Therefore, the infectious viruses recovered from the positive controls must be ≥4-log10 for valid viricidal test results. To determine the disinfection efficacy of VUV light against seasonal influenza viruses, two common influenza A viruses, H3N2 and H1N1, causing seasonal epidemics were used. In the current study, initial viral loads for both H1N1 and H3N2, presented in the Additional file

 <sub>50</sub>/mL) and 5.1 ± 0.8 log10(TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL), respectively.
