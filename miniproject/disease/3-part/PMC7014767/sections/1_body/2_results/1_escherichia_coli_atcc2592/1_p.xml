 <italic>E. coli</italic> in 10-fold diluted and 100-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculums across triplicate experiment sets, presented in the Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> as Expt. 1 and Expt. 2, were (1.9 ± 0.6) × 10
 <sup>7</sup> CFU/mL and (2.4 ± 0.2) × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL, respectively. At 10 min VUV light disinfection, the device was able to produce at least 6-log10 reduction in viable bacterial count for 100-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculum. However, 10 min VUV light disinfection for 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculum can only achieve a borderline to insufficient bactericidal activity with an average 2.4-log10 growth reduction and 99.57% inhibition of bacterial growth (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b). The results suggested that VUV light disinfection is much more effective against lower 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial concentration. At 15 min disinfection, complete inhibition of bacterial growth was also observed in 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculum, resulting in at least 6-log10 growth reduction (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b).
