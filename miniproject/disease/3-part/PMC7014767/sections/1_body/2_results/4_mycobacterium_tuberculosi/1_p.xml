<p id="Par51">As defined in previous sections, disinfection time against bacteria was considered sufficient when a minimum 3-log10 reduction of viable bacterial count was observed. For mycobactericidal activity, a 5-log10 reduction in viable bacterial load is required due to the highly infectious nature of MTB. In other words, a minimum of 5-log10 viable bacterial load would be required for a valid experimental set. The average bacterial concentration for McFarland standard 0.5 MTB inoculum was only (3–5) × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL according to our previous experiments (data not shown). When the bacterial inoculum was diluted by 100-fold, the bacterial concentration would only be around 10
 <sup>4</sup> CFU/mL. The bacterial load could be too low and it was incapable of illustrating 5-log10 growth reduction. The experiment was therefore conducted with a higher bacterial concentration and more detailed disinfection time as compared to the tests of other bacteria. 0.5 McFarland standard and 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard inoculums were used and irradiated by VUV for 10, 20, 30 and 45 min. Initial bacterial counts for 0.5 McFarland standard and the 10-fold diluted 0.5 McFarland standard MTB inoculums were (4.4 ± 1.7) × 10
 <sup>6</sup> CFU/mL and (1.2 ± 0.2) × 10
 <sup>5</sup> CFU/mL, respectively, presented in the Additional file
