<p id="Par53">In the present study, we have demonstrated that VUV light disinfection can achieve complete inactivation of MTB growth after 30 min disinfection regardless of the bacterial concentration. Meanwhile at 20 min, VUV light disinfection can only result in a minimum of 3-log10 reduction in bacterial count, which is much longer when compared to the
