<p id="Par27">Adopting vacuum-UV (VUV) lamps, for instance, the ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps, can be an effective mean of disinfecting the airborne microorganisms. Many existing infection control products use low pressure mercury vapor lamps as light source. This is a source of high energy photons with low cost. Recently, pulsed xenon light source technology emitting a broad spectrum (200-300 nm) of UV light is an emerging alternative to low pressure mercury vapor lamps that allows much faster surface disinfection because of the high peak power [

Electrical discharge of low pressure mercury vapor mainly emits 254 nm ultraviolet light C (UVC) and 185 nm VUV light. However, existing products mainly use the lamps with doped quartz envelope that absorbs 185 nm photons to prevent the formation of potentially dangerous ozone. Nevertheless, ozone is also a powerful disinfectant and the valuable disinfection opportunity of the 185 nm VUV light becomes waste heat.
