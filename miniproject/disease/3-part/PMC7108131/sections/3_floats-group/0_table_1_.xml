    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assessment of confidence in estimates of clinical outcomes</td>
    <td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Heterogeneity in patient outcomes between or within outbreaks creates uncertainty for power calculations and will affect selection of a statistical design for a trial. Spurious heterogeneity may occur due to random error in small cohorts, or represent ascertainment, lead-time, measurement, or follow-up bias. Real heterogeneity can occur due to improvements in care over an outbreak, pathogen evolution, or changes in host susceptibility and vulnerability but should be adjusted for.</td>
