<p>However, due to the very nature of the epidemic-prone infectious diseases that appear in the WHO list of priority diseases, evaluation in clinical studies is challenging, not least because the epidemiology is unpredictable but also because the pathogenesis and natural history of many of these diseases are not well defined. For example, during the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic, case fatality rate (CFR) estimates varied widely from 0 to 13 500 per 100 000 laboratory-confirmed infections, with a heterogeneity of 99.97% (using

A therapeutic trial designed with patient survival as a primary outcome measure would have grossly misjudged the required sample size if the trial was designed using the wrong CFR. Therapeutic trials for the prevention of congenital Zika syndrome will be hindered by the absence of consistently used criteria to define the outcome of congenital malformations [

For Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, a lack of systematic biological sampling means that disease pathophysiology and factors associated with more severe disease and viral clearance (a commonly used secondary outcome measure) are not well understood [
