<p>It is important to monitor antigenic variation among different EV-A71 genogroups for vaccine development. Therefore, we further selected 33 sera collected from seropositive children aged 6 to 24 months to measure cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against three EV-A71 viruses (A/BrCr/1970, B5/HCMC-E452/2013 and C4a/HCM82/VNM/11). Since subgenotype C4a viruses predominantly circulated in 2011 and 2012, these seropositive young children were likely infected with the subgenotype C4a viruses. The geometric mean titers (GMT) of antibody titers and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008124.g001">Fig 1</xref>, GMT (95% CI) of neutralizing antibodies against the B5, A and C4a viruses were 7.72 (95%CI = 7.22–8.21), 7.06 (95% CI: 6.47–7.66), and 6.81 (95% CI: 6.15–7.47) after log
 <sub>2</sub> transformation, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008124.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Overall, no significant antigenic variation could be detected among these three viruses using post-infection sera collected from children infected with subgenotype C4a viruses.
