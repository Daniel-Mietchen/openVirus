<p>Serum neutralizing antibody against subgenotype C4a virus (viral strain: C4a/HCM82/VNM/11, accession code: KC222964) was measured to determine status of EV-A71 infection following standard procedures. RD cells and 100 TCID50 of virus titer were employed for measuring neutralizing antibody titers. Each serum was tested with three replicates. The highest serum dilution which could inhibit more than 50% of wells with cytopathological effect observed under microscope was assigned as neutralizing antibody titer. The procedure of neutralizing antibody tests was described previously [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For interpreting cross-reactive serum neutralizing antibody responses, it is better to select children who are only infected by one EV-A71 genotype. The predominant EV-A71 genotype/subgenotype in HCMC was C4 in 2010â€“2012 and shifted to B5 in early 2013. Therefore, cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against three EV-A71 viruses (A/BrCr/1970, B5/HCMC-E452/2013 and C4a/HCM82/VNM/11) were measured using sera collected from seropositive children aged 6 to 24 months. These seropositive children were very likely only infected by EV-A71 C4a viruses during 2011 and 2012.
