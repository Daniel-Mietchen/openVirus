<p id="Par46">Over the 6 years period, the overall percent positive for medically attended influenza cases were 20% (1166/5715). The percent positive for ILI and SARI case were 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289), respectively. This finding is relatively higher than 16.2% posetivity rate in most of African countries and 18% positivity rate in eastern African countries as reported by WHO during 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Whereas, this shows higher compared to the influenza positivity rate from ILI samples in Niger (12%) and Gabon (11%), and lower compared to 23.3% posetivity rate in Madagascar [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The influenza positivity rate for SARI samples was 2.83% which was low compared to findings in South Africa and China which reported 8 and 6% respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In addition, the presented finding was lower in comparison with 16.5 and 20.2% influenza virus detection rate among SARI cases reported in Eastern Mediterranean Region and Vietnam [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The variation if the findings might be due to the difference in accuracy of detection of cases at the sentinel sites, the timing of sampling, specimen quality and handling approach, effectiveness of the diagnostic testing in different settings. In contrast, it might be due to the true variation in circulating influenza viruses in different geographical areas as reported by different countries.
