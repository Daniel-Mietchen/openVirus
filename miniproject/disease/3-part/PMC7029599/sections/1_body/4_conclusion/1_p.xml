<p id="Par52">Influenza like illness has significant morbidity in Ethiopia, and that it is disproportionally distributed by age. The majority of medically attended influenza positive cases were influenza type A and higher number of it were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) and Influenza-A (H1N1) pdm2009. The incidence rate of influenza found to be higher in the age group of 5–14 years and 15- 44 years. Incidence rate of Seasonal influenza has two peak seasons in a period from October–December and from April–June. The rate of influenza is significant, warranting a response from government (public health agencies) to prevent, detect, and treat influenza in the name of national health security. It could be useful to policy makers to consider influenza seasonality when determining timing, vaccine composition, and target age groups for influenza vaccination campaigns. Improving the surveillance system could help further define populations at risk for influenza.</p>
