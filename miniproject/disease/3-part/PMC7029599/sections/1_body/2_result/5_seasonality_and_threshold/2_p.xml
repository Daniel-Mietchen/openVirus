<p id="Par44">The epidemic season mean start lies on week 42 (October) and the mean end lies week 2 (December) of the year. The highest threshold was recorded by the year 2016/17 (R = 8.2, r = 032) followed by 2014/15 (R = 7.9, r = 0.37) and 2012/13 (R = 7.5, r = 0.43). The average epidemic lengths might last for 11–12 weeks. The weekly epidemic threshold of influenza ranged in a Incidence rate of 2.5 (minimum threshold) to 7.66 (Very high threshold) per 100,000 population in the catchment area [Mathew correlation coefficient “r” of 3.4 with 0.42 sensitivity rate and 0.67 positive predictive value], Figs.
