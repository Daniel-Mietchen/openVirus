<p id="Par41">The overall proportion of laboratory confirmed influenza positive medically-attended ILI cases among patients presented to the sentinel sites (health facility) seeking medical care for any kind of illness (total admission rate) were 0.82% (824.6 per 100, 000 total admitted patients [95%CI; 44.39, 1604.79]).The mean annual proportion was 0.16% (160.04 per 100, 000 of total admitted patients). The higher influenza positive case proportion was recorded in 2013 by 0.26% (R = 261.7; 95%CI; 6.57, 516.76] followed by an influenza positive case proportion of 0.2% (R = 191.1 in 2014 [95% CI; 48.35, 333.95] per 100,000 population of total admission (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, below). Medically attended influenza positive case proportion were high (2.5%) in the age group between 5 and 14 years of age [R = 2496.1, 95% CI; 1715.92, 3276.32] followed by 1% in the age group of 15–44 [R = 1009.0, 95% CI; 228.80, 1789.20] per 100,000 of total admitted patients (Table
