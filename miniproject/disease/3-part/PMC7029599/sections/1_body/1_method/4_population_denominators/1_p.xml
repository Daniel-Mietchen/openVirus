<p id="Par26">The total admitted patient in each sentinel sites for health care service and the population in the lower administrative level where the sentinel sites are located (district/woreda population) was applied as a denominator to calculate the medically attended ILI positive case proportion and incidence rate. The total admitted population was obtained from the weekly aggregated data collected from the registration log book for all patients seeking any medical service in each health facilities and used as a denominator population to calculate the influenza positive case proportion of ILI and SARI associated influenza patients. Age- and year-specific total population denominators were obtained from projections of the 2007 census data for Ethiopia reported by Central Statistical Authority [CSA, 2007]. The midyear population size were applied for calculation of the Incidence All estimates were obtained overall and within the age categories of: &lt; 1 years, 1–4 years, 5–14 years, 15–44 years and &gt; 44 years of age. This age category has different from WHO age category of 0 to &lt; 2 years, 2 to &lt; 5 years, 5 to &lt; 15 years, 15 to &lt; 50 years, 50 to &lt; 65. The variation in age category applied in this manuscript was done by considering the availability of population denominator data from central statistical authority.</p>
