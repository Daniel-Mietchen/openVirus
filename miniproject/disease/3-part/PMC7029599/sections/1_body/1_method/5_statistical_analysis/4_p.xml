<p id="Par30">Weekly trend of seasonal influenza with in the 7 year period was applied for seasonality and predicted threshold was done by applying the “Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)” using R-Studio version 3.4.3. As initial step, the weekly trend of medically attended influenza positive cases were done using excel v-13. Then the weekly Incidence rate of medically attended influenza like illness was for each year in the surveillance period (2012–2017) was applied. Since Ethiopia is located in the Northern hemisphere (4 degree); the Incidence rate on week 40 was used as a starting period and week 20 as the end period. The seasonality and MEM model was extracted from the analysis result on the R-Studio. This includes the epidemic threshold, high and very high threshold, starting and ending season of the epidemics including the goodness and intensity parameters.</p>
