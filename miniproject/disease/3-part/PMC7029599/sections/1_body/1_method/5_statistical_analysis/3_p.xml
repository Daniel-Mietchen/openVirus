<p id="Par29">The estimated medically attended influenza positive ILI case proportion was calculated by taking the influenza (ILI and SARI) positive cases divided by the total admission (cumulative from eight sentinel sites) extracted from the weekly aggregated data. The estimated medically attended influenza like illness incidence rate was calculated by taking the influenza positive cases divided by the cumulative population of the lower administrative level population size where each sentinel sites were located and multiplied by a constant of 100,000. The Incidence rate was calculated for each year of the surveillance period and the cumulative Incidence rate was calculated by taking the cumulative influenza positive cases (2012â€“2017) divided by the mid-year population. Incidence rates were expressed per 100,000 population.</p>
