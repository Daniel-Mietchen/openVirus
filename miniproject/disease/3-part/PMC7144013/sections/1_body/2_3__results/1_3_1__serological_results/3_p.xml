<p>In the univariate logistic regression analysis, no association was found between animal species and the results obtained in serum or transudate (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The 1:10 dilution of the liver transudate showed the best agreement with serum, based on the kappa coefficient (Îº = 0.630) (
