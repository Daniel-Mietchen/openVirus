<p>HEV belongs to the Orthohepevirus genus and the 
 <italic>Hepeviridae</italic> family, and it is classified into eight genotypes according to the genetic sequence [
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Genotypes 1 and 2 infect humans exclusively, are endemic in developing countries, and appear in epidemic forms [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These genotypes are mainly transmitted by the fecal-oral route, through consumption of contaminated water. Genotypes 3 and 4 are zoonotic, affecting humans and several animal species around the world. They are responsible for autochthonous and sporadic infections, and they are the main cause of hepatitis E infections in industrialized countries [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Genotype 3 has been detected in a wide variety of animals such as horses, mongooses, rats, rabbits, cows, dogs, cats, chickens, and red deer. Genotype 4, in contrast, affects pigs, wild boars, and donkeys nearly exclusively, and it is restricted to Asia [

 <xref rid="B12-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Transmission of these genotypes occurs mainly through the consumption of raw or undercooked meat or liver products from its main host, the pig, but also from wild boars and deer [

 <xref rid="B14-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Human populations that maintain close contact with animals show higher hepatitis E seroprevalence [

 <xref rid="B17-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Non-animal transmission routes have also been described for these genotypes, including organ transplantation, blood transfusion [

 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. More recently, genotypes 5 and 6 have been described in wild boars and genotypes 7 and 8 in camelids in Asia [
