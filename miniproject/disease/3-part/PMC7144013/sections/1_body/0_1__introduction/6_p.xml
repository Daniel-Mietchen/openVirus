<p>The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) technique is the main diagnostic method to perform HEV surveillance studies, and many commercial and ’in-house’ kits have been described [

 <xref rid="B46-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Serum samples are typically used to assay anti-HEV antibodies, although meat juice and body cavity transudate have also been used in a few studies [

To detect the presence of HEV RNA, several reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) techniques have been described, with the method proposed by Jothikumar et al. in 2006, one of the most frequently used because of its high specificity and sensitivity [

 <xref rid="B50-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Samples most frequently used for RT-PCR detection are feces, liver, serum, muscle, semen, and food products (e.g., sausage, meat). Feces and liver are the matrices of choice since the virus can be detected in serum only for a short time [

For field prevalence hepatitis E studies, the use of RT-qPCR cannot always be affordable (technically and economically) due to the number of samples to be tested. In addition, even for seroprevalence studies, optimal serum samples are sometimes difficult to obtain and even not possible, particularly in the case of wild boar hunts, where a long period of time can pass between animal death and sampling. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of liver transudate as an alternative matrix for the detection of HEV-antibodies using a commercial ELISA kit, as well as for the detection of HEV RNA by RT-qPCR.
