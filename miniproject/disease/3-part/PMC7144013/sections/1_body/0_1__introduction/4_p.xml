<p>Genotype 3 was first identified from a pig in the USA in 1997 when it was shown to be related both antigenically and genetically to human HEV [

 <xref rid="B37-microorganisms-08-00450" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]: one review found seroprevalences of 30–93% at the farm level (overall HEV prevalence of 10–100%) and 8–93% at the population level (overall HEV prevalence of 1–89%). These wide ranges likely reflect variation in several factors such as farming practices, biosecurity measures, or the number of pigs, and sows on the farm [
