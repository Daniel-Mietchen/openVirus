<p>Only 13 serum and four liver transudate samples out of 58 were RT-qPCR positive, and only three samples were RT-qPCR-positive for both matrices from the same animal. The presence of antibodies in serum and liver transudate was substantially higher than the presence of the virus detected by RT-qPCR in both matrices, in agreement with a previous study that found high seroprevalence 73.3% but the prevalence of only 15.6% in liver respectively based on PCR [

Most serum samples (43/45) and all transudates that were negative by RT-qPCR were positive by ELISA. This may be because viremia lasts for a very short time in circulating blood, which makes it quite difficult to detect viral RNA in serum [
