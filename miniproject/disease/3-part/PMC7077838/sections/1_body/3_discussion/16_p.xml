<p>For optimal clinical and economical management and treatment of febrile disease cases in resource-poor tropical and subtropical regions where malaria and DF are endemic, patients should be tested for malaria and DENV NS1 positivity as early as possible post onset of symptoms, preferably during the first three days of illness. Even at a high rate of secondary DENV infections, early application of the fairly inexpensive NS1 rapid test will quickly identify the majority of DF cases. Only DENV NS1 negative sera from patients not suffering from malaria have to be analyzed further with the more costly DENV-specific RT-PCR and diagnostic tests targeting other pathogens.</p>
