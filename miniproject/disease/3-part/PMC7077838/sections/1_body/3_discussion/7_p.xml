<p>A conclusive analysis of the influence of anti-NS1 IgG antibodies on NS1 antigen detection in our patient collective as well as the sound implementation and validation of an immune complex dissociation method for improvement of NS1 rapid test sensitivity would require: 1) Determination of anti-NS1 antibody titers in all tested samples by ELISA or IIFT. 2) Implementation of an immune complex dissociation method efficiently disintegrating immune complexes but preserving NS1 protein structure/epitopes as necessary for the respective antigen detection method. 3) Establishment of a neutralization control confirming signal specificity in post-dissociation samples: as discussed by Pokriefka 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], positive test results should be suppressible by the addition of an excess of an anti-antigen positive serum due to reformation of immune complexes.
