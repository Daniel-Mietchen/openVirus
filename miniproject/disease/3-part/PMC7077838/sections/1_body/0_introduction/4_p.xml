<p>Laboratory diagnostics of DENV infection can be based on the detection of the virus itself (by virus culture), viral RNA (by real-time PCR), viral antigen (by ELISA or lateral flow testing) and the detection of a virus specific IgM/IgG response [

 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thereby, direct methods (virus culture, real-time PCR, antigen detection) as well as (with limitations) IgM detection can be used for diagnosis of acute infections while the presence of DENV-specific IgG antibodies indicates a prior exposure to DENV [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Although infection with one DENV serotype confers lifelong homotypic immunity, heterotypic cross-protection is timely limited [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, consecutive infections with different serotypes are commonly observed in residents of endemic countries. Serologically, these secondary infections are characterized by the rapid and early rise of broadly reactive anti-flavivirus IgG antibodies; IgM antibody titers often remain low [
