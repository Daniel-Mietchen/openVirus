<p>Dependent on local disease epidemiology, travel history and clinical signs, differential diagnosis of DF against a wide range of diseases caused by bacterial (e.g. spotted fever, scrub typhus, leptospirosis), parasitic (e.g. malaria) or viral (e.g. chikungunya fever, Zika fever, influenza, measles) pathogens is necessary [

Thereby, an accurate diagnosis already in the early febrile phase of the disease is important to (1) avoid further unnecessary and expensive diagnostic procedures and potentially harmful antibiotic treatments, (2) administer correct and timely interventions already at primary and secondary care levels and (3) to identify outbreaks as early as possible. Thus, time-consuming, highly specialized methods as virus cultivation or serological evaluation based on the observation of seroconversion in paired serum samples is of little relevance in the acute clinical situation and the most relevant techniques for early diagnosis in the field are DENV-specific real-time PCR and the detection of virus antigen by rapid test or ELISA.
