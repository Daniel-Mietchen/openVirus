 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Briefly, 50 μl serum were mixed with 50 μl 1.5 M glycine pH 2.8 and incubated for 1 h at 37°C before adding 10 μl 1.5 M Tris pH 9.4. SD Bioline NS1 antigen testing was performed immediately afterwards by applying 100 μl of the reaction mixture to the sample well. Heat treatment was performed as described by Beall 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pone.0230337.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, 70 μl serum were mixed with 70 μl 0.1 M EDTA pH 7.5 and incubated for 5 min at 95°C. Following centrifugation (12,000 g, 10 min), 100 μl of the supernatant was applied to the sample well of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test. For comparison, 50 μl serum were diluted with 60 μl 1 x PBS pH 7.4 and 100 μl of this mixture were applied to the sample well of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test. According to the manufacturer’s instruction, all test results were monitored after 20 min incubation at room temperature.
