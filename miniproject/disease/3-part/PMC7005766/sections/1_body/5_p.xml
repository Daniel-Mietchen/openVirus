 </xref> their role in chronic liver diseases (chronic viral hepatitis, alcoholic and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and HCC) and the potential benefit of anti-platelet therapy in these contexts, highlighting the pro-regenerative effect of platelets on hepatocytes, the role of platelets in the progression of liver fibrosis, their immunomodulatory role and their pro-metastatic role. Experimental data regarding anti-platelet therapy in chronic viral hepatitis (B and C), which is characterized by immune-mediated liver damage, showed a potential benefit. In metabolic liver diseases, platelets might also constitute a therapeutic target with recent experimental and clinical studies pointing towards a protective effect of anti-platelet therapy in both preventing the progression of liver fibrosis and the development of NASH-induced HCC. Finally, anti-platelet therapy has shown promise in reducing HCC development and liver metastases in experimental models. In the near future, new methodologies based on the proteomic and transcriptomic analysis of platelets might offer tools for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic liver disease.
