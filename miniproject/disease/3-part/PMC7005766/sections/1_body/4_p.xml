<p id="p0045">One specific group in which surveillance of HCC is required is that of HCV-patients with bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis that remain at risk, albeit lower, of developing life-threatening complications such as HCC, despite a sustained virological response. Understanding that risk and whether there are subgroups in whom surveillance might be avoided (ie fibrosis 3) is a complex matter that clearly depends on being able to reliably stage fibrosis and estimate HCC risk in individual patients.

 </xref> reviews the evidence regarding post-sustained virological response outcome and surveillance needs in HCV-patients with pre-therapeutic advanced liver fibrosis. Data regarding the risk of HCC, but also that of portal hypertension complications, extra-hepatic complications or liver failure are carefully dissected to improve risk stratification and refine screening strategies in this additional growing population.
