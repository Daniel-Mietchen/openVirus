<p id="para0005">We collected 6327 throat swabs. Of the 6327 (female 2782 
 <italic>vs.</italic> male 3545) outpatients who sought treatment in 2016 to 2018, 1886 outpatients were confirmed as pathogen positive. In this study, we studied only ILI outpatients who were single pathogen positive. Overall, the most frequently detected agents were H3N2 (530/6327, 8.38%), H1N1 (285/6327, 4.50%), hRV (216/6327, 3.41%), and B-Yamagata (195/6327, 3.08%). (

The top three pathogens were mainly influenza viruses. Influenza and other pathogens were present for most of the 3 years in this study. However, the same influenza subtype did not persist as the dominant strain; rather, a mixture of high-intensity peaks of single subtypes and the co-circulation of types and subtypes at variable intensities occurred. (Fig. S1â€“3). This was consistent with other ILI surveillance data that demonstrated asynchronous peaks and the co-circulation of different pathogens.
