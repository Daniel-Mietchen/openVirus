<p id="para0009">This study also found that MP accounted for a large proportion of the pathogen spectrum of ILI in Beijing, with a detection rate of 2.01%. MP is a common pathogen associated with human respiratory infections that can cause endemic or even global outbreaks among people of all ages.

 </xref> However, there has been few studies on MP in routine surveillance at home and abroad, and the inclusion of these additional pathogens in ILI studies might greatly increase the positive detection frequency(2). Therefore, in an early epidemic of unexplained fever, it is necessary to be alert to the possibility of MP infection, especially when the epidemic occurs in a closed environment.
