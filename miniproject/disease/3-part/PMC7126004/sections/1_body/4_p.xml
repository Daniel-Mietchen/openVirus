<p id="para0006">Of the 6327 ILI, the overall prevalence of influenza was 18.90% (1196/6327). Relatively low detection rates have even been reported in studies conducted in other geographical areas, such as Gansu Province in China,

 </xref> at 20.48% (1086/5303) and 28.33% (2137/7543), respectively. Regarding the pathogen spectrum of ILI in Beijing, the dominant strains in 2016–2018 were H3N2 and B-Victoria (2016), H3N2 and H1N1 (2017), H3N2 and B-Yamagata (2018), indicating that different dominant subtypes of influenza viruses in this region alternate. The discrepancies in the influenza detection rates among patients with ILI from different areas highlighted the geographical differences in virus burdens. However, these geographical differences in the detection rate may have been affected by several other factors, such as different technical approaches, sampling periods, study durations, or target populations (global population, paediatric population, etc.).
