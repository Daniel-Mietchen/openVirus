<p id="para0008">It was hRV that had a detection rate of 3.41% (216/6327) in this study; hRV had a great impact on persons under 60 years old and was a major viral pathogen of ILI during the study period (Table 1). In many regions of the world, there have been reports of outbreaks caused by hRV, such as the UK (2009–2017)
