<p id="para0004">Influenza viruses, other respiratory viruses and bacteria have been detected in patients with ILI (2–4). These respiratory viruses and bacteria, including seasonal humans influenza virus A (sFluA) and humans influenza virus B (sFluB), human coronavirus (hCoV-OC43,hCoV-NL63,hCoV-HKU1 and hCoV-229E), para-influenza virus (PIV 1–4), adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), hRV, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), boca virus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), chlamydia (CM) and MP are well recognized. Patients infected by these pathogens exhibit highly similar symptoms, rendering a clinical diagnosis unreliable and limiting aetiological and epidemiological studies.
