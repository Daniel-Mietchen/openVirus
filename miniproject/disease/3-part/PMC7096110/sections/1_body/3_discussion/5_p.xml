<p>Chlamydiosis is a major ruminant infectious disease that may result in sudden abortion outbreaks, thereby affecting herd production and reproduction [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In humans, only a few infection cases were reported, however, chlamydiosis during pregnancy causes a life-threatening risk for the fetus and the mother as well [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ELISA assay as a highly specific, sensitive, easy to perform for the detection of chlamydiosis [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, Baud 
 <italic/>et al. [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] stated that the MOMP-based ELISA ideal for large-scale serological studies, because of its high throughput and excellent specificity. In our study, the prevalence of chlamydiosis was 0.75% in sheep, while goats and camels did not show any positivity. There were few studies reported the prevalence of 
 <italic>C. abortus</italic> in Saudi Arabia; 19.4% in camels [
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], 10.05% in Al-Ahsa camels [
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], 7.52% and 34.50% in sheep and goats, respectively in AL-Riyadh [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. We found 
 <italic>C. abortus</italic> was more frequent in males than in females with no significant correlation (
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.01), the reason for the frequency difference is unclear but sex may be a factor affecting the prevalence of chlamydiosis [
