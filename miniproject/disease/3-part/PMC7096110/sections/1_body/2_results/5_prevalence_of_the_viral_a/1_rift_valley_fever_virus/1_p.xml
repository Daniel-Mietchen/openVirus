<p>The incidence of RVFV among animals was shown in 
 <xref rid="table4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The highest prevalence rate of RVFV was recorded in sheep (71: 10.7%), then in goats (41: 17.9%), while there was no prevalence recorded among camels. Concerning the animalâ€™s gender, the prevalence rate among male animals was higher than females, with a highly significant correlation (
