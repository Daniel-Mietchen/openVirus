<p>The competitive ELISA diagnostic kit was designed to detect antibodies specific for the RVFV nucleoprotein in sera or plasma specimens. ELISA microplates were coated with RVFV nucleoprotein. If the serum samples contained antibodies to RVFV, it would inhibit the binding of an anti-nucleoprotein-peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase)-labeled monoclonal antibody to the RVFV nucleoprotein coated on the plastic wells. While if there were no antibodies in the sample, a blue solution would appear and it turned yellow after adding the stop solution.</p>
