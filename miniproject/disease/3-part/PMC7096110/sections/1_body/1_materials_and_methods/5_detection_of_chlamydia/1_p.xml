 <italic>C. abortus</italic>, it reduces the frequency of non-specific reactions. If the tested serum contained anti-Chlamydia antibodies, an antigen-antibody complex would be formed. Then, a horseradish peroxidase conjugate was added, and an antigen-antibody-conjugate was formed. After washing, a substrate was added, and the developed blue color relied on the concentration of antibodies in the tested serum. In the presence of antibodies, the blue solution turned into yellow after adding the stop solution. While no color developed if there were no antibodies in the serum sample.
