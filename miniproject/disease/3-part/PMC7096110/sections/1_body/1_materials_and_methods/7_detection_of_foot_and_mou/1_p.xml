<p>The competitive ELISA kit is used to detect FMDV serotype O antibodies in serum specimens. ELISA microplates were coated with non-infectious FMDV type O antigen. If the antibodies exist in the serum samples, it will inhibit the binding of an anti-serotype O horseradish peroxidase-labeled monoclonal antibody to the non-infectious FMDV type O antigen coated on the plastic wells. If there were antibodies in the sample, no color would appear. While if there were no antibodies in the sample, a blue solution would appear and it turned yellow after adding the stop solution.</p>
