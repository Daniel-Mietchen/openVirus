<p>Since its first description in 1961 in Trinidad and Tobago (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), OROV has caused several outbreaks and sporadic infections in the Brazilian Amazon, particularly in the states of Pará, Amapá, Rondônia, Maranhão, Acre, Amazonas, Minas Gerais, Mato Grosso, and Tocantins (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and evidence suggests the circulation of OROV in other Brazilian states (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Since the late 1980s, additional cases and outbreaks of OROV have been reported in Panama, Peru (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">–</xref>
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), and, more recently, Ecuador (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The virus has been isolated from sloths (
 <italic>Bradypus trydactilus</italic>) (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and marmosets (
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp.) (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), as well as from invertebrates such as 
 <italic>Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) and 
 <italic>Ochlerotatus serratus</italic> mosquitoes and 
 <italic>Culicoides paraensis</italic> biting midges (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). It has been proposed that OROV has two distinct transmission cycles (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the sylvatic transmission cycle, wild mammals such as sloths (
 <italic>B. trydactilus</italic>) and primates (
 <italic>Allouatta caraya</italic>, 
 <italic>Callithrix penicillata</italic>) serve as hosts for the virus, which is transmitted by vector species that are common in rural areas (
 <italic>Aedes serratus</italic> and 
 <italic>Coquillettidia venezuelensis</italic> have been proposed as vectors in the sylvatic cycle). This sylvatic cycle may possibly include other vertebrate hosts, including wild birds and rodents (such as 
 <italic>Proechimys</italic> sp.). In contrast, the urban transmission cycle involves human-to-human transmission mediated by the biting midge 
 <italic>C. paraensis</italic> (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and can be facilitated by anthropogenic disturbance of forest areas. OROV produces an acute febrile illness in humans, characterized by unspecific symptoms such as fever, chills, headaches, myalgia, and joint pain (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and is therefore difficult to diagnose and differentiate from other co-occurring infectious diseases such as leptospirosis, dengue fever, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, malaria, and rickettsial and 
 <italic>Coxiella</italic> infections (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Specific to the Amazon region, OROV infections are difficult to distinguish from undifferentiated febrile illness associated with group C orthobunyaviruses (e.g., Itaqui and Caraparú viruses) or phleboviruses from the Candiru complex.
