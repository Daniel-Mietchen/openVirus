<p>The 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> is a highly diverse order of viruses that include multiple emerging human pathogens. Within this order, the 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic> genus (family 
 <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>) includes many arthropod-borne virus species that have been associated with disease in humans (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). The severity of disease varies and ranges from self-limiting febrile illness to encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). One prominent member of this genus is Oropouche virus (OROV), a common causal agent of febrile disease in the Amazon basin (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) and a potential candidate for future emerging epidemics in the region and elsewhere (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).
