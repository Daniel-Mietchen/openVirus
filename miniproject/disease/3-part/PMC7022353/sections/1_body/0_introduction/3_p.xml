<p>The genome of OROV is typical of the orthobunyaviruses and comprises three negative-sense RNA segments of different sizes: a large segment (L) that encodes a RNA dependent RNA polymerase, a medium (M) segment that encodes a membrane polyprotein comprised of three main components (the Gn, NSm, and Gc proteins), and a small (S) segment that encodes the structural nucleocapsid protein N and a second nonstructural protein, Ns, in an overlapping reading frame (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The Gn and Gc proteins determine the architecture of the viral particle; cryo-electron microscopy studies show that the membrane proteins of Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) form a tripodal structure (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), and the crystal structures of the N terminus of Gc suggest that this trimeric assembly may be conserved across various orthobunyaviruses (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). The segmented nature of the OROV genome enhances the likelihood of genome reassortment events, a phenomenon that has been observed more generally in the bunyaviruses (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) and has been associated, in some cases, with a dramatic increase in disease severity, such as with Ngari virus, a reassortant between BUNV and Batai virus (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Furthermore, reassortment appears to play an important role in the evolution and emergence of new viruses within OROV and related species, as has been described for the reassortant Jatobal virus (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) and Perdoes virus (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) in Brazil, the Iquitos virus (IQTV) in Peru (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and the Madre de Dios virus in Venezuela (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).
