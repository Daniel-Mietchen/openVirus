<p>In addition to the Ecuadorian sequences, we collected all available sequences for the three OROV genome segments from GenBank at the National Center for Biotechnology Information. We then excluded all sequences that were shorter than a threshold segment length (specifically, &lt;6,500 nucleotides long for L, &lt;4,200 nucleotides long for M, and &lt;693 nucleotides long for S). These GenBank sequences represent the genetic diversity of OROV from outbreaks in Trinidad and Tobago, Panama, Peru, and Brazil and cover the complete sampled history of the virus from the mid 1950s to the late 2000s, with the latest outbreak in Brazil reported in 2009 (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). The data sets were compiled into individual alignments for each of the three viral genome segments (denoted L for large, M for medium, and S for small). A complete list of the GenBank accession numbers of all sequences used is presented in Table S1.
