<p>The availability of high-resolution protein structures for the OROV proteins is limited. We therefore focused efforts on the OROV glycoprotein Gc because (i) N-terminal regions for a number of orthobunyaviral Gc glycoproteins (including the head domain of OROV Gc, PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=6H3X" assigning-authority="pdb" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6H3X</ext-link>) have been structurally elucidated (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) and (ii) this protein shows an increased number of sites under positive selection compared to other OROV proteins (see Results). The second component of the OROV glycoprotein, Gn, was not analyzed here because no adequate atomic resolution structure is currently available. For Gc, N-linked glycosylation sites were predicted for each virus sequence using the NetNGlyc 1.0 server (

The sequence evolution of these motifs was subsequently mapped onto the M segment phylogeny using a maximum parsimony approach. To enable structure-based mapping of sites under selection, we created a composite molecular model that encompasses the structurally elucidated N-terminal head of OROV Gc (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=6H3X" assigning-authority="pdb" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6H3X</ext-link>) and the stem domains from the closely related Schmallenberg virus (SBV) (PDB ID 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=6H3S" assigning-authority="pdb" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6H3S</ext-link>) (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) through sequence-independent structural alignments in PyMOL (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). Since there are no known resolved structures of the orthobunyaviral C-terminal domains (henceforth called the core region), this region was omitted from the structural analysis. Residues in the N-terminal head of the OROV Gc structure that contribute to the crystal packing-induced homotrimeric surface (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>) were identified with the PDBePISA server (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). Sites under selection were mapped onto the composite and the trimeric models, and their residue-specific solvent accessibility was analyzed using the ESPript 3.0 server (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>).
