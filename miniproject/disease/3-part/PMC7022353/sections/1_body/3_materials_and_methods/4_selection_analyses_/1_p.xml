<p>The ORF alignments of the S and L segments, as well as those of the individual proteins of the M segment ORF (Gn, NSm and Gc), were tested for evidence of natural selection using the various methods implemented in HyPhy (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), implemented by the Datamonkey 2.0 server (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>). Statistical tests were used to evaluate evidence for both pervasive and episodic selection in the OROV genome and to evaluate selection across whole genes, as well as at specific codons. Analyses of pervasive selection were performed using three methods: (i) the Branch-site Unrestricted Statistical Test for Episodic Diversification (BUSTED) method, which tests for gene-wise selection and estimates a mean 
 <italic>dN</italic>/
 <italic>dS</italic> ratio for each gene (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>), (ii) the Single-Likelihood Ancestor Counting (SLAC) method, and (iii) the Fixed Effects Likelihood (FEL) method. The latter two approaches were used to infer specific codons under adaptive selection (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Episodic selection was evaluated using two methods: (i) the Mixed Effects Model of Evolution (MEME), which identifies individual codons under positive selection (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and (ii) a branch-site model implemented in aBSREL (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), which was used to search for phylogenetic branches under selection. A final analysis was performed using the Fast Unconstrained Bayesian Approximation (FUBAR) (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) method to evaluate the difference between nonsynonymous (β) and synonymous rates (α) per site for each viral segment. All codon positions were numbered relative to the OROV reference strain BeAn19991.
