<p>Six strains of OROV were isolated independently via one passage in Vero cells from febrile patient sera sampled in 2016 in the Esmeraldas province of Ecuador (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). RNA was extracted, and six complete genome sequences were generated using a metagenomic approach as described previously (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). Briefly, cDNA was prepared using a sequence independent single primer amplification approach (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>), cDNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT kit (Illumina), and sequencing was performed on a MiSeq (Illumina) using 150-nucleotide paired-end runs. Reads were mapped to reference sequences using BWA MEM (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>). The final consensus sequences were generated using Quasibam (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). We visually inspected each data set for the occurrence of single nucleotide variants within each patient; limited variation per site was found for all isolates (detailed in File S1 in the supplemental material). The study was approved by the bioethics committee of Universidad San Francisco de Quito, and all patients provided written consent indicating that they agreed for their samples to be tested for additional pathogens.
