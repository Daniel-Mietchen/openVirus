<p>We undertook a screen for sites under selection using different models implemented in the HyPhy framework (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Evidence for both pervasive and episodic selection was found in different genes using different methods (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Pervasive selection (selection that occurs persistently along the whole phylogeny) was detected in the S segment. Individual sites under pervasive selection were identified in the M segment alignments: for the Gn protein one site was found to be evolving under positive selection (by the SLAC and FEL methods), for the NSm protein one site was identified (by the FEL method), and for the the Gc protein two sites were found to be under selection (by the FEL and FUBAR methods). Sites evolving under pervasive selection were also identified in the S and L segments (one site in each) by the FUBAR method (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Episodic adaptive selection (selection that occurs heterogeneously across the tree branches) was detected in all alignments under the mixed effects model (MEME) (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In total, MEME identified six sites under selection in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), seven sites under selection in the M segment polyprotein, and one site under selection in the nonstructural N protein. Of these sites, only four were identified by two or more methods: codon 66 of the Gn scaffold protein, codon 86 of the NSm nonstructural protein and codons 269 and 442 of the Gc spike protein (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). We note that three of these four sites feature more than two alleles, and the frequencies of the most common allele range from 0.44 to 0.73 (Table S3). This episodic selection is made evident when comparing the difference between synonymous and nonsynonymous rates per site on the M segment, where, despite a low proportion of sites identified as evolving under selection (Fig. S5a), each lineage shows different sites with higher nonsynonymous substitution rate (Fig. S5b).
