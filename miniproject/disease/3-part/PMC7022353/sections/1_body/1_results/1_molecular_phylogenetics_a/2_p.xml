<p>The trees for the different segments show considerable topological differences, suggesting the likelihood of reassortment events in the viral genome. Pairwise comparisons between segment phylogenies (Fig. S3) indicate that the L segment of the 2009 Mazag√£o outbreak sequences has arisen through a reassortment event. There are also widespread topological differences between the S segment and the L and M segments (Fig. S3), particularly for the Brazilian sequences (which cluster in robust monophyletic clades in the L and M segment trees but as multiple clusters in the S segment phylogeny). This suggests that OROV might reassort frequently; however, the low node support for the S segment could also represent phylogenetic uncertainty rather than differing evolutionary history. Furthermore, a comparison of the three segment trees drawn on the same scale shows widely differing tree lengths (
