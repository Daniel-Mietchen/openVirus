<p>We sought to explain the substantially older TMRCA of the M segment compared to the other two segments, despite the fact that all segments share overlapping sets of strains. The temporal signal we observed (Fig. S1) suggests that the roots of the M and L segment phylogenies represent different ancestral viruses and that the discrepant TMRCAs are not the result of estimation error. How can this conclusion be reconciled with the topological similarities between the M and L segment phylogenies? We suggest that these results could be explained by hypothesizing that the ancestor of one of the M segment lineages underwent a past reassortment event with an unsampled, divergent OROV lineage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). At present, it is not possible to determine which of the two lineages actually underwent reassortment (for visualization in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>, lineage 2 was chosen randomly). Under this hypothesis, the TMRCAs of segments M and L can differ substantially, and yet their phylogenies remain largely congruent. This hypothesis posits that a large diversity of OROV in South America exists, which is currently unsampled and among which reassortment is common.
