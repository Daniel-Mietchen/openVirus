<p>The adaptation of an emerging virus to new hosts can affect the likelihood of future outbreaks and is a useful phenomenon to explore. While computational evolutionary analysis can usefully indicate the presence of positive selection and molecular adaptation in virus genomes, sequence data alone cannot resolve the functional and biological context of selected sites. Further, different methods for detecting selection do not always give the same results; hence, conclusions benefit from considering the consensus of results generated by multiple models and methods (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Three different models all indicated the positive selection acting on codon 66 of Gn (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The N terminus of closely related Bunyamwera virus (BUNV) Gn protein is predicted to localize outside the viral particle (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) and function as a scaffold for the trimeric Gc spike (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The residue encoded by codon 66 falls within this predicted extramembrane domain, potentially exposing it to the host immune system. Unlike other bunyaviruses, such as phleboviruses (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>) and hantaviruses (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), it is unlikely that the Gn is large enough to extend from the virion membrane and shield the fusion loops of the cognate Gc. Thus, while amino acid changes are unlikely to affect fusion loop shielding, it is possible that selective forces acting on Gn could just alter the stability of the Gn-Gc lattice during cell entry.
