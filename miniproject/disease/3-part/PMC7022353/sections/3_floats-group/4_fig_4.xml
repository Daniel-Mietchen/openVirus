  <p>Model of OROV genome evolution and reassortment that can resolve the inconsistent TMRCA estimates of the L and M segments. The upper panel depicts a simplified ancestral graph that describes the joint ancestry of the L (orange) and M (teal) segments. Sampled sequences are represented by dark and light gray circles at the tree tips. These are grouped into lineages 1 and 2, which correspond to the two main lineages in the M and L phylogenies (see 
   <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The light-gray branches represent hypothesized, highly diverse, unsampled OROV lineages. The graph contains one reassortment event (black diamond), resulting in the ancestor of lineage 2 in the M segment being descended from a divergent, unsampled lineage (alternatively, the reassortment might have occurred on the branch ancestral to lineage 1). As a result, the TMRCA of the L segment phylogeny (lower right panel; orange circle) exists substantially earlier of the M segment (lower left panel; teal circle). For simplicity, other more recent reassortment events between lineages 1 and 2 are not shown (i.e., the 2009 Mazag√£o outbreak clade).
