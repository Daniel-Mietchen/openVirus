  <p>Time-calibrated and evolutionary rate analysis of the OROV genome. (a) A comparison of the three segments reveals an older common ancestor for the M segment, resulting in the divergence of two lineages that appear to diversify in the early to mid-1900s (lineage 1 and lineage 2 are indicated as L1 and L2 in the figure). (b) Estimated evolutionary rates of the segments. (c) Sliding window estimation of the relative genetic distance of each of the two M segment lineages (shown in orange and blue) to Iquitos virus (IQTV), used as an outgroup. Points of the sequences where the closest genotype to the outgroup changes could be interpreted as recombination events with unsampled sequences. (d) An analysis of the younger segments, S and L, reveals emergence date estimates for the virus in the early to middle 20th century, and shows relatively consistent estimates for the TMRCA of the new Ecuadorian sequences in the early 2010s. The posterior probabilities (PP) of each node is shown based on a gray-scale color scheme (0.0 PP = black to 1.0 PP = white).</p>
