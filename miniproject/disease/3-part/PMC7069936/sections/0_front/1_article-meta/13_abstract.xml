 <p id="Par1">FLU-v, developed by PepTcell (SEEK), is a peptide vaccine aiming to provide a broadly protective cellular immune response against influenza A and B. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, phase IIb efficacy and safety trial was conducted. One hundred and fifty-three healthy individuals 18–55 years of age were randomized to receive one or two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v or adjuvanted placebo subcutaneously on days −43 and −22, prior to intranasal challenge on day 0 with the A/California/04/2009/H1N1 human influenza A challenge virus. The primary objective of the study was to identify a reduction in mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) defined as the presence of viral shedding and clinical influenza symptoms. Single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v recipients (
  <italic>n</italic> = 40) were significantly less likely to develop MMID after challenge vs placebo (
  <italic>n</italic> = 42) (32.5% vs 54.8% 
  <italic>p</italic> = 0.035). FLU-v should continue to be evaluated and cellular immunity explored further as a possible important correlate of protection against influenza.
