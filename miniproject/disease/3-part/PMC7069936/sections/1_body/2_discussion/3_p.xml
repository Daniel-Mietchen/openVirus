<p id="Par15">Previous human studies were carried out administering a single-dose of FLU-v, but in this study two doses were tested in humans. Although the two-dose regimen showed a reduction in MMID compared to placebo, this was not statistically significant. The study was only powered to compare the active groups to placebo so there was no comparison of the active groups. Larger studies are needed to directly compare the single to two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v. However, the lack of a statistically significant effect of two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v may be explained by recent data in mice demonstrating that T cells from thrice vaccinated mice were significantly less effective in adoptive transfer studies than T cells from mice receiving a single vaccination

 </sup>. In that study the researchers observed an increase in the number of regulatory T cells in animals that had received multiple vaccinations. Elimination of these regulatory cells during the second and third vaccinations resulted in a recovery of therapeutic efficacy. In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that repeated exposure within a short time or prolonged continuous exposure to antigen stimulation can result in T cell exhaustion, characterized by a higher level of activation and differentiation of T cells than seen in acute stimulation leading to reduced effector function. This can include a reduction in the number of cells able to produce cytokines leading to a failure to provide help to other lymphocytes to stimulate an effective antigen response

 </sup>. Further study of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and whole-blood RNA collected after vaccination with FLU-v need further evaluation to test the above hypotheses and to define the protective immune responses being generated.
