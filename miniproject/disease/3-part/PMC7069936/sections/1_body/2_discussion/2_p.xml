<p id="Par14">In this study single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v was safe and efficacious in that it induced a statistically significant reduction in the number of participants positive for MMID compared to placebo. These data demonstrate the efficacy of this broad-spectrum, “universal” vaccine candidate and do so in a healthy volunteer human challenge model. In addition, every other secondary endpoint measured to evaluate disease severity and viral shedding, although not statistically significant, demonstrated reductions in favor of single-dose FLU-v.</p>
