<p id="Par13">The results of this study demonstrate that a peptide-based vaccine designed to induce influenza-specific T cell immunity (in the absence of inducing antibody responses against HA) can provide some protection against influenza. At least one other peptide-based universal influenza vaccine candidate inducing T cell immunity has completed phase I and II trials, but that vaccine has not demonstrated efficacy via a primary outcome

 </sup>. However, the ability of peptide vaccines to alter the functionality of T cells has been previously observed
