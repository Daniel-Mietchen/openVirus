<p id="Par11">The most common AE related to vaccination observed in this study was injection site induration (41% of participants). All of these events were mild in intensity except for one participant who experienced injection site induration considered moderate. The highest proportion of participants experiencing this AE were in the two-dose FLU-v group (63%) while fewer were observed in the one-dose FLU-v group (46%) and the placebo group (16%). Injection site pain was observed in 6% of those in the two-dose FLU-v group. No other AEs related to vaccination were observed in greater than 4% of the participants in any of the treatment groups. All of these other AEs were mild in intensity except for two events, one arthralgia and one injection site reaction considered severe. There were no serious AEs identified (Table
