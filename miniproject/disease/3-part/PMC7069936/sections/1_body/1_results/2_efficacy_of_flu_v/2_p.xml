<p id="Par8">When evaluating clinical disease, no significant difference in the number of participants experiencing at least one symptom was observed between the groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). However, there was a statistically significant reduction in the number of participants who experienced at least two or more symptoms during their infection between those who received single-dose FLU-v and those who received placebo (40% vs 64.3%, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.024). A smaller reduction in the two-dose FLU-v group (56.1%) compared to placebo in the participants with at least two or more symptoms (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.296) was also observed but not significant (Table
