  <p>The incidence of the binary endpoints was calculated and then analyzed using a one-sided Fisher’s exact test with 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 being considered significant (*). The lower boundary for the estimate of the difference (placebo-vaccine) in the percentage of each endpoint is presented that corresponds to a one-sided 95% significance level, along with the estimate of the difference. MMID (mild to moderate disease) was considered positive if a participant had at least one symptom of influenza along with a positive diagnostic test during the quarantine period post influenza challenge.
