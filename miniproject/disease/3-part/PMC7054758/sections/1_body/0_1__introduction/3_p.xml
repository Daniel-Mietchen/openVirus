<p>The suppressor of the cytokine signaling (SOCS) protein family is a classical negative regulator of cytokine receptor signaling of the JAK/STAT pathway and consists of eight structurally similar proteins (SOCS1–7 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein) [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SOCS1 and SOCS3 are the most extensively characterized members [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Several recent studies have revealed that some viruses could regulate expression of the host proteins by overstimulating SOCS1 and/or SOCS3, thereby inhibiting the immune signaling pathway and facilitating viral evasion of immune surveillance [

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For instance, HIV infection interferes with the expression SOCS1 and SOCS3, leading to immune activation. Sustained immune activation disrupts the lymphoid system and favors HIV replication [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, hepatitis B virus increases SOCS3 expression, thereby promoting the inflammation in the liver [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SOCS1 also aggravates enterovirus-induced cardiac injury [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Influenza A virus inhibits type I IFN signaling via NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B-dependent induction of SOCS3 expression [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, the relationship of EV71 infection with JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling is less studied. Until now, whether EV71 evades the host immune system by regulating the expression of SOCS proteins remains unknown.
