  <p>EV71 virus infection induces SOCS expression. (a, b) RD cells were infected with the EV71 virus (CC063) (MOI = 0, MOI = 0.03, and MOI = 0.06) for the indicated time points. The RT-PCR was used to measure SOCS1 (b) and SOCS3 mRNA (a). (c) The expression of the SOCS3/SOCS1 protein was also detected by western blot. Quantification of SOCS3 expression was analyzed by ImageJ2X. SOCS3 expression with EV71 virus infection (MOI = 0) was normalized to 1. (d, e) One-day-old mice were intracerebrally inoculated with EV71 virus at 10
   <sup>3</sup> CCID50 ml
   <sup>−1</sup> or MEM medium (as control). SOCS1 (e) and SOCS3 (d) mRNA level expressions were assessed by RT-PCR in samples of the hind-limb muscle from the infected mice. Samples were collected at the times indicated. All the data shown in this figure are representative of at least three independent experiments. The statistical significance analyses were performed using two-sided unpaired
