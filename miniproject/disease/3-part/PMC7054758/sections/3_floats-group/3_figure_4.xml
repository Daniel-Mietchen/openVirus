  <p>EV71 infection activates SOCS expression through the NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B pathway and inhibits IFN-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. (a) RD cells were stimulated with or without IFN
   <italic>β</italic> for 6 h and then infected with or without EV71 virus for 24 h. The expression of SOCS3, as well as STAT3 phosphorylation, was analyzed by western blot. The relative expressions of SOCS3, p-STAT3, and STAT3 were normalized to those of lane 1. (b) RD cells were treated with NF-
   <italic>κ</italic>B inhibitor BAY11-7082 for 1 h and then infected with EV71 virus at the indicated time points. SOCS3 expression was detected by RT-PCR. The data are representative of at least three independent repeats. The statistical significance analyses were performed using two-tailed unpaired 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (NS: no significance; 
   <sup>∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, 
   <sup>∗∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and 
   <sup>∗∗∗</sup>
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). (c) Schematic diagram of the EV71 virus activating SOCS gene expression and inhibiting the JAK/STAT signaling pathway.
