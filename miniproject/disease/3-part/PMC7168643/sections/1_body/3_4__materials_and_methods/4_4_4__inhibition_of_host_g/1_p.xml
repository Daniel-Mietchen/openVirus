<p>To evaluate the effect of MDV A/AA/6/60 LAIV NS1 and PA-X proteins on host protein synthesis, human 293T cells (2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, 24-well plate format, triplicates) were transiently co-transfected in suspension, using LPF2000, with 1 μg/well (500 ng/plasmid) of the indicated pDZ plasmids encoding WT or mutant PA (PA

 <sup>−</sup>) proteins, together with 25 ng/well of pCAGGS plasmids expressing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) and Gaussia luciferase (Gluc). pDZ empty (E) plasmid was used as control or to complete 1 μg/well when only one NS or PA plasmid was added. At 24 h p.t., cells were analyzed for GFP expression under a fluorescence microscope and Gluc activity was quantified from TCS using a Biolux Gaussia luciferase reagent (New England BioLabs) and a Lumicount luminometer (Packard). The mean value with standard deviations (SDs) were calculated using Microsoft Excel software.
