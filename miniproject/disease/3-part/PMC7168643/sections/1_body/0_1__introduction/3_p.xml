<p>IAV has developed several mechanisms to counteract host antiviral responses, namely inhibiting the production of interferon (IFN) and the downstream activities of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) proteins, which normally inhibit virus replication and propagation [

 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Segment 3 (PA) of IAV encodes two proteins, the first being the polymerase acid (PA) protein that is produced directly from the PA mRNA and has endonuclease activity, as well as being a component, together with PB2 and PB1, of the viral polymerase complex [
 <xref rid="B15-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Segment 3 also encodes a second protein, PA-X, which is translated from a +1 frameshift open reading frame (ORF) located in the PA viral segment. PA-X shares the first N-terminal 191 amino acids with PA, but contains a unique short C-terminal sequence [

 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Importantly, PA-X has been shown to have multiple functions, such as the selective degradation of host RNA polymerase II-transcribed mRNAs, which leads to the selective inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, blocking of antiviral responses, or modulating host inflammation [

 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Despite PA-X and PA sharing the same N-terminal region, PA-X has a stronger endonucleolytic activity, indicating that the C-terminal domain is responsible for the cellular shutoff [
 <xref rid="B24-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Furthermore, the primary transcript produced from the viral genome segment 8 (NS) of IAV is the non-structural protein 1 (NS1), a multifunctional protein which counteracts the innate immune responses, allowing the virus to replicate in IFN-competent systems [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Synergistically to PA-X, the NS1 protein of certain IAV strains can inhibit host protein synthesis, controlling the expression of IFN and/or ISGs [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,

 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To accomplish this, NS1 binds to the 30 kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (CPSF30), inhibiting the recognition by the CPSF complex of polyadenylation signals of mRNAs during transcription, blocking the cleavage of immature mRNAs and the addition of the poly (A) tail; this is because this poly (A) tail is required for nucleus export, stability, and translation of cellular mRNAs. The unprocessed mRNAs accumulate in the nucleus, leading to an inhibition of host gene expression, including IFN or ISGs [

 <xref rid="B34-pathogens-09-00086" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The amino acid residues responsible for this NS1 function have been mapped in multiple IAV strains. For instance, A/Puerto Rico/8/34 H1N1 cannot bind CPSF30 due to mutations at positions 103 and 106, but that capacity can be restored by introducing amino acid changes at these residues (L103F and I106M) [
