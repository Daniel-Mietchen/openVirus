 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The identified respiratory viruses were as follows: adenovirus (AdV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus (FLU), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), bocavirus (BoV), and human coronavirus (HCoV). RT-PCR was performed to identify MP using an ABI 7500 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with an EuDxTM-PN MLC Detection Kit (EUDIPIA) and an AnyplexTM II RB5 Detection Kit (Seegene). The results of RT-PCR analyses and serologic titers for MP infections were obtained from comprehensive reviews of laboratory records.
