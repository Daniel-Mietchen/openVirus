<p id="Par27">Seasonal Mann-Kendall tests, one type of non-parametric statistical analysis, were used to detect monotonic trends in monthly data with an annual seasonal pattern. For the categorical variables, numbers and percentages were calculated and groups were analyzed using the chi-squared test. Post hoc analyses were used to examine if the characteristics of MP pneumonia groups were statistically significant with the chi-squared test. For the parametric continuous variables, means and standard deviations (SD) were derived, and one-way ANOVA tests were conducted to compare groups, followed by Bonferroni’s post hoc test. For the nonparametric continuous variables, the Kruskal-Wallis rank test was performed, followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. All statistical analyses were performed using R 3.5.1. A
