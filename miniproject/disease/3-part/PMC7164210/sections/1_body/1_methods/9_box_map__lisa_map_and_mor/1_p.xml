<p id="Par31">The Box map is an extension of the Moran scatterplot in which the elements of each quadrant of the plot are represented by a specific colour with their respective polygons. The LISA map indicates the regions whose location correlation is significantly different from the others, being classified into the following groups: non-significant; and significant at the 5% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05), 1% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01), and 0.1% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001) levels, respectively. The Moran map, similarly to the LISA map, shows only significant values, being represented in four groups and placed in the quadrants to which they belong on the graph.
