<p id="Par24">Spatial correlation is the correlation between observations of a single variable solely attributable to their proximity in space. Spatial autocorrelation (association) measurements and tests can be differentiated by the range or scale of analysis, as distinguished from global and local measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. A global measure implies that all elements in the matrix W are included in the spatial correlation calculation, producing a spatial autocorrelation value for any spatial weight matrix. In contrast, local measures are concentrated, i.e. they evaluate the autocorrelation associated with one particular area or a few area units rather than all of them [
