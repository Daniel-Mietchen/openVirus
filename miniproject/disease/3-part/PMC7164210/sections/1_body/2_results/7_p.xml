<p id="Par38">As in the previous year, the survey conducted in July 2015 (the third LIRAa) reached the highest levels of infestation, with 49 neighbourhoods at high risk and only three at medium risk. Very high levels of infestation were detected in the neighbourhoods of Presidente Medici (11.5%), Cruzeiro (11%) and Jardim Paulistano (11%), all belonging to the east zone. In the last survey of 2015 (the fourth LIRAa), there was a small reduction in the number of neighbourhoods with high risk, from 49 to 44.
