<p id="Par39">In 2016, more than half of the city’s municipal neighbourhoods presented high levels of infestation, with an overall rate of 4.3%. Due to the strike of endemic disease control agents of 2016, only three surveys were conducted. On third LIRAa, the last of the year, held in October, it can be seen that there was a significant improvement in the rates when compared with other surveys of the same year. However, none of the neighbourhoods reached a satisfactory index, i.e. low risk, with the majority remaining on high alert, with medium risk. The Moranʼs index map for HI and BI in 2016 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Figure S4, respectively) highlights the similarity of the infestation pattern in adjoining neighbourhoods, as already shown for 2014 and 2015.
