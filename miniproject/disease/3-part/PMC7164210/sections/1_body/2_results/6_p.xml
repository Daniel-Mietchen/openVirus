<p id="Par37">In 2015, there was a worsening of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito infestation rates. On the first LIRAa of the year, held in January, 34 neighbourhoods had an HI greater than 4.0%, i.e. more than half of the municipality was at high risk of an outbreak. In the second LIRAa, only one neighbourhood located in the city centre had a satisfactory index, i.e. less than 1%. Over time, the number of neighbourhoods with high infestation rate dropped from 34 to 30, but the value of this indicator rose in almost every neighbourhood, which resulted in an increase in the overall index of the municipality, which rose from 4.4% to 4.9%.
