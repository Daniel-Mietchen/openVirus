<p id="Par54">Regarding the limitations of this study, it should be considered that the analyses were carried out from secondary data provided by the Environmental Surveillance Service of Campina Grande municipality. In our analysis, environmental actions to curb infestations, as well as rainfall variability and climate change patterns, were not considered. For a better evaluation of the use of autocorrelation statistics to define strata or units for risk analysis and vector control, it will be important to replicate this study in other localities and assess the variability caused by environmental changes.</p>
