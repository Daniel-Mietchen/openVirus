<p id="Par44">This is the first study to show the spatial autocorrelation of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> mosquito infestation among the neighbourhoods of Campina Grande. The results demonstrate autocorrelation distribution patterns evolving throughout the year. This analysis is an innovative strategy and may be more effective in planning surveillance actions than infestation rates, as suggested by the literature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Spatial autocorrelation more accurately points out localities with similar levels of vulnerability and risk of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> infestation, which may help direct the actions of the responsible health authorities.
