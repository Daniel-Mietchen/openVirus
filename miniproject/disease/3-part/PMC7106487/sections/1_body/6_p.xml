<p>In order to evaluate the role of the nitro group on antiviral activity, the amino derivatives 
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold> were also synthesized; compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> was treated with Fe
 <sup>(0)</sup> in conc. HCl leading to 
 <bold>15</bold> in high yields, while carbazole 
 <bold>7</bold> was reacted under microwave irradiation with Cbz,Boc‐lysine to give, after deprotection in HCl/AcOEt, the pure 
 <bold>16</bold> (Scheme 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-5003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Finally, we also tried to modify the 
 <italic>N</italic>‐ethyl substituent of 
 <bold>6</bold> in order to increase the selectivity of our inhibitors targeting the MTase SAM binding site. For this purpose, we compared the structure of the human N7 MTase (hRNMT) involved in the capping of cellular mRNA, with that of both viral MTases. The X‐ray structure revealed structural similarities between the viral and the human MTases (NS5 and hRNMT). However, both ZIKV and DENV NS5‐MTase possess a hydrophobic pocket located near the exocyclic amide of SAM,
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> which is absent in the hRNMT. In the ZIKV MTase, the region is defined by the amino acids F139, I153, G164, E155, R166, and V170, compared to residues F133, I147, G148, E149, R160, and V164 in the DENV MTase. We anticipated that the absence of this hydrophobic pocket in hRNMT could help to increase compound selectivity for the viral MTases and, hence, limit the interference of inhibitors with host MTases. In the docking snapshot, the ethyl group of compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> is located in proximity of this pocket, clearly showing that its replacement with a benzyl or a phenylethyl moiety could lead to derivatives able to selectively recognize and inhibit only the viral enzymes over the host enzymes (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
