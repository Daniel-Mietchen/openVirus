<p>Thus, the synthesis of derivatives 
 <bold>21 a</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold> bearing a phenyl‐alkyl substituent on the carbazole nitrogen was planned. Carbazole 
 <bold>17</bold> was treated with HNO
 <sub>3</sub> and converted into the nitro derivative 
 <bold>18</bold>, which was in turn alkylated on the aromatic nitrogen with appropriate benzyl or alkyl halide in the presence of NaH to give compounds 
 <bold>19 a</bold>–
 <bold>b</bold>. Reduction of the nitro group of 
 <bold>19</bold> with SnCl
 <sub>2</sub> led to amino derivatives 
 <bold>20 a</bold>–
 <bold>b</bold>. The latter were then treated with 4‐I‐phenyl‐ or 2,4‐(MeO)
 <sub>2</sub>‐phenyl‐isocyanate in toluene at 60 °C affording ureas 
 <bold>21 c</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold> in high yields. A different strategy was adopted to synthesize the derivatives 
 <bold>21 a</bold>–
 <bold>b</bold>, due to the commercial lack of the appropriate isocyanate reagent. The 2‐methyl‐4‐nitro‐aniline was treated with triphosgene at 0 °C in the presence of Et
 <sub>3</sub>N leading to the formation of the corresponding isocyanate, which was reacted 
 <italic>in situ</italic> with carbazole 
 <bold>7</bold> to give the desired ureas 
 <bold>21 a</bold>–
 <bold>b</bold> in good yields (Scheme
