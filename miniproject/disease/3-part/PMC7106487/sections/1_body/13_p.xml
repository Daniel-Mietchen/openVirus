<p>Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>15</bold> also showed some activity against DENV (EC
 <sub>50</sub>=9.75 μM), even if the antiviral activity is clearly linked to an adverse toxic effect on the host cell (CC
 <sub>50</sub>=20 μM). Finally, compound 
 <bold>21 b</bold> which showed no enhanced activity against ZIKV MTases, proved to inhibit ZIKV replication at good concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>=12.5 μM). However, compound 
 <bold>21 b</bold> showed toxicity in cellular assay as well as 
 <bold>21 f</bold> which was found active on ZIKV MTase instead. This could suggest that these compounds might target another MTase (i. e. cellular MTase) involved in virus replication. Interestingly, compound 
 <bold>21 d</bold>, which showed poor inhibition of ZIKV MTase, inhibits ZIKV with good EC
 <sub>50</sub>=25 μM and no toxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub>=100 μM).
