<p>Conversely the compounds 
 <bold>15</bold> and 
 <bold>16</bold> and those of series 
 <bold>11</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> barely inhibited the ZIKV MTase. Interestingly compound 
 <bold>6</bold> and those of the series 
 <bold>9</bold> showed a similar inhibition profile on DENV NS5‐MTase, but the compounds of series 
 <bold>21</bold> barely inhibit the DENV MTase suggesting some specificity of this family. A dose‐response assay was then performed for the most promising compounds and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values deduced from titration curves after curve fitting are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The results indicate that the replacement of the methyl group of 
 <bold>6</bold> with a chlorine atom in 
 <bold>9 a</bold> did not affect the inhibitory activity of the compound against ZIKV MTase, whilst it proved to be detrimental for inhibiting the DENV MTase. Similarly, the replacement of the electron withdrawing nitro group of 
 <bold>6</bold> with other substituents (i. e. the electron donating iodine or methoxy in 
 <bold>9 c</bold>–
 <bold>d</bold>, or electron withdrawing −CN or −CF
 <sub>3</sub> in 
 <bold>9 b</bold> and 
 <bold>9 f</bold>) negatively affected the compound's inhibitory activity mainly against the ZIKV MTase. The different activity of compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>9</bold> can be explained by taking in consideration the crucial H‐bond interaction between nitro groups of 
 <bold>6</bold> with the hydroxyl group of S62, which is not possible for derivatives 
 <bold>9 b</bold>–
 <bold>f</bold>. The low activity of compounds 
 <bold>11 b</bold> can be attributed to the lack of appropriate substituents on the phenyl ring able to interact with S62. On the other hand, the carbazole ring proved to be crucial for the antiviral activity since its replacement with other rings in 
 <bold>12</bold> and 
 <bold>14</bold> led to inactive compounds. Derivatives 
 <bold>21 c</bold>, 
 <bold>21 e</bold> and 
 <bold>21 f</bold> showed good activity against ZIKV MTase at concentrations similar to 
 <bold>6</bold> (IC
 <sub>50</sub>=23–48 μM). It is likely that the 
 <italic>N‐</italic>benzyl or 
 <italic>N</italic>‐phenylethyl substituents in compounds 
 <bold>21</bold> are helping these compounds to bind to the viral proteins even if no substantial improvement from 
 <bold>6</bold> was detected. A dose–response curve for hit compound 
 <bold>6</bold> is reported in Figure
