 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> and the compounds in the NCI Diversity Set V database docked in the S‐adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding site in order to identify molecules that might disrupt the activity of the enzyme. A set of 40 best ranking molecules were initially identified, among which the urea 
 <bold>6</bold> emerged as the best candidate due to its favorable interactions with the SAM binding site. The urea 
 <bold>6</bold> was thus evaluated in enzymatic inhibition assays against ZIKV NS5‐MTase, showing an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 35 μM (Table 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). A similar IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 38 μM was observed when 
 <bold>6</bold> was assayed against DENV NS5‐MTase. Due to the novelty of the structure when compared to known flavivirus inhibitors, the urea 
 <bold>6</bold> was thus selected as a hit compound for further studies. Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b shows the most favorable binding pose of the hit compound 
 <bold>6</bold> in the ZIKV NS5‐MTase binding pocket. The urea spacer connects the carbazole with a 2‐methyl‐4‐nitro‐phenyl group, which occupies the region that interacts with the methionine backbone of SAM (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). The nitro group of 
 <bold>6</bold> interacts with the side chain of S62 in a similar way to the SAM carboxyl group, possibly stabilizing the interaction of the compound with the protein. The high sequence and structural identity between ZIKV and DENV NS5‐MTases led to the identical binding of compound 
 <bold>6</bold> in both proteins (Figure 
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c).
