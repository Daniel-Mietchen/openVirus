<p>Within this context, viral proteins represent appealing targets for the development of novel antiviral therapies. Examples of current flavivirus inhibitors, such as

 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">20</xref> The NS3 and NS5 proteins of DENV and ZIKV show a high degree of homology, and their crystal structures have recently been determined.

 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> While DENV NS5‐polymerase has been investigated by a number of research groups as a potential target for development of new antivirals, there has been very little work carried out on DENV and ZIKV NS5‐MTase.

 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> The NS5‐MTase is responsible for maturation of the viral RNA cap and catalyzes the methylation of the N7 position of a guanine and the 2′‐OH of the first ribonucleotide to yield

 </sub>‐RNA.
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> These methylations of the RNA cap structure play a key role during virus replication and are critical to virus survival in infected animals.
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> Indeed, biochemical studies and reverse genetic analysis have shown that N7‐MTase activity is essential for mRNA translation into viral protein, and so viruses devoid of N7‐MTase show a strongly reduced replication phenotype.
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> By contrast, 2′‐
 <italic>O</italic>‐MTase defective viruses can replicate moderately well in infected cells, but are highly attenuated in mice or rhesus monkey and induce a strong antiviral response.
 <xref rid="cmdc201900533-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> Thus, the inhibition of both N7‐ and 2′‐
 <italic>O</italic>‐MTase activities should restrain viral replication, making the NS5‐MTase a promising target for the development of new anti‐ZIKV, and potentially anti‐DENV, antivirals.
