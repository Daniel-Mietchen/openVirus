<p>The MTases were incubated with radiolabeled [
 <sup>3</sup>H]‐SAM together with the GpppAC
 <sub>4</sub> RNA substrate and the different compounds at 50 μM. The reaction was stopped after 30 mins at 30 °C. The sample products were filtered on a DEAE membrane to remove non‐incorporated [
 <sup>3</sup>H]‐SAM, and radioactivity transferred on the RNA substrate was counted. Compounds

 <bold>9 a</bold>, 
 <bold>9 d</bold>, 
 <bold>21 b</bold>, 
 <bold>21 c</bold>, 
 <bold>21 e</bold> and 
 <bold>21 f</bold> showed inhibition of ZIKV NS5‐MTase higher than ∼30 %. The compound 
 <bold>21 e</bold> and 
 <bold>21 f</bold> showed the more potent reduction of ZIKV NS5‐MTase activity of ∼70 %.
