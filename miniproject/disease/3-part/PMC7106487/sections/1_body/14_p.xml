<p>In summary, a structure‐based virtual screening protocol on a set of chemical libraries using the ZIKV NS5‐MTase was performed leading to the identification of a novel class of carbazoyl‐urea inhibitors. Compounds 
 <bold>6</bold> and 
 <bold>21 c</bold>, 
 <bold>21 e</bold>, 
 <bold>21 f</bold> showed inhibitory activity against ZIKV MTase as well as the related DENV MTase. Conversely, the urea derivative 
 <bold>15</bold> showed an antiviral effect against ZIKV with EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.67 μM, despite its poor inhibitory activity toward the NS5‐MTase 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Studies to identify novel MTase inhibitors, to optimize the structure‐activity relationships of carbazoyl‐urea analogues of 
 <bold>6</bold> and to fully unravel their mode of action are currently in progress in our laboratories.
