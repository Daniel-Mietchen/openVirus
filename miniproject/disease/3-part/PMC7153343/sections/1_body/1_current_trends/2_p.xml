<p id="p0070">Each year, approximately 600 million travelers transport pathogens between places and provide a means for infectious disease to spread across borders. The increased globalization of the world has resulted in travel and trade being facilitated on a global scale, which has caused infectious diseases to spread more easily to countries that were previously unaffected. Moreover, there is a higher prevalence of infectious diseases in low-income and developing countries due to increased poverty, social inequality, and conflict, leading to increased susceptibility and a decreased capacity to effectively provide sufficient treatment.</p>
