<p id="p0115">Zoonotic pathogens account for 60.3% of all EIDs, of which an estimated 70.8% are contracted through contact with wildlife. In this context, understanding human contact with wildlife and how to minimize it in hotspots with highly biodiverse fauna can help contain new incidences. Moreover, the limited outbreak of EIDs in areas where conservation efforts have drastically reduced anthropogenic contacts with wildlife means more conservation efforts will lead to a substantial decline of EIDS. It is also crucial to institute smart surveillance in areas of high population density to avoid new strains of infection from reemerging.</p>
