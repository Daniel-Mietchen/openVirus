<p id="p0095">In the meantime, there is urgency in building a global network consisting of a team of specialists in EIDs. This network will be hinged on improved communication surrounding risks of outbreaks in global hotspots that are difficult to access. This will be foundational to addressing outbreaks, as the WHO has observed that areas with more frequent outbreaks and endemic cases of reemerging infectious diseases such as HIV, HBV, and Ebola tend to be in low- and middle-income countries. Budget constraints in allocations for emergencies and laboratory research may therefore be undermining efforts at total eradication of EIDs in these areas. The lack of coordinated effort in understanding the nature and extent of outbreaks among specialists may be a major contributory factor where isolated cases of EIDs easily escalate to full-blown epidemics. Therefore, a global network of specialist and experts is key in designing future responses to EIDs.</p>
