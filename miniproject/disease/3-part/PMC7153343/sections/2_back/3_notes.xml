 <p>The threat of emerging and infectious diseases (EIDs) to human health, society, and the global economy is increasing as infectious diseases continue to evolve and spread. To illustrate, in 2016 alone over 1 million people died from HIV, and 216 million people contracted Malaria. Furthermore, the SARS outbreak in 2002 resulted in death for 700 out of the 8000 infected patients within 6 months, with the survivors experiencing ill health and, in some cases, disability. Clearly, infectious diseases such as SARS place added stress on healthcare systems in affected countries as these systems must mobilize resources to effectively deal with the epidemics. They also create tensions within communities and decrease economic prosperity. For example, travel, tourism, and retail sales dropped dramatically during the SARS epidemic, especially in Asia where the disease originated and was most prevalent. Globally, the economic impact of SARS was estimated to be $30–100 billion USD. Emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are largely preventable, and yet with their profound impact and increasing prevalence, they remain a threat to global health, which must be addressed.</p>
