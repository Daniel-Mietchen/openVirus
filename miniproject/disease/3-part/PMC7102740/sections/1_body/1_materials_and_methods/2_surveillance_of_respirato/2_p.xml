<p id="par0035">During 2011–2016 an event-based surveillance system was also in place that collected information on “unusual” respiratory events posing a potential risk to public health 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These were defined as hospitalized or deceased SARI cases matching at least one of the following criteria: aged 5–64 years with no comorbidities; healthcare workers; swine and poultry workers; recent travels to sites with transmission of highly pathogenic respiratory agents; or belonging to a SARI cluster. These “unusual” SARI cases were left in the database since they provided &lt;4% of all specimens and their exclusion did not alter the results.
