<p id="par0120">We conducted a retrospective comparative analysis of syndromic surveillance data from Ecuador (2009â€“2016), using different methodological approaches to compare the epidemiology, age distribution, and CFR of RVIs caused by different viruses types and subtypes. The overall PDR was 26.8%, with influenza and RSV accounting for most test-positive specimens. Comparing the overall and virus-specific PDR between studies is made problematic by the variability of factors like the demographic structure of the country, the surveillance scheme and the clinical features of patients being sampled, the sampling techniques being used

 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. By and large, a viral aetiology could be established in a smaller number of patients compared to previous studies

 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, which might be explained by the failure to detect common causes of RVIs like rhinovirus, coronavirus, and others
