<p id="par0110">The overall PDR ranged within a narrow interval (26.2% and 30.0%) in all age groups except the elderly (≥65 years), where it was 15.8% (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The virus-specific PDR was dependent on age for most respiratory viruses. In the multinomial logistic regression, young children (&lt;1 and 1–4 years) were significantly more likely to test positive for RSV, adenovirus, parainfluenza or hMPV, and less likely to test positive for influenza, than young adults (18–39 years) (
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). Instead, older children (5–17 years) were more likely to be detected with influenza B (in addition to RSV, adenovirus or parainfluenza) than young adults. There were no significant differences between young (18–39 years) and older (40–64) adults. The elderly were less likely to test positive for the A(H1N1)p influenza, and more likely to be detected with adenovirus, than young adults.
