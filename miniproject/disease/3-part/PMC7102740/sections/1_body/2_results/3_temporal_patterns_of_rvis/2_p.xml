<p id="par0105">The average monthly PDR differed between respiratory viruses (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The most distinct seasonality was for RSV, whose average monthly PDR peaked in March (21.7%) and had its trough in September-October (1.6% in both months). The period of the year with the most intense influenza activity embraced December (PDR 13.2%) and January (PDR 14.2%); a milder (PDR 8.2%â€“8.3%), yet longer peak of activity was in June-August. The peak of influenza activity in December and January was mainly driven by the A(H1N1)p and A(H3N2) virus subtypes, while the peak of activity in June-August was caused by influenza A(H1N1)p and B (
