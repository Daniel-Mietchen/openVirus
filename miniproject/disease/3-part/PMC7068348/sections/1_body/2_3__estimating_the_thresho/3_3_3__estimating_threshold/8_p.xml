<p>At the national level, when the weekly average temperature was less than 27.21 °C, a 1 °C increase in average temperature caused the expected value of BI to increase by 0.09 unit. When the weekly average temperature was higher than 27.21°C, a 1 °C increase in temperature led to a 0.26 unit increase in the expected value of BI. For the southern regions of Taiwan, the impacts of all weather factors on dengue vector index were stronger than those at the national level. Specifically, when the weekly average temperature was less than 27.27 °C, a 1 °C increase in temperature led to a 0.29 unit increase in the expected value of BI. When the weekly average temperature was between 27.27 and 30.17 °C, the expected value of BI increased by 0.63 units for every additional degree Celsius increase. When the weekly average temperature was above 30.17 °C, a 1 °C increase in temperature caused the expected value of BI to increase by 1.49 units.</p>
