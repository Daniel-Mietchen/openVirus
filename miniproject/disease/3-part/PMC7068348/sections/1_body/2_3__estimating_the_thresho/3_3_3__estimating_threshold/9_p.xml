<p>The empirical results also indicated that the impacts of precipitation and relative humidity on dengue vector index vary under different regimes of weekly average temperature. At the national level, relative humidity had a negative effect on BI when weekly average temperature was less than 27.21 째C. However, this effect became positive when weekly average temperature exceeded 27.21 째C. For the southern region of Taiwan, the effects of relative humidity on the expected value of BI became stronger when temperature increased. There were significant positive effects of precipitation on the expected value of BI when weekly average temperature was below 30.2 째C. However, the effects of precipitation on the expected value of BI became insignificant when the weekly average temperature rose above 30.2 째C.</p>
