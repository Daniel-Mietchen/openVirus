<p>Extreme changes in weather and climate events containing extreme temperature events are highly likely to increase in both frequency and strength in the future. It is important to identify potential temperature thresholds for dengue vector indices in order to quantify the effects of temperature on climate-related spread of dengue and better support early warning systems for dengue epidemics. Therefore, our research findings can provide valuable information for future epidemiological studies investigating the relationship between climatic factors and dengue fever incidence.</p>
