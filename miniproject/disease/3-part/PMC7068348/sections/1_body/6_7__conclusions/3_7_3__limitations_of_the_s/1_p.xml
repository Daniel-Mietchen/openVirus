<p>Although we identified potential threshold effects of climate factors on dengue, our analysis had several limitations. First, due to the lack of long-term data on meteorological and other socio-ecological changes, the empirical estimates of climate effects on dengue may change when more data become available in the future. Second, dengue cases may be underestimated due to asymptomatic infection cases, and the quality of vector surveillance data may also vary county by county due to differences in the procedure and effort investing in the surveillance. As a result, empirical estimates at the national level may be less accurate than those at regional levels. Finally, our empirical analysis was based on weekly county-level panel data, which did not effectively take the geographical dimension into account due to the lack of detailed dengue surveillance data. However, research on estimating the effects of climate factors on dengue should not be limited to the analysis of panel data. Spatiotemporal approaches with more detailed dengue surveillance data could better describe the spatial spreading and transmission patterns of dengue epidemic.</p>
