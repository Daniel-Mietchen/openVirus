<p>Future studies are recommended to develop models at regional scale with more detailed community-level data and spatial information. In addition, the methodology proposed in this study could also be utilized for other regions/countries to estimate the relationship between climatic factors, vector indices, and dengue incidence. This would be very useful to support an early warning system for dengue epidemics worldwide, because it has been found that the habitat range of dengue vectors has expanded from areas of low latitude to mid- or high-latitude regions as the temperature has increased. Therefore, future studies are encouraged to focus on the climate-related habitat expansion and spread of dengue vectors.</p>
