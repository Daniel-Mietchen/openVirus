<p>On the assumption that other factors affecting dengue cases remain the same, we also found that increases of Breteau index resulted in substantial increases in the risk of dengue fever. Investigating the potential effects of future climate change on the dengue vector index, we found that increases in projected temperature caused the value of BI to increase, ranging from a low value of 3.51% to a high value of 17.75% at the national level. For the southern region of Taiwan, the impacts were much stronger, with increases in the value between 5.13 and 54.42%. This implies that southern regions will be more vulnerable to climate-change-induced dengue fever and hence more effects should be devoted to reducing the risk in this region.</p>
