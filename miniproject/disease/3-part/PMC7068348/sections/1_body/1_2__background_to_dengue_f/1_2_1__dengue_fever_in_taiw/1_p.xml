However, serious dengue outbreaks were recorded again in 1981 (13,000 reported cases) on the islet of Hsiao-Liu Chiu, Pingtung (Hsieh, 1982; Wu, 1986). After that, a DENV-1 epidemic occurred during the 1987–1988 period in southern Taiwan. Among 10,420 reported cases, the total number of indigenous cases was 5,336, with 241 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever, including 19 deaths [
