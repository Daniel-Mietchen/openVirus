<p>Many studies have found associations between climate conditions and the transmission of dengue. According to their findings, temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity have been identified as the most important climate variables related to the transmission of dengue. Additionally, mosquito larval indices have been widely used to predict the transmission of dengue. For example, Hwang [
 <xref rid="B36-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] explored the relationship between 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes and dengue fever epidemics in Taiwan in 1988â€“1990. The distribution and density of two different types of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (
 <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>) were assessed in his study. The results indicated that the larval and adult density of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> and the larval density of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are correlated with temperature, rainfall, and relative humidity. Increases in 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> density were positively correlated to increases in temperature and rainfall. The peak of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> density was also directly related to rainfall. Furthermore, the number of dengue fever cases was significantly correlated with seasonal population fluctuations and the regional density of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.
