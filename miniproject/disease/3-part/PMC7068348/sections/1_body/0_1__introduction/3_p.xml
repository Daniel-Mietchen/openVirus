<p>The relationship between dengue incidence and climate change has been extensively studied, but so far little attention has been paid to the threshold effects of climate on dengue vector indices. For policy purposes, it is important to construct a reliable alert system for checking and tracing whether a threshold effect of temperature on vector index exists in order to effectively reduce dengue risk. By monitoring the average temperature to see whether it has reached the threshold temperature or not, dengue fever prevention plans could be better prepared to avoid disease outbreaks. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to estimate the threshold effects of temperature on the Breteau index and to explore how this entomological index and the incidence of dengue fever are related in Taiwan. Our findings can provide valuable information for policy-makers in the implementation of public health measures to prevent and control dengue fever in the future. To fulfill our research goals, the specific objectives of the study were defined as (1) to examine the threshold effects of meteorological factors on a dengue vector index (BI); (2) to investigate the relationship between BI and the number of confirmed dengue cases; and (3) to explore the potential impacts of temperature on the BI dengue vector index under future climate change scenarios.</p>
