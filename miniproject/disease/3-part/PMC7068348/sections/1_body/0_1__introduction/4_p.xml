<p>Evidence has shown that climate–dengue associations may vary within-country/-region or even within-province [

 <xref rid="B24-ijerph-17-01392" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Therefore, our empirical models included a nationwide model and a southern Taiwan model, including Tainan, Kaohsiung, and Pingtung counties, for comparison purpose. By combining the panel threshold regression technique with count data models, we estimated the non-linear relationship between temperature and mosquito larval index (BI). To proceed, we first employed Hansen’s panel threshold model [

Corresponding to different temperature regimes, data were then decomposed into different sets and negative binomial regression models were applied to assess the non-linear relationship between meteorological factors and BI. We also explored how the number of confirmed cases of dengue fever and vector surveillance data are related in Taiwan. Finally, climate change scenarios simulated by the Taiwan Climate Change Projection and Information Platform (TCCIP) were factored into the estimated coefficients to estimate the potential impacts of future climate change on the BI dengue vector index in Taiwan.
