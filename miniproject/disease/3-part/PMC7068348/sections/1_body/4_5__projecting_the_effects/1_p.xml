<p>To investigate the potential effects of future climate change on the dengue vector index, temperature projections were retrieved from the Taiwan Climate Change Projection Information and Adaptation Knowledge Platform (TCCIP). This future climate change projection is the simulation of future possible climate scenarios in Taiwan at a 5 × 5km resolution for the 2021–2100 period with a baseline period of 1886–2005. A a set of four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) was employed in this study: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5, corresponding to radiative forcing levels of 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5 watts per square meter, respectively.</p>
