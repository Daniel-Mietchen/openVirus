<p>At the nationwide level, the increase in BI peaked at 5.30% in the 2041-2060 period in the RCP 2.6 scenario. For the RCP 4.5 scenario, the increase in BI peaked at 8.87% in the 2081–2100 period. The BI reached a 11.18% increase in the 2081–2100 period in the RCP 6.0 scenario. For the RCP 8.5 scenario, the BI increase reached 17.75% in the 2081-2100 period. Under future climate change scenarios, average temperatures in the southern region exceeded the threshold level of 27.27 °C in the RCP 6.0 scenario during the 2081–2100 period (27.35 °C). For the RCP 8.5 scenario, average temperatures exceeded the threshold level of 27.27 °C during the periods of 2061–2080 (27.71 °C) and 2081–2100 (28.47 °C). Under the RCP 8.5 scenario, values of BI were predicted to increase more dramatically in the southern region than at the nationwide level, peaking at 40.77% and 54.54% during the periods of 2061–2081 and 2081–2100, respectively.</p>
