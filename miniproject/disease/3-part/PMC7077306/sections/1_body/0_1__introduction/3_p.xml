 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Amplifications of CHIKV have been detected at approximately 5-year intervals. This interval is hypothesized to be the time necessary for the turnover of susceptible vertebrate hosts, mainly nonhuman primates [

Indeed, 20 confirmed human cases were reported in the Kedougou and Saraya districts, mainly in gold mining sites. In parallel, 42 CHIKV-infected mosquito pools were obtained by RT-PCR from September to December 2009, mainly from 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> (16 pools), 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> (5 pools)
