<p>Age was classified as &lt;5, 5 to 9, 10 to 19, 20 to 39, 40 to 59, and ≥60 years. Associations of seroprevalence with the age and sex of individuals were investigated by logistic regression analysis, and statistical significance was assessed with a likelihood ratio test. The models included random intercepts for villages and rural communities to adjust for clustering of surveyed individuals. Confidence intervals of seroprevalence by sex or age group were obtained based on the exact binomial method. We included a sex-age interaction term to explore potential greater exposure to infections on certain groups (i.e., male adults be more exposed during their activities outside their resident villages), considering that age groups reflect different occupational activities (&lt;20, 20 to 59, and ≥60 years), and stratified by population density (locations with ≤400 and &gt;400 people per km
 <sup>2</sup>).
