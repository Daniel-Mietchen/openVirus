<p>The sampling method was based on a two-level cross-sectional randomized cluster sampling adapted from the WHO procedure. The sampling frame was the list of villages drawn up for the 2002 national census. The Kedougou region was first divided into 3 districts. For each district, 40 villages were randomly selected using the cumulative total method. In each of the selected villages, 10 persons by randomly selected household were sampled. From each consented individual, 5 mL of intravenous blood was taken. Samples were centrifuged, and serum aliquoted, and sent in liquid nitrogen to the Dakar Pasteur Institute for anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies ELISA, according to the method described by Traore-Lamizana et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Briefly, indirect IgG ELISA testing was performed on Microplate ELISA 96-well Maxisorp. After a coating step with CHIKV mouse hyperimmune ascitic fluid, followed by CHIKV antigen capture, samples were added, and specific antibody-antigen complexes were revealed by an anti-human IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugated antibody (KPL, USA). An ELISA microplate reader showed the Optical Density (OD) and sera as positive samples if the OD was â‰¥0.20 and the ratio (R) between the sample and the negative control was &gt;2.
