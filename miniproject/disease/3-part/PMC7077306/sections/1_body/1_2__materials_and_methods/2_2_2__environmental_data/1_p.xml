<p>A suite of environmental, topographical, and demographic datasets was used to explore potential drivers of CHIKV outbreaks in the study area. From the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00196" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] product, we downloaded global MOD13Q1 data, which include vegetation indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), and the mid-infrared band (MIR). The NDVI and EVI are effective for quantifying green vegetation but the EVI was specifically developed to be more sensitive to changes in areas having high biomass, while MIR has been found to be useful to discriminate water surfaces [

Environmental, topographic, and demographic data were extracted for village point locations as average values over a buffer zone of 1 km radius. We further assessed sensitivity of estimates to buffer size by repeating the analysis with a buffer zone of a 3 km radius to account for movement of individuals around village locations.
