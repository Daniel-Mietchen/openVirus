 </xref> is acquired through ingestion of unpasteurized milk, although transmission can occur after direct contact with animal parts or, in laboratories, through inhalation of aerosolized particles. It has a global distribution, with a higher prevalence in the Middle East, Balkans, former USSR, the Mediterranean, and South America. Symptoms develop 2 to 4 weeks after exposure (up to 6 months) and vary from an acute febrile illness to a chronic low-grade relapsing fever; signs include lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly. Complications of brucellosis are commonâ€”in particular, large-joint septic arthritis, sacroiliitis, and, less commonly, spondylitis of the lumbar spine. Other complications include epididymo-orchitis, septic abortion, neurologic involvement (meningitis, encephalitis, and abscess), and endocarditis.
