  <p>Optimization by SVC with the most different (d)nts between human and avian virus segments. The sorted 60 (d)nts were successively put into the accumulating feature list for the SVC (random state = 1 and cv = 5); the MA of the three cross-validation scores (cross_val importance) (MA3) and the cross_val importance itself for each segment were curved (
   <italic>A</italic>–
   <italic>F</italic>). The first 9, 12, 11, 13, 10, 9 (d)nts in each list were defined as the best features for PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NA (
   <italic>G</italic>), respectively, when the cross_val importance curve crossed the MA3 curve. (
   <italic>H</italic>) Boxplot of the best 9 (d)nts for the PB2 segment; the Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test was performed between the two groups for each (d)nt, and the 
   <italic>P</italic>-value is indicated.
