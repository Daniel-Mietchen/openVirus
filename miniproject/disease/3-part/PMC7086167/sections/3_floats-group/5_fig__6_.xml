  <p>The distribution of the subtypes and hosts of human-adaptive IAV sequences before the 2009 influenza pandemic. The human adaptation was predicted by the SVC model with a probability threshold of 0.5. The total number of sequences, the number of human-adaptive sequences, and the human adaptation ratio are quantitatively presented by the size of the red and green circles and the height of the blue histogram in polar coordinates. The labels of the top 20 subtypes (
   <italic>A</italic>) or the top 20 hosts (
   <italic>B</italic>) for the US-resampled sequences (left part of A/B) or for all IAV sequences (right part of A/B) are indicated. The subtypes and hosts are listed in descending order.
