<p>To evaluate the importance of each (d)nt, we first sorted the (d)nts with a PCA/SVC combined model. Three thousand and five hundred and forty iterations of PCA/SVC analysis were performed to transform every four (d)nts into one PCA component, which was then utilized for the SVC classification of the avian and human IAV sequences. Thus, the 60 (d)nts were sorted according to their average area under the curve (AUC) (a) of the repeated above-mentioned PCA/SVC analysis. Supervised ML models (GBRT, MLP, RFC, and SVC) were utilized to evaluate the efficiency of the sorted (d)nts as human/avian classification features. Accumulated (d)nts, from 1 to 60 from the sorted list, were input into each of the four models, and the Cross_val score was utilized as an efficiency indicator. The optimized ML (d)nt number was defined as the number of the accumulated (d)nts, with which the Cross_val score did not increase as much as the (d)nt number accumulation, was evaluated by the MA strategy (
