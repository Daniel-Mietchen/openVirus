<p>In total, 59–61 sequence samples were randomly selected (random state = 1) from each segment sequence set (3.59–5.01% of the total sequences) via pandas.DataFrame.sample (Python). Then, MEGA (MEGA 7.0.26, 
 <xref rid="msz276-B20" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et al. 2016</xref>) was utilized to build a maximum likelihood tree with the Tamura–Nei model (
 <xref rid="msz276-B41" ref-type="bibr">Tamura and Nei 1993</xref>) for PB2 (A) and the other five segments (B–F). The parameters were set as follows: uniform rates among sites, gaps complete deletion, the ML heuristic method set to the nearest-neighbor interchange, and with making the initial tree automatically (default—NJ/BioNJ) as an initial tree. Multiple and pairwise alignments were performed with ClustalW with a gap-opening penalty of 15, a gap extension penalty of 6.66, an IUB DNA weight matrix, and a transition weight of 0.5 before a phylogenetic tree was built. Another two rounds of random resampling were performed from each segment sequence set with the same sampling ratio as mentioned above, and the maximum likelihood tree was built with the same parameters.
