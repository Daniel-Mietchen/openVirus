<p>PCA is a widely utilized unsupervised ML model for constructing a low-rank model of a data matrix. For the following (d)nt sorting, an orthogonal transformation by PCA (
 <xref rid="msz276-B16" ref-type="bibr">Jolliffe and Cadima 2016</xref>) was performed to convert every four (d)nts with possible correlations into one principal component, with the most significant possible variance (formula 4). For the evaluation of the separability between avian and human sequences, PCA was also utilized to transform the information of all (60) or the optimized (d)nts into two principal components.
