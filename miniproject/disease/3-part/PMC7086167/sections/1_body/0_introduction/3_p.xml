<p>Gene sequencing technology and machine/deep learning methods have facilitated virus sequence identification of a considerably large data set, including IAVs. Machine learning (ML) methods have recently demonstrated their effectiveness in multiple disciplinary fields, including virology. The distinct host tropism protein signatures of IAVs (

 <xref rid="msz276-B10" ref-type="bibr">Eng et al. 2017</xref>), and even the avian-to-human transmission risk of IAVs (
 <xref rid="msz276-B31" ref-type="bibr">Qiang et al. 2018</xref>) have been recognized. The host dependence of mononucleotides (nts) and tetranucleotide compositions of influenza viruses has also been studied with ML methods (

 <xref rid="msz276-B44" ref-type="bibr">Tulloch et al. 2014</xref>) and replication (
 <xref rid="msz276-B48" ref-type="bibr">Witteveldt et al. 2016</xref>) of IAV viruses. Species-specific (
 <xref rid="msz276-B13" ref-type="bibr">Glass et al. 2007</xref>) and virus-family-specific (
 <xref rid="msz276-B8" ref-type="bibr">Di Giallonardo et al. 2017</xref>) dinucleotide compositions have also been computationally recognized. More recently, the dinucleotide composition in RNA virus genomes accurately predicts viral reservoir hosts and arthropod vectors using ML methods (
 <xref rid="msz276-B2" ref-type="bibr">Babayan et al. 2018</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesize that genomic dinucleotide composition is another crucial genomic feature for influenza viruses, which is most likely amino acid independent, and may be useful for characterizing the human adaptation feature of IAVs.
