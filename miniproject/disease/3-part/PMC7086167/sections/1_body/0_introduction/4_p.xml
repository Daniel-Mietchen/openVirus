<p>In the present study, 60 types of mono- and dinucleotide compositions were analyzed based on the nucleotide position within a codon in the full-length coding sequences of the first six genomic segments of IAVs: PB2 (polymerase basic protein 2), PB1, PA (polymerase acidic protein), HA (hemagglutinin), NP (nucleoprotein), and NA (neuraminidase). These (d)nts were optimized based on their relative importance, with principal component analysis (PCA) and support vector classifier (SVC) methods. Then, ML models of gradient-boosted regression trees (GBRT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier, random forest (RF) classifier, and SVC were built to analyze and predict the human adaptation of human-, swine-, or avian-origin IAVs. Our models perform well in predicting human-adaptive swine or avian IAVs.</p>
