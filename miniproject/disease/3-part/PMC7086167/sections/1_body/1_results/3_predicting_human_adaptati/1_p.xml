<p>The unsupervised clustering and supervised two-category classification with the four ML classifiers mentioned above were performed to evaluate the effectiveness of the characterized (d)nts for human/avian IAV classification. It was demonstrated that the two principal components of the nine optimized (d)nts were separable in distribution between avian and human sequence sets for the PB2 (

Such separability was also indicated by the hierarchical clustering of both sequence sets. The majority of the human and avian PB2 sequences were clustered into two groups for the PB2 segment (

Interestingly, the PA sequences of A(H1N1)pdm09 were clustered into the avian sequence group, thought distinctive from other human sequences and avian sequences, as indicated previously (
