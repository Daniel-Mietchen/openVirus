<p>The human adaptation of the sequence-resampled sequence set from the United States and all-sequence set was predicted (with an SVC probability threshold of 0.5) by the above-mentioned SVC model. Then, the association of such adaptation was analyzed with sequence labels, such as subtype and host. Regardless of the other labels, the H1N2 subtype was highly adaptive to humans (approximately 75% by both sequence sets, the left and right parts in

 </xref>), as well as the designated human-adaptive H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes. There were 10% or more human-adaptive sequences for H2N2 and H11N9, mixed or H4N8 sequences in the sequence-resampled sequence set from the United States (left part of

 </xref>). Surprisingly, 16.4% and 19.4% of the turkey sequences from the two sets were human-adaptive sets, ranking first for avian hosts; more than 10% sequences were human-adaptive sets from other birds, such as American black ducks, shorebirds, gulls, blue-winged teal, and quails in either sequence set (
