<p>A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, also known as swine-origin IAVs (H1N1) (S-OIVs), first emerged in North America (

 <xref rid="msz276-B26" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al. 2015</xref>), we analyzed the worldwide distribution of human-adaptive swine and avian sequences before the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. It was indicated that North America and East Asia were the high-risk areas of human-adaptive swine sequences (
 <xref rid="msz276-T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>) for the six IAV segments, based on the human adaptation ratio. Notably, the United States is ranked first for the absolute number of human-adaptive sequences for each segment. East Asia, particularly Hong Kong and mainland China, had larger human adaptation ratios. Human-adaptive avian sequences are dominantly distributed in the United States and China (
 <xref rid="msz276-T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the United States still led the world in the number or proportion of human-adaptive sequences for the five segments (
 <xref rid="msz276-T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), except NA (maximum in China) (
 <xref rid="msz276-T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Accordingly, such distribution bias of human-adaptive swine and avian sequences was consistent with the origin of each segment for the 2009 H1N1 pandemic (
