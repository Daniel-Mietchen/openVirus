<p>The influence of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic on the human adaptation of avian and swine IAVs post-2009 was also evaluated. As indicated in 
 <xref rid="msz276-T2" ref-type="table">tableÂ 2</xref>, all six segments of avian sequences decreased in terms of the human adaptation ratio, although the adaptive sequence number increased. In particular, the adaptive sequences of PB1, PA, and HA increased much more (over the median level). For swine viruses, all six segments of the sequences, particularly for NA, PA, and HA (over the median level), increased in terms of both the human adaptation ratio and adaptive sequence number.
