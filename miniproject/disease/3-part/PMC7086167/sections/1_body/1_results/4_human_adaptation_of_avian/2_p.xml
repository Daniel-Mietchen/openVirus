<p>Furthermore, the hierarchical clustering analysis of the S-OIVs with the IAVs before 2009 was performed based on the SVC model-characterized (d)nts by random sampling 1,000 samples from the total samples. As indicated (

S-OIV PB1 was most closely clustered with the human H3N2 viruses before or after 2000 in the United States (
