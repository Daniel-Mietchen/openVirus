<p>As the workflow diagram in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="msz276-F1">figure 1
  <italic>A</italic>
 </xref> shows, data wrangling was performed for IAV open reading frame (ORF) sequences. Twelve types of mononucleotides (nts) and 48 types of dinucleotides (dnts) in the ORF were counted for all the sequence samples. The phylogeny of the sample ORF sequences, the hierarchical clustering of sequence samples based on the 60 (d)nts,, and the distribution of the sequence samples, in each type of sequence label, were analyzed (

 </xref>). The 60 (d)nts were sorted based on their importance (cross-validation score, cv_Score) for the classifier with PCA and SVC methods (

 </xref>), which were optimized with ML approaches from the sorted (d)nts, were utilized for the final data optimization and the final prediction (
