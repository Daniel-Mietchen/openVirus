<p>In total, 226,183 full-length coding sequences for the first six segments (PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NA), available up to December 31, 2018, had skewed distributions for the labels of country/area, host, subtype, segment, or year. In total, 8,634 sequences were dropped, beyond the length range had repeated sequence IDs (

Random resampling was performed to maintain a ratio of approximately 1:1 for the sequences from the United States and mainland China, the second largest influenza sample country. The resampled 83,980 avian and human sequences available for feature extraction and model building were dominantly from North America and East and Southeast Asia, particularly from the United States and China (
