<p>Phylogenetic relationships were inferred on the basis of putative RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps), as they shared conserved domains across all RNA viruses. All the phylogenies described in this manuscript used clades, nomenclature and sequences provided by Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. RdRp amino acid sequences of the newly discovered viruses were trimmed to include only conserved domains and aligned using MAFFT v7 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] with the E-INS-i algorithm. Phylogenetic trees were then generated using the maximum likelihood approach (ML) implemented in IQ-TREE [
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] with default parameters.
