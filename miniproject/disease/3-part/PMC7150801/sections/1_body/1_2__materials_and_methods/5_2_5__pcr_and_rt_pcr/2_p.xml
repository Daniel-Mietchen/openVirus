<p>For each RNA pool used for library construction, cDNA was synthesized from total RNA (200 ng) using the High Capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Specific primers were designed for all the newly identified viruses. RT-PCR was also conducted to determine the prevalence of the European viruses in the original unpooled RNA samples. The absence of contaminating genomic DNA was verified, including in the PCR step samples without the reverse transcription step.</p>
