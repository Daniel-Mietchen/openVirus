<p>The pre-assembly steps were performed using the suite of bioinformatic tools called BBTools v38.70 [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Raw paired-end files were processed for removal of Illumina adaptor sequences and artifacts, and for length and ribosomal filtering via kmer matching using BBDuk. To avoid unwanted environmental contaminants, the remaining reads were further analyzed to remove reads matching to human, mouse and dog sequences, using BBMap. Finally, BBMerge and BBNorm were used for merging overlapping paired reads and normalizing read coverage before assembling with Trinity v2.6.6 [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Some of the resulting sequences were further assembled by CAP3 v3 (overlap length cutoff = 65; overlap percent identity cutoff N = 90) [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. DIAMOND v0.9.24.125 [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] with an E-value cut-off of 0.0001 was used to perform a blastx search for matches to viral genomes in the NCBI non redundant protein database (version October 2018). Putative viral sequences were further checked and analyzed manually, in an effort to exclude as much as possible viruses associated with insect food (especially grapevine), gut microflora or possible parasites. Such filtering was based on similarities with known plant, fungi and nematode viruses, and on the number of reads mapping on each viral transcript, assuming that the more common the virus was, the more likely it was infecting 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic>. Bowtie2 [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] was used to map reads against the reference transcripts with parameters that selected only reads that mapped in pairs with the right orientation (--no-mixed â€“no-discordant). Reads mapping onto viral genomes were expressed as RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads).
