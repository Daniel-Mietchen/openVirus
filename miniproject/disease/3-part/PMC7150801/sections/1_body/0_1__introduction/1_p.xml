 <italic>Scaphoideus titanus</italic> Ball. (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) is a phloem-feeding nearctic leafhopper that was probably introduced accidentally from North America to Europe in the late 19
 <sup>th</sup> century, in the attempt to find a solution against downy mildew and phylloxera epidemics occurring in Europe at that time [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Genetic characterization of American and European 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> populations revealed that the latters are likely to descend from a single introduction from the United States [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In its original range, 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> was mostly captured in open woodlands, on wild 
 <italic>Vitis</italic> species and only rarely on cultivated grapevines [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In Europe, by contrast, it has been reported mainly on 
 <italic>Vitis vinifera</italic>, although it is known to thrive in abandoned vineyards and wild grapevines [

 <italic>S. titanus</italic> is the primary vector of Flavescence dor√©e phytoplasma (FDp) in vineyards, and it has so far, spread to many European grape-growing countries, such as Italy [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], France [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], Hungary [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and Switzerland [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Phytoplasmas are obligate bacterial pathogens, confined mainly in the phloem tissue. Upon feeding on infected plants, sap-sucking insects, such as 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic>, can passively acquire them and transmit the pathogen to healthy plants [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. FDp is a quarantine pest of grapevine in the European Union. It typically causes color aberrations and downward-rolled margins in foliage, lack of lignification in shoots, reduced fruit setting, flower withering, bunch wilting and berry drop. In the end, infected plants either die or recover from the disease, but with a significant reduction in productivity [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The overall economy of wine-producing regions is not only affected by yield losses caused by this disease, but also by the expensive compulsory containment measures [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The only currently available control strategies focus on the reduction of vector populations in vineyards, and include uprooting of symptomatic grapevines, compulsory insecticide applications with specific timing, removal of wild vines that may act as refuges for the insect, and hot water treatments of rootstocks, scions or grafted cuttings to kill deposited eggs [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At the same time, concerns are mounting especially over the effects of pesticides on the environment, non-target organisms and human health. Consequently, it is essential to develop more sustainable alternatives to the use of chemicals. A possible option would be to exploit the largely unexplored genetic diversity of viruses infecting 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> for developing highly specific and environmentally benign tools for biological control.
