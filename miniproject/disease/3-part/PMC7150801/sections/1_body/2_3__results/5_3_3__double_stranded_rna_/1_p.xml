<p>The deduced amino acid sequences of three contigs from St_IT2, St_FR and St_CH libraries were identical and their closest relative identified by blastx (42% amino acid identity, 37% query coverage) was a dsRNA virus named Spissistilus festinus virus 1 (SpFV1) (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). According to the ICTV, less than 50% sequence identity at the protein level generally reflects a species difference, so the newly identified virus was named Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1.
