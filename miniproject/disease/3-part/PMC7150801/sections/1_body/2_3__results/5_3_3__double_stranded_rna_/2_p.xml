<p>SpFV1 has a monopartite dsRNA genome that shares similarities at the amino acid level with a variety of dsRNA viruses, some unclassified and some classified in the 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic> or 
 <italic>Chrysoviridae</italic> families [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Similarly to SpFV1 and its sister taxon Circulifer tenellus virus 1 (CiTV1) [
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], the genome organization of Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1 presented a 5′-leader sequence followed by an ORF encoding a proline-alanine rich protein (PArp), a 3′ proximal RdRp ORF, and finally a short 3′-untranslated region (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00287-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). The presence of a putative 7nt-frameshift site (AAACCCU) near the PArp ORF stop codon and a downstream stretch of 85 nucleotides that may form a pseudoknot suggested that, similarly to SpFV1 and CiTV1, the expression of the RdRp could be the result of a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00287-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). Such genomic organization is very similar to that of members of the genus 
 <italic>Totivirus</italic>. Despite that, Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1, as well as SpFV1 and CiTV1, fell into a well-supported clade distinct from the one that included viruses belonging to the family 
 <italic>Totiviridae</italic> (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00287">Supplementary Materials S9</xref>). Besides Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1, this small clade included other eight viruses isolated from members of the class Insecta and two viruses identified in plants, Cucurbit yellows-associated virus [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and Persimmon latent virus [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].
