<p>Eleven sequences from the St_USA library were identified as putative segments of a reovirus, hereafter named Scaphoideus titanus reo-like virus 1 (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00287">Supplementary Materials S4</xref>). Initially, only nine segments were assigned to this virus. The putative missing segments were then manually searched using the genome of Homalodisca vitripennis reovirus (GenBank accessions: FJ497789.1 â€“ FJ497800.1) [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] as bait. The targeted analysis succeeded in finding segments 9 and 11. The fact that both formed chimeric sequences with long insect transcripts was probably the reason for the failure to identify them by automatic blastx analysis. Segment 12 of Homalodisca vitripennis reovirus did not find any significant match with any of the contigs within the St_USA library. The phylogenetic analysis placed Scaphoideus titanus reo-like virus 1 in the phytoreovirus clade, which included Homalodisca vitripennis reovirus and two plant-infecting viruses (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00287">Supplementary Materials S10</xref>). The phytoreovirus clade was, in its turn, phylogenetically close to two reo-like viruses isolated from insects.
