<p>On the basis of the blastx results, three contigs from the St_USA library were identified as the three putative segments of a bunya-like virus, hereafter named Scaphoideus titanus bunya-like virus 1 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> have tripartite genomes consisting of a large segment (L), which encodes the RdRp, a medium (M) segment, which encodes the viral glycoprotein precursor, and a small (S) segment, which encodes the nucleoprotein (

In the case of Scaphoideus titanus bunya-like virus 1, it was possible to identify the same terminal complementary heptanucleotide in segments M and S, but not in the L segment. Despite that, the RdRp-coding sequence that we putatively assigned to this bunya-like virus was the only one found in this library that showed significant similarities with RdRps of known bunyaviruses. In addition, the phylogenetic analysis unambiguously (100% bootstrap support) placed it within the 
 <italic>Phasmaviridae</italic> cluster, a family of insect-infecting viruses in the order 
 <italic>Bunyavirales</italic> (
