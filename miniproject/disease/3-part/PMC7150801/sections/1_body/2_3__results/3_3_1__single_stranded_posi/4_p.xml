<p>Four contigs from the St_USA library were tentatively assigned to two sobemo-like viruses, hereafter referred to as Scaphoideus titanus sobemo-like virus 1 and 2 (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00287-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The two RdRps showed the highest similarity with those of Hubei sobemo-like virus 26 and Hubei sobemo-like virus 24, respectively. Despite the fact that most sobemo-like viruses described by Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] have a +ssRNA monopartite genome, we could reasonably hypothesize that each sobemo-like genome identified in 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> has a bipartite genome: the longer fragment (around 3000 bp) encodes two non-overlapping ORFs coding for a trypsin-like serine protease and an RdRp; the second shorter genomic fragment (around 1500 bp) codes for a putative capsid protein (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00287">Supplementary Materials S4</xref>). Such hypothesis was based on similar depth of coverage across the viral segments, and, above all, on the presence of the same heptanucleotide at the termini of the two segments assigned to Scaphoideus titanus sobemo-like virus 1. Consequently, the other two sequences most likely belonged to Scaphoideus titanus sobemo-like virus 2. The correct two-by-two association between long and short segments was also confirmed by RT-PCR: one insect was positive only for one couple of segments and another insect was positive only for the other couple (data not shown). Notably, both hypothetical capsid proteins were similar to a hypothetical protein identified in a nodavirus (Naganuma virus). The two newly identified sobemo-like viruses appeared to belong to two different lineages within the large clade that grouped viruses identified from a variety of arthropods (
