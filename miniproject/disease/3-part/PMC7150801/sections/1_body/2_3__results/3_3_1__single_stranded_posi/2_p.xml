<p>According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) species demarcation criteria for the genus Iflavirus [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], isolates/strains belong to the same iflavirus species if the sequence identity at the amino acid level, between their coat proteins, is above 90%. On this basis, the two European genomes significantly differed from the known iflavirus sequences, but not from each other, so they were likely to represent a single new iflavirus species, hereafter named Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1. The USA iflavirus showed a percentage of amino acid identity below 90% if compared to other known iflaviruses and Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 1. Therefore, it could represent another new iflavirus species, from here on named Scaphoideus titanus iflavirus 2.
