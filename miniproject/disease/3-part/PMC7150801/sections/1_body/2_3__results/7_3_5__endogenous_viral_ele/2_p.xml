<p>Given that 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> genome is not available, specific primers were designed on one sequence for each phylogenetic group that is characterized by an RNA genome without DNA intermediates, i.e., mononegaviruses, reoviruses and bunyaviruses (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00287">Supplementary Materials S3 and S12</xref>). PCR analyses on total DNA extracted from 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> revealed that they were indeed all endogenised into the host genome (data not shown). The potential integration of sequences similar to parvovirus genomes could not be verified by PCR, as they are DNA viruses and a PCR amplification could be due to either, an integration into the host genome or simply to the presence of the virus within the insect.
