<p>Additionally, multiple fragments with similarities to the PArp from Spissistilus festinus virus 1 were found in each European library, but, unlike the EVEs mentioned above, they were characterized by ORFs that spanned the whole sequence without any premature stop codon. Notably, none of these sequences could be assigned to the previously described genome of Scaphoideus titanus toti-like virus 1. It was possible to reconstruct a large part of the 3â€² PArp coding sequence only by using transcripts from all the European libraries together, but still the deduced protein was partial. In addition, a specific search to identify the missing RdRp failed. The fragmentation of the PArp coding sequence observed in each library and the lack of the corresponding RdRp represented clues in favor of a possible integration of these sequences into the insect genome. Specific primers designed on one of these fragments (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00287">Supplementary Materials S3 and S12</xref>), which was found in two out of the five European libraries, revealed that at least this part of the viral genome was indeed integrated into the insect genome (data not shown).
