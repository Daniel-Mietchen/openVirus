<p>Pioneered by studies of bacteriophages in the marine environment [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], undirected high-throughput sequencing is becoming the easiest and cheapest procedure for the detection and genetic characterization of new viruses or virus variants. Metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies have been radically changing virology, re-shaping virus lineages and revealing an unexpected richness of genome sizes and structures [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Although such astonishingly abundant sequences are linked to little or no biological information, there is unanimity in the assumption that genome sequences can be used to support the existence of a free/replicating virus [
 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our work we chose a metatranscriptomic approach to characterize the virome of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic>, primarily because arthropods demonstrated to harbor an unprecedented diversity of RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Secondly, transcriptome profiling can provide additional information, such as the presence of RNAs possibly expressed by DNA viruses as well as a rough quantification of the viral load within the host.
