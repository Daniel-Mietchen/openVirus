<p>The majority of meta-omics studies about the virosphere of insect vectors has been conducted mostly on species transmitting diseases of medical and veterinary importance, such as 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> [

 <xref rid="B52-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]
 <italic>, Aedes</italic> [

 <xref rid="B54-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. By contrast, investigations on viruses that may infect insect vectors of plant pathogens are scarce. Metagenomics study of 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci,</italic> vector of several plant viruses, resulted in the identification of many RNA viruses, some of which are likely to infect the whiteflies themselves [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. New putative viruses that may have the potential to be used as biocontrol agents have been discovered in 
 <italic>D. citri</italic>, the natural vector of the causal agent of Huanglongbing (HLB) [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Novel dicistrovirus-like sequences were also identified during a metagenomics project of another vector for plant-infecting viruses, 
 <italic>Aphis fabae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B58-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The nine new viral genomes described in this work probably do not depict the total diversity of viruses that may infect 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic>, as it is known that the composition of insect viromes is influenced by a variety of factors, such as diet, stage of development, geographical location [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Yet, we provide first insights into the unexplored viral community of this vector, which is responsible for the spread of FDp in European vineyards. The possibility of exploiting these naturally occurring viruses, as specific and targeted biocontrol agents of 
 <italic>S. titanus,</italic> would be a possible answer to the increasing demand for a more sustainable viticulture.
