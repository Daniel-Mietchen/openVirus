<p>Virus-like sequences often derive from mixed virus populations and, consequently, there is the risk of assembling chimeric or artefactual genomes, neglecting sequences from viruses with segmented and multipartite genomes, and assigning transcribed virus-derived sequences integrated into the host genome to actively replicating viruses [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00287" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Stringent criteria were adopted in this work to minimize, as far as possible, the bioinformatic pitfalls that may lead to mis-assemblies and misinterpretation of the newly discovered genomes. First, we only considered contigs that encoded complete, or near complete, viral genomes with intact open reading frames to avoid EVEs. Additionally, in the case of multipartite viruses, we looked for the presence of the same nucleotides at the termini of each segment to ensure the correct genome assignment. The low and variable prevalence of the two newly identified viruses in the European populations of 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> constituted a further clue in favor of true replicating viruses. On the opposite, the presence in all or almost all libraries of some viral sequences with premature stop codons supported the hypothesis that they were potential EVEs. Some of these were unambiguously demonstrated to be integrated into 
 <italic>S. titanus</italic> genome and expressed as RNAs.
