<p>This cohort study is the first to investigate the relationship between viral exposure and VF risk at first STEMI before PPCI. The study consecutively enrolled 4,659 patients with STEMI (aged 18–80 years), of whom 12% developed VF prior to PPCI. It was found that VF patients had experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with the patients without VF (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.76–6.54). The expected winter peak and summer nadir of VF were not observed. After correlating Danish viral exposure surveillance data with individual data on VF risk among first STEMI, no such relationship was found between EV or influenza exposure and occurrence of VF. Therefore, there is no support for an association between higher levels of EV or influenza and high VF prevalence.</p>
