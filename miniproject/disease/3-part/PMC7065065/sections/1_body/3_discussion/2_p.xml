<p>While it is well established that infection with pathogens that cause inflammation can result in neuropathy,
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> there have been few epidemiological studies of neuropathies in Brazil. Our results indicated that increases in GBS were related to the epidemics of H1N1 in 2009, dengue virus type 4 in 2013, and Zika virus in 2015. In 2009, a novel reassortant influenza A subtype H1N1 spilled over from swine to immunologically naïve human populations.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> In the state of Rio de Janeiro, H1N1's arrival was followed by an increase in GBS. The increases in GBS in 2013 and 2015 coincided with the introduction of novel arboviruses. Although the H1N1 epidemic in 2009 coincided with an increase in GBS, none of the patients whose charts we reviewed in 2015–2017 had symptoms of influenza or recent influenza vaccination. Epidemiological studies have not demonstrated a relationship between influenza vaccination and increased risk of GBS.
 <xref rid="ijgo13050-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref> GBS incidence may have been lower in the winter because arboviral infections happen predominantly in the summer, spring, and fall.
