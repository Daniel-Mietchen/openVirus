<p>We compared a historical time series of inflammatory polyneuropathies, which included GBS, to time series of influenza, dengue virus, and Zika virus in the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Further, we analyzed medical charts of arbovirus infections that resulted in hospitalization with neurological disease. Our objectives were to explore whether epidemics of emerging viruses are associated with neurological hospitalizations in Brazil and whether models could be used to predict neurological sequelae from viral infections.</p>
