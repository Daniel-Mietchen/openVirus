<p>Weekly counts of national hospitalisations data, aggregated to weeks by date of admission, were obtained retrospectively from the National Hospital Morbidity Database (NHMD), the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW), from the first week of July 2001 to the last week of June 2014. Hospitalisation diagnoses in Australia during the study period were coded using the ICD-10-AM edition for individual year [
 <xref rid="pone.0230705.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The clinical diagnosis coding used for ICD-10-AM is reviewed and modified annually in Australia. The NHMD contained almost all hospital records in Australia including both public and private hospital separations for the study period. The counts were aggregated under the following principal diagnosis categories from the ICD-10-AM: influenza and pneumonia (J09−J18) and all respiratory disease (J00–J99). For each category, data were aggregated for persons of all ages, and for the following age groups: 0–14, 15–64, 65–84, and ≥85 years.
