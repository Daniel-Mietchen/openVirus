<p>The estimated all-age total influenza-attributable pneumonia and influenza hospitalisation rate was 31.6 (95% CI: 30.8, 32.4) per 100,000, representing 41% of the estimated respiratory hospitalisation rate. Like respiratory hospitalisations, the estimated pneumonia and influenza hospitalisation rate per 100,000 declined with age, from 236.6 (95% CI: 222.4, 250.8) to 19.5 (95% CI: 19.0, 20.0) in 15â€“64 year-olds, and then increased somewhat to 37.1 (95% CI: 35.5, 38.7). Influenza B accounted for 28% of the all-age total influenza rate in persons of all ages.</p>
