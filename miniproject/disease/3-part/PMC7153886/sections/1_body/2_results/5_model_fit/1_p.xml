<p>The Q-Q plots showed some minor departures from normality in the model residuals, particularly at the extremities of the line of normality. Autocorrelation plots of the residuals indicated low to moderate autocorrelation, varying by diagnosis category. Furthermore, we examined correlation between the influenza A and B time series in each year. Influenza A and B were highly correlated, with correlation coefficients â‰¥ 0.9, in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2011 and 2013.</p>
