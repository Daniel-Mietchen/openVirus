<p>For the 2009 pandemic year, we estimated an all-age influenza A(H1N1)pdm09-attributable respiratory hospitalisation rate of 56 per 100,000, which was lower than the average annual total seasonal influenza-attributable rate. On the other hand, the influenza and pneumonia pandemic rate of around 39 per 100,000 was higher than the annual average seasonal influenza rate for influenza and pneumonia. These differences are explained by higher rates in the 15–64 years age group and lower rates in other adult age groups for pandemic compared with seasonal influenza. Even so, the rate in 15–64 year-olds was not outstanding when compared with seasonal influenza in some specific years. Among children aged under 15 years, only the influenza and pneumonia hospitalisation rate was statistically significant (about 41 per 100,000) for pandemic influenza and this was similar to the estimated average annual total seasonal influenza-attributable influenza and pneumonia hospitalisation rate in that age group.</p>
