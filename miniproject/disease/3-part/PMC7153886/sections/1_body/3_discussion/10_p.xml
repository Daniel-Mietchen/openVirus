<p>To conclude, our study provided more recent estimates of influenza-attributable hospital morbidity in Australia for 12 influenza seasons and a pandemic year. On average, older Australians experienced the highest rate of hospital admissions attributable to both seasonal and pandemic influenza. The majority of influenza-attributable hospitalisations appear to be associated with influenza A, although this may reflect the greater frequency of influenza A infections in the community. While the 2009 pandemic year had a lower all-age hospitalisation rate compared with seasonal influenza, the rate in 15â€“64 year-olds was higher than the seasonal influenza average, although this rate was not unusual compared with some individual seasonal influenza years. Collinearity between influenza A and B time series presented a challenge in our modelling approach, in discriminating the type-specific impact of influenza, so future modelling should use time series that include a testing denominator to limit the effect of changing testing frequency over time. Ongoing estimation of influenza burden is required to assess the burden of influenza and to verify the performance of influenza vaccination policy in reducing influenza-attributable morbidity and mortality.</p>
