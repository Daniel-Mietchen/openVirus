<p id="para0031">Development of neutralizing antibody responses was delayed compared to HAI antibody responses, and neutralizing antibody titers continue to increase for longer periods after recovery. Zhang et al. reported increase of neutralizing antibody response within 2 weeks from illness onset by using a pseudovirus-based neutralization assay.

 </xref> However, results of pseudovirus-based neutralization assay might not correlate well with results of an authentic virus-based neutralization test.

 </xref> In the study by Guo et al., no neutralizing antibodies were detected in samples collected before day 28 after illness onset, which is consistent with our findings.

 </xref> Ma et al. also observed delayed neutralizing antibody response after infection, with GMTs increasing overtime, peaking on day 200.

 </xref> We observed discordance in H7N9 virus HAI and neutralizing antibody responses with the HAI antibody response decreasing after a peak at 3 months while the neutralizing antibody response increased long after clinical recovery. The correlation of HAI and neutralizing antibody responses varied by A(H7N9) virus antigen, with greater correlation for the more recent A/Hong Kong/125/2017 virus compared with the older antigenically distinct A/Anhui/1/2013 virus. A(H7N9) vaccines induce comparable levels of HA-reactive IgG antibody as seasonal influenza vaccines in mice, but neutralizing titers are low, suggesting a large component of the induced antibody response is non-neutralizing

 </xref> Therefore, neutralizing antibody titers may underestimate the protective effect of antibody responses following A(H7N9) virus infection.
