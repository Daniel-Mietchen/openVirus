<p id="para0034">Our study had several limitations. First, all participants had symptomatic disease requiring hospitalization. The magnitude and kinetics of the antibody responses in patients with milder illness or asymptomatic infections might be different. Second, clinical data were not available for all patients during their hospitalization, which might impact some analyses. Third, we were not able to collect serial serum specimens from patients during hospitalization and were limited to testing remaining available sera. Survivors were not all followed up at the same designated time points. Fourth, we did not have respiratory specimens to characterize the A(H7N9) viruses that infected the patients, or to determine viral load, duration of shedding and associations with disease severity and antibody responses. Finally, the A(H7N9) patients followed up in this study may not be representative of all survivors of A(H7N9) virus infection in China; however, we included patients from 6 provinces and from 3 epidemics since 2013.</p>
