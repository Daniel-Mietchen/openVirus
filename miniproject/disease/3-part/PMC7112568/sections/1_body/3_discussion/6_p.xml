<p id="para0030">HPAI A(H7N9) viruses are antigenically distinct from other LPAI A(H7N9) viruses, including A/Hunan/2650/2016 and A/Anhui/1/2013, as determined by using post-infection ferret antisera.

 </xref> Lu et al. reported that sera collected 2–3 weeks after illness onset from patients with LPAI A(H7N9) clade C1 virus infection reacted with HPAI A(H7N9) human isolates, although at lower titers than those against homologous virus.

 </xref> Since we lacked virological data to identify the specific virus strains infecting the patients, we tested serum samples from patients from the 2016–2017 epidemic against three distinct A(H7N9) virus strains. Those patients with positive serological responses were likely infected by LPAI A(H7N9) viruses. Convalescent sera from these patients collected at 16–20 months after illness did not react with HPAI A(H7N9) virus. These data from human samples verified the antigenic difference among distinct A(H7N9) viruses.
