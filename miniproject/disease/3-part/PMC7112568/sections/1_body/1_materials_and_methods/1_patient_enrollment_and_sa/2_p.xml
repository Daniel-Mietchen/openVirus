<p id="para0014">For patients who were enrolled during hospitalization, we obtained available residual sera that were collected for clinical laboratory testing; these patients were also followed up after discharge to obtain additional samples. In addition, we recruited and followed patients after discharge. Serum samples were collected at enrollment and during follow-up visits, which occurred 3, 6, 12, 18, and 65 months after illness onset. Among these serum samples, fifty-five specimens collected after hospital discharge of patients from the 2013 and 2013â€“2014 epidemics were tested and reported in a previous study investigating the virus-specific antibody responses and T cell memory in A(H7N9) survivors within the year following illness onset.
