  <p>Dynamic of hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers in patients with A(H7N9) virus infection. A, average curve covers the whole study period (0–65 months after illness onset); B, curve between 0 and 90 days after illness onset; and C, curve for 0–480 days after illness onset are shown. Dark orange lines: average HAI antibody curve; light orange zones: 95% confidence interval around average antibody curve. Gray dash lines: threshold titers at 40 and 80.</p>
