<p>Almost four years after the close of the West Africa epidemic, on 3 May 2018 health authorities from the Équateur province of northwestern Democratic Republic of the Congo reported that 17 persons had become ill with EVD near Bikoro, a small market town next to Lake Tumba south of Mbdanka, near the neighboring Republic of the Congo. This Équateur outbreak of Ebola virus was the ninth to occur in the DRC since the virus was first identified in 1976 [

Following his funeral, 11 members of his family also developed the infection, of whom seven had provided care for him or attended his funeral. On 17 May, the first case of EVD was reported from Mbadanka, the capital city of Équateur province and a busy port city with over one million persons located on the Congo River. This was the first time that Ebola virus had reached a city in the DRC, and it rekindled fears of when Ebola virus had reached urban areas during the West African epidemic. In addition, there was concern that Ebola virus could spread via river traffic to the capital city of Kinshasa, a city of approximately 11 million, as well as to Brazzaville, both of which lie on the Congo River, and then across national borders to nine other countries as well [

Clinical investigations had been initiated during the West Africa Ebola epidemic including the Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL; NCT02344407), Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine Against Ebola (STRIVE; NCT02378753), and the “Ebola ça suffit!” cluster-randomized ring vaccination trial in Guinea (PACTR201503001057193), which all strongly supported the protective effects of the single dose vaccination strategy with rVSV-ZEBOV [

Ring vaccinations were quickly organized in the affected areas—using this method, contacts of those infected, followed by contacts of those contacts, were vaccinated, as were healthcare workers, laboratory personnel, surveillance workers and people involved with burials. Unfortunately, the exclusionary policies that denied vaccine administration to pregnant and lactating women and infants that had been maintained during the West Africa epidemic were once again implemented, preventing them from receiving the potentially life-saving vaccine [
 <xref rid="B11-vaccines-08-00038" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. By the close of the epidemic on 24 July 2018, there were 54 confirmed or suspected cases and 33 deaths, with a CFR of 61%. A total of 3330 persons received the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine during the outbreak [
