<p>On 7 May 2019, the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) issued new recommendations that included introducing an additional experimental Ebola vaccine developed by the Janssen Division of Johnson &amp; Johnson [

This vaccine, an adenovirus 26 vectored glycoprotein/MVA-BN-Filo (Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN) vaccine regimen, had been designated as the second vaccine to be used in the outbreak. The two-dose vaccination regimen includes Ad26.ZEBOV as the first dose, which is based on Janssen’s AdVac
 <sup>®</sup> technology, and MVA-BN-Filo as the second dose, which is based on Bavarian Nordic’s MVA-BN
 <sup>®</sup> technology and is administered approximately 8 weeks later. This vaccination regimen uses a viral vector strategy in which viruses—adenovirus serotype 26 (Ad26) and Modified Vaccinia Ankara (MVA)—have been genetically modified so that they cannot replicate in human cells, while safely inducing the production of Ebola virus proteins in order to trigger an immune response [
