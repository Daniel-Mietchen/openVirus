<p>Infectious agents exploit infected organisms in order to survive, multiply, settle, and eventually spoil. While some infections may remain asymptomatic or scarcely manifest, others are treatment resistant and have a grim prognosis. The immune system efficiently shields the body against infectious agents but eventually may fail, with harsh outcomes for the infected organism. Viruses are intracellular parasites hinging on the host cellular structures and cellular processes to replicate, survive, and disseminate. The biological clock drives circadian rhythmicity of cellular processes and immune functions, thus shaping the host response to viral infections and affecting the patterns of host–pathogen interaction [
 <xref rid="B90-pathogens-09-00083" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Similarly to other infectious diseases, viral infections impact the circadian clock circuitry of the infected organism that, in turn, interacts with the molecular components of the infecting pathogens, pointing to a role of timing in this complex interplay and to a possible advantage of applying chrono-modulated antiviral therapeutic strategies. The contemporary chronotherapy employed or proposed in metabolic, immune, and neoplastic diseases could better address the outline of host–pathogen interaction, advancing the efficacy of antiviral therapy and improving the outcome of treatment of viral infections.
