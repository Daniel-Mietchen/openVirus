<p>A worldwide problem is represented by seasonal epidemics of influenza. Influenza is a disease with global impact that causes enormous morbidity and mortality on an annual basis. The severity of the infection depends on both the virus strain and a number of host factors, primarily age and the presence of comorbid conditions. The mortality and usage of healthcare resources associated with influenza is focused in the elderly and in those with a coexisting disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In patients with COPD, the morbidity and mortality caused by an influenza virus infection are considerably greater.</p>
