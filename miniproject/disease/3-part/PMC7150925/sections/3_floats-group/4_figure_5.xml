  <p>A neighbor-joining tree constructed using partial N-gene (255 nucleotides) sequences of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV), shows the relationships among the PPRV isolates. The Kimura 2-parameter model was used to calculate the percentage (indicated by numbers beside branches) of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in 1000 bootstrap replicates. The sequences from DRC generated in this study PPRV/DRC/01/2017 (MT154039) and PPRV/DRC/14/2017 (MT154040) are indicated with a shaded grey box, were identical to the Burundi sequence (MH370230) and related to other isolates from north-eastern Uganda and eastern DRC 2018 (MN2434724-25). The scale bar indicates nucleotide substitutions per site.</p>
