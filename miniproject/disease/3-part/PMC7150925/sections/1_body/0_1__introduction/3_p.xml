<p>One of the more diverse and complex domestic and wild ungulate communities occurs in East Africa. The first PPR cases described in livestock from East Africa date from 1971–1972 in Sudan [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], followed by outbreaks confirmed in Ethiopia in 1989–1990 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Despite some serological evidences of PPRV incursions into Uganda and Kenya in the 1980s [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and early 2000s [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and an isolated report of an outbreak in Uganda in 2003 [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], it was not until 2006–2008 when the first official and large PPR outbreak was reported in Kenya and the bordering Karamoja region in Uganda, with further disease records in northern Tanzania (2007–2008) [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Since then, several PPR outbreaks have been described in different regions of East Africa, suggesting PPRV persistence in some nomadic and semi-nomadic pastoralist systems of South Sudan, north-eastern Uganda, north-western Kenya, and northern Tanzania (

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. PPR appeared to be absent in Ugandan wildlife prior to 2004 from serosurveillance under the Pan African Rinderpest Campaign (PARC) and the Pan African Programme for the Control of Epizootics (PACE) for RP eradication, but African buffalo (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00293">Table S2</xref>), corresponding with the first reports of PPR in livestock in this country (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00293">Table S1</xref>). All the evidence suggests that PPRV is present in some parts of Uganda and since 2004 has caused outbreaks of disease in livestock when introduced to naïve herds and areas.
