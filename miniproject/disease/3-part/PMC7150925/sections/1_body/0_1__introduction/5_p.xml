<p>One of the objectives of the Improved Understanding of the Epidemiology of Peste des Petits Ruminants (IUEPPR) project (ANIHWA ERANET BB/L013592/1 and BB/L013657/1) was to study the status of PPR in wildlife from eastern Africa and explore the epidemiological links with ongoing livestock cycles. Under that framework, this study aims to provide a perspective on PPR of the northern region of the Albertine Rift as a whole, over a recent time period, and more specifically study PPR at the wildlife–livestock interface in western Uganda, which represents a savannah–forest transition ecozone with relatively low interactions of small livestock with wildlife. The PPRV strains recovered opportunistically during the study period from across the Ugandan border in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were also studied.</p>
