This was reported to the provincial agricultural department in North Kivu and samples were taken to the Goma Veterinary Laboratory including serum and nasal swabs from 14 sheep and goats and some organs after necropsy. A large number of sheep and goats died in Kibumba, Rutshuru, Kiwandja, and Goma, but no cases in wildlife were reported at the time by the Virunga National Park staff. The swab samples were subsequently shipped by the IUEPPR project to the project partner at The Pirbright Institute, UK for diagnostics and molecular characterization of the virus.
