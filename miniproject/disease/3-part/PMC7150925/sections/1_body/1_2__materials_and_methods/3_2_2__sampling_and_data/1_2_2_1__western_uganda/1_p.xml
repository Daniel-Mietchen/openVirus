<p>For the detection of PPRV antibodies in wildlife from QENP, a minimum sampling size of 39, with 3 animals per herd, was calculated assuming an expected herd prevalence of 20% and a within-herd prevalence of 60% (95% confidence, 90% of test sensitivity), taking into account that previous surveys on PPR reported 25%â€“100% seroprevalence in African buffalo and antelopes from East Africa [

 <xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Buffalo were captured from six different areas within QENP in 2015 and five areas in 2017, and Uganda kob from five mating grounds in 2015. Animals were selected as a convenience sample within herds among different age categories from &gt; 6 months old.
