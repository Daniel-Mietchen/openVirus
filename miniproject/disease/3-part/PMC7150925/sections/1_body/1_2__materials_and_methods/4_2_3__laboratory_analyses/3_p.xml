<p>All 14 nasal swabs from the outbreak near to Virunga National Park in DRC were screened for the presence of viral nucleic acid by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The swab samples were processed and total RNA extracted following a method described previously [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The extracted RNA was used in RT-qPCR and the assay was performed following the method as described by Batten and colleagues [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In addition, total RNA was also extracted from a tissue culture grown virus PPRV/Morocco/2008 [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>], and this RNA was used as the positive control in all the molecular assays. The RNA from RT-qPCR positive samples were reverse transcribed and the C-terminus of the N-gene was amplified as previously described [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] using the superscript III One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The PCR amplicons were purified using the GE Healthcare Illustra GFXPCR purification kit (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced using BigDye
 <sup>®</sup> Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA) on an ABI 3730 machine. Sequences were assembled and analyzed using SeqMan pro (DNAStar Lasergene 13.0). The sequences obtained were deposited in Genbank under the accession numbers MT154039 (PPRV/DRC/01/2017) and MT154040 (PPRV/DRC/14/2017).
