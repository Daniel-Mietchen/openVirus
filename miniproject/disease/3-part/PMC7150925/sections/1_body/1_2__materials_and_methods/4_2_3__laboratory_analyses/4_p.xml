<p>The partial N-gene sequences (255 nucleotides) available in GenBank for Africa including DRC, Uganda, and Burundi (
 <italic>n</italic> = 33) until November 2019 were retrieved and used for constructing a neighborhood-joining phylogenetic tree. Alignments of the N-gene sequences were made using the Clustal W program and used for construction of distance matrices using the Kimura 2-parameter nucleotide substitution model [

 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. A maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree was then generated using MEGA 6.0, and the robustness of tree topology was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates.
