<p>PPRV antibodies in buffalo and kobs from QENP did not show a clear spatial pattern. If African buffalo are relatively sedentary and Uganda kob at times territorial, these animals in QENP can be considered as one population whereas they may represent at least two epidemiological units divided by the extensive Maramagambo Forest (

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Surprisingly in Uganda, PPR infection occurred in all ecologically discrete wildlife populations sampled in both segments of the protected area (north and south Maramagambo Forest and Kazinga Channel; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00293-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests a consistent force of infection in all areas even though livestock are not allowed to enter the park, and the low intensity of the wildlifeâ€“small livestock interface observed. Therefore, at least a temporary PPRV transmission within natural areas, and possibly involving a multi-host system, is likely. The age prevalence data from wildlife are suggestive of discrete events for PPRV transmission within parks, perhaps predictable alongside epidemic cycles in livestock. However, it does not support a significant degree of temporal persistence of PPRV within natural systems. Alternatively, a separate source of morbillivirus exposure may also exist, cross reacting in the N ELISA test (60% of N-gene is conserved between morbilliviruses): this could be the canine distemper virus or another yet unknown morbillivirus. Our results are somewhat different to previous studies that indicated an increased seroprevalence by age in wildlife from Ngorongoro Conservation Area, together with a continued PPRV detection in local domestic sheep and goats [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00293" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Despite all these evidences, the absence of detection of viral RNA in these samplings precludes molecular epidemiology and it remains inconclusive as to the circulation of the virus amongst these wildlife populations.
