<p>In South Sudan, some of the wildlife populations, particularly antelope and common warthog (
 <italic>Phacochoerus africanus</italic>), are highly spatially integrated with livestock even if direct physical contact is rare. Livestock is predominantly nomadic, with large seasonal movements including large flocks of small livestock at times and moving transboundary. These pastoral systems are extensive and show ample opportunity for spillover with frequent livestock infection cycles (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00293">Table S1</xref>). Migratory and long movement patterns may predispose some species to a higher PPR-exposure risk and/or bridge between distant susceptible populations.
