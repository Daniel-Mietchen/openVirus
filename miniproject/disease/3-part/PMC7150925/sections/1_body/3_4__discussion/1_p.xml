<p>In the recent past, PPRV has regularly caused disease outbreaks in small ruminants within East Africa associated with different virus strains in circulation [

The role of wildlife and wildlifeâ€“livestock interfaces in PPR epidemiology is still largely unknown in Africa and this gap could be an issue for the PPR global eradication program. In the present study, we describe the occurrence of several PPR-like syndromes and confirm outbreaks in livestock and a broad and recent exposure of wildlife to PPRV in the northern Albertine Rift and Nile basin. Based on local changes of seroprevalence and viral detection, our results indicate that PPRV circulated during the study period and in previous years within a wide geographic and ecologic range in western Uganda, eastern DRC, and South Sudan, involving livestock and exposed wildlife, and including areas with sedentary livestock systems and forested habitats that are not typically associated with PPR in East Africa. This is contemporary information to recent publications on a similar status in Tanzania where widespread infection in small livestock and wildlife was reported in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area [
