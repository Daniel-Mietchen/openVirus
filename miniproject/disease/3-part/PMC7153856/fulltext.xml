It is the interactive exchange of information about risks among experts and people. Effective RC can minimize the impact that diseases such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika have on populations.

The study was designed based on the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. In addition, the Social Amplification of Risk Framework and the theory of cultural schemas were applied to understand RC in the social context.</p></sec><sec id="sec003"><title>Results</title><p>Television, radio and newspapers were the most important channels of information regarding dengue and chikungunya. Moreover, individuals also reported receiving information via social media, the internet and family/friends. Interestingly, the use of internet to obtain information diminished with age, while females were more likely to use internet compared to men. These key findings were statistically significant. An important outcome was that the risk perception towards chikungunya at the beginning of the outbreak was attenuated. This might be due to the (perceived) lack of RC before the epidemic. This same risk perception was amplified later during the outbreak by the increased exposure to information. Lastly, we show how cultural schemas influence people&#x02019;s perception regarding preventive measures and treatment of chikungunya and dengue.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Data obtained emphasise the importance of understanding the <italic>user</italic> of media platforms and sharing information in a timely fashion through a transparent process with the content that convinces people of the seriousness of the matter.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika are an increasing public health concern worldwide. The mentioned VBDs are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito from the <italic>Aedes</italic> species. Preventing or reducing VBDs continues to depend mainly on vector control and interrupting human-vector contact. Risk communication (RC) is the interactive exchange of information about hazards among experts and individuals. As it influences individuals&#x02019; behaviour, a better understanding of how it works is vital to improving RC strategies in the context of VBD prevention and control strategies. Our study highlighted the complexity of this matter as we found that there are multiple factors, including the volume of information, trust, experience with a similar disease and cultural schemas that determine how people cope with risk and information. We recommend broadening the use and scope of media platforms to share information and to customise the messages taking the cultural schemas of the community into account.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALWCA.2016.021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-1918-9144</contrib-id><name><surname>Tami</surname><given-names>Adriana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005075</institution-id><institution>Universitair Medisch Centrum Groningen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2733-4820</contrib-id><name><surname>Elsinga</surname><given-names>Jelte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Funding was provided by the Dutch Research Council (NWO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.nwo.nl/onderzoek-en-resultaten/onderzoeksprojecten">https://www.nwo.nl/onderzoek-en-resultaten/onderzoeksprojecten</ext-link>) to the project entitled "Public health impact of chronic chikungunya illness and performance/utilisation of the health care system in the face of arboviral (dengue, chikungunya, Zika) epidemics in Curacao" Acronym: ARBOCARIB (NWO grant ALWCA.2016.021); and by an MD/PhD Scholarship for Jelte Elsinga from the Junior Scientific Masterclass, University Medical Center Groningen.

Dengue is the most important arthropod-borne viral disease in humans. It is endemic in 125 countries mostly in America, South-East Asia and Western Pacific regions [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Approximately 4 billion people are now at risk of dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. A dengue virus (DENV) infection causes a flu-like illness and occasionally progresses to severe forms of dengue: dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Individuals infected with chikungunya virus (CHIKV) generally have symptoms such as high fever, skin rash and debilitating polyarthralgia, which usually persist 1&#x02013;2 weeks. However, a proportion of cases progresses to the chronic stage of CHIKV infection, in which some symptoms, such as arthralgia, last for months to years [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Zika virus (ZIKV) infection has been linked to adverse fetal outcomes, including microcephaly and other congenital abnormalities in the developing fetus and newborn. Also, it has been associated with Guillain- Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS)[<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but one must take into account that GBS is also associated with other bacterial and viral infections, e.g. Campylobacter jejuni, Influenza and other Vector-Borne Diseases (VBDs) such as dengue and chikungunya [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These VBDs present with flu-like symptoms and are generally self-limiting, barring the development of the aforementioned complications [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>In the Caribbean, the primary vector of DENV (Flavivirus), CHIKV (Alphavirus) and ZIKV (Flavivirus) is <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. <italic>Ae</italic>. <italic>aegypti</italic> is a tropical and subtropical mosquito species widely distributed around the world, mostly between latitudes 35 &#x000b0;N and 35 &#x000b0;S [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Given the vector distribution, countries located in the tropical and subtropical regions are susceptible to its invasion and spread [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In Cura&#x000e7;ao, a Caribbean island within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, all four serotypes of dengue (DENV 1&#x02013;4) have circulated during the past two decades [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. According to local health authorities, dengue epidemics occur cyclically. CHIKV caused a significant outbreak in 2014&#x02013;2015, affecting up to 50% of the population (Ministry of Health, Environment and Nature of Cura&#x000e7;ao, 2016). In 2016, the introduction of ZIKV caused another major outbreak in the country. The Department of Epidemiology and Research of the Ministry of Health (MoH) reported that since December 2015 up to August 2017, a total of 2314 laboratory-confirmed ZIKV cases were recorded. However, it should be noted that confirmed cases only represent a fraction of those who were infected, as up to 80% of the individuals with ZIKV infection are asymptomatic and not everyone experiencing symptoms, which may be very mild, will visit a health facility [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The MoH estimates that at least 50% of the local population had been infected with ZIKV (I. Gerstenbluth, personal communication). This is comparable to the reported attack rates in French Polynesia (66%) and Yap Island (73%) [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>The treatment of dengue, chikungunya, and Zika relies on supportive treatment and symptom relief since there is no antiviral treatment available. Considering the possible complications of these viral diseases, prevention, prompt diagnosis and adequate intervention at the onset of disease symptoms are the main options for reducing the burden of disease. To date, no vaccines are available for Zika, and chikungunya [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. There is a licensed dengue vaccine available. However, it is not suitable for large-scale use [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, the prevention or reduction of the transmission of the mentioned VBDs hinges primarily on control of the mosquito vectors <italic>(e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>environmental management</italic>, <italic>biological and chemical control)</italic> and interruption of human-vector contact <italic>(e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>individual protection including the use of repellents</italic>, <italic>clothing that minimises skin exposure</italic>, <italic>and household protection including window and door screens</italic>, <italic>and air-conditioning)</italic>[<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Risk communication (RC) refers to the exchange of real-time information, including advice and opinions between experts and individuals facing threats to their health, economic or social well-being [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is an essential tool for the prevention and control of diseases because it can supply individuals with the knowledge needed for an optimal decision-making process [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The Health Belief Model (HBM) is one of the most widely used and validated theoretical models to understand the decision-making process and the health-seeking behaviour of individuals [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Core concepts in the HBM are the perceived susceptibility and the perceived severity of the condition, leading to the perceived threat. The perception of threat is integral in the decision-making processes of individuals because it plays an essential role in motivating health behaviour change [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. An essential concept in the HBM that influences the perceived risk and health-seeking behaviour is called &#x0201c;cues to action&#x0201d;. Cues to action refer to strategies that activate readiness. According to a recent study published by Metta et al., individuals&#x02019; previous experiences in managing conditions similar to malaria were considered to be cues to action, because their past experiences seem to have informed their self-medication decisions in the context of malaria [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. According to Hochbaum (1958), cues to action could be cultural schemas of individuals or information that individuals receive from media, informal and formal networks [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Cultural schemas are deeply internalised and largely unconscious networks of associations built up over time that facilitate perception, interpretation, and action [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, cultural schemas are frameworks of a specific culture that exist in an individual&#x02019;s thoughts and have the ability to instigate actions. The cultural schemas are also shaped by the political context, which then influences the relation between the State and the individual/community[<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Risk perception is also essential for RC because it determines which hazards individuals care about and how they deal with them. RC models such as risk perception, mental noise, negative dominance, and trust determination have been developed to understand how individuals perceive risk, how they process risk information, and how they make decisions about them [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, recent research indicates a general shift in focus towards models emphasising the importance of social-cultural factors for public acceptance of risk messages [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), developed by Kasperson et al. has been prominent on research agendas in trying to understand the gaps between risk perception research and the social context [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The framework seeks to explain how information processes, institutional structures, the behaviour of social groups, and individual responses shape the social experience of risk [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The SARF states that risk events interact with individual psychological, social and cultural factors in ways that risks are amplified, receiving public attention, or attenuated, receiving less public attention [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>As essential as it is, RC in the context of vector/mosquito-borne disease remains a neglected topic in the scientific literature [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Although the mentioned studies give useful insights, they fail to explain RC through the individual point of view and in the social context. Therefore in this paper, we aim to understand RC regarding VBDs in the social context and from the audience&#x02019;s point of view. The audience in this study refers to people that experienced VBDs and that live in Cura&#x004ab;ao. It is essential to take the audience&#x02019;s perception into account when studying RC because it permits RC experts to understand the audience&#x02019;s expectations, opinions and beliefs. The aim of this study will be addressed by seeking to understand (I) the user of the channels of information, (II) the risk perception regarding dengue and chikungunya, (III) the influence of cultural schemas on information, perceptions and preferences, and finally (IV) the information channels that individuals consider trustworthy. This knowledge will lead to applicable community-focused health messages and strengthen the preparedness and performance of RC for future epidemics in Cura&#x000e7;ao, and other countries vulnerable to VBDs. We will use a mixed-methods approach based on the SARF, HBM, and the cultural schemas theory to investigate RC regarding VBDs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>In June and July 2015, a cross-sectional mixed-method (quantitative and qualitative) study using focus group discussions (FGDs), in-depth interviews (IDIs), and individual questionnaires (survey), was performed to assess community participation in Mosquito Breeding Site Control (MBSC) in Cura&#x004ab;ao [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The study was designed based on an integrated theoretical framework of the HBM and Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). This current study used the SARF, HBM and the theory of cultural schemas, as an analytical interpretive framework, to understand RC among the recruited study participants of the aforementioned cross-sectional mixed-method study. Three concepts of the HBM were incorporated in the SARF. The SARF was applied to explore which channels of information inform individuals about VBDs and the concepts of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of the HBM were applied to understand the risk perception of the study population. The information coming from different channels was considered as a cue to action. The theory of cultural schemas was also incorporated in our integrated conceptual framework to understand the cultural dimensions in the processing of information at the individual level. Both SARF and cultural schemas were not applied at the time of data collection but were used for analysis and result interpretation. In this study, the qualitative data were analysed first and were validated and supported through quantitative analyses.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Study site</title><p>Cura&#x000e7;ao (capital Willemstad) is an island in the southern Caribbean Sea, located &#x000b1;65 km north of the Venezuelan coast.

Individuals with paid jobs were more likely to receive information regarding dengue from their GPs compared to individuals who were unemployed or retired (<xref rid="pntd.0008136.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Univariate analysis also showed that the usage of television as a channel of information regarding dengue diminished with increasing income (<xref rid="pntd.0008136.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).

Therefore, we focus only on the association between the use of the internet and socio-demographic characteristics.</p><p>Univariate analysis revealed a negative association between age and the use of the internet, while female gender was positively associated with internet usage. The use of internet increased with the level of education. Individuals having a paid (non-manual) job were 2.72 times more likely to use the internet compared with unemployed individuals. Furthermore, individuals earning &#x02265;5000 guilders per month were 3.23 times more likely to use the internet compared to individuals who earned &#x02264;999 guilders per month (<xref rid="pntd.0008136.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). After adjusting for education, occupation and income, age and gender were still significantly associated with the use of the internet (<xref rid="pntd.0008136.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The data of this study showed that as age increases the use of the internet decreases 5% per each year of age.

Because of this, people have become familiar with the disease as well as with necessary preventive measures. However, when it comes to chikungunya, the participants of both FGDs and IDIs were not satisfied with the local health authorities. According to the majority of the participants, the official information regarding chikungunya coming from the local health authorities was late:</p><disp-quote><p>&#x0201c;People were criticising, ah, it went like a type of epidemic on the island. People had the idea that the minister did not act on time to stop the epidemic. I am not sure about the impact of the governmental programs, the programs regarding fumigation, on the community. However, people had the idea that the governmental actions were like too little too late (Dutch proverb: mustard after the meal), and it was on a small scale. Thus, the governmental actions were too late to prevent the epidemic.&#x0201d;</p><p>Female, teacher, age not documented, IDI.</p></disp-quote><p>The qualitative data analysis revealed that, as a result of the perceived delay in official information regarding chikungunya, people started to search for information. In order to verify and validate their opinions, they started to share their opinions regarding the transmission routes, symptoms, prevention and treatment options with people in their surroundings. Some participants reported turning to friends and family members for assistance in assigning meaning to the symptoms they were experiencing, and for advice on how to treat their condition. This could explain why many participants reported having received information regarding chikungunya via interpersonal channels.</p></sec><sec id="sec020"><title>Risk perceptions toward dengue and chikungunya</title><p>A considerable proportion of the participants of this mixed-method study agreed that everyone in the community was potentially susceptible to DENV infection, regardless of his or her age. According to the participants of both FGDs and IDIs, DENV infection is not a severe disease, because the symptoms are flu-like. However, they were well-informed about the severe consequences of DENV infection. In the case of the survey participants, 67% and 60% of them fully agreed that DENV infection is a serious condition and that people who are infected could die of the infection, respectively. Based on these results, the majority of the participants had a moderate-high perceived susceptibility and a moderate-high perceived severity of DENV infection.</p><p>In the case of CHIKV infection, the majority of the participants of both FGDs and IDIs did not expect to be infected with CHIKV because they were not informed, before the epidemic, about a possible CHIKV infection outbreak. The qualitative data suggested that the perceived susceptibility and the perceived severity regarding CHIKV infection were attenuated due to the lack of RC. However, both were amplified when the television, radio, newspaper, and people started to share information regarding the high burden of chikungunya during the epidemic. When prompted to discuss gender and age differences related to CHIKV infection, a proportion of the participants of the FGDs and IDIs perceived that the youth was less at risk of CHIKV infection as their immune system was stated to be better than children, adults and older adults. However, the rest of the participants agreed that everyone in the community was susceptible to the condition, regardless of gender and age. The same shared perception was observed among the survey participants as almost half of the participants (47%) reported that not everyone in Cura&#x000e7;ao ran a high risk of being infected with CHIKV. When participants were asked about the severity of CHIKV infection, all the participants of the qualitative study stated that it was a severe disease and 72% of the participants of the survey fully agreed with this statement. Based on these results, the majority of the participants had a moderate-low perceived susceptibility and moderate-high perceived severity regarding CHIKV infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec021"><title>The influence of cultural schemas on information, perceptions and preferences</title><p>Information regarding the knowledge of the transmission route, preventive measures and treatment options of our study participants, was published previously [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

The extract of papaya leaves was recommended because it was believed to increase the platelet levels in patients infected with DENV and CHIKV, and in turn, reduced the severity of the infection. Although the use of herbs was recommended by alternative medicine practitioners, it should be stated that herbs are a popular and traditional treatment option to treat diseases among people living on the island. The positive experiences of treating the common cold and other diseases with herbs had motivated infected individuals to use alternative medicine, such as papaya, mango and soursop leaves, to treat CHIKV and possibly DENV infection. The results of the survey showed that 30.5% of 339 participants reported having used papaya leaves, and 28.5% of 337 study participants used mango leaves to treat the CHIKV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008136.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The use of mango leaves was also recommended by alternative medicine practitioners, although the benefits are not documented.

These results are in line with the findings of the CBS of Cura&#x000e7;ao (CBS, ICT &#x00026; Media survey 2017) and with the literature [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Our multivariate model, including age, gender, education, occupation and income, explains only 17.5% <italic>(Nagelkerke R</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = <italic>0</italic>.<italic>175)</italic> of internet usage. Using the internet for information on chikungunya may be less influenced by common socio-demographic characteristics and may be better explained by other factors such as personality traits <italic>(e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>extraversion)</italic> [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>].</p><p>The qualitative data of our study showed how the risk perception regarding CHIKV infection was attenuated due to the lack of RC before the epidemic and how the risk perception was amplified by the increased exposure of information, as well as the direct and indirect experience of the physical manifestation of CHIKV infection in the peak of the chikungunya epidemic. Based on the participant&#x02019;s narratives, we believe that the media including television, radio, newspapers and interpersonal channels of information played an essential role in the amplification of the risk of individuals, especially in the context of chikungunya. The findings of a recent study published by Chan et al. support our results [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Chan et al. showed that changes in the volume of information in media were followed by several changes in individuals risk perceptions and protective behaviour regarding the Zika virus in the United States [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. They also found that social media coverage was positively correlated with changes in risk perception while television and newspapers were positively correlated with changes in protective behaviours. These findings revealed that the influence of media on risk perceptions and behaviour could vary by the volume of information and type of channel of information [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, more research is needed to investigate these differences.</p><p>With regards to the risk perception of people, our results showed that the majority of the participants had a moderate-high perceived susceptibility and a moderate-high perceived severity of DENV infection. However, the qualitative data show that people considered it also to be &#x0201c;merely flu-like&#x0201d;. We believe this relatively high perceived disease severity of DENV infection is biased by the knowledge of the participants gained over the last years. It is possible that the participants are aware of the threat of DENV infection and report it, but that on the other hand, they do not really consider DENV infection as a threat as there have hardly been any reports of severe dengue disease on the island. This phenomenon could well be the reason for an initially reduced risk perception of the CHIKV infection. More research is needed to understand the feeling of threat with respect to VBDs among individuals living in Cura&#x000e7;ao and to assess the role of other factors, e.g. heuristics, in this context.</p><p>Furthermore, we found that individual cultural schemas played an essential role in forming individuals&#x02019; perceptions regarding the preventive measures and treatment options of VBDs, especially in the case of chikungunya. The information regarding the influence of cultural schemas on the perceptions and behaviour of individuals in the context of VBDs is lacking. A recent paper published by Metta et al. showed that cultural schemas played a role in malaria self-care among adults in Tanzania, especially regarding the use of herbs in healing multiple conditions [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A similar cultural schema was observed in our study, with regard to using herbs to treat CHIKV and possible DENV infection. We showed that individuals&#x02019; cultural schemas are possible cues to action, which instigated the health-seeking behaviour of individuals. Also, the results of our study showed that people got confused when their reality <italic>(e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>herbs did not cure or reduce the symptoms of the CHIKV infection)</italic> did not fit in their cultural schema <italic>(e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>herbs heal diseases)</italic>. RC experts will need to include aspects of cultural <italic>schemas (e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>the use of herbs in the treatment of disease)</italic> in their RC strategies.</p><p>Lastly, the data of this study also highlighted trust issues between the community and the local health authorities, including the general practitioners. As the participants perceived that information regarding CHIKV infection came when the community was already experiencing the condition, they expressed disappointment and showed signs of reduced trust in the health authorities. There was less trust in the government because people perceived that the measures performed by the government were not enough to protect them against health insecurities; in this case, the CHIKV infection epidemic. This implies that governmental actions during this epidemic would have influenced people&#x02019;s trust in the government. There was less trust in general practitioners because the patients doubted the efficacy of the treatments. We believe that the power relations between health practitioners and patients are changing in Cura&#x004ab;ao. Health practitioners can no longer assume that patients will trust them because of their power/position in society. Trust has been found to play an essential role in predicting risk perceptions and behaviours of individuals [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In the case of distrust, people will doubt the information that the channel is providing and this in turn will affect not only their risk perception and their behaviour but also RC efforts as such in a negative way. In other words, negative trust issues should be addressed in RC.</p><sec id="sec027"><title>Limitations and strengths</title><p>The current study was limited by its cross-sectional retrospective design and is susceptible to recall bias. The study participants consisted of more females than males; this might limit the generalisability of our results. However, this might not be a significant issue, because women are mainly responsible for the housekeeping, family care and the provision of information to the family [<xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0008136.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. The wide confidence intervals that were found for all socio-demographic characteristics may be explained by the small number of participants in each category. Therefore, &#x0201c;age&#x0201d; was used as a continuous variable in the regression model. A strength of the study was its mixed-method design. Also, our study design offered the opportunity to understand RC from the audience&#x02019;s point of view, which could help RC experts to understand their target population comprehensively. Even though our sample size is small, our results on internet use correlate with the results of the CBS which was based on a representative sample of the population.</p></sec><sec id="sec028"><title>Conclusions and recommendations</title><p>The findings of this study form an important contribution to the research field of RC, because to our knowledge, no studies combining qualitative and quantitive research methods based on the SARF, HBM and cultural schemas theory to understand RC from the audience&#x02019;s perspective have been published to date. We found that there are different factors <italic>(e</italic>.<italic>g</italic>. <italic>1</italic>. <italic>the timing of sharing information</italic>, <italic>2</italic>. <italic>the channel of information</italic>, <italic>3</italic>. <italic>the volume of information</italic>, <italic>4</italic>. <italic>trust in the source of information</italic>, <italic>5</italic>. <italic>previous experience with a disease</italic>, <italic>and 6</italic>. <italic>cultural schemas)</italic> that influence how people deal with risk. Health authorities should target these factors in future RC strategies. We recommend broadening the use and scope of media platforms to share information on a timely basis and with the content that convinces people of the seriousness of the matter. The health authorities can customise their channels of information by using more social media platforms to reach the younger generation and other groups in the community. We recommend to evaluate the manner in which social media was used and to what extent people were aware of the existence of these platforms to achieve the desired impact. As the health authorities are mistrusted by the public, more efforts need to be made to provide accurate information to the community through a transparent process. Lastly, further research should take more individual characteristics such as cultural schemas and heuristics into account when studying the influence of RC on risk perception and behaviour of individuals.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec029"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008136.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Characteristics of the study participants of the FGDs and IDIs.</title><p>Adapted from: Elsinga J, van der Veen HT, Gerstenbluth I, Burgerhof JGM, Dijkstra A, Grobusch MP, et al.
