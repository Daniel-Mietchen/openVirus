<p>Multiple sequence alignment showed high amino acid sequence similarities between the Iranian isolate, Th-W2259, and the other isolates. Although numerous conserved amino acid sequences were found among the isolates, especially among those belonging to the same phylogenetic group, a number of amino acid changes were observed among the isolates belonging to different groups. The results indicated that some of them were genogroup-specific amino acid substitutions, including A

 <sub>14,88</sub>, E
 <sub>27,38</sub>, G
