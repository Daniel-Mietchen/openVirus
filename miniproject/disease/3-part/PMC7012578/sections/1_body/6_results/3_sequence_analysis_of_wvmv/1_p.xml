<p>The nucleotide sequence of the CP gene of the isolate Th-W2259 and the other sequences of the virus (
 <xref rid="t1-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) were assessed for evidence of recombination using RDP 4.39. As no clear recombination events (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 1 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup>) were found among the CP gene sequences studied, all the 14 non-recombinant sequences and one isolate of SMV (the outgroup) were utilized for phylogenetic analysis using ML and NJ algorithms; the ML tree is shown in 
 <xref rid="f2-ppj-36-087" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>. The trees obtained from both methods placed the sequences into five major groups: East Asian-1 to 3, North American and World with high bootstrap values. In all the trees, the Iranian isolate and the other six isolates from Europe and Oceania were clustered in World group. Six isolates from China and one isolate from United States were placed in East Asian-1 to 3 and North American group, respectively. While all the isolates belonging to East Asian and North American groups were obtained from 
 <italic>Wisteria sinensis</italic>, most of World group isolates were isolated from different 
 <italic>Wisteria</italic> species.
