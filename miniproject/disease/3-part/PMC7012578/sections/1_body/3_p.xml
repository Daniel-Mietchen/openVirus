<p>The 
 <italic>Potyviridae</italic> is the largest family of plant-infecting RNA viruses, and many species are aphid-borne (
 <xref rid="b58-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Wylie et al., 2017</xref>). Potyviruses are very important plant viruses economically and are widespread in cultivated plants throughout the world, and are found infecting wild plants as well (

Seven potyviruses of legumes were previously reported in Iran. These include bean common mosaic virus (BCMV), bean common mosaic necrosis virus (BCMNV), bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV), cowpea aphid-borne mosaic virus (CABMV), pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV), peanut mottle virus (PeMoV), and soybean mosaic virus (SMV) (
