<p>The CP gene sequence of WVMV isolate from Iran and 13 other isolates from the GenBank sequence database were used (
 <xref rid="t1-ppj-36-087" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The results of BLAST searches showed that the CP sequence of an isolate of SMV, GenBank accession no. FJ640971, closely matched that of the WVMV sequences, and this sequence was used for the outgroup. The sequences were aligned and degapped, with or without the SMV sequence (

 <xref rid="b37-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2015</xref>) were used to predict presence of recombination events in the aligned sequences. A sequence was considered “recombinant” if the recombination event was detected by at least three methods (

 <xref rid="b47-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Posada, 2002</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis was performed by Mega 6.0 software using the SMV sequence as the outgroup, as described above, except that the best nucleotide substitution models used for ML analysis were Tamura three-parameter model with a gamma distribution of site-rate variants across four categories. Trees were finally edited using iTOL v4. This model also was applied in Mega 6.0 to estimate nucleotide distances. Deduced amino acid sequence distances were estimated using the best-fitted model of Jones-Taylor-Thornton. In this analysis, a bootstrap procedure with 1,000 replicates was performed to estimate standard errors.
