<p>To determine the nucleotide sequence of PCR products, fragments of expected sizes were excised from the gel and cleaned by the sequencing service of Bioneer (Daejeon, Korea). Sanger sequencing was carried out in both directions using the amplification primers. Pseq primer (
 <xref rid="b52-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Valouzi et al., 2017</xref>) was used for sequencing of the PCR product obtained using NWCIEN primers. Sequences of each region were determined using two independent PCR products. The sequences of adjacent regions were overlapped by about 100 bp to ensure that they were from the same genome and were not from different components of a genome mixture (
