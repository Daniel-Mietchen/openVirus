<p>In the present work, we tested whether aphids collected in the wild could be used as indicators of bean-infecting potyviruses. Individuals of 
 <italic>A. craccivora</italic> and 
 <italic>A. fabae</italic> collected from a locust tree transmitted a potyvirus to bean seedlings and produced symptoms resembled those reported for WVMV (
 <xref rid="b3-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Bos, 1996</xref>). 
 <italic>A. craccivora</italic> was also previously reported as a vector for WVMV (
 <xref rid="b3-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Bos, 1996</xref>). Further studies, including sequencing and sequence analysis unequivocally confirmed the presence of the virus (
 <xref rid="b34-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2006</xref>). Although we discovered a WVMV isolate from colonizing aphids collected from a locust tree, subsequent tests on the apparent host tree were negative for the virus. This could be due to uneven distribution of viruses in plants (

 <xref rid="b27-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Jones et al., 2017</xref>). Another interpretation of these results is that we accidentally collected a viruliferous winged aphid(s) from the locust tree. Winged aphids are mobile, and they may probe plants as they move and seek suitable food sources. As they probe, potyviruses adhere to mouthparts 
 <italic>via</italic> motifs in the viral HC-Pro and CP (
 <xref rid="b57-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Whitfield et al., 2015</xref>). In this case, although the winged aphid was probably collected from a legume by chance, it is likely that it picked up WVMV from an earlier visit to another legume. Potyviruses remain viable and infectious in the mouthparts of aphids for a few hours (
 <xref rid="b13-ppj-36-087" ref-type="bibr">Fereres and Raccah, 2015</xref>), which results in spread of these viruses to new host plants. This finding highlights both a potential advantage and potential challenge to using aphids to sample the potyvirome of the area, especially when dealing with winged aphids.
