 <caption>
  <p>A maximum likelihood (ML) tree constructed from coat protein gene sequences of Wisteria vein mosaic virus isolates. Numbers at each node indicate the percentage of supporting bootstrap samples in ML and neighbor-joining methods, respectively. The homologous sequence of an isolate of soybean mosaic virus (accession no. FJ640971) was used as the outgroup. The sequence of the isolate Th-W2259 (in green) was obtained in this study.</p>
