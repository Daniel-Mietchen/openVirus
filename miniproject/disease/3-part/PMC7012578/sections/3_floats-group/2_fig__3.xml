  <p>Amino acid sequence alignment of complete or partial coat protein sequences of representative isolates of Wisteria vein mosaic virus belonging to five phylogenetic groups: East Asian-1 to 3, North American and World. The sequence of the isolate Th-W2259 was obtained in this study. Amino acid substitutions are shown in black rectangles. Substitutions unique to the World and East Asian-3 groups are shown in dotted rectangles. The sequence of Beijing isolate was used as the reference sequence.</p>
