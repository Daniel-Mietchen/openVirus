<p>Our findings showed that HMPV infections occurred in all age groups, but the most affected age groups were those under five years of age, mainly infants less than one year old and older people. These results are consistent with the serological studies, which suggest that HMPV is acquired early in life, and at five years of age, approximately 70% develop antibodies against HMPV. The prevalence of antibodies against HMPV in people between the ages of six months and one year is 25%, and this prevalence increases to 55% for those between one and two years, to 70% for those from two to five years and 100% for individuals more than five years of age [
