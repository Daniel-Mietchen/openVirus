<p>We used a qualitative multiplex test for the simultaneous detection and identification of nucleic acids of different respiratory viruses (RSV, HMPV, HRV / HEV, PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, PIV4, AdV, HCoV HKU1, HCoV OC43, HCoV NL63, HCoV 229E and HBoV) from respiratory samples. The xTAG
 <sup>Â®</sup> RVP FAST v2 test incorporates the multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in Luminex platforms together with the universal tag classification system. The analysis also detects the MS2 bacteriophage, which must be added to each sample as an internal control and a procedure control prior to extraction (lamda bacteriophage DNA).
