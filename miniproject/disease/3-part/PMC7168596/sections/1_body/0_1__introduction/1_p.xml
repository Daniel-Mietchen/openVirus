<p>Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) pose a significant public health issue worldwide. There are more than 200 respiratory viruses that can cause ARIs. Influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are the most common viral agents associated with ARIs, accounting for around 70% of all ARIs [

All these viral pathogens are associated with acute lower respiratory infections and create a substantial burden of disease, particularly in young children (&lt;5 years), older individuals (≥65 years) and immune-compromised patients. HMPV has been detected in 4–16% of hospitalizations of children suffering from ARIs. Serologic surveys revealed that primary HMPV infection is common, as antibodies were detected in over 90% of individuals between 5 and 10 years of age [
