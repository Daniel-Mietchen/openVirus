<p>In Mexico, influenza surveillance is conducted by the national epidemiological surveillance system through sentinel monitoring. Influenza monitoring health units capture all probable cases of influenza on the national influenza platform and only take 10% of samples of patients with influenza-like diseases and 100% samples of patients with severe acute respiratory Infection. These health units are distributed throughout the country and include different sectors within the Ministry of Health (National Institute of Social Security for State workers, Mexican Institute of Social Security, Petroleos Mexicanos, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy). The surveillance of non-influenza respiratory viruses is conducted in the country based on samples of hospitalized patients and deaths that meet the operational definition of severe acute respiratory infection. From 2009 to 2018, 188,076 hospitalized cases and 16,812 deaths were registered on the national influenza platform, of which 111,260 and 8586, respectively, tested negative for influenza. Of the 119,846 samples of hospitalized patients and deaths throughout the health sector, 7283 (6%) samples were processed with the objective of identifying respiratory etiologic agents and determining the epidemiological behavior of HMPV in influenza-negative samples from hospitalized and deceased patients in Mexico between 2009 and 2018. The results of this study aim to raise awareness among clinicians about the impact of HMPV on severe acute respiratory infections, mainly among young children and older people. </p>
