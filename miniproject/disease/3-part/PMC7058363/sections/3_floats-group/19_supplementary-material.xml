 <caption>
  <p>Nonlinear multidimensional scaling plot of the number of arbovirus isolates by mosquito species across all sampling sites and seasons: natural history parameters (in red text), species (black text and +’s), and arboviruses (blue text and x’s). Only natural history parameters variables significant at p = 0.01 are shown, and only the names of the mosquito species which odds of arbovirus detection’s 95% confidence interval were greater than unity are shown.</p>
