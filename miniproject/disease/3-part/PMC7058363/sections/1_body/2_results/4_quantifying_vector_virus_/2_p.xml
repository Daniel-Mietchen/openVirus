<p>All arbovirus specific GLMMs further supported the associations among mosquitoes and arboviruses observed in our community ecology analyses (all GLMM tables are available as supporting information). With the exception of EEEV and TVTV, both avian and mammalian arboviruses associated with multiple vector species (

 <italic>Aedes stimulans</italic>, though this association should be interpreted cautiously as it is likely an artifact of the GLMM’s structure and the unusual timing/prevalence of WNV detections in this species at a particular site in a particular year in the data set. We detected no clear primary vectors for CVV, JCV, and PTV as infections in multiple species were dispersed throughout each virus’ detection period and many species across genera associated with these viruses (
