<p id="p0070">Existing medical tests are effective to find the “known bad,” aka diseases, but can be ineffective in detecting “unknown bad.” This is often the case as medical tests are specific for one disease, often under specific conditions (age, gender, genetic, stage of disease, type of treatment). Hence there is a need to develop tools for the unknown bad such as new infectious diseases or increased burden of existing infections due to mutation of existing strains. The parallel between cybersecurity and infectious diseases is on the spread following an “attack.” In the medical field, majority of the data corresponds to normal behaviors and known suspicious observations. Extreme values and rare events are of utmost importance for extreme risk evaluation (Japan’s recent events show the need for such methods). In the context of our problematic, infectious diseases, the low-frequency risk makes extreme value theory and rare event analysis models of choice for representing appropriately infectious risk-related uncertainties. It is obvious that having a sophisticated uncertainty representation that best fits data is of utmost importance for correctly detecting infectious risk (extreme values). The study and application of the extreme value theory coupled with the copula allows us to detect weak signals in large structured and unstructured data. It should be known that when we use dimension reduction methods, the weak signal at the extreme may be lost. With the era of AI and distributed computing we can partially overcome the curse of dimensionality. It should not be confusing with classical AI tools as extreme value theory is a branch of statistics that seeks to assess, from a given ordered sample the probability of events that are more extreme than any previously observed. It is then a high-dimensional statistical approach. There were several attempts to use extreme value theory in machine algorithms and deep learning such as the extreme value machine method by

By combining high-dimensional statistics and AI, there should be enough synergy to convince stakeholders and decision-makers to test their potential for predicting and modeling rare events such as pandemics, with a level of certainty (
