<p id="p0080">In practice, the methods of determination of extreme values is done using the “Block Maxima” method where data are divided into blocks corresponding to separate periods of time. Alternatively, extreme value analysis rely on extracting from a continuous record, the peak values reached for any period during which values exceed or fall below a certain threshold (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). This method is generally referred to as the “Peak Over Threshold” (POT) method. Of course, the choice of this threshold is, in itself, a problem, and this conditions the estimates of the parameters. On top of that, there are cluster phenomena, mainly when the time between two consecutive observations is small. In this case, it is common to observe “clusters” of extreme values, excluding being treated as if they were independent observations. Finally, in fine, it is often necessary to base the analysis of extreme values on small samples, even when they come from sets containing thousands of observations. For POT data, the analysis may involve fitting two distributions: one for the number of events in a known period of time (Poisson distribution) and the other for the size of the exceedances (Pareto distribution).
