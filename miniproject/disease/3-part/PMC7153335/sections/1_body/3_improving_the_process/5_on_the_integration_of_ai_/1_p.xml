<p id="p0095">The IoT gather a myriad of information on our habits. We can predict that the field of medicine will also highly benefit from IoT. More and more clinical laboratory tests are automated and the complexity of data generated can be more complex. Strategies to implement AI in health-care institutions still need to be developed (
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Beeler et al., 2018</xref>). The first aim is to setup a state-of-the-art data management system. While most hospitals and clinics have such systems in place, these are often obsolete as they are not adapted for the type of data we generate nowadays. In the constant chase against infectious diseases hospitals must have in place a systematic way to predict the emergence of nosocomial infections (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ). Such intelligent systems should consider multiple parameters including emergence of infectious diseases but also any particular change in the hospital’s routine. This was effectively performed using random forests and could bring attention to the hospital staff for possible gaps (
 <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Valleron, 2017</xref>). To reach such a level of predictivity there are several items to consider (i) upgrade the expertise in AI, (ii) develop synergies between mathematicians, biologists, and clinicians, and (iii) develop the culture around AI as done for previous technological developments. Of course, this implementation is not without some sacrifices. However, while AI is widely seen as a threat for “common” jobs, it should be seen as an opportunity. Hence, hospitals, clinics, and other surveillance institutions should turn it as a chance. Recent works have shown the benefit of integrating AI approaches for improved diagnosis. Ultrasound has proved to be a useful tool to validate diagnosis of lung infection: pneumonia. This diagnosis depends on two factors: the expertise of the operator and the potential bias during interpretation by the medical personal. Using pattern recognition and image analysis was used for automatic classification of pneumonia (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Correa et al., 2018</xref>). The neural network trained correctly identified pneumonia infiltrates (&gt; 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity). Moreover, the geographic information related to infectious diseases should be matched with the patients’ medical record and history (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Hay et al., 2013</xref>). This is very important to immediately understand the relationship between location and other characteristics of the patients such as professional activity, family environment, housing type, contact with animals, etc. This will enable hospitals, which are often the first site where patients are in contact with professionals, to become experts in forensic science, where the culprit is a microorganism. Recent advances were proposed such as building on simulation experiences (
 <xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Hogan et al., 2016</xref>). Preparedness for epidemic is mostly tested in hospital regarding number of beds, and activation of specific measures to avoid transmission of infection. Here, the Apollo structured vocabulary (XML Schema Document-based syntax) was developed to represent infectious disease scenarios and enable its utilization in independent simulators.
