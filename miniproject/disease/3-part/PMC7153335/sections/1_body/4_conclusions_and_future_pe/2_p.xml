<p id="p0110">Bio-surveillance still remains largely uncoordinated systems. There is a need to take advantage of the rapid progress made in the past decades in data processing, analytics, and utilization. Existing structures such as the MOH-driven global influenza surveillance could be used as examples to develop long-term capabilities in preventing infectious disease pandemics and their deleterious effects. Even intracountry organizations often fail to communicate information properly and to group this in a timely manner. As discussed in this chapter, the architecture of the data is an essential part that should be defined upstream to enable such data sharing, merging, and analysis. With increasing product exchanges and travels the risks for dissemination of infectious diseases would not be reduced unless strategic decisions are made at the global level regarding implementation of big data architectures and their integration for AI-driven solutions. There is also a temptation not to wait for policies to be implemented. For instance, personalized approaches for infectious diseases risk have been proposed (
 <xref rid="bb0320" ref-type="bibr">Vinarti and Hederman, 2018</xref>). This is taking three essential parameters of infectious diseases: (i) pathogenâ€™s availability, (ii) transmission method, and (iii) susceptible host. By testing three transmission types of infectious diseases, tuberculosis (air borne), Dengue (vector borne), and Cholera-India (water/food borne) the authors showed the effective and automatic generation of BN (risk probabilities), highly influenced by the person and the environment. Both population-wide and personalized approaches should be developed as infectious diseases have different infectivity, incubation time, transmission mode, and will lead to different symptoms depending on the host.
