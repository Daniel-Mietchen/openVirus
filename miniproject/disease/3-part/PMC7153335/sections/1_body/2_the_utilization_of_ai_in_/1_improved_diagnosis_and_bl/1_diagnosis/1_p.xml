<p id="p0040">The fear of infectious disease transmission has led authorities to set up processes to detect individuals at risk. As such, in Singapore airport terminals, temperature checks are performed systematically using a thermal camera to identify individuals with high temperature. This minimal check is one piece of the multiple steps taken forward to block transmission of infections. Recent approaches using mathematical modeling are improving this type of surveillance. A similar system was developed to detect infected patients by classification using vital signs (
 <xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, respiration rate, heart rate, and facial temperature were used to successfully classify individuals at higher risk for influenza using neural network and fuzzy clustering method. Fuzzy clustering methods differ from the 
 <italic>k</italic>-means clustering because of the addition of the membership values (degree of belongness to a cluster based on edge/centroid position in the said cluster) and the fuzzifier. As such, each point can belong to multiple clusters contrary to the nonfuzzy clustering methods. This demonstrates the ability to develop effective methods for identifying populations at risk. This triage is necessary and part of the process, even in the case of emergent infectious diseases, where efforts have to be prioritized. The use of machine learning methods can be used in more sophisticated contexts. For instance, a combination of support vector machine (SVM) learning algorithm, Matlab, leave one out cross-validation (LOOCV) method, and nested one-versus-one (OVO) SVM were used to better separate gene sequences from bacteria over other methods such as high-resolution melt (HRM). The combination of SVM and HRM could identify with high accuracy (100%) isolated bacteria (
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">Fraley et al., 2016</xref>). In real-life biological samples, blood samples from patients, the accuracy was affected which shows the limitation of developing tools from data generated in a controlled environment (laboratory). Whether this was due to poor quality of the biological samples or inherent to the interactions of the bacteria in a nonartificial environment is not known. Still, this shows that the mathematical tools developed should consider certain practicalities such as quality of the samples or duration of the laboratory process. This was tackled in the case of tuberculosis diagnosis, the second leading cause of death from infection in the world (
 <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Saybani et al., 2015</xref>). Because of the lengthy process to have a final decision regarding diagnosis, early indicators of the infectious were sought (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Existing systems exist such as the artificial immune recognition system (AIRS) for various diseases diagnosis. AIRS was developed using the immune system’s feature. The role of the immune system is to recognize threats and keep these in memory. Immunological memory is probably the most important feature of immunity as it allows us to better respond when the threat (infectious agent) is encountered a second time. This is in line with developing AI tools based on human cognitive function, the only difference here is the fact intelligence is decentralized to the periphery (blood). AIRS use 
 <italic>k</italic>-nearest neighbor (kNN) as a classifier. Few issues with kNN in machine learning (i) it identifies patterns of data without demanding for an exact match to known patters which provides low accuracy and (ii) if 
 <italic>k</italic> is too small or large there may be issues with noise and loose neighborhood, respectively. The AIRS that uses supervised machine learning methods (
 <xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Watkins and Boggess, 2002</xref>) has shown good accuracy (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Cuevas et al., 2012</xref>). Saybani et al. have improved the accuracy of such a classification aid by using SVM instead of kNN as classifier. SVM is a much more robust classifier and was applied to a tuberculosis cohort. With an accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 100%, Youden’s Index of 1, area under the curve (AUC) of 1, and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0, the new AIRS method was able to successfully classify tuberculosis patients. Another life threatening and pandemic infection, malaria, has been under intense research to develop novel, easily implementable, and cost-effective methods for diagnosis. Malaria diagnosis is time consuming and may require the intervention of several health services. Machine learning algorithms were developed to detect red blood cells (RBCs) infected with malaria from digital in-line holographic microscopy data, a fairly cheap technology (
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Go et al., 2018</xref>). Segmented holograms from individual RBC were tagged with several parameters and 10 of these were statistically different between healthy and infected RBCs. Several machine learning algorithms were applied to improve the malaria diagnostic capacity and the model trained by the SVM showed the best accuracy in separating healthy from infected RBCs for training (
 <italic>n</italic>  = 280, 96.78%) and testing sets (
 <italic>n</italic>  = 120, 97.50%). This DIHM-based AI methodology is simple and does not require complex blood sample processing.
