 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Adeboye et al., 2016</xref>) have utilized autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) for predicting infectious diseases. The ARIMA model was originally developed for economic applications but has been used in other domains such as for infections that occur in cyclic or repeating patterns. The time series models such as ARIMA are used to predict future outbreaks as they filter out high-frequency noise in the data to detect local trends based on linear dependence in observations in the series. The ARIMA model can integrate dynamic relationships and update the model based on recent events. Hence, ARIMA models have been widely used for epidemic time series forecasting including hemorrhagic fever, dengue fever, and tuberculosis. For the later and other infectious diseases, seasonality is an important aspect (

Using seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) and neural network auto-regression (SARIMA-NNAR) tuberculosis incidence and seasonality was analyzed in South Africa. This machine learning approach indicated the need to tackle coinfection issues, especially HIV, and also festival peak periods to be risk factors driving transmission. SARIMA-NNAR outputs with the best model based on the simulation performance: the Akaike information criterion (AIC), second-order AIC (AICc), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) which were lower than SARIMA alone. Other methods than ARIMA can indicate a potential risk associated with infection outbreak. In a study on Rift Valley Fever (RFV) emergence in Africa and the Arabic peninsula, maximum entropy machine learning methods have identified the key determinants associated with infectious risk. RVF is a vector-borne viral zoonosis and the ML output identified intermittent wetland, wild Bovidae richness, and sheep density as the main associations with landscape suitability for RVF outbreaks (

Derivatives of ARIMA such as an optimized ARIMA-generalized regression neural network (GRNN) model were used for forecasting and control of tuberculosis in a far from ideal environment of high population movement and coinfection history (HIV) in the Heng county (China). This shows a superior performance that the previous models to predict future incidence of tuberculosis (

This can be exemplified by a study showing how modeling [using three-step floating catchment area (3SFCA)] can help optimize health-care utilization by reallocating health-care resources to sites where the ratio of demand/supply is increasing dramatically (
