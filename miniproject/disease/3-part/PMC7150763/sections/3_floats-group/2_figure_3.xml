  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>) Cluster size distribution of HIV-1 transmission networks. The cluster size distribution of transmission networks consisted of 101 sequences that were linked as pairs, 15 clusters of 3 linked sequences, 4 clusters of 4 linked sequences, 1 cluster of 5 linked sequences, 1 cluster of 11 linked sequences and 1 cluster of 15 linked sequences. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Transmission pairs with phylogenetic evidence for the direction of HIV-1 transmission. The blue colored circles represent sequences that are linked to one another with phyloscanner scores (%) showing support for transmission in either direction between individual sequences. Sourceâ€“recipient pairs that had phyloscanner scores &gt;60% for linkage and &gt;60% for one direction were considered highly supported.
