   <bold>A</bold>) Phyloscan plot showing deep-sequence phylogenies reconstructed at 250 bp genomic window intervals across the genome. Ancestral state reconstruction was used to attribute phylogenetic lineages to individuals, and phylogenetic subgraphs were defined as groups of lineages that were attributed to the same individual. For a pair of individuals, the scan plots show the shortest patristic distance between subgraphs of both individuals (
   <italic>y</italic>-axis) and the topological relationship between subgraphs of both individuals (colors) across the genome (ancestral to one another (light blue), siblings (yellow), intermingled (dark blue), or disconnected (purple)). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Description of topological relationship between subgraphs in deep-sequence phylogenies. The phylogenetic topology or ordering of subgraphs is used to infer the likely direction of transmission between individuals [
   <xref rid="B48-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Ancestral 1-&gt;2 means that at least one subgraph from individual 1 is phylogenetically adjacent to a subgraph from individual 2, and that all adjacent subgraphs from individual 1 are ancestral to those of individual 2. This phylogenetic pattern is consistent with transmission from individual 1 to individual 2, possibly via unsampled intermediates. Similarly, ancestral 2-&gt;1 means at least one subgraph from individual 1 is phylogenetically adjacent to a subgraph from individual 2, and that all adjacent subgraphs from individual 1 are descendent from those of individual 2. This phylogenetic pattern is consistent with transmission from individual 2 to individual 1, possibly via unsampled intermediates. Intermingled 1~2 means that at least one subgraph from individual 1 is phylogenetically adjacent to one subgraph from individual 2, and that there are adjacent subgraphs from individual 1 ancestral to those of individual 2, and vice versa. Sibling 1~2 means that at least one subgraph from individual 1 is phylogenetically adjacent to one subgraph from individual 2, and that the adjacent subgraphs are phylogenetically next to each other. These two patterns indicate that the two individuals are closely related, but there is no evidence for the direction of transmission. Disconnected refers to individuals who have subgraphs that are not adjacent to each other. This pattern suggests that the two individuals are phylogenetically unlinked.
