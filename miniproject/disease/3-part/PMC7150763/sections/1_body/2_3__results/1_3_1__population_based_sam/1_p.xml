<p>Between August 2014 and August 2017, a total of 6185 HIV-1 positive individuals were enrolled in CHF and VCT campaigns, of whom 2531 were deep-sequenced (at a sequencing depth of &gt;30Ã— over at least 5000 nt of the HIV-1 genome). A total of 3200 participants were from the GP of whom 1578 were male and 1622 female. Then, 1309 (40.9%) samples were deep-sequenced, comprising 636 men (40.3% of 1578) and 673 women (41.5% of 1622). Further, 2185 participants were from fishing sites of whom 1103 were male and 1082 were female. Then, 895 (41.0%) samples were deep-sequenced, comprising 468 men (42.4% of 1103) and 427 (39.5% of 1082) women. There were 720 women at high risk and 80 male clients recruited, of whom 301 (41.8%) women at high risk and 26 (32.5%) clients were deep-sequenced. 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> provides further demographic information on the recruited and sampled individuals. The proportion of men and women who had their samples deep sequenced in each study population were similar, with the exception of male clients of women at high risk.
