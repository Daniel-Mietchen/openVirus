<p>We further characterized the age-specific HIV-1 transmission flows among the phylogenetically highly supported source–recipient pairs (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). We sought to use the same age band as in de Oliveira et al. [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] to enable a comparison between the population sampled in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, and our settings in central and southwestern Uganda. However, with 74 reconstructed source–recipient pairs between men and women, we reduced these further to age bands 18–24 years and 25–59 years at time of diagnosis. In the sample, transmission was not assortative within the two age groups in both the male-to-female and female-to-male direction, with estimated assortativity coefficients of 0.07 (95% CrI −0.18–0.33) and −0.08 (−0.40–0.28) respectively. More detailed analysis of the transmission flows showed that most (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18, 25.0%) phylogenetically reconstructed transmissions occurred from men of 25–59 years to women of 25–59 years, followed by transmissions (
 <italic>n</italic> = 13, 18.1%) from men of 25–59 years to women of 18–24 years. The estimated transmission flows among participants after adjusting for sequence sampling differences are reported in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> column 4. Considering transmission flows from men to women compared to vice versa, the estimated flow ratios were 3.16 (95% CrI 0.92–14.44) from men aged 18–24 years to women aged 18–24 years compared to vice versa, 1.29 (95% CrI 0.47–3.69) from men aged 18–24 years compared to vice versa, 2.63 (95% CrI 0.96–8.28) from men aged 25–59 compared to vice versa, and 2.29 (95% CrI 1.02–5.52) from men aged 25–59 to women aged 25–59 compared to vice versa.
