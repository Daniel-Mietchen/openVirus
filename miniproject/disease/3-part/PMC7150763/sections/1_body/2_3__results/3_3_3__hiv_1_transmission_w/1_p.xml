<p>The phylogenetically reconstructed networks included 105 source–recipient pairs (
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00331-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, column three). The majority of reconstructed source–recipient pairs were within the population groupings. Thirty-six (34.3%) were from GP to GP; 33 (31.4%) were from FF to FF, and 10 (9.5%) were from WHR to WHR. Between population groups, we found 14 (13.3%) source–recipient pairs from GP to FF, 9 (8.6%) pairs from the FF to the GP, 2 (1.9%) pairs from FF to WHR, and 1 pair (1.0%) from WHR to the GP.
