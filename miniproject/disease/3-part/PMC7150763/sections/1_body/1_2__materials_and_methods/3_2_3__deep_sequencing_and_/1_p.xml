<p>First, 10 mL of blood was collected from the study participants by venipuncture, including those on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Next generation sequencing was performed on samples from infected participants who did not report ART use and who had sufficient plasma viraemia (viral load &gt;1000 copies/mL). HIV-1 deep sequencing was performed using the Illumina Miseq platform at the Africa Health Research Institute (Durban, South Africa), and at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Hinxton, UK) [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Briefly, viral RNA was extracted from plasma samples using the QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA). Reverse transcription and amplification of the extracted viral RNA was done in a one-step RT-PCR reaction using a set of 4 HIV-1 primers that were designed for the amplification of HIV-1 genomes in four overlapping amplicons for all groups and subtypes [

Amplicons were pooled in equimolar quantities according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for the library preparation step using the Nextera XT kit. Library validation was performed using the Agilent Bioanalyzer before sequencing was done using the Miseq 250-bp paired end technology as previously described [
