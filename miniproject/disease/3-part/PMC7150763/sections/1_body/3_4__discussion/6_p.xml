<p>In conclusion, the reconstructed patterns of HIV-1 transmission found across cohorts of HIV-1 infected individuals in central and southwestern Uganda support previous findings [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] that high-prevalence fishing communities on Lake Victoria are net recipients of HIV-1 transmission flow in the local epidemic, and not a net source of transmission flow to the neighboring low-prevalence communities located further inland. We suggest that geographically targeted interventions that focus on high-prevalence FF populations should not restrict the roll-out of preventative measures in neighboring areas that could be sources of HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, this study supports calls to re-design prevention interventions to more effectively aid men of all ages to engage with and stay in care, and thereby reduce the disproportionate infection burden among women. Two-pronged intervention approaches that target both viral transmission sources to reduce transmission and sink populations to reduce risk of infection appear optimal in reducing the future HIV-1 incidence in key and general population groups.
