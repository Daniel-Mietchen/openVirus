<p>HIV-1 transmission in the GP and across populations into the FF communities was mostly driven by individuals above 25 years of age relative to those younger than 25 years. We found that an estimated 65.3% (44.1–82.9%) of women aged 18–24 years in the sample were infected by men above 25 years, consistent with findings from a recent study conducted in South Africa [

There was no combination of age groups in which transmissions from women to men outweighed those from men to women, suggesting that women in the sample are “sinks” of HIV-1 transmission regardless of age. These observations challenge the concept of a transmission cycle wherein young women are infected by older men, and then transmit to men of similar age [
