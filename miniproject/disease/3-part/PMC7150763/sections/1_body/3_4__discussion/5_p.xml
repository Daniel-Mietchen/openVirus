<p>Phylogenetic reconstruction of HIV transmission networks is increasingly common to characterize HIV dynamics, typically based on tools such as HIV-TRACE [

 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. These tools can be applied to Sanger sequence data, and the reconstructed networks represent sets of phylogenetically linked individuals whose viral genetic relatedness suggest a direct or indirect epidemiologic link. In contrast, the deep-sequence approach adopted here provides further information into the direction of transmission between individuals in such networks using additional signal in the topology of deep-sequence phylogenetic trees. However, while the deep-sequence approach is advantageous in several aspects, there are important potential limitations to consider in future applications. Most obviously, deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses require deep-sequence data, which is only beginning to become more broadly available [

 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. It is also important to consider the substantially larger requirements on storage (on the order of hundreds of gigabytes for our population-based study), as well as analysis time (~300 phylogenies reconstructed for each potential transmission network across sliding windows of the entire HIV genome is computationally intensive). Finally, due to the complexity involved in handling deep-sequence data, available analysis software does not easily install on Windows systems [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00331" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. However, these challenges are primarily of logistic nature and we see no fundamental reason that prevents use of HIV deep-sequence technology to support the End the HIV initiative in the US as well as similar efforts [
