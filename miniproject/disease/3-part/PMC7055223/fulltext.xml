These four arboviruses are endemic in overlapping regions due to the co-prevalence of the transmitting mosquito vector species <italic>Aedes</italic> and <italic>Culex</italic>. Thus, a multivalent vaccine that targets all four viruses would be of benefit to regions of the world where these diseases are endemic. We developed a potential Virus Like Particle (VLP) based multivalent vaccine candidate to target these diseases by using stable cell lines that continuously secrete VLPs in the culture supernatants. Moreover, inclusion of Capsid in the VLPs provides an additional viral protein leading to an enhanced immune response as evident from our previous studies with ZIKV. Immunization of Balb/c mice with different combinations of Capsid protein containing VLPs either as monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent formulation resulted in generation of high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly, the potential tetravalent VLP vaccine candidate provided strong neutralizing antibody titers against all four viruses. The 293&#x02009;T stable cell lines secreting VLPs were adapted to grow in suspension cultures to facilitate vaccine scale up. Our stable cell lines secreting individual VLPs provide a flexible yet scalable platform conveniently adaptable to different geographical regions as per the need. Further studies in appropriate animal models will be needed to define the efficacy of the multivalent vaccine candidate to protect against lethal virus challenge.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="npg-subject"><title>Subject terms</title><kwd>Protein vaccines</kwd><kwd>Viral infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Arthropod borne viruses are a group of pathogens that are transmitted in the human population via the bite of arthropods including mosquitoes, flies and ticks. Recent increase in arboviral epidemics in the human population has been attributed to various factors including urbanization and geographical expansion of both the host and vectors for these diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Amongst these arboviral diseases, Chikungunya (CHIKV), Japanese Encephalitis (JEV), Yellow Fever (YFV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) have expanded from isolated outbreaks in endemic areas to large scale epidemics affecting multiple continents<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The recent outbreaks of ZIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> and previous outbreaks of CHIKV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> are indications that these viruses will continue to plague the human population putting millions at risk and adding a significant burden on the healthcare system.</p><p id="Par3">The World Health Organization lists Dengue virus (DENV) as the most common mosquito-borne viral disease with CHIKV, YFV and JEV as other arboviruses being endemic in various parts of the world. The majority of human population that resides in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world is at risk for at least one of these arboviral infections. These pathogens are transmitted via vectors that are found in overlapping geographical regions; <italic>Aedes sp</italic> in the case of CHIKV, YFV and ZIKV and <italic>Culex sp</italic> in the case of JEV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the clinical symptoms of infection with these viruses can be remarkably similar making differential diagnosis difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. To complicate matters further, the serum cross reactivity between these viruses makes differential diagnosis and sero- surveillance a daunting task<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. Hence, an effective control of these viruses requires active vaccination in endemic areas and in the most vulnerable populations. Currently, a live attenuated virus (LAV) vaccine for YFV and a LAV as well as a killed JEV vaccine is available for use in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. However, these vaccines utilize viral strains from the early 70&#x02009;s and have limitations including safety and availability. Similarly, a tetravalent LAV vaccine for Dengue has recently been approved with limited success and much controversy regarding its effectiveness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">While LAV vaccines have been the candidate of choice in the past, recent advances in molecular biology has demonstrated the effectiveness of other vaccine platforms especially Virus Like Particles (VLPs). The success of the multivalent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of VLPs as vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Previously, we developed a VLP vaccine candidate for Zika virus and found that the immunogenicity of Capsid protein containing VLPs (CprME) was better than prME VLPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the use of stable cell lines to generate VLPs provides a much needed platform for the advancement and commercialization of this technology<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Besides being safe and efficacious, VLP vaccines also provide the added advantage of multivalency by combining closely related different VLPs in desired concentrations into a single formulation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The HPV vaccine is one such example where VLPs from 9 closely related strains of HPV are included to increase antigenic breadth and generate a broader immune response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">In this study, we used the VLP approach to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine targeting CHIKV, JEV, YFV and ZIKV termed (CJaYZ vaccine). Stable cell lines secreting Capsid protein containing VLPs for all four viruses were established and characterized. Concurrently, Reporter Virus Particle (RVP) assays were also developed for the four viruses to test neutralizing antibody activity. Immunogenicity of the VLPs as monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent combinations was tested in Balb/c mice. High level of neutralizing antibodies were generated against each virus both in monovalent as well as tetravalent combinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of Capsid protein containing VLPs for YFV and JEV as well as the first report demonstrating the efficacy of a multivalent VLP vaccine candidate against arboviruses. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a multivalent VLP vaccine to provide neutralizing antibody response against diverse arboviruses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Synthetic gene constructs expressing structural proteins of YFV, CHIKV and JEV and generation of Capsid protein containing VLPs</title><p id="Par6">To develop a multivalent arboviral vaccine, we first designed structural protein expression vectors for the above viruses.

We developed a consensus sequence for CHIKV, JEV and YFV to include the most representative circulating virus sequences in our vaccine platform. Full length genomic sequences from the ViPR database were used to generate a consensus sequence using DNAStar software. This consensus sequence was then used to generate a codon optimized expression vector spanning the structural proteins of CHIKV, JEV and YFV. Codon optimized sequences were synthesized commercially and cloned into pcDNA 3.1 vector and tested for protein expression.

The cleavage of capsid from prME regions in flaviviruses is mediated by the NS2B-NS3 protein complex that forms an active protease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. The viral protease cleaves off the Capsid protein from the cytoplasmic side of the ER.

Cells were cotransfected with ZIKV NS2B3 with either YFV or JEV CprME and the supernatants were assayed for VLP production. As demonstrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,D</xref>, JEV and YFV constructs showed minimum VLP release into the supernatants in the absence of NS2B3 expression.

In case of flaviviruses, the structural proteins (CprME) from a separate plasmid can complement a subgenomic WNV replicon expressing a GFP reporter gene to generate RVPs. This RVP based system has been shown to work well for different flaviviruses including WNV and Zika<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.

The rise in arboviral outbreaks including CHIKV, JEV, YFV and more recently ZIKV is driven by multiple factors including increased urbanization, increased global travel and trade as well as global climate changes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup>. While the incidence of arboviruses is on the rise, there is a lack of specific treatment for these diseases. Thus, there is a combined effort on prevention of infection by controlling the mosquito and tick vector populations, reducing mosquito and tick bites, travel advisories etc. However, such measures largely rely on availability of ample resources and human compliance and hence have proven less effective<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. On a similar note, the antigenic relatedness combined with overlapping clinical presentation between these viruses makes differential diagnosis and treatment difficult<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> suggesting that a more comprehensive approach that targets multiple arboviruses simultaneously is warranted. A multivalent vaccine targeting multiple arboviruses that are prevalent in majority of tropical and subtropical regions of the world would be highly desirable.</p><p id="Par19">Vaccination against arboviruses has been an effective strategy in limiting outbreaks. Currently a JEV and YFV vaccine is available in monovalent form<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>. Similarly a tetravalent vaccine for DENV (DENV1-4) has recently been approved for use in individuals previously exposed to Dengue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>. All of these vaccines include a form of live attenuated virus (LAV) that makes the production and use of these vaccines on a large scale challenging. For example, in the case of JEV, the vaccination programs are geared towards specific regions where the diseases are endemic or in the case of an outbreak<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Furthermore, the safety issue of live viruses precludes vaccination of certain group of people including immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. This is especially relevant in the case of ZIKV vaccination where the target population is largely going to be pregnant women.</p><p id="Par20">Virus like particles provide a safe and effective alternative to traditional live virus based vaccines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. These particles provide several advantages over other vaccine platforms including 1) resemble native viruses thereby providing repetitive antigens on the surface of VLPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>. 2) Are replication incompetent making them safe to use in immunocompromised populations. 3) Ease as well as consistency of production using stable cell lines provides easy scale up and commercialization. A VLP vaccine against CHIKV has shown efficacy in animal models and has now progressed to human trials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Similarly a ZIKV VLP vaccine has been tested in our lab in small animal model and shown to generate high titer neutralizing antibodies that protect against live virus challenge<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. While a number of arboviral VLPs have been developed including some for JEV and DENV, most of these studies utilize prME expression and the particles lack Capsid protein<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. The inclusion of Capsid protein in all of our VLP preps provides an additional antigen and better immunogenicity as evident from our Zika studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. Furthermore, previous studies on arboviral VLPs including CHIKV have been conducted in monovalent forms and there is no study on whether a multivalent VLP vaccine against related arboviruses would provide effective immunity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Our study was geared towards determining whether a multivalent VLP formulation encompassing CHIKV, JEV, YFV and ZIKV would provide effective neutralizing response against all four viruses. The use of multivalent VLPs from closely related viruses is not unprecedented and in fact, the current Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) VLP vaccine is a 9 valent vaccine against HPV types 6/11/16/18/31/33/45/52/58. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy and cost effectiveness of this multivalent VLP vaccine<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">In previous studies, our group has developed a prME and CprME VLP vaccine against ZIKV and demonstrated the superiority of Capsid protein containing VLP vaccine (CprME) over VLPs without capsid (prME)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. We have also developed a strategy to generate Capsid protein containing VLPs for ZIKV using a bicistronic vector that expresses the structural proteins CprME as well as the Zika NS2B3 protease. This bicistronic vector helped us establish stable cell lines that are high secretors of Zika CprME VLPs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>. In this study, we modified the bicistronic vector by replacing CprME region of ZIKV with that of YFV or JEV. Interestingly, ZIKV NS2B3 was effective at cleaving C from prME for both JEV and YFV allowing us to use the vector to establish stable cell lines. We used a self-inactivating lentiviral system with Blasticidin resistance gene to generate stable single cell clones of 293&#x02009;T cells secreting VLPs for the above four viruses. Extensive characterization showed that the cell lines were stable, produced VLPs relatively consistently either in the presence or absence of Blasticidin and could be scaled up to higher density cultures like five layer multiflasks or suspension cells for VLP production.</p><p id="Par22">Although use of multilayer flasks and other modified surface cell culture vessels are available for adherent cell expansion; the adaptation of adherent cells to suspension growth can be efficient strategy to scale up production to bioreactors. 293&#x02009;T cells are amiable to adaptation to suspension growth using specialized media and culture conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. We were able to adapt all of our stable cell lines to grow in 293&#x02009;T Ex Cell serum free media in shaker cultures with no reduction in VLP production compared to adherent cells. Furthermore, the use of serum free media provides an added advantage of eliminating animal origin products for commercial production of VLPs using these adapted cells in bioreactors.</p><p id="Par23">Immunization studies in Balb/c mice showed that the VLPs (monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent) generated neutralizing antibodies as determined via RVP based assay. Further, confirmation of the neutralizing potential will need to be conducted using infectious virus. We also find a dose dependent response against the antigen as tetravalent formulations had 1/4<sup>th</sup> the amount of each antigen (total protein) compared to the monovalent vaccine. The tetravalent vaccine hence generated a comparatively lower neutralizing antibody titer determined by RVP based neutralization assays and anti E antibodies determined via immunoprecipitation. These findings are important as this suggests that the amount of antigen/VLPs from each virus can be adjusted to achieve desired neutralizing efficacy. However, in order to achieve this, it will be important to determine the precise antigen amount of each VLP in the multivalent mix preferably as E antigen equivalents. The effectiveness of the VLPs in different combinations as bivalent or tetravalent combinations also shows the versatility of the system and the possibility of tailoring the vaccine to different geographical regions. Overall, our study provides a significant advancement both in terms of VLP vaccines as well as the strategy of using multivalent VLP vaccine candidates to target arboviruses. Further studies in appropriate animal models are needed to determine if the neutralizing antibody titers elicited upon immunization with the multivalent VLP vaccine are able to protect against a lethal virus challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>Cell lines and reagents</title><p id="Par24">Experiments were conducted in BSL2 containment following appropriate safely protocols and guidelines. 293&#x02009;T and Vero cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS.
