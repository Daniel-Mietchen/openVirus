<p id="Par13">For a vaccine candidate to be successful, it is desirable that there is minimum variability between preps and the cell line is stable and does not lose expression of the exogenous gene. Large scale expansion will also require the growth of cells in media free from selection agents like Blasticidin. To satisfy the above criteria, we tested the stability of the cell lines by two separate methods. The cells were cultured in the presence of Blasticidin for ~9 months. Thereafter, the cells were stained for E and Capsid protein expression and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>, the stable cell lines showed robust expression of E and Capsid proteins despite long term culture, suggesting stable integration of the exogenous gene. We next asked whether the cell lines were capable of robust VLPs secretion in the absence of blasticidin which may be desirable during bulk vaccine preparation. For this the cell lines were cultured in the absence of blasticidin for 30 days. After the terminal passage and when cells reached confluency, culture supernatants were concentrated and analyzed for VLP secretion via western blotting. Cells cultured alongside in the presence of Blasticidin were used for comparison. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>, cells cultured in the absence of Blasticidin showed comparable VLP production for all four cell lines (JEV, CHIKV, YFV and ZIKV) as cells cultured in the presence of Blasticidin. We next analyzed the morphology of VLPs produced from the stable cell lines after long term culture. The morphology of JEV, CHIKV, YFV and ZIKV particles was consistent with that of virus particles with an average diameter of 40–50 nm or slightly larger for CHIKV and densely staining membranes as demonstrated by electron microscopy
