Using the bicistronic lentivirus vector expressing Zika NS2B3 and flaviviral CprME’s, we generated stable cell lines that secrete high levels of JEV, YFV

 </sup>. For CHIKV, the lentivirus construct expressed the CE3E2E1 region. Lentivirus particles were used to transduce 293 T cells and transduced cells selected by culturing in the presence of Blasticidin. Single cell clones were characterized individually by analyzing E protein expression by flow cytometry and VLP secretion into the culture supernatants. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>, for JEV, the stable cell clone JD12 was best in VLP secretion and showed uniform E protein staining by flow cytometry. Similarly, the YF9 clone was selected for YFV
