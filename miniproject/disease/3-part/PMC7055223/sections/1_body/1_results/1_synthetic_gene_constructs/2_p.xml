<p id="Par7">Having successfully generated the structural protein expression vectors, we next analyzed VLP formation from our codon optimized structural protein expression vectors. The cleavage of capsid from prME regions in flaviviruses is mediated by the NS2B-NS3 protein complex that forms an active protease

 </sup>. The viral protease cleaves off the Capsid protein from the cytoplasmic side of the ER. This is required for the cell signalase to cleave off and release the prM

 </sup>. Expressing NS2B3 in trans is one method of providing the protease for cleavage and has been used previously for Zika virus VLP production. We wanted to test whether JEV and YFV CprME would be cleaved by the Zika NS2B3 protease. Cells were cotransfected with ZIKV NS2B3 with either YFV or JEV CprME and the supernatants were assayed for VLP production. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B,D</xref>, JEV and YFV constructs showed minimum VLP release into the supernatants in the absence of NS2B3 expression. Protease expression robustly increased VLP secretion as detected by both E and CA antibodies. Moreover, both ZIKV and WNV NS2B3 were efficient in cleaving ZIKV, YFV and JEV CprME with comparable VLP release in the supernatants
