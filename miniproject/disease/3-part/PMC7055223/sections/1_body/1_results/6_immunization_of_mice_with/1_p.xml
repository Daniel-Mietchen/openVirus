<p id="Par14">Having developed a robust system to produce VLPs, we next proceeded with testing the immunogenicity of the multivalent vaccine in murine model. As the vaccine is produced as individual VLPs

 <bold>)</bold>, it is important to test the monovalent formulation along with bivalent or tetravalent combinations. We included a bivalent formulation that included JEV and CHIKV VLPs as these two viruses are prevalent in Asia and a second bivalent group consisting of YFV and CHIKV VLPs as these two viruses are endemic in South America and Africa

 </sup>. Balb/c mice in groups of 6 each were immunized with either monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent VLPs complexed with alum (alhydrogel 2%) as an adjuvant. The protein content of the individual VLP preps and the multivalent formulation was comparable (Supplementary Figure
