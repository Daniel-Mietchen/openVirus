<p id="Par15">Sera from immunized mice was tested for generation of neutralizing antibodies using the RVP assay. As demonstrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6A–D</xref>, high levels of neutralizing antibodies were detected in all the groups of immunized mice. As anticipated, the titers were highest for the monovalent groups as they received the highest antigen dose. Mice immunized with bivalent and tetravalent vaccine combinations showed a slight reduction in neutralizing antibody titers likely due to the reduction in antigen dose. These data demonstrate the feasibility of a multivalent arboviral vaccine in eliciting a strong neutralizing antibody response.
