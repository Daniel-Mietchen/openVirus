<p id="Par24">Experiments were conducted in BSL2 containment following appropriate safely protocols and guidelines. 293 T and Vero cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. K562 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in RPMI media supplemented with 10% FBS. All transfections were performed using Turbofect reagent (Thermo Fisher) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Antibodies for detection of Zika Envelope (E) protein (GTX133314) and Capsid protein (GTX133317), JEV E protein (GTX125867) and Capsid protein (GTX634153), YFV E protein (GTX134024) and Capsid protein (GTX134022) by western blotting were from GeneTex. For detection of ZIKV, YFV and JEV E protein by flow cytometry, the 4G2 antibody (MAB10216, Millipore) was used. For CHIKV E1-E2 protein detection by flow cytometry and western blotting, the 6A11 clone was used from Novus Biologicals. JEV, YFV and ZIKV specific sera were kindly provided by BEI resources and the CHIKV specific sera was kindly provided by Centers for Disease Control.</p>
