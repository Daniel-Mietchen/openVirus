 </sup>. Briefly, 239 T cells were transfected with WNV Rep/GFP along with CprME plasmid from different flaviviruses (ZIKV, JEV, YFV). The RVPs were harvested 48 h post transfection, aliquoted and stored for future use. RVPs were titrated in Vero cells plated in 96 well clear bottom black plates at 5,000 cells per well. Thereafter, cells were infected with serial two-fold dilutions of the RVPs and incubated for 72 h. The plates were fixed using 4% formalin/PBS, images acquired using the Cytation5 imaging system (BioTek) which provides a read out of the number of GFP positive cells per well. For neutralization assays, mouse sera or antibodies were serially diluted in DMEM and incubated with the RVPs for 1 h at room temperature. Subsequently, the virus:sera mix was added to Vero cells and number of GFP positive cells quantitated as described above.
