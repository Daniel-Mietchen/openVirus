<p id="Par5">In this study, we used the VLP approach to develop a safe and efficacious vaccine targeting CHIKV, JEV, YFV and ZIKV termed (CJaYZ vaccine). Stable cell lines secreting Capsid protein containing VLPs for all four viruses were established and characterized. Concurrently, Reporter Virus Particle (RVP) assays were also developed for the four viruses to test neutralizing antibody activity. Immunogenicity of the VLPs as monovalent, bivalent or tetravalent combinations was tested in Balb/c mice. High level of neutralizing antibodies were generated against each virus both in monovalent as well as tetravalent combinations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the effectiveness of Capsid protein containing VLPs for YFV and JEV as well as the first report demonstrating the efficacy of a multivalent VLP vaccine candidate against arboviruses. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a multivalent VLP vaccine to provide neutralizing antibody response against diverse arboviruses.</p>
