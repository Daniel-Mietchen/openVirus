<p id="Par4">While LAV vaccines have been the candidate of choice in the past, recent advances in molecular biology has demonstrated the effectiveness of other vaccine platforms especially Virus Like Particles (VLPs). The success of the multivalent Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine has demonstrated the safety and efficacy of VLPs as vaccines

 </sup>. Previously, we developed a VLP vaccine candidate for Zika virus and found that the immunogenicity of Capsid protein containing VLPs (CprME) was better than prME VLPs

 </sup>. Besides being safe and efficacious, VLP vaccines also provide the added advantage of multivalency by combining closely related different VLPs in desired concentrations into a single formulation
