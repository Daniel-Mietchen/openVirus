   <bold>(B)</bold> YFV RVPs 
   <bold>(C)</bold> ZIKV RVPs or 
   <bold>(D)</bold> CHIKV RVPs after incubation with serial dilutions of virus specific sera or control sera. Infection was determined 72hrs post infection via automated microscopy. Data is represented as percent infection normalized to control sera as mean ± SD of triplicate observations.
