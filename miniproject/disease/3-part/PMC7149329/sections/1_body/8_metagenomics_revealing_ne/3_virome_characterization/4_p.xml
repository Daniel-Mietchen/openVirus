<p id="p0380">An interesting study, demonstrating the potential significance of a ship-mediated virus spread was carried out lately (

 <xref rid="bib108" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2015b</xref>). In this survey, the composition of viral communities in ballast and harbor waters were determined by metagenomic methods. The results showed that a majority of the viral sequences do not have any homologs in public databases, hence they could not be assigned to any taxa. The minority, the assigned viruses, were prevailed by dsDNA viruses, especially bacteriophages. However, sequences associated with emerging, important viruses of fish and shrimp were also detected, for example, the koi herpesvirus (KHV), infectious spleen, and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), white spot syndrome virus Thus, drawing attention to the fact, that ballast water of cargo ships could be an important vector for the transport of nonnative species to new aquatic environments including viruses (
