<p id="p0420">As for crustacean, NGS also contributed for discovering novel viral pathogens (
 <xref rid="bib231" ref-type="bibr">Van Aerle and Santos, 2017</xref>). Recently, an iridescent virus causing severe disease and high mortality in farmed whiteleg shrimp (
 <italic>Litopenaeus vannamei</italic>) has been reported and termed as shrimp hemocyte iridescent virus (SHIV). Partial sequences were obtained by viral metagenomics, and phylogenetic calculations based on the sequences of major capsid protein and ATPase showed that SHIV is a new iridescent virus, which could not be clustered into any of the five known genera of 
 <italic>Iridoviridae</italic>. Based on the sequences a diagnostic PCR was developed for detecting this novel virus threatening shrimp farming industry in China (
