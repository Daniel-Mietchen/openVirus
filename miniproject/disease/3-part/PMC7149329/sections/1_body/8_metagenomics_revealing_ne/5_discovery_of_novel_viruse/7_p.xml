<p id="p0425">Novel viral sequences were obtained from another shrimp species, the northern pink shrimp (
 <italic>Farfantepenaeus duorarum</italic>), using NGS on the hepatopancreas of 12 healthy shrimp captured from the Gulf of Mexico. Among the sequences, a novel nodavirus (
 <italic>F. duorarum</italic> nodavirus, FdNV) and a new CRESS DNA virus showing highest similarity to circoviruses were identified. The genome analysis of the FdNV suggested that the virus is closely related to nodaviruses causing white tail disease in giant river prawn (
 <italic>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</italic>) and muscle necrosis disease in whiteleg shrimp (
