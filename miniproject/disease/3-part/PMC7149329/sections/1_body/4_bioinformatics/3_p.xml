<p id="p0125">Nucleotide sequence analysis has a couple of steps, including base calling, the quality check of the sequencing runs. The read sequences are commonly stored in FASTQ file format or in the native raw data file formats depending on the sequencing instrument and the associated onboard software. This step is followed by quality control of the reads (searching for sequence errors and artifacts, platform-specific error profiles, etc.), then trimming (cleavage of adapters, tags, primers), and the alignment and assembly of contigs (mapping to reference sequences or de novo assembly). In general, there are several assembly tools and software (e.g., Geneious, Velvet, and ABySS); but nowadays viral genome specific genome assemblers, such as VICUNA, Viral Assembly Pipeline (VrAP), V-FAT, AV454, RIEMS, and metagenome assemblers like Omega, Genovo, MEGAHIT, MetaSpades, MetaVelvet are also available (

During de novo assembly, there is no available reference sequence for alignment; this technique is key to identify novel virus genome sequences. The next step is genome identification and annotation [open reading frame (ORF), the coding sequence, repeated elements, untranslated regions, etc.], search for single nucleotide polymorphism and insertion/deletion, and comparative sequence analysis. Commercially available analysis tools (e.g., CLCBIO Genomic Workbench, Avadis NGS, and Softgenetics Nextgene) offer user-friendly solutions for this purpose. Virus-specific data bases are useful to collect relevant information on virus families and also sequence data for subsequent taxonomic and phylogenetic classification (
