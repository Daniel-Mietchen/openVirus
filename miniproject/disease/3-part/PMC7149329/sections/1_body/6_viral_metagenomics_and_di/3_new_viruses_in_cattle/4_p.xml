A new strain of rotavirus A (RVA) G15P[14] in adult cows has been detected through next generation sequencing in Japan during epizootic diarrhea. This strain was associated with decreased milk production and a conclusion was drawn for its derivation from multiple reassortments among Japanese cattle. Various diverse genotypes have been discovered in Japanese cattle in VP3, NSP3, and NSP4 genes of rotavirus B (RVB). Their identity was found to be between around 52%â€“68% between human, murine, and porcine RVBs. Analysis and comparative studies were revealed for the independent evolutions of bovine RVBs (

In the Asia-Pacific region, a number of picornaviruses have been discovered in various hosts like bats, canines, felines, etc., in quick succession. Similarly, a number of picornaviruses have been found in bovines in Japan and named bovine Japanese Picornaviruses, due to having close relations with Chinese picornaviruses (
