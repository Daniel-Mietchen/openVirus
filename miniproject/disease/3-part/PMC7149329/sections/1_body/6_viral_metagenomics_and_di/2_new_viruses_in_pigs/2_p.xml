<p id="p0140">Several new astro- and boca-viruses were detected as well as RNA virus’s posavirus 1 and 2 in porcine fecal samples from North Carolina using 454 pyrosequencing (

Pestiviruses are prevalent among varied animal species ranging from all farm animals to wild animals, like wild boar and deer species. They were initially discovered through the classical and conventional methods. Now their detection rate has increased with the aid of metagenomics. In the United States, recently discovered pestiviruses have been through the metagenomic studies, under the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus metagenomic sequencing project (

Through critical and various cross-validating analysis, identity of a novel virus is set. Later, this virus was found to be widespread in European countries as well (

 <xref rid="bib213" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). Metagenomic analysis deciphers for a varied and extended viral flora from single-stranded RNA to circular DNA viruses.
