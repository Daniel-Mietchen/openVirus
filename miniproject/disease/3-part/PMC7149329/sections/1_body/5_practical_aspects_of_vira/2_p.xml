<p id="p0135">The application of viral metagenomics is being continuously adopted and used in veterinary medicine. In clinical diagnostics, the recognition and the treatment of novel and rare pathogens is a real challenge. With the new technical inventions, this problem could be solved. Another application is the real-time investigation of outbreaks caused by viral pathogens and the prevention of potential epidemics. The environmental monitoring of pathogens by viral metagenomics may also have an important role in efforts of infectious disease control. In this case, the quick reaction, the regulation, and risk assessment based on laboratory confirmed evidence is very important. Moreover, broad-range detection and identification of novel viruses or novel types of known viruses will be able to help us to broaden our range of vision, facilitate protection against viral agents, and understand viral diversity (

In several cases, the co-occurrence of the newly identified virus with a disease symptom does not proof the causation, although experimental and epidemiological verification is required. To provide disease causation, Mokili et al. proposed the metagenomics Kochâ€™s postulates. Viral metagenomics has the opportunity to identify the components of multifactorial infectious diseases (
