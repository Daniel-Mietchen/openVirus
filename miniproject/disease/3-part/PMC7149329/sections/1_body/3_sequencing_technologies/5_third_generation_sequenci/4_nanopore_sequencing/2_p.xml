<p id="p0110">Oxford Nanopore Technologies developed a new, incomparable system. The first nanopore based sequencer was the MinION, in 2014. Recently, the company offers miniature handheld devices (MinION, SmidgION) and high-throughput installations (PromethION) as well. Nanopore devices perform DNA and RNA sequencing directly and in real time. A nanopore is a nano-scale hole, which is created by pore-forming proteins and they act as channels embedded on lipid bilayer or artificial membrane (

During the sequencing, a voltage is applied across the membrane continuously, causing ionic current. When the DNA fragment is passed through the nanopore, the conductivity of ion currents in the pore changes, since the nucleotides have different shapes and they have a different effect on the change of the ionic flow.
