<p id="p0100">Pacific Biosciences developed the single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing. SMRT is based on DNA replication via DNA polymerase. When a fluorescent nucleotide is incorporated into the growing DNA chain, the enzyme cleaves off the fluorescent dye. The emitted signals are detectable in real time by a CCD camera placed inside the machine. The other key point of the method is the usage of zero-mode waveguides (ZMW), which are fine wells in a metallic film covering a chip. Each ZMW contains single DNA polymerase attached to their bottom and single DNA target. This allows the observation of a fluorescent labeled single molecule in real time, kept apart from the signal noise background (other fluorescent labeled molecules). With this new approach the read length has dramatically increased with maximum read lengths up to &gt;100Â kbp. A major drawback is the relatively high error rate (single pass accuracy ~86%, but the consensus accuracy &gt;99.99%), which stems mostly from indel errors.</p>
