<p id="p0115">At this time, the smallest instrument commercially available is the MinION. It is a portable, pocket-sized device; when it is attach to a laptop or computer freshly generated data are displayed on the screen in real time. The technology provides long read length (up to 1Â Mbp). The method does not require an amplification step and the detection of bases is fluorescent-tag free. However, the technology provides relatively high error rate which can be counterbalanced by increasing the sequencing depth [
