<p>The intensity of exposure to WNV in nature is very complex and depends on many factors such as the density of mosquito population, the mosquitoes behavior, the spatio-temporal distribution of the virus amplification hosts (birds) and their immunological status, and the availability of alternative sources of blood meals for the mosquitoes [

The results obtained in this study document the exposure of wild boars in central Italy to Flavivirus and provides evidence of the potential utility of European wild boar swine as sentinels of WNV. The advantages of using wild boar as WNV sentinels include: The opportunity to monitor WNV in a mammalian population (which may reflect human exposure more accurately than avian species), collaboration with already established wild boar collection programs (thus decreasing the cost of surveillance), the much larger quantities of serum available for testing than in mesomammals and small mammals, and the use of an overabundant feral species for surveillance rather than native fauna [
