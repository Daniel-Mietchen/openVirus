 <xref rid="B32-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Savini et al. [
 <xref rid="B33-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] have shown the circulation of USUV in Italy, particularly in Tuscany, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, and Friuli. The presence of an endemic cycle in local species of birds and mosquitos is supported by the detection of the virus in wild birds and by seroconversion in horses and sentinel chickens [
