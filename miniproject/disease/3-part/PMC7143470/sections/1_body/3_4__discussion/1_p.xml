<p>During our survey, 13 wild boars resulted positive for Flavivirus by cELISA, but VNT confirmed the presence of WNV specific antibody only in one European wild boar. ELISA positive, VNT negative samples indicate the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies versus WNV or against other antigenically related Flaviviruses, for example, the Usutu virus. In fact, even though Flavivirus activity has been limited in Italy, in the last decade, evidence of the circulation of Flaviviruses transmitted by mosquitoes such as WNV and Usutu virus (USUV) has been found with increasing frequency [
