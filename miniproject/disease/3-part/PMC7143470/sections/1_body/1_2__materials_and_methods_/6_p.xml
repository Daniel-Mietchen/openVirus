<p>To verify cELISA positive samples, neutralizing antibody titers to WNV were determined by a virus-neutralization test (VNT), according to Monaco et al. [
 <xref rid="B22-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. A serum sample was considered positive if the cytopathic effect (CPE) neutralization was greater than 90% at the lowest dilution (1:10). The serum titer represents the highest serum dilution capable of neutralizing over 90% of the CPE in cell culture. VNT titles greater than or equal to 1/10 were considered WNV specific. To confirm the presence of Flavivirus RNA in positive wild boar samples, an RT-PCR was performed using pan-Flavivirus primers, according to Johnson et al. [
 <xref rid="B27-animals-10-00494" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. No template and WNV field isolate positive samples were used in the RT-PCR assay as negative and positive controls, respectively. Nucleic Acid was purified from blood samples of cELISA positive wild boars using Quiazol Lysis Reagent (Quiagen, Venlo, The Nederlands) following the manufacturer’s instruction. The viral RNA was amplified using degenerate primers Flavi-For (sense) 5′-GCMATHTGGTWCATGTGG-3′ and Flavi-Rev (antisense) 5′-GTRTCCCAKCCDGCNGTRTC-3′ [

To synthesize the first-strand cDNA, the Super script II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was used. The mixture was incubated at 42 °C for 50 min, followed by heating at 95 °C for 5 min. Amplifications were performed using 2.5 U Takara LA Taq (Takara BIO, Inc., Japan) with the following thermal cycle: Initial denaturation at 94 °C for 3 min, 30 cycles of 94 °C for 45 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 90 s [

The amplification products were analyzed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis in TBE buffer (89 mM Tris-borate, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.2) by ChemiDoc gel scanner (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA).
