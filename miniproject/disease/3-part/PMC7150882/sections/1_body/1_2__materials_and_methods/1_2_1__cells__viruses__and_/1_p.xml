<p>Huh7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) and maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and sera were isolated from a rhesus monkey that was immunized with rHAdV4-GnGcopt after 210 days, and PBMCs were stored in liquid nitrogen for further use. RVFV MP-12 strains expressing eGFP (RVFV-SeGFP) and RVFV MP-12 strains expressing
