<p>PBMCs were stained with anti-CD3-PerCP (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), anti-CD19-Alexa Flour 700 (Beckman Coulter, Pasadena, CA, USA), anti-Human IgG-PE (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and Strep-tag Gn at 2 μg/5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells. After they were washed three times with FPBS (2% FBS), the PBMCs were stained with anti-Strep-APC (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA). Gn-specific memory B cells were defined as CD19
