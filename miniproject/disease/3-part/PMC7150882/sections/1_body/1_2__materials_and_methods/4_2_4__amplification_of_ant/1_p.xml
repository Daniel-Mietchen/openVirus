<p>The genes encoding Ig VH and VL chains were amplified by RT-PCR and nested PCR using a previously described method [
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In summary, the single cells sorted in 96-well plates were served as templates to generate cDNA of Ig VH and VL by RT-PCR using SuperScript™ III First-Strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA). The Ig VH and VL genes were produced via two rounds of nested PCR. The cDNAs were regarded as a template to amplify the products of first-round nested PCR. Then, the Ig VH and VL genes were amplified from the first round of nested PCR products. The cytomegalovirus promoter, Ig leader sequence, Ig VH/VL genes, Ig constant region (IgG1), and poly(A) sequence segments were linked by overlapping PCR to generate linear expression cassettes, which include full-length Ig heavy- or light-chain, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The purified PCR products of paired full-length Ig H and L genes were co-transfected into HEK293T cells using TurboFect transfection reagent (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The culture supernatants were collected at 48 h after transfection and stored at −20 °C for further use.
