<p>To express truncated Gn proteins via the prokaryotic expression system, the genes of truncated Gn proteins were cloned into the pET-32a vector. In particular, RVFV Gn (M residues 154–469, GenBank accession number: DQ380208.1) was truncated into 10 segments (45 aa each) and two adjacent segments overlapped by 15 amino acids, named Gn1a–Gn10a. Each segment was individually cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of the pET-32a vector.</p>
