<p>The Gn1a–Gn10a genes were cloned into pET-32a and transformed into 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> BL21(DE3) competent cells (Tiangen, Beijing, China). The culture was grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL of ampicillin until the OD
 <sub>600</sub> reached 0.8. The cultures were inducted with the final concentration of 0.5 mM of isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The target proteins were subsequently harvested by lysing 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> via ultrasonic waves and purified using a HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA).
