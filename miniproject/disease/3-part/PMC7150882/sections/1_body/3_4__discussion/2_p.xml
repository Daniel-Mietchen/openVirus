<p>Western blotting analysis showed that 1332F11 could not recognize Gn under reducing conditions, but 1331E4 could bind to Gn under the same conditions. This implied that 1332F11 could recognize a conformational epitope in Gn, and that 1331E4 could bind to linear epitope in Gn. Interestingly, a subsequent binding epitope identification assay revealed that two NAbs bind to the same polypeptide, 
 <sup>409</sup>GSKKCTGDAAFCSAY
 <sup>423</sup>, in Gn. A previous study presenting the crystal structure of Gn showed that this polypeptide contains one β-sheet and one α-helix [

Thus, the β-sheet and α-helix structure could be abolished under reducing conditions, leading to the failure of 1332F11 to recognize Gn under these conditions. Coincidentally, the targeting region of an RVFV-neutralizing antibody (RV-Gn1) has also been structurally mapped and found to be near the polypeptides

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, this corresponding region of SFTSV Gn is also targeted by the neutralizing antibody Mab4-5 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Taken together, these results demonstrate that domain III is likely an immunodominant part in Gn among phleboviruses. Therefore, this domain in Gn might be treated as a target for developing antibodies and vaccines. Further alanine-scanning mutagenesis of

 <sup>423</sup> suggested that 1331E4 and 1332F11 share six of the same critical residues (
