<p>As previously described, Gn and Gc proteins exist as a heterodimer on the viral surface [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00259" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Next, we superimposed the Gn component of our NAb–Gn docking model onto a reported model of assembled RVFV Gn–Gc (PDB ID: 6F9F). The results show that the sites in Gn that supporting binding of NAbs were close to the fusion loop in Gc (
