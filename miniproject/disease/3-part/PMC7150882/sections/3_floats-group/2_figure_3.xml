  <p>Western blot analysis of the type of NAb epitopes. The supernatants, collected from the Expi293F cells transfected with Gn expression vector (pCDNA3.4-Gn) and empty vector (pCDNA3.4-empty), were loaded into lane 1 and lane2, respectively. The indicated antibodies were incubated with the membrane transferred with RVFV Gn at a final concentration of 1 Î¼g/mL. The protein reacting with anti-Gn rabbit polyclonal antibody was used as a positive control.</p>
