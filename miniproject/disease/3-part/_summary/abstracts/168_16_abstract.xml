 <title>Objectives:</title>
 <p>To evaluate the prevalence of cardiac injury and its association with mortality in hospitalized patients infected with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus.</p>
 <sec>
  <title>Design:</title>
  <p>Retrospective cohort study.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Setting:</title>
  <p>A total of 133 hospitals in 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities of mainland China that admitted influenza A (H7N9) virus–infected patients between January 22, 2015, and June 16, 2017.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Patients:</title>
  <p>A total of 321 patients with influenza A (H7N9) virus infection were included in the final analysis.</p>

  <title>Interventions:</title>
  <p>None.</p>

  <title>Measurements and Main Results:</title>
  <p>Demographics and clinical characteristics were collected from medical records. Cardiac injury was defined according to cardiac biomarkers, electrocardiography, or echocardiography. Among the 321 patients, 203 (63.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Compared with the uninjured group, the cardiac injury group had lower Pa

   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), longer stay in the ICU (10.0 vs 9.0 d; 
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.029), and higher proportion of in-hospital death (64.0% vs 20.3%;

   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (hazards ratio, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.31–3.24) during hospitalization.

  <title>Conclusions:</title>
  <p>Cardiac injury is a frequent condition among hospitalized patients infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus, and it is associated with higher risk of mortality.</p>
