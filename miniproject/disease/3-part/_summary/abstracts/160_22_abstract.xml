 <p>The Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that has reemerged as a serious public health problem around the world. Syndromes of infected people range from asymptomatic infections to severe neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper, we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET), an alkaloid isolated from 
  <italic>Cephalotaxus drupacea</italic>, was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity 
  <italic>in vitro</italic> (i.e., in Vero and A549 cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1–4 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-
  <italic>Flavivirus</italic> medications.
