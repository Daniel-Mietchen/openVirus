 <p>The mosquito-borne La Crosse virus (LACV; genus 
  <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>, family 
  <italic>Peribunyaviridae</italic>, order 
  <italic>Bunyavirales</italic>) is prevalent in the United States and can cause severe childhood meningoencephalitis. Its main virulence factor, the nonstructural protein NSs, is a strong inhibitor of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system. NSs acts by imposing a global host mRNA synthesis shutoff, mediated by NSs-driven proteasomal degradation of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II. Here, we show that RPB1 degradation commences as early as 1â€‰h postinfection, and identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Elongin C (and its binding partners Elongins A and B) as an NSs cofactor involved in RPB1 degradation and in suppression of global as well as IFN-related mRNA synthesis.
