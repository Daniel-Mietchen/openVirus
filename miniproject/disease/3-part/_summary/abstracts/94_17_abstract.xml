 <p>After the mass campaign of Measles and Rubella vaccination in 2003 in Iran, the cases of measles and rubella infection decreased but still, the cases of rash and fever were reported. It is worth noting that some other viral infections show signs similar to measles and rubella such as some arboviruses. Considering the epidemic outbreak of arbovirus infections in countries neighbouring Iran, we performed this study to estimate the possibility of chikungunya and dengue fever among measles and rubella IgM negative patients presenting with rash and fever from December 2016 to November 2017 in the National Measles Laboratory at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Serum samples were selected at random from patients from eight provinces. The presence of DENV IgM and CHIKV IgM was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the 1306 sera tested, 210 were CHIKV seropositive and 82 were dengue seropositive. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the CHIKV IgM antibody seropositivity rate in Kerman (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.10–3.92; 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.024) and Fars (OR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.06–2.93; 
  <italic>P</italic> = 0.027). The DENV and CHIKV seropositivity rate in summer is higher than in other seasons (
  <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). Our seropositive samples suggest possible CHIKV and DENV infection in Iran. It is likely that these viruses are circulating in Iran and there is a need to study vector carriage of these two viruses.
