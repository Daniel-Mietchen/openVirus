 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a 
  <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (
  <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>) transmitted to humans mainly by the bite of an infected 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> is the primary epidemic vector of ZIKV and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic>, the secondary one. However, the epidemiological role of both 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> species in Central Africa where 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> was recently introduced is poorly characterized. Field-collected strains of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> from different ecological settings in Central Africa were experimentally infected with a ZIKV strain isolated in West Africa. Mosquitoes were analysed at 14- and 21-days post-exposure. Both 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> were able to transmit ZIKV but with higher overall transmission efficiency for 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> (57.9%) compared to 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> (41.5%). In addition, disseminated infection and transmission rates for both 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> varied significantly according to the location where they were sampled from. We conclude that both 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> are able to transmit ZIKV and may intervene as active Zika vectors in Central Africa. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological transmission of ZIKV in Central Africa and develop suitable strategy to prevent major ZIKV outbreaks in this region.
