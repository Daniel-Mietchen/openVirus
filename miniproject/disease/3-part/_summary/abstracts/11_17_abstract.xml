 <p>The development of reverse transcriptionâ€“polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers against conserved regions of most potyviral genomes enabled sampling of the potyvirome. However, these assays usually involve sampling potential host plants, but identifying infected plants when they are asymptomatic is challenging, and many plants, especially wild ones, contain inhibitors to DNA amplification. We used an alternative approach which utilized aphid vectors and indicator plants to identify potyviruses capable of infecting common bean (
  <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic>). Aphids were collected from a range of asymptomatic leguminous weeds and trees in Iran, and transferred to bean seedlings under controlled conditions. Bean plants were tested serologically for potyvirus infections four-weeks post-inoculation. The serological assay and symptomatology together indicated the presence of one potyvirus, and symptomology alone implied the presence of an unidentified virus. The partial genome of the potyvirus, encompassing the complete coat protein gene, was amplified using generic potyvirus primers. Sequence analysis of the amplicon confirmed the presence of an isolate of Wisteria vein mosaic virus (WVMV), a virus species not previously identified from Western Asia. Phylogenetic analyses of available WVMV sequences categorized them into five groups: East Asian-1 to 3, North American and World. The Iranian isolate clustered with those in the World group. Multiple sequence alignment indicated the presence of some genogroup-specific amino acid substitutions among the isolates studied. Chinese isolates were sister groups of other isolates and showed higher nucleotide distances as compared with the others, suggesting a possible Eastern-Asian origin of WVMV, the main region where 
  <italic>Wisteria</italic> might have originated.
