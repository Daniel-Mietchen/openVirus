 <p>African swine fever (ASF) is a highly virulent disease of swine with devastating socio‐economic consequences with persistence mechanisms that remain unknown in Eastern Europe. In this manuscript, we developed and fit a spatially explicit mechanistic epidemiological model to spatio‐temporal disease surveillance data using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the relative role of carcass‐based transmission in ASF virus persistence and spatial spread. We inferred that 53%‐66% of ASF virus transmission events occurred through the contact of susceptible hosts with dead carcasses and we found that the relative importance of transmission mechanisms depended critically on host density.
