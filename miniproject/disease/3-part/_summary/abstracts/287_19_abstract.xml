 <p>Using site-specific glycoproteomic analysis, Thompson etÂ al. characterize the diversity of N-glycosylation across human and avian hemagglutinin subtypes. This study reveals that hemagglutinins from human influenza viruses contain conserved glycosites with high-mannose glycosylation and demonstrates that mannose-binding lectins are useful tools for virus labeling and neutralization of H3N2 strains.</p>
