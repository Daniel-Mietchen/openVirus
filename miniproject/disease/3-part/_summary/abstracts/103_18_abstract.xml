  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>A qualitative study using semistructured interviews was conducted in Villavicencio. Six women who had been diagnosed with Zika virus infection during their pregnancies and whose fetus had suspected microcephaly participated in the investigation. Grounded theory was used and thematic content analysis was made for each category identified.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Three main themes affecting access to healthcare services were identified: (1) women knew basic information about the virus, but it was limited; (2) access to services was delayed due to their lack of availability or limited supply in the municipality; and (3) most of the participants made out‐of‐pocket payments to get access to services that were not provided.</p>

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p>Several gaps were identified in the provision of healthcare services to pregnant women during the Zika epidemic. Policy makers need to utilize the results from affected communities to develop and implement public policies that adapt and respond to their priorities and needs.</p>
