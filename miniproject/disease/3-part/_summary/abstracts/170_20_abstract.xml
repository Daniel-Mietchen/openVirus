  <italic>Cassava brown streak virus</italic> (CBSV), which was confined to coastal East Africa and the shores of Lake Malawi, has rapidly expanded its geographic range and now threatens regional food security. A recent laboratory experiment, in which vector access to plants infected with CBSV is varied, has provided plausible ranges for epidemiological parameters such as pathogen retention period (i.e., the duration that the pathogen is retained by the vector). In this work we introduce a new computational and mathematical framework for estimating epidemiological parameter values, instead of plausible ranges, from experiments in vector access to host plants. Since long distance carriage of insect vectors occurs within atmospheric air flows, the duration that the vector retains the pathogen (i.e., retention period) indirectly limits the scale of epidemics. Using our methods, we found that CBSV is retained for a far shorter duration than had previously been assumed. Our methods can be applied to the many experiments in vector access to host plants that have been conducted for numerous arthropod-transmitted plant pathogens across a range of genera. The ensuing epidemiological parameter estimates can be used in landscape computer simulations to predict epidemic risk and the prospects for control.
