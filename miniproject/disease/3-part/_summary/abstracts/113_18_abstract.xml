 <title>ABSTRACT</title>
 <p>For enteroviruses such as poliovirus (PV), empty capsids, which are antigenically indistinguishable from mature virions, are produced naturally during viral infection. The production of such capsids recombinantly, in heterologous systems such as yeast, have great potential as virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates. Here, using PV as an exemplar, we show the production of VLPs in 
  <named-content content-type="genus-species">Pichia pastoris</named-content> by coexpression of the structural precursor protein P1 and the viral protease 3CD. The level of expression of the potentially cytotoxic protease relative to that of the P1 precursor was modulated by three different approaches: expression of the P1 precursor and protease from different transcription units, separation of the P1 and protease proteins using the 
  <italic>Thosea asigna</italic> virus (TaV) 2A translation interruption sequence, or separation of the P1 and protease-coding sequences by an internal ribosome entry site sequence from 
  <italic>Rhopalosiphum padi</italic> virus (RhPV). We also investigate the antigenicity of VLPs containing previously characterized mutations when produced in 
  <italic>Pichia</italic>. Finally, using transmission electron microscopy and two-dimensional classification, we show that 
  <italic>Pichia</italic>-derived VLPs exhibited the classical icosahedral capsid structure displayed by enteroviruses.

  <bold>IMPORTANCE</bold> Although the current poliovirus immunization program has been extremely successful in reducing the number of cases of paralytic polio worldwide, now more cases are caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses than by wild poliovirus. Switching to inactivated poliovirus vaccines will reduce this over time; however, their production requires the growth of large amounts of virus. This biosafety concern can be addressed by producing just the virus capsid. The capsid serves to protect the genetic material, which causes disease when introduced into a cell. Therefore, empty capsids (virus-like particles [VLPs]), which lack the viral RNA genome, are safe both to make and to use. We exploit yeast as a versatile model expression system to produce VLPs, and here we specifically highlight the potential of this system to supply next-generation poliovirus vaccines to secure a polio-free world for the future.
