  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">Yellow fever (YF) is a severe, infectious, but non-communicable arboviral hemorrhagic disease. In the last decades, yellow fever virus (YFV) infections have been prevalent in endemic areas in Brazil, affecting human and non-human primate (NHP) populations. Monitoring of NHP infection started in 1999, and reports of epizootic diseases are considered important indicators of viral transmission, particularly in relation to the sylvatic cycle. This study presents the monitoring of YFV by real-time RT-PCR and the epidemiological findings related to the deaths of NHPs in the south-eastern states and in the north-eastern state of Bahia, during the outbreak of YF in Brazil during 2017 and 2018.</p>

  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and north-eastern Brazilian states were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR).</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and north-eastern Brazilian states were collected between 2017 and 2018. The samples were subjected to molecular diagnostics for YFV detection using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) techniques. Epizootics were coincident with human YF cases. Furthermore, our results showed that the YF frequency was higher among marmosets (
   <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp.) than in previous reports. Viremia in species of the genus 
   <italic>Alouatta</italic> and 
   <italic>Callithrix</italic> differed greatly.

  <title>Discussion</title>
  <p id="Par4">Our results indicate a need for further investigation of the role of 
   <italic>Callithrix</italic> spp. in the transmission cycles of YFV in Brazil. In particular, YFV transmission was observed in a region where viral circulation has not been recorded for decades and thus vaccination has not been previously recommended.

  <title>Conclusions</title>
  <p id="Par5">This highlights the need to straighten epizootic surveillance and evaluate the extent of vaccination programmes in Brazil in previously considered “YFV-free” areas of the country.</p>
