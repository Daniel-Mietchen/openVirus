 <p>Zika virus (ZIKV), isolated for the first time in Uganda in 1947, is transmitted to human beings mainly by the bite of an infected mosquitoes belonging to the 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> genus notably 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic>. Both 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> species are present in Central Africa, however their epidemiological role is poorly characterized. Here, we assessed the ability of 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> collected in different ecological settings in Central Africa to transmit a ZIKV strain isolated in West Africa. Analysis showed that both 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> and 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> are able to transmit ZIKV but with higher overall transmission efficiency for 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> compared to 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic>. In addition, disseminated infection and transmission rates for both 
  <italic>Aedes</italic> species varied significantly according to the sampling location. Overall, our result suggests that in Central Africa, 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic> is more competent to transmit ZIKV than 
  <italic>Ae</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> although parameters such as the feeding behaviour, longevity and mosquito densities can modulate pathogens transmission in nature. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological transmission of ZIKV in Central Africa and develop suitable strategy to prevent major ZIKV outbreaks in this region.
