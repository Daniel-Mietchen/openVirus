  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>This study comprised all consecutive patients with first STEMI (n = 4,659; aged 18–80 years) admitted to the invasive catheterization laboratory between 2010–2016, at Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, covering eastern Denmark (2.6 million inhabitants, 45% of the Danish population). Hospital admission, prescription, and vital status data were assessed using Danish nationwide registries. We utilized monthly/weekly surveillance data for enterovirus and influenza from the Danish National Microbiology Database (2010–2016) that receives copies of laboratory tests from all Danish departments of clinical microbiology.</p>

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>Of the 4,659 consecutively enrolled STEMI patients, 581 (12%) had VF before primary percutaneous coronary intervention. In a subset (n = 807), we found that VF patients experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with the patients without VF (OR 3.39, 95% CI 1.76–6.54). During the study period, 2,704 individuals were diagnosed with enterovirus and 19,742 with influenza. No significant association between enterovirus and VF (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.99–1.02), influenza and VF (OR 1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.00), or week number and VF (p-value 0.94 for enterovirus and 0.89 for influenza) was found.</p>

  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p>We found no clear seasonality of VF during first STEMI. Even though VF patients had experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with patients without VF, no relationship was found between enterovirus or influenza exposure and occurrence of VF.</p>
