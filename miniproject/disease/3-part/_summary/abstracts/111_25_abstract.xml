 <p>In Brazil, Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are reported as being transmitted exclusively by 
  <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> in urban settings. This study established the vectors and viruses involved in an arbovirus outbreak that occurred in 2019 in a rural area of Esp√≠rito Santo state, Brazil. Mosquitoes collected were morphologically identified, sorted in samples, and submitted to molecular analysis for arboviruses detection. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed for the viral sequence obtained. All 393 mosquitoes were identified as 
  <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic>. DENV-1 genotype V was present in one sample and another sample was positive for ZIKV. The DENV-1 clustered with viruses that have circulated in previous years in large urban centers of different regions in Brazil. This is the first report of 
  <italic>A</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> infected by DENV and ZIKV during an outbreak in a rural area in Brazil, indicating its involvement in arboviral transmission. The DENV-1 strain found in the 
  <italic>A</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> was not new in Brazil, being involved previously in epidemics related to 
  <italic>A</italic>. 
  <italic>aegypti</italic>, suggesting the potential to 
  <italic>A</italic>. 
  <italic>albopictus</italic> in transmitting viruses already circulating in the Brazilian population. This finding also indicates the possibility of these viruses to disperse across urban and rural settings, imposing additional challenges for the control of the diseases.
