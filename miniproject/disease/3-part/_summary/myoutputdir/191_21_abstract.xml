  <bold>Novel antivirals targeting ZIKA virus</bold>: The recent outbreaks of Zika virus (ZIKV) worldwide make the discovery of novel antivirals a priority. Using a structure‐based virtual screening approach we were able to identify and develop a novel series of carbazoyl‐urea derivatives that are able to inhibit the ZIKV NS5‐MTase as well as ZIKV replication at micromolar concentration.
