It is unknown from which anatomical site of the respiratory tract influenza A virus transmission occurs. Here pairs of genetically tagged and untagged influenza A/H1N1 A/H3N2 and A/H5N1 viruses that are transmissible via the air are used to co-infect donor ferrets via the intranasal and intratracheal routes to cause an upper and lower respiratory tract infection respectively. In all transmission cases we observe that the viruses in the recipient ferrets are of the same genotype as the viruses inoculated intranasally demonstrating that they are expelled from the upper respiratory tract of ferrets rather than from trachea or the lower airways. Moreover influenza A viruses that are transmissible via the air preferentially infect ferret and human nasal respiratory epithelium. These results indicate that virus replication in the upper respiratory tract the nasal respiratory epithelium in particular of donors is a driver for transmission of influenza A viruses via the air.  ,
PMC7005743,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\1_15_abstract.xml,   Here the authors perform simultaneous inoculation of genetically tagged influenza A virus in ferrets and show that airborne transmissible viruses are preferentially transmitted from the upper respiratory tract which correlates with high replication ability in the ferret and human nasal respiratory epithelium.  ,
PMC7008609,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\2_15_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT     Objectives.   To assess the distribution of Mayaro virus (MAYV) in Latin America and the Caribbean and evaluate existing country-level MAYV surveillance mechanisms.       Methods.   Research was conducted from May 2018 through May 2019 to collect data from academic literature on Mayaro fever in Latin America and the Caribbean. PubMed ClinicalKey Scopus Nature SciELO LILACS and Google Scholar were searched for peer-reviewed journal articles and data from health authorities including the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and ministries of health was also sought. MAYV-related publications published from 1954 through 2019 were screened. Publications that added to the overall understanding of MAYV including its geographical and epidemiological distribution were included in this report.       Results.   A total of 901 MAYV cases have been reported in humans in countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. Since its discovery in 1954 in Trinidad and Tobago MAYV has been isolated from individuals living in Argentina Bolivia Brazil Ecuador French Guiana Haiti Mexico Panama Peru and Venezuela. Of those 901 cases 42 of them were reported exclusively by health authorities. In contrast 843 confirmed and presumptive autochthonous cases and an additional 16 imported cases were identified in academic literature. No country-level surveillance mechanisms for MAYV were recorded in academic literature or by health authorities.       Conclusions.   This report demonstrates that MAYV surveillance efforts are limited in comparison to the virus’s presence in Latin America and the Caribbean highlighting the importance of enhancing arboviral surveillance systems in the affected countries.    ,
PMC7010214,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\3_27_abstract.xml,   SUMMARY  Influenza A viruses (IAVs) have a remarkable tropism in their ability to circulate in both mammalian and avian species. The IAV NS1 protein is a multifunctional virulence factor that inhibits the type I interferon host response through a myriad of mechanisms. How NS1 has evolved to enable this remarkable property across species and its specific impact in the overall replication pathogenicity and host preference remain unknown. Here we analyze the NS1 evolutionary landscape and host tropism using a barcoded library of recombinant IAVs. Results show a surprisingly great variety of NS1 phenotypes according to their ability to replicate in different hosts. The IAV NS1 genes appear to have taken diverse and random evolutionary pathways within their multiple phylogenetic lineages. In summary the high evolutionary plasticity of this viral protein underscores the ability of IAVs to adapt to multiple hosts and aids in our understanding of its global prevalence.  ,

PMC7010294,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\6_23_abstract.xml,      Background   Arboviruses transmitted by day-biting     Aedes mosquitoes are a major public health concern. With the challenges inherent in arbovirus vaccine and therapeutics development vector control and bite prevention strategies are among the limited options available for immediate intervention. Bite prevention through personal protective technologies (PPT) such as topical mosquito repellents or repellent-impregnated clothing may help to decrease biting rates and therefore the risk of disease in groups most susceptible to adverse outcomes from Zika virus. However achieving high uptake and compliance with PPT can be challenging.          Methodology/Principal findings   To gain an insight into the knowledge and concerns of pregnant women surrounding Zika and their opinions regarding PPT particularly repellent clothing a focus group study was carried out with pregnant women women of reproductive age and semi-structured interviews with their male partners in two cities in Colombia. The discussions revealed shortfalls in basic knowledge of Zika virus with several pregnant participants reporting being unaware of the potential for Zika-related congenital malformations. Although participants generally considered Zika to be a significant personal threat most rated it as less of a concern than dengue or diarrheal diseases. Overall repellent clothing and other forms of PPT were viewed as effective although some participants expressed concerns over the high costs of repellents and safety fears of regular contact with repellent chemicals which they perceived as potentially harmful. Plant-derived repellents were considered to be safer than synthetic chemical repellents. Discussions also highlighted that health centers were the preferred source of information on bite-reduction.       Conclusions/Significance   Achieving high uptake and compliance with PPT in populations most at risk of adverse outcomes from Zika infection requires engaging key users in open dialogue to identify and address any practical issues regarding PPT use and concerns over safety. The findings presented here suggest that educational campaigns should strongly emphasize the risks associated with Zika during pregnancy and discuss safety profiles of approved synthetic repellents and the availability of EPA-approved plant-based repellents. In addition the economic and political context should be a major consideration when evaluating personal mosquito-repellent strategies.    ,
PMC7010294,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\7_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Although mosquito personal protective technologies (PPT) such as topical DEET or permethrin impregnated clothing show high efficacy in laboratory studies they frequently achieve poor population uptake. This is likely due to numerous factors including high costs dislike of the feel or smell of the product and safety fears over the repellent chemicals. The targeted use of PPT to those at elevated risk of severe disease such as pregnant women in Zika endemic regions may help mitigate adverse outcomes from Zika virus infection. To explore ways of increasing the appeal of PPT a focus group study was performed with pregnant women and women of reproductive age in two cities in Colombia. Although almost all participants had heard of Zika not all pregnant women were aware of the potential for Zika-related birth defects. PPT products were generally viewed as effective although many expressed fears that repeated exposure to chemicals may affect fetal development. There was limited trust over repellent-manufacturer claims of safety and women from low socioeconomic groups believed PPT products to be unaffordable. Participants identified health centers as trusted sources of bite-prevention education suggesting health workers should emphasize safety and efficacy of approved repellents.  ,
PMC7012031,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\8_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT     BACKGROUND:    Influenza is a highly contagious acute viral respiratory tract infection. The emergence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2009 caused a pandemic. Since then it has become a seasonal influenza virus. It causes symptoms ranging from mild to severe illness which might be fatal particularly in people with underlying chronic medical conditions immunocompromised people the elderly and pregnant women.       OBJECTIVE:    Describe the data generated by the influenza A(H1N1) pdm09 surveillance in Saudi Arabia from 2010 to 2016.       DESIGN:    Retrospective descriptive.       SETTING:    Hospitals reporting to the Ministry of Health.       MATERIALS AND METHODS:    We studied aggregate data on hospitalized cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Saudi Arabia between 2010 and 2016. The surveillance system used the case definition proposed by the WHO. The cases were confirmed by performing the real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) on upper respiratory samples.       MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:    Suspected and confirmed influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 cases.       SAMPLE SIZE:    113 502 suspected H1N1 cases and 17 094 (15.1%) confirmed cases.       RESULTS:    Most of the reported cases were registered in the Riyadh region. During the period of the study the highest number of confirmed cases 9262 (54.2 %) was in 2015. The case fatality rate for confirmed cases was 3.6%.       CONCLUSION:    Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 showed seasonal trends. The number of suspected influenza cases each year was proportionate to the number of confirmed cases for that year. Riyadh Jeddah and the Eastern areas (regions with the highest population) reported most of the cases.       LIMITATION:    Only one strain of H1N1 was tested.       CONFLICT OF INTEREST:    None.    ,

After an antigenic stasis of about six years new antigenically distinct variants of the virus emerged globally in 2016 necessitating a change in the vaccine formulation for the first time in 2017. Herein we analyzed thirty-eight HA sequences of influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 strains isolated in Kenya during 2015–2018 seasons to evaluate their antigenic and molecular properties based on the HA1 sub-unit. Our analyses revealed that the A (H1N1) pdm09 strains that circulated in Kenya during this period belonged to genetic clade 6B subclade 6B.1 and 6B.2. The Kenyan 2015 and 2016 isolates differed from the vaccine strain A/California/07/2009 at nine and fourteen antigenic sites in the HA1 respectively. Further those isolated in 2017 and 2018 correspondingly varied from A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain at three and fifteen antigenic sites. The predicted vaccine efficacy of A/California/07/2009 against Kenyan 2015/2016 was estimated to be 32.4% while A/Michigan/45/2015 showed estimated vaccine efficacies of 39.6% - 41.8% and 32.4% - 42.1% against Kenyan 2017 and 2018 strains respectively. Hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) assay using ferret post-infection reference antiserum showed that the titers for the Kenyan 2015/2016 isolates were 2–8-fold lower compared to the vaccine strain. Overall our results suggest the A (H1N1) pdm09 viruses that circulated in Kenya during 2015/2016 influenza seasons were antigenic variants of the recommended vaccine strains denoting sub-optimal vaccine efficacy. Additionally data generated point to a swiftly evolving influenza A (H1N1) pdm09 virus in recent post pandemic era underscoring the need for sustained surveillance coupled with molecular and antigenic analyses to inform appropriate and timely influenza vaccine update.  ,
PMC7012578,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\11_17_abstract.xml,   The development of reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction using degenerate primers against conserved regions of most potyviral genomes enabled sampling of the potyvirome. However these assays usually involve sampling potential host plants but identifying infected plants when they are asymptomatic is challenging and many plants especially wild ones contain inhibitors to DNA amplification. We used an alternative approach which utilized aphid vectors and indicator plants to identify potyviruses capable of infecting common bean (   Phaseolus vulgaris). Aphids were collected from a range of asymptomatic leguminous weeds and trees in Iran and transferred to bean seedlings under controlled conditions. Bean plants were tested serologically for potyvirus infections four-weeks post-inoculation. The serological assay and symptomatology together indicated the presence of one potyvirus and symptomology alone implied the presence of an unidentified virus. The partial genome of the potyvirus encompassing the complete coat protein gene was amplified using generic potyvirus primers. Sequence analysis of the amplicon confirmed the presence of an isolate of Wisteria vein mosaic virus (WVMV) a virus species not previously identified from Western Asia. Phylogenetic analyses of available WVMV sequences categorized them into five groups: East Asian-1 to 3 North American and World. The Iranian isolate clustered with those in the World group. Multiple sequence alignment indicated the presence of some genogroup-specific amino acid substitutions among the isolates studied. Chinese isolates were sister groups of other isolates and showed higher nucleotide distances as compared with the others suggesting a possible Eastern-Asian origin of WVMV the main region where    Wisteria might have originated.    ,
PMC7014709,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\12_13_abstract.xml,      Background   The rate of S68G mutation in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase has increased and is closely related to the K65R mutation among CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment. We aimed to explore the temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations and disclose the role of the former on susceptibility to nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) and viral replication with the K65R double mutations among CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment.       Methods   The occurrence of S68G and K65R mutations was evaluated among HIV-1 of various subtypes in the global HIV Drug Resistance Database. The temporal association of S68G and K65R mutations was analyzed through next-generation sequencing in four CRF01_AE-infected patients who failed treatment with tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz. The impact of the S68G mutation on susceptibility to NRTI and replication fitness was analyzed using pseudovirus phenotypic resistance assays and growth competition assays respectively.       Results   The frequency of the S68G mutation increased by 1.4–9.7% in almost all HIV subtypes and circulating recombinant forms in treatment-experienced patients except subtype F. The S68G mutation often occurred in conjunction with the K65R mutation among RTI-treated patients with frequencies ranging 21.1–61.7% in various subtypes. Next-generation sequencing revealed that the S68G mutation occurred following the K65R mutation in three of the four CRF01_AE-infected patients. In these three patients there was no significant change detected in the half maximal inhibitory concentration for zidovudine tenofovir or lamivudine between the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations as demonstrated by the phenotypic resistance assays. Virus stocks of the K65R and K65R/S68G mutations were mixed with 4:6 1:1 and 9:1 and cultured for 13 days the K65R/S68G mutants outgrew those of the K65R mutants irrespective of the input ratio.       Conclusions   S68G may be a natural polymorphism and compensatory mutation of K65R selected by NRTIs in the CRF01_AE strain of HIV-1. This mutation does not affect susceptibility to NRTI; however it improves the replication fitness of K65R mutants. This study deciphers the role of the S68G mutation in the HIV reverse transcriptase of the CRF01_AE strain and provides new evidence for the interpretation of drug-resistant mutations in non-B subtypes of HIV-1.    ,
PMC7014767,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\13_13_abstract.xml,      Background   This study is to elucidate the disinfection effect of ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps against human pathogens. Ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps emit mainly 254 nm ultraviolet light C (UVC) with about 10% power of Vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV) light at 185 nm. The combination of UVC and VUV can inactivate airborne pathogens by disrupting the genetic materials or generation of reactive oxygen species respectively. In this study inactivation of common bacteria including     Escherichia coli ATCC25922 (    E. coli) Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase-producing     E. coli (ESBL) Methicillin-resistant     Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and     Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and that of influenza A viruses H1N1 and H3N2 under the radiation from ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps was examined. Log reduction values at different treatment durations were determined.          Methods   In vitro tests were carried out. Various bacterium and virus suspensions were added onto nitrocellulose filter papers and subjected to the illumination from ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamps. The extents of pathogen inactivation at different illumination times were investigated by conducting a series of experiments with increasing duration of illumination. log10 reduction in CFU/ml and reduction at log10(TCID    50) were respectively measured for bacteria and viruses. The disinfection effectiveness of this type of lamps against the pathogens under the environment with a moderate barrier to light was therefore evaluated.          Results   Ozone producing low-pressure Hg vapor lamp successfully inactivated these human pathogens. Nevertheless among these pathogens disinfection of MTB required more intense treatment. In the best tested situation 3-log10 inactivation of pathogens can be achieved with ≤10 min of VUV treatment except MTB which needed about 20 min. This demonstrated the high resistance against UV disinfection of MTB.       Conclusions   Following the criteria that valid germicidal results can be reflected with 3-log10 inactivation for bacteria 4-log10 inactivation for viruses and 5-log10 inactivation for MTB most of the bacteria required ≤10 min of VUV treatment 20 min for the influenza viruses while MTB needed about 30 min VUV treatment. This indicated that VUV light is an effective approach against different environmental microorganisms.    ,
PMC7017508,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\14_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Community–acquired pneumonia (CAP) is one of the leading worldwide causes of childhood morbidity and mortality. Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization.       Methods   We conducted a retrospective study in 30994 children (aged 0–18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea.     Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP) and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests.          Results   MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015) the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children &lt; 2 years of age RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP followed by MP (9.4%); however MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2–18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia.       Conclusions   The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.    ,
PMC7018131,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\15_18_abstract.xml,   Dengue is a viral disease caused by an arbovirus of the genus    Flavivirus transmitted in Brazil by the mosquito    Aedes aegypti (Linnaeus 1762). Simultaneous circulation of the four viral serotypes (DENV1 2 3 and 4) has been occurring since 2010 and determines a scenario of hyperendemicity of the disease in the country. This study aimed to describe the epidemiological situation of dengue in Brazil in the last three decades. This is a descriptive observational study that used data of dengue notifications of the National Surveillance System from 1990 to 2017 available in the Epidemiological Bulletins and publications of the Ministry of Health. Dengue incidence increased in all Brazilian regions and the interepidemic periods are distinct in the different regions. The greatest epidemics was recorded in 2015 (1688688 cases) with an incidence of 826.0 cases per 100000 inhabitants which illustrates the occurrence of dengue in the last decade with increasingly higher epidemic peaks and shortening of the interepidemic periods. The incidence and mortality indices point to the need to improve the organization of response to dengue epidemics. This study provides information on the epidemiology of dengue in the country and can be used in the formulation of public health policies to reduce the impacts of viral transmission.    ,
PMC7019041,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\16_16_abstract.xml,   Despite evidence of augmented Natural Killer (NK) cell responses after influenza vaccination the role of these cells in vaccine-induced immunity remains unclear. Here we hypothesized that NK cells might increase viral clearance but possibly at the expense of increased severity of pathology. On the contrary we found that NK cells serve a homeostatic role during influenza virus infection of vaccinated mice allowing viral clearance with minimal pathology. Using a diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model we were able to specifically deplete NKp46+ NK cells through the administration of diphtheria toxin. Using this model we assessed the effect of NK cell depletion prior to influenza challenge in vaccinated and unvaccinated mice. NK-depleted vaccinated animals lost significantly more weight after viral challenge than vaccinated NK intact animals indicating that NK cells ameliorate disease in vaccinated animals. However there was also a significant reduction in viral load in NK-depleted unvaccinated animals indicating that NK cells also constrain viral clearance. Depletion of NK cells after vaccination but 21 days before infection did not affect viral clearance or weight loss—indicating that it is the presence of NK cells during the infection itself that promotes homeostasis. Further work is needed to identify the mechanism(s) by which NK cells regulate adaptive immunity in influenza-vaccinated animals to allow efficient and effective virus control whilst simultaneously minimizing inflammation and pathology.  ,
PMC7019145,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\17_20_abstract.xml,   Lassa fever (LF) is increasingly recognised as an important rodent-borne viral haemorrhagic fever presenting a severe public health threat to sub-Saharan West Africa. In 2017–18 LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018–19. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (   R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards three-parameter logistic Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the    Rs and epidemic turning points (   τ) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's    Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between    R and state rainfall with various lag terms. Our estimated    Rs for 2017–18 (1.33 with 95% CI 1.29–1.37) was significantly higher than those for 2016–17 (1.23 with 95% CI: (1.22 1.24)) and 2018–19 (ranged from 1.08 to 1.36). We report spatial heterogeneity in the    Rs for epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We find that a one-unit (mm) increase in average monthly rainfall over the past 7 months could cause a 0.62% (95% CI 0.20%–1.05%)) rise in    R. There is significant spatial heterogeneity in the LF epidemics in different Nigerian regions. We report clear evidence of rainfall impacts on LF epidemics in Nigeria and quantify the impact.    ,
PMC7019302,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\18_24_abstract.xml,   The West Nile virus is endemic in multiple European countries and responsible for several epidemics throughout the European region. Its evolution into local or even widespread epidemics is driven by multiple factors from genetic diversification of the virus to environmental conditions. The year of 2018 was characterized by an extraordinary increase in human and animal cases in the Central-Eastern European region including Hungary. In a collaborative effort we summarized and analyzed the genetic and serologic data of WNV infections from multiple Hungarian public health institutions universities and private organizations. We compared human and veterinary serologic data along with NS5 and NS3 gene sequence data through 2018. Wild birds were excellent indicator species for WNV circulation in each year. Our efforts resulted in documenting the presence of multiple phylogenetic subclades with Balkans and Western-European progenitor sequences of WNV circulating among human and animal populations in Hungary prior to and during the 2018 epidemic. Supported by our sequence and phylogenetic data the epidemic of 2018 was not caused by recently introduced WNV strains. Unfortunately Hungary has no country-wide integrated surveillance system which would enable the analysis of related conditions and provide a comprehensive epidemiological picture. The One Health approach involving multiple institutions and experts should be implemented in order to fully understand ecological background factors driving the evolution of future epidemics.  ,
PMC7019320,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\19_25_abstract.xml,   For highly pathogenic viruses reporter assays that can be rapidly performed are critically needed to identify potentially functional mutations for further study under maximal containment (e.g. biosafety level 4 [BSL-4]). The Ebola virus nucleoprotein (NP) plays multiple essential roles during the viral life cycle yet few tools exist to study the protein under BSL-2 or equivalent containment. Therefore we adapted reporter assays to measure NP oligomerization and virion-like particle (VLP) production in live cells and further measured transcription and replication using established minigenome assays. As a proof-of-concept we examined the NP-R111C substitution which emerged during the 2013–2016 Western African Ebola virus disease epidemic and rose to high frequency. NP-R111C slightly increased NP oligomerization and VLP budding but slightly decreased transcription and replication. By contrast a synthetic charge-reversal mutant NP-R111E greatly increased oligomerization but abrogated transcription and replication. These results are intriguing in light of recent structures of NP oligomers which reveal that the neighboring residue K110 forms a salt bridge with E349 on adjacent NP molecules. By developing and utilizing multiple reporter assays we find that the NP-111 position mediates a complex interplay between NP’s roles in protein structure virion budding and transcription and replication.  ,
PMC7019359,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\20_16_abstract.xml,   Influenza C virus (ICV) is a common yet under-recognized cause of acute respiratory illness. ICV seropositivity has been found to be as high as 90% by 7–10 years of age suggesting that most people are exposed to ICV at least once during childhood. Due to difficulty detecting ICV by cell culture epidemiologic studies of ICV likely have underestimated the burden of ICV infection and disease. Recent development of highly sensitive RT-PCR has facilitated epidemiologic studies that provide further insights into the prevalence seasonality and course of ICV infection. In this review we summarize the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ICV.  ,
PMC7019415,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\21_20_abstract.xml,   The risk of emergence and/or re-emergence of arthropod-borne viral (arboviral) infections is rapidly growing worldwide particularly in Africa. The burden of arboviral infections and diseases is not well scrutinized because of the inefficient surveillance systems in endemic countries. Furthermore the health systems are fully occupied by the burden of other co-existing febrile illnesses especially malaria. In this review we summarize the epidemiology and risk factors associated with the major human arboviral diseases and highlight the gap in knowledge research and control in Sudan. Published data in English up to March 2019 were reviewed and are discussed to identify the risks and challenges for the control of arboviruses in the country. In addition the lack of suitable diagnostic tools such as viral genome sequencing and the urgent need for establishing a genomic database of the circulating viruses and potential sources of entry are discussed. Moreover the research and healthcare gaps and global health threats are analyzed and suggestions for developing strategic health policy for the prevention and control of arboviruses with focus on building the local diagnostic and research capacity and establishing an early warning surveillance system for the early detection and containment of arboviral epidemics are offered.  ,
PMC7019439,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\22_19_abstract.xml,   Influenza D virus is a novel influenza virus which was first isolated from an ailing swine in 2011 and later detected in cattle suggesting that these animals may be a primary natural reservoir. To date few studies have been performed on human samples and there is no conclusive evidence on the ability of the virus to infect humans. The aim of this serological study was to assess the prevalence of antibodies against influenza D virus in human serum samples collected in Italy from 2005 to 2017. Serum samples were analysed by haemagglutination inhibition and virus neutralization assays. The results showed that the prevalence of antibodies against the virus increased in the human population in Italy from 2005 to 2017 with a trend characterized by a sharp increase in some years followed by a decline in subsequent years. The virus showed the ability to infect and elicit an immune response in humans. However prevalence peaks in humans appear to follow epidemics in animals and not to persist in the human population.  ,
PMC7019470,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\23_16_abstract.xml,   The recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) in the Americas and its devastating developmental and neurological manifestations has prompted the development of field-based diagnostics that are rapid reliable handheld specific sensitive and inexpensive. The gold standard molecular method for lab-based diagnosis of ZIKV from either patient samples or insect vectors is reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The method however is costly and requires lab-based equipment and expertise which severely limits its use as a point-of-care (POC) tool in resource-poor settings. Moreover given the lack of antivirals or approved vaccines for ZIKV infection a POC diagnostic test is urgently needed for the early detection of new outbreaks and to adequately manage patients. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a compelling alternative to RT-qPCR for ZIKV and other arboviruses. This low-cost molecular system can be freeze-dried for distribution and exhibits high specificity sensitivity and efficiency. A growing body of evidence suggests that LAMP assays can provide greater accessibility to much-needed diagnostics for ZIKV infections especially in developing countries where the ZIKV is now endemic. This review summarizes the different LAMP methods that have been developed for the virus and summarizes their features advantages and limitations.  ,
PMC7019491,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\24_18_abstract.xml,   Virus replication displays a large cell-to-cell heterogeneity; yet not all sources of this variability are known. Here we study the effect of defective interfering (DI) particle (DIP) co-infection on cell-to-cell variability in influenza A virus (IAV) replication. DIPs contain a large internal deletion in one of their eight viral RNAs (vRNA) and are thus defective in virus replication. Moreover they interfere with virus replication. Using single-cell isolation and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction we uncovered a large between-cell heterogeneity in the DI vRNA content of infected cells which was confirmed for DI mRNAs by single-cell RNA sequencing. A high load of intracellular DI vRNAs and DI mRNAs was found in low-productive cells indicating their contribution to the large cell-to-cell variability in virus release. Furthermore we show that the magnitude of host cell mRNA expression (some factors may inhibit virus replication) but not the ribosome content may further affect the strength of single-cell virus replication. Finally we show that the load of viral mRNAs (facilitating viral protein production) and the DI mRNA content are independently from one another connected with single-cell virus production. Together these insights advance single-cell virology research toward the elucidation of the complex multi-parametric origin of the large cell-to-cell heterogeneity in virus infections.  ,
PMC7019553,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\25_18_abstract.xml,   In Hungary between February 2017 and July 2019 70 confirmed measles cases were reported raising questions about the adequacy of population-level immunity. Although the assumed vaccination coverage is ≥99% in a recent study we detected potential gaps in the anti-measles humoral immunity. In Hungary according to a decree by the Ministry of Public Welfare beginning from 2021 the healthcare provider should conduct a serosurvey of anti-measles protection levels of healthcare professionals. To facilitate the compliance with this requirement we developed a quick ‘three-in-one’ or ‘triple’ MMR (measles mumps and rubella) indirect ELISA (IgG); an assay format that is currently not available commercially. High throughput applicability of the ‘three-in-one’ ELISA was verified using 1736 sera from routine laboratory residual samples using an automated platform (Siemens BEP 2000 Advance). Assay verification was performed by comparing the full antigen repertoire-based ‘target’ assay with in-house ‘control’ assays using recombinant viral antigen coatings and by validated commercially available kits. Indirect immunofluorescence was used as an independent reference method. Data were analysed using OriginLab IBM SPSS RStudio and MedCalc. In case of measles we combined our current results with previously published data (   N   total measles = 3523). Evaluation of anti-mumps and anti-rubella humoral antibody levels was based on the measurement of 1736 samples. The lowest anti-measles seropositivity (79.3%) was detected in sera of individuals vaccinated between 1978 and 1987. Considering the antigen-specific seropositivity ratios of all samples measured anti-measles -mumps and -rubella IgG antibody titres were adequate in 89.84% 91.82% and 92.28% respectively. Based on the virus-specific herd immunity threshold (HIT) values (HIT   Measles = 92–95% HIT   Mumps = 75–86% HIT   Rubella = 83–86) it can be stated that regarding anti-measles immunity certain age clusters of the population may have inadequate levels of humoral immunity. Despite the potential gaps in herd immunity the use of MMR vaccine remains an effective and low-cost approach for the prevention of measles mumps and rubella infections.    ,
PMC7019608,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\26_21_abstract.xml,   Neurological disorders represent an important sanitary and economic threat for the equine industry worldwide. Among nervous diseases viral encephalitis is of growing concern due to the emergence of arboviruses and to the high contagiosity of herpesvirus-infected horses. The nature severity and duration of the clinical signs could be different depending on the etiological agent and its virulence. However definite diagnosis generally requires the implementation of combinations of direct and/or indirect screening assays in specialized laboratories. The equine practitioner involved in a mission of prevention and surveillance plays an important role in the clinical diagnosis of viral encephalitis. The general management of the horse is essentially supportive focused on controlling pain and inflammation within the central nervous system preventing injuries and providing supportive care. Despite its high medical relevance and economic impact in the equine industry vaccines are not always available and there is no specific antiviral therapy. In this review the major virological clinical and epidemiological features of the main neuropathogenic viruses inducing encephalitis in equids in Europe including rabies virus (   Rhabdoviridae) Equid herpesviruses (   Herpesviridae) Borna disease virus (   Bornaviridae) and West Nile virus (   Flaviviridae) as well as exotic viruses will be presented.    ,
PMC7019683,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\27_15_abstract.xml,   Influenza A virus (IAV) exploits host factors to multiply and cause disease. An in-depth knowledge of this interaction of IAV with the host will aid the development of anti-IAV intervention strategies. Previously we demonstrated that host cortactin an actin filament-binding protein promotes IAV infection but undergoes degradation via a lysosome-associated apoptotic pathway during the late stages of IAV infection. Next we wanted to further understand the mechanisms and significance of this phenomenon. By using the RNA interference screens and site-directed mutagenesis followed by western blotting we found that lysosome protease cathepsin C is involved in cortactin degradation in human cells infected with IAV. Furthermore executioner apoptotic caspase caspase-3 not caspase-6 or caspase-7 is involved in cortactin degradation during IAV infection and caspase-3 cleavage site is located in the first actin-binding repeat of cortactin polypeptide. Finally when expressed ectopically the cleavage-resistant cortactin mutants decreased the amount of IAV progeny released from infected cells that was enhanced by the cleavage-sensitive cortactin wild type. These data strengthen the hypothesis proposed earlier that host cortactin plays an inhibitory role during the late stages of IAV infection and IAV is facilitating its degradation to undermine such function.  ,
PMC7019718,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\28_18_abstract.xml,   Two distinct phenomena of airborne transmission of variola virus (smallpox) were described in the pre-eradication era—direct respiratory transmission and a unique phenomenon of transmission over greater distances referred to as “aerial convection”. We conducted an analysis of data obtained from a systematic review following the PRISMA criteria on the long-distance transmission of smallpox. Of 8179 studies screened 22 studies of 17 outbreaks were identified—12 had conclusive evidence of aerial convection and five had partially conclusive evidence. Aerial convection was first documented in 1881 in England when smallpox incidence had waned substantially following mass vaccination making unusual transmissions noticeable. National policy at the time stipulated spatial separation of smallpox hospitals from other buildings and communities. The evidence supports the transmission of smallpox through aerial convection at distances ranging from 0.5 to 1 mile and one instance of 15 km related to bioweapons testing. Other explanations are also possible such as missed chains of transmission fomites or secondary aerosolization from contaminated material such as bedding. The window of observation of aerial convection was within the 100 years prior to eradication. Aerial convection appears unique to the variola virus and is not considered in current hospital infection control protocols. Understanding potential aerial convection of variola should be an important consideration in planning for smallpox treatment facilities and protecting potential contacts and surrounding communities.  ,

However despite such efforts HIV continues to persist in populations with a global incidence rate of 1.8 million in 2017 alone. The introduction of new infections into susceptible regional populations promotes the spread of HIV indicating a crucial need to study the impact of migration and mobility on regional and global efforts to prevent HIV transmission. Here we reviewed studies that assess the impact of human mobility on HIV transmission and spread. We found an important role for both travel and migration in driving the spread of HIV across regional and national borders. Combined our results indicate that even in the presence of control and preventive efforts if migration and travel are occurring public health efforts will need to remain persistent to ensure that new infections do not grow into outbreaks.   ,
PMC7020004,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\30_16_abstract.xml,   The placenta is a unique mixed organ composed of both maternal and fetal tissues that is formed only during pregnancy and serves as the key physiological and immunological barrier preventing maternal–fetal transmission of pathogens. Several viruses can circumvent this physical barrier and enter the fetal compartment resulting in miscarriage preterm birth and birth defects including microcephaly. The mechanisms underlying viral strategies to evade the protective role of placenta are poorly understood. Here we reviewed the role of trophoblasts and Hofbauer cells in the placenta and have highlighted characteristics of vertical and perinatal infections caused by a wide range of viruses. Moreover we explored current progress and future opportunities in cellular targets pathogenesis and underlying biological mechanisms of congenital viral infections as well as novel research models and tools to study the placenta.  ,
PMC7020194,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\31_13_abstract.xml,   The tetraspanin Cluster of Differentiation 151 (CD151) is ubiquitously expressed in adult tissue especially in the lungs where it has been implicated in lung cancer asthma influenza and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). CD151 interacts with laminin-binding integrins and growth factor receptors and is reported in cancer-promoting processes such as tumor initiation metastasis and angiogenesis. In asthma CD151 was shown to promote airways hyperresponsiveness through calcium signaling whereas in influenza CD151 was shown to be a novel host factor for nuclear viral export signaling. Furthermore CD151 was shown to be associated with increased disease severity and poorer survival outcome in asthma and lung cancer respectively. In this review we provide an update on the current understanding of CD151 with regards to its contribution to lung pathophysiology. We also summarize factors that have been shown to regulate CD151 expression and identify key areas that need to be taken into consideration for its utility as a screening or prognostic tool in disease management and/or as a therapeutic target for the treatment of lung diseases.  ,
PMC7020694,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\32_14_abstract.xml,   Influenza virus is a respiratory pathogen that can cause disease in humans with symptoms ranging from mild to life-threatening. The vast majority of influenza virus infections in humans are observed during seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics. Given the substantial public health burden associated with influenza virus infection yearly vaccination is recommended for protection against seasonal influenza viruses. Despite vigilant surveillance for new variants and careful selection of seasonal vaccine strains the efficacy of seasonal vaccines can vary widely from year to year. This often results in lowered protection within the population regardless of vaccination status. In order to broaden the protection afforded by seasonal influenza vaccines the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) has deemed the development of a universal influenza virus vaccine to be a priority in influenza virus vaccine research. This universal vaccine would provide protection against all influenza virus strains eliminating the need for the yearly reformulations of seasonal influenza vaccines. In addition to universal influenza vaccine efforts substantial progress has been made in developing novel influenza virus therapeutics that utilize broadly neutralizing antibodies to provide protection against influenza virus infection and to mitigate disease outcomes during infection. In this review we discuss various approaches toward the goal of improving influenza virus vaccine efficacy through a universal influenza virus vaccine. We also address the novel methods of discovery and utilization of broadly neutralizing antibodies to improve influenza disease outcomes.  ,
PMC7021315,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\33_24_abstract.xml,      Background   Zika virus has recently spread to South- and Central America causing congenital birth defects and neurological complications. Many people at risk are flavivirus pre-immune due to prior infections with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue virus) or flavivirus vaccinations. Since pre-existing cross-reactive immunity can potentially modulate antibody responses to Zika virus infection and may affect the outcome of disease we analyzed fine-specificity as well as virus-neutralizing and infection-enhancing activities of antibodies induced by a primary Zika virus infection in flavivirus-naïve as well as yellow fever- and/or tick-borne encephalitis-vaccinated individuals.       Methodology   Antibodies in sera from convalescent Zika patients with and without vaccine-induced immunity were assessed by ELISA with respect to Zika virus-specificity and flavivirus cross-reactivity. Functional analyses included virus neutralization and infection-enhancement. The contribution of IgM and cross-reactive antibodies to these properties was determined by depletion experiments.       Principal findings   Pre-existing flavivirus immunity had a strong influence on the antibody response in primary Zika virus infections resulting in higher titers of broadly flavivirus cross-reactive antibodies and slightly lower levels of Zika virus-specific IgM. Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of Zika virus was mediated by sub-neutralizing concentrations of specific IgG but not by cross-reactive antibodies. This effect was potently counteracted by the presence of neutralizing IgM. Broadly cross-reactive antibodies were able to both neutralize and enhance infection of dengue virus but not Zika virus indicating a different exposure of conserved sequence elements in the two viruses.       Conclusions   Our data point to an important role of flavivirus-specific IgM during the transient early stages of infection by contributing substantially to neutralization and by counteracting ADE. In addition our results highlight structural differences between strains of Zika and dengue viruses that are used for analyzing infection-enhancement by cross-reactive antibodies. These findings underscore the possible impact of specific antibody patterns on flavivirus disease and vaccination efficacy.    ,
PMC7021315,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\34_25_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The explosive spread of Zika virus a flavivirus to South- and Central America underscores the potential threat of newly emerging arthropod-borne viruses. Zika virus infection can cause congenital birth defects and neurological complications. Many people at risk are flavivirus pre-immune because of prior infections with other flaviviruses (e.g. dengue virus which co-circulates in Zika outbreak regions) or vaccinations (e.g. against yellow fever or tick-borne encephalitis) and have non-protective cross-reactive antibodies at the time of infection. Since pre-existing immunity can modulate the specificity and functional activity of antibody responses and cross-reactive antibodies have been implicated in disease enhancement we compared the specificities of serum samples from flavivirus-naïve and vaccinated individuals after primary Zika virus infections. Prior immunity led to a strong booster of cross-reactive antibodies that did not neutralize Zika virus. Importantly we could also show that newly formed IgM antibodies contributed significantly to virus neutralization and prevented infection enhancement by other antibodies. Our data thus show how pre-existing cross-reactive immunities can alter the specificities and functional activities of antibody responses in flavivirus infections which may affect flavivirus-induced disease and the efficacy of vaccinations.  ,

PMC7022353,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\36_19_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  The Amazon basin is home to numerous arthropod-borne viral pathogens that cause febrile disease in humans. Among these    Oropouche orthobunyavirus (OROV) is a relatively understudied member of the genus    Orthobunyavirus family    Peribunyaviridae that causes periodic outbreaks in human populations in Brazil and other South American countries. Although several studies have described the genetic diversity of the virus the evolutionary processes that shape the OROV genome remain poorly understood. Here we present a comprehensive study of the genomic dynamics of OROV that encompasses phylogenetic analysis evolutionary rate estimates inference of natural selective pressures recombination and reassortment and structural analysis of OROV variants. Our study includes all available published sequences as well as a set of new OROV genome sequences obtained from patients in Ecuador representing the first set of genomes from this country. Our results show differing evolutionary processes on the three segments that comprise the viral genome. We infer differing times of the most recent common ancestors of the genome segments and propose that this can be explained by cryptic reassortment. We also present the discovery of previously unobserved putative N-linked glycosylation sites as well as codons that evolve under positive selection on the viral surface proteins and discuss the potential role of these features in the evolution of OROV through a combined phylogenetic and structural approach.       IMPORTANCE The emergence and reemergence of pathogens such as Zika virus chikungunya virus and yellow fever virus have drawn attention toward other cocirculating arboviruses in South America.

PMC7023813,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\37_13_abstract.xml,   Vaccination is the most effective measure at preventing influenza virus infections. However current seasonal influenza vaccines are only protective against closely matched circulating strains. Even with extensive monitoring and annual reformulation our efforts remain one step behind the rapidly evolving virus often resulting in mismatches and low vaccine effectiveness. Fortunately many next-generation influenza vaccines are currently in development utilizing an array of innovative techniques to shorten production time and increase the breadth of protection. This review summarizes the production methods of current vaccines recent advances that have been made in influenza vaccine research and highlights potential challenges that are yet to be overcome. Special emphasis is put on the potential role of glycoengineering in influenza vaccine development and the advantages of removing the glycan shield on influenza surface antigens to increase vaccine immunogenicity. The potential for future development of these novel influenza vaccine candidates is discussed from an industry perspective.  ,

PMC7029021,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\39_13_abstract.xml,   Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is an important pathogen that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children worldwide. hMPV has two major genotypes hMPV-A and hMPV-B. Epidemiological studies have shown that the two hMPV genotypes alternate in predominance worldwide in recent years. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and there is no study about the interaction between them such as competitive replication which maybe the possible mechanisms for alternating prevalence of subtypes. Our present study have used two different genotypes of hMPV (genotype A: NL/1/00; B: NL/1/99) in different proportions in animal model (BALB/c mice) and cell model (Vero-E6) separately. The result showed that the competitive growth does exist in BALB/c mice genotype B had a strong competitive advantage. However genotype B did not cause more severe disease than non-predominant (genotype A) or mixed strains in the study which were evaluated by the body weight airway hyperresponsiveness and lung pathology of mouse. In cell model competitive growth and the two genotypes alternately prevalence were observed. In summary we confirmed that there was a competitive replication between hMPV genotype A and B and no difference in disease severity caused by the two subtypes. This study shows a new insight to understand the alternation of hMPV genotype prevalence through genotype competition and provide experimental evidence for disease control and vaccine design.  ,
PMC7029599,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\40_13_abstract.xml,      Background   The influenza virus spreads rapidly around the world in seasonal epidemics resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Influenza-related incidence data are limited in many countries in Africa despite established sentinel surveillance. This study aimed to address the information gap by estimating the burden and seasonality of medically attended influenza like illness in Ethiopia.       Method   Influenza sentinel surveillance data collected from 3 influenza like illness (ILI) and 5 Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) sites from 2012 to 2017 was used for analysis. Descriptive statistics were applied for simple analysis. The proportion of medically attended influenza positive cases and incidence rate of ILI was determined using total admitted patients and catchment area population. Seasonality was estimated based on weekly trend of ILI and predicted threshold was done by applying the “Moving Epidemic Method (MEM)”.       Result   A total of 5715 medically attended influenza suspected patients who fulfills ILI and SARI case definition (77% ILI and 23% SARI) was enrolled. Laboratory confirmed influenza virus (influenza positive case) among ILI and SARI suspected case was 25% (1130/4426) and 3% (36/1289). Of which 65% were influenza type A. The predominantly circulating influenza subtype were seasonal influenza A(H3N2) (    n = 455 60%) and Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (    n = 293 38.81%). The estimated mean annual influenza positive case proportion and ILI incidence rate was 160.04 and 52.48 per 100000 population. The Incidence rate of ILI was higher in the age group of 15–44 years of age [‘Incidence rate (R) = 254.6 per 100000 population’ 95% CI; 173.65 335.55] and 5–14 years of age [R = 49.5 CI 95%; 31.47 130.43]. The seasonality of influenza has two peak seasons; in a period from October–December and from April–June.          Conclusion   Significant morbidity of influenza like illness was observed with two peak seasons of the year and seasonal influenza A (H3N2) remains the predominantly circulating influenza subtype. Further study need to be considered to identify potential risks and improving the surveillance system to continue early detection and monitoring of circulating influenza virus in the country has paramount importance.    ,
PMC7031255,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\41_18_abstract.xml,   Rift Valley fever (RVF) is an acute febrile zoonotic disease that is caused by the RVF virus (RVFV) and is spread by arthropod vectors. Virus-like particle (VLP) vaccines which have the advantages of strong immunogenicity and safety play an important role in the prevention of this disease. VLPs for RVFV were successfully prepared by our research group using a baculovirus-insect cell expression system. To study the immunogenicity of these RVFV VLPs a correct 3rd or 4th generation recombinant baculovirus rBac-N-G was identified and used to infect Sf9 cells which were cultured in suspension at a large scale. Subsequently cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the VLPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation and purified using a sucrose gradient after which they were used to immunize BALB/c mice by intramuscular injection. The results showed that the RVFV VLPs prepared by our research group could effectively induce mice to produce RVFV neutralizing antibodies and that the prepared VLPs could stimulate mouse spleen cells to produce high levels of the cytokines IL-4 and IFN-γ. Moreover the proportion of lymphocytes producing IL-4 and IFN-γ in the spleen of mice immunized with RVFV VLPs was significantly increased. Therefore the RVFV VLPs prepared in this study had strong immunogenicity and could effectively activate humoral and cellular immunity in mice. This study lays a solid foundation for the development of RVFV VLP vaccine candidates and promotes the healthy development of animal husbandry and human public health.  ,
PMC7031735,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\42_17_abstract.xml,   The detrimental impact of air pollution as a result of frequent exposure to fine particles posed a global public health risk mainly to the pulmonary disorders in pediatric and geriatric population. Here we reviewed the current literature regarding the role of ginseng and/or its components as antimicrobials especially against pathogens that cause respiratory infections in animal and    in vitro models. Some of the possible mechanisms for ginseng-mediated viral inhibition suggested are improvements in systemic and mucosa-specific antibody responses serum hemagglutinin inhibition lymphocyte proliferation cell survival rate and viral clearance in the lungs. In addition ginseng reduces the expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ TNF-α IL-2 IL-4 IL-5 IL-6 IL-8) and chemokines produced by airway epithelial cells and macrophages thus preventing weight loss. In case of bacterial infections ginseng acts by alleviating inflammatory cytokine production increasing survival rates and activating phagocytes and natural killer cells. In addition ginseng inhibits biofilm formation and induces the dispersion and dissolution of mature biofilms. Most clinical trials revealed that ginseng at various dosages is a safe and effective method of seasonal prophylaxis relieving the symptoms and reducing the risk and duration of colds and flu. Taken together these findings support the efficacy of ginseng as a therapeutic and prophylactic agent for respiratory infections.    ,
PMC7031975,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\43_13_abstract.xml,      Background   In recent years Ecuador and other South American countries have experienced an increase in arboviral diseases. A rise in dengue infections was followed by introductions of chikungunya and Zika two viruses never before seen in many of these areas. Furthermore the latest socioeconomic and political instability in Venezuela and the mass migration of its population into the neighboring countries has given rise to concerns of infectious disease spillover and escalation of arboviral spread in the region.       Results   We performed phylogeographic analyses of dengue (DENV) and chikungunya (CHIKV) virus genomes sampled from a surveillance site in Ecuador in 2014–2015 along with genomes from the surrounding countries. Our results revealed at least two introductions of DENV in 2011 and late 2013 that initially originated from Venezuela and/or Colombia. The introductions were subsequent to increases in the influx of Venezuelan and Colombian citizens into Ecuador which in 2013 were 343% and 214% higher than in 2009 respectively. However we show that Venezuela has historically been an important source of DENV dispersal in this region even before the massive exodus of its population suggesting already established paths of viral distribution. Like DENV CHIKV was introduced into Ecuador at multiple time points in 2013–2014 but unlike DENV these introductions were associated with the Caribbean. Our findings indicated no direct CHIKV connection between Ecuador Colombia and Venezuela as of 2015 suggesting that CHIKV was at this point not following the paths of DENV spread.       Conclusion   Our results reveal that Ecuador is vulnerable to arbovirus import from many geographic locations emphasizing the need of continued surveillance and more diversified prevention strategies. Importantly increase in human movement along established paths of viral dissemination combined with regional outbreaks and epidemics may facilitate viral spread and lead to novel virus introductions. Thus strengthening infectious disease surveillance and control along migration routes and improving access to healthcare for the vulnerable populations is of utmost importance.    ,
PMC7031979,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\44_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Yellow fever (YF) is a severe infectious but non-communicable arboviral hemorrhagic disease. In the last decades yellow fever virus (YFV) infections have been prevalent in endemic areas in Brazil affecting human and non-human primate (NHP) populations. Monitoring of NHP infection started in 1999 and reports of epizootic diseases are considered important indicators of viral transmission particularly in relation to the sylvatic cycle. This study presents the monitoring of YFV by real-time RT-PCR and the epidemiological findings related to the deaths of NHPs in the south-eastern states and in the north-eastern state of Bahia during the outbreak of YF in Brazil during 2017 and 2018.       Methods   A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and north-eastern Brazilian states were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR).       Results   A total of 4198 samples from 2099 NHPs from south-eastern and north-eastern Brazilian states were collected between 2017 and 2018. The samples were subjected to molecular diagnostics for YFV detection using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rtRT-PCR) techniques. Epizootics were coincident with human YF cases. Furthermore our results showed that the YF frequency was higher among marmosets (    Callithrix sp.) than in previous reports. Viremia in species of the genus     Alouatta and     Callithrix differed greatly.          Discussion   Our results indicate a need for further investigation of the role of     Callithrix spp. in the transmission cycles of YFV in Brazil. In particular YFV transmission was observed in a region where viral circulation has not been recorded for decades and thus vaccination has not been previously recommended.          Conclusions   This highlights the need to straighten epizootic surveillance and evaluate the extent of vaccination programmes in Brazil in previously considered “YFV-free” areas of the country.    ,
PMC7032730,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\45_20_abstract.xml,   Influenza A viruses cause seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics in the human population. While the worldwide circulation of seasonal influenza is at least partly understood the exact migration patterns between countries states or cities are not well studied. Here we use the Sankoff algorithm for parsimonious phylogeographic reconstruction together with effective distances based on a worldwide air transportation network. By first simulating geographic spread and then phylogenetic trees and genetic sequences we confirmed that reconstructions with effective distances inferred phylogeographic spread more accurately than reconstructions with geographic distances and Bayesian reconstructions with BEAST that do not use any distance information and led to comparable results to the Bayesian reconstruction using distance information via a generalized linear model. Our method extends Bayesian methods that estimate rates from the data by using fine-grained locations like airports and inferring intermediate locations not observed among sampled isolates. When applied to sequence data of the pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus in 2009 our approach correctly inferred the origin and proposed airports mainly involved in the spread of the virus. In case of a novel outbreak this approach allows to rapidly analyze sequence data and infer origin and spread routes to improve disease surveillance and control.  ,
PMC7032730,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\46_21_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Influenza A viruses infect up to 5 million people in recurring epidemics every year. Further viruses of zoonotic origin constantly pose a pandemic risk. Understanding the geographical spread of these viruses including the origin and the main spread routes between cities states or countries could help to monitor or contain novel outbreaks. Based on genetic sequences and sampling locations the geographic spread can be reconstructed along a phylogenetic tree. Our approach uses a parsimonious reconstruction with air transportation data and was verified using a simulation of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic. Applied to real sequence data of the outbreak our analysis gave detailed insights into spread patterns of influenza A viruses highlighting the origin as well as airports mainly involved in the spread.  ,

PMC7033529,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\48_17_abstract.xml,   Sensitive accurate and cost-effective diagnostic tests are urgently needed to detect Zika virus (ZIKV) infection. Nonstructural 1 (NS1) glycoprotein is an excellent diagnostic marker since it is released in a hexameric conformation from infected cells into the patient's bloodstream early in the course of the infection. We established a stable rZNS1-His-expression system in HEK293 cells through lentiviral transduction. A novel optimization approach to enhance rZNS1-His protein secretion in the mammalian expression system was accomplished through 50 nM rapamycin incubation followed by serum-free media incubation for 9 days reaching protein yields of ∼10 mg/l of culture medium. Purified rZNS1-His hexamer was recognized by anti-NS1 antibodies in ZIKV patient's serum and showed the ability to induce a humoral response in immunized mice. The obtained recombinant protein is a reliable biological tool that can potentially be applied in the development of diagnostic tests to detect ZIKV in infected patients during the acute phase.  ,
PMC7034435,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\49_17_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Since its first report in 1942 peste-des-petits-ruminants virus (PPRV) has caused several epidemics in a wide range of susceptible hosts around the world. In the last 30 years the evidence of natural and experimental infections and virus isolation were reported from novel but unusual hosts such as camel cattle buffalo dogs Asiatic lion and pigs. In addition PPRV in a potential vector biting midges (   Culicoides imicola) has been reported. Either presented as clinical and/or subclinical infections the presence of the virus in an extended range of susceptible hosts highlights the cross-species transmission and supports the hypothesis of an endemic circulation of PPRV among susceptible hosts. However the potential role of large ruminants camels and unusual hosts for PPRV epidemiology is still obscure. Therefore there is a need for molecular and epidemiological investigations of the disease among usual and unusual hosts to achieve the goals of disease control and eradication programmes initiated by national and international organisations such as the FAO and OIE. This review is the first to summarise the scattered data on PPR in large ruminants camels and unusual hosts to obtain the global scientific communities’ attention for further research on epidemiological aspects not only in its native hosts but also in large ruminants camels and other unusual hosts.    ,
PMC7036483,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\50_13_abstract.xml,   Influenza continues to cause severe illness in millions and deaths in hundreds of thousands annually. Vaccines are used to prevent influenza outbreaks however the influenza virus mutates and annual vaccination is required for optimal protection. Vaccine effectiveness is also affected by other potential factors such as the human immune system a mismatch with the chosen candidate virus and egg adaptation associated with egg-based vaccine production. This article reviews the influenza vaccine development process and describes the implications of the changes to the cell-culture process and vaccine strain recommendations by the World Health Organization since the 2017 season. The traditional manufacturing process for influenza vaccines relies on fertilized chicken eggs that are used for vaccine production. Vaccines must be produced in large volumes and the complete process requires approximately 6 months for the egg-based process. In addition egg adaptation of seed viruses occurs when viruses adapt to avian receptors found within eggs to allow for growth in eggs. These changes to key viral antigens may result in antigenic mismatch and thereby reduce vaccine effectiveness. By contrast cell-derived seed viruses do not require fertilized eggs and eliminate the potential for egg-adapted changes. As a result cell-culture technology improves the match between the vaccine virus strain and the vaccine selected strain and has been associated with increased vaccine effectiveness during a predominantly H3N2 season. During the 2017–2018 influenza season a small number of studies conducted in the United States compared the effectiveness of egg-based and cell-culture vaccines and are described here. These observational and retrospective studies demonstrate that inactivated cell-culture vaccines were more effective than egg-based vaccines. Adoption of cell-culture technology for influenza vaccine manufacturing has been reported to improve manufacturing efficiency and the additional benefit of improving vaccine effectiveness is a key factor for future policy making considerations.  ,
PMC7036648,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\51_18_abstract.xml,   Abstract  In 1984 a large prospective study of the natural history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) was established; 10 years later the Women’s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS) was launched. Motivated by the merger and redesign of these long-standing HIV cohort studies in 2019 we review ways in which HIV epidemiology in the United States has transformed over the lives of these studies and how this evolution has influenced planning for enrollment and follow-up. We highlight changes that have occurred in the 3 major domains that are central to epidemiologic science: changes to key populations at highest risk for HIV refinements in measurement and shifts in the outcomes of interest and a new era in the tools and approaches that epidemiologists use to synthesize evidence from measurements made on populations. By embracing foundational principles with modern methods the epidemiologic approach of analyzing the causes and distributions of diseases in contemporaneous populations will continue to advance HIV science over the next decade.  ,
PMC7040968,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\52_24_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   Cell‐based influenza vaccines can solve the problem of the frequent occurrence of egg adaptation–associated antigenic changes observed in egg‐based vaccines. Seed viruses for cell‐based vaccines can be prepared from clinical specimens by cell culture; however clinical samples risk harboring respiratory viruses other than influenza virus. Therefore it is necessary to investigate the patterns of co‐infection in clinical samples and explore whether cell culture technology can selectively propagate influenza viruses from samples containing other respiratory viruses.       Methods   A total of 341 clinical specimens were collected from patients with influenza or influenza‐like illness and analyzed by ResPlex II assay to detect 18 respiratory viruses. The patterns of co‐infection were statistically analyzed with Fisher's exact test. The samples with double or triple infections were passaged in suspension MDCK cells (MDCK‐S) adherent MDCK cells (MDCK‐A) and LLC‐MK2D cells. Cell‐passaged samples were analyzed by ResPlex II assay again to investigate whether each cell line could amplify influenza viruses and eliminate other respiratory viruses.       Results   Double infections were detected in 8.5% and triple infections in 0.9% of the collected clinical specimens. We identified four pairs of viruses with significant correlation. For all samples with double and triple infection MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A could selectively propagate influenza viruses while eliminating all contaminating viruses. In contrast LLC‐MK2D showed lower isolation efficiency for influenza virus and higher isolation efficiency for coxsackievirus/echovirus than MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A.       Conclusions   Both MDCK‐S and MDCK‐A are considered suitable for the preparation of influenza vaccine seed viruses without adventitious agents or egg‐adaptation mutations.    ,
PMC7040971,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\53_22_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   The International Health Regulations state that early detection and immediate reporting of unusual health events is important for early warning and response systems.       Objective   To describe a pilot surveillance program established in health facilities in Yaoundé Cameroon in 2017 which aimed to enable detection and reporting of public health events.       Methods   Cameroon’s Ministry of Health in partnership with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Cameroon Pasteur Center and National Public Health Laboratory implemented event‐based surveillance (EBS) in nine Yaoundé health facilities. Four signals were defined that could indicate possible public health events and a reporting triage and verification system was established among partner organizations. A pre‐defined laboratory algorithm was defined and a series of workshops trained health facilities laboratory and public health staff for surveillance implementation.       Results   From May 2017 to January 2018 30 signals were detected corresponding to 15 unusual respiratory events. All health facilities reported a signal at least once and more than three‐quarters of health facilities reported ≥2 times. Among specimens tested the pathogens detected included     Klebsiella pneumoniae     Moraxella catarrhalis     Streptococcus pneumoniae     Haemophilus influenza     Staphylococcus aureus     Pneumocystis jiroveci influenza A (H1N1) virus rhinovirus and adenovirus.          Conclusions   The events detected in this pilot were caused by routine respiratory bacteria and viruses and no novel influenza viruses or other emerging respiratory threats were identified. The surveillance system however strengthened relationships and communication linkages between health facilities and public health authorities. Astute clinicians can play a critical role in early detection and EBS is one approach that may enable reporting of emerging outbreaks and public health events.    ,
PMC7041325,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\54_17_abstract.xml,          Introduction:    Two species of    Aedes (Ae.) mosquitoes (   Ae. aegypti and    Ae. albopictus) are primary vectors for emerging arboviruses that are a significant threat to public health and economic burden worldwide. Distribution of these vectors and the associated arboviruses such as dengue virus chikungunya virus yellow fever virus and Zika virus was for a long time restricted by geographical ecological and biological factors. Presently arbovirus emergence and dispersion are more rapid and geographically widespread largely due to expansion of the range for these two mosquitoes that have exploited the global transportation network land perturbation and failure to contain the mosquito population coupled with enhanced vector competence.    Ae. aegypti and    Ae. albopictus may also sustain transmission between humans without having to depend on their natural reservoir forest cycles due to arthropod adaptation to urbanization. Currently there is no single strategy that is adequate to control these vectors especially when managing arbovirus outbreaks.           Objective:    This review aimed at presenting the characteristics and abilities of    Ae. aegypti and    Ae. albopictus which can drive a global public health risk and suggests strategies for prevention and control.           Methods:    This review presents the geographic range reproduction and ecology vector competence genetic evolution and biological and chemical control of these two mosquito species and how they have changed and developed over time combined with factors that may drive pandemics and mitigation measures.           Conclusion:    We suggest that more efforts should be geared toward the development of a concerted multidisciplinary approach.    ,
PMC7043782,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\55_28_abstract.xml,      Aims   To investigate seasonality and association of increased enterovirus and influenza activity in the community with ventricular fibrillation (VF) risk during first ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).       Methods   This study comprised all consecutive patients with first STEMI (n = 4659; aged 18–80 years) admitted to the invasive catheterization laboratory between 2010–2016 at Copenhagen University Hospital Rigshospitalet covering eastern Denmark (2.6 million inhabitants 45% of the Danish population). Hospital admission prescription and vital status data were assessed using Danish nationwide registries. We utilized monthly/weekly surveillance data for enterovirus and influenza from the Danish National Microbiology Database (2010–2016) that receives copies of laboratory tests from all Danish departments of clinical microbiology.       Results   Of the 4659 consecutively enrolled STEMI patients 581 (12%) had VF before primary percutaneous coronary intervention. In a subset (n = 807) we found that VF patients experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with the patients without VF (OR 3.39 95% CI 1.76–6.54). During the study period 2704 individuals were diagnosed with enterovirus and 19742 with influenza. No significant association between enterovirus and VF (OR 1.00 95% CI 0.99–1.02) influenza and VF (OR 1.00 95% CI 1.00–1.00) or week number and VF (p-value 0.94 for enterovirus and 0.89 for influenza) was found.       Conclusion   We found no clear seasonality of VF during first STEMI. Even though VF patients had experienced more generalized fatigue and flu-like symptoms within 7 days before STEMI compared with patients without VF no relationship was found between enterovirus or influenza exposure and occurrence of VF.    ,
PMC7044130,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\56_16_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) infection causes severe neurological symptoms in adults and fetal microcephaly and the virus is detected in the brain of microcephaly and meningoencephalitis patient. However the mechanism of ZIKV crossing the physiological barrier to the central nervous systems (CNS) remains elusive. The placental barrier and the blood brain barrier (BBB) protect the fetus from pathogens and ensure healthy brain development during pregnancy. In this study we used human placenta trophoblasts cells (JEG-3) and human brain-derived endothelial cells (hCMEC/D3) as    in vitro models of the physiological barriers. Results showed that ZIKV could infect JEG-3 cells effectively and reduce the amounts of ZO-1 and occludin between adjacent cells by the proteasomal degradation pathway suggesting that the permeability of the barrier differentially changed in response to ZIKV infection allowing the virus particle to cross the host barrier. In contrast ZIKV could infect hCMEC/D3 cells without disrupting the BBB barrier permeability and tight junction protein expression. Although no disruption to the BBB was observed during ZIKV infection ZIKV particles were released on the basal side of the BBB model and infected underlying cells. In addition we observed that fluorescence-labeled ZIKV particles could cross the    in vitro placenta barrier and BBB model by transcytosis and the action of transcytosis could be blocked by either low temperature or pharmacological inhibitors of endocytosis. In summary the ZIKV uses a cell-type specific paracellular pathway to cross the placenta monolayer barrier by disrupting cellular tight junction. In addition the ZIKV can also cross both the placenta barrier and the BBB by transcytosis. Our study provided new insights into on the mechanism of the cellular barrier penetration of ZIKV particles.    ,
PMC7044301,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\57_13_abstract.xml,   Nigeria has the highest number of AIDS-related deaths in the world. In this study we characterised the HIV-1 molecular epidemiology by analysing 1442 HIV-1    pol sequences collected 1999–2014 from four geopolitical zones in Nigeria using state-of-the-art maximum-likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses. The main circulating forms were the circulating recombinant form (CRF) 02_AG (44% of the analysed sequences) CRF43_02G (16%) and subtype G (8%). Twenty-three percent of the sequences represented unique recombinant forms (URFs) whereof 37 (11%) could be grouped into seven potentially novel CRFs. Bayesian phylodynamic analysis suggested that five major Nigerian HIV-1 sub-epidemics were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s close to the Nigerian Civil War. The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos before migrating towards smaller rural areas. This study provides novel insight into the Nigerian HIV-1 epidemic and may have implications for future HIV-1 prevention strategies in Nigeria and other severely affected countries.    ,
PMC7044319,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\58_13_abstract.xml,   A critical global health need exists for a Zika vaccine capable of mitigating the effects of future Zika epidemics. In this study we evaluated the antibody responses and efficacy of an aluminum hydroxide adjuvanted purified inactivated Zika vaccine (PIZV) against challenge with Zika virus (ZIKV) strain PRVABC59. Indian rhesus macaques received two doses of PIZV at varying concentrations ranging from 0.016 µg − 10 µg and were subsequently challenged with ZIKV six weeks or one year following the second immunization. PIZV induced a dose-dependent immune response that was boosted by a second immunization. Complete protection against ZIKV infection was achieved with the higher PIZV doses of 0.4 µg 2 µg and 10 µg at 6 weeks and  with 10 ug PIZV at  1 year following vaccination. Partial protection was achieved with the lower PIZV doses of 0.016 µg and 0.08 µg. Based on these data a neutralizing antibody response above 3.02 log   10 EC50 was determined as a correlate of protection in macaques. PIZV elicited a dose-dependent neutralizing antibody response which is protective for at least 1 year following vaccination.    ,

PMC7045083,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\60_18_abstract.xml,      Background   Nasopharyngeal colonisation by     S. pneumoniae is a prerequisite for invasive pneumococcal infections. Influenza co-infection leads to increased susceptibility to secondary pneumonia and mortality during influenza epidemics. Increased bacterial load and impaired immune responses to pneumococcus caused by influenza play a role in this increased susceptibility. Using an Experimental Human Challenge Model and influenza vaccines we examined symptoms experienced by healthy adults during nasal co-infection with     S. pneumoniae and live attenuated influenza virus.          Methods   Randomised blinded administration of Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) or Tetravalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (TIV) either preceded bacterial inoculation or followed it separated by a 3-day interval. The presence and density of     S. pneumoniae was determined from nasal washes. Participants completed a symptom questionnaire from the first intervention until 6 days post second intervention.          Results   The timing and type of influenza vaccination and presence of     S. pneumoniae in the nasopharynx significantly affected symptom reporting. In the study     where influenza vaccination     preceded bacterial inoculation: nasal symptoms were less common in the LAIV group than the TIV group (OR 0.57 p &lt; 0.01); with colonisation status only affecting the TIV group where more symptoms were reported by colonised participants compared to non-colonised participants following inoculation (n = 12/23 [52.17%] vs n = 13/38 [34.21%] respectively; p &lt; 0.05). In the study     where influenza vaccination     followed bacterial inoculation: no difference was seen in the symptoms reported between the LAIV and TIV groups following inoculation and subsequent vaccination; and symptoms were unaffected by colonisation status.          Conclusion   Symptoms experienced during live viral vaccination and bacterial co-infection in the nasopharynx are directly affected by the precedence of the pathogen acquisition. Symptoms were directly affected by nasal pneumococcal colonisation but only when TIV was given prior to bacterial exposure.    ,
PMC7045448,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\61_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Mosquito-borne viral infections have in recent years become a public health threat globally. This review aimed to provide an overview of the ecological and epidemiological profiles of mosquito-borne viral infections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).       Methods   A search of literature was conducted using Google Scholar PubMed and the WHO website using the following keywords: “Democratic Republic of the Congo” “Zaire” “Belgian Congo” and either of the following: “mosquito-borne virus” “arbovirus” “yellow fever” “dengue” “chikungunya” “West Nile” “Rift Valley fever” “O’nyong’nyong” “Zika” “epidemiology” “ecology” “morbidity” “mortality”. Published articles in English or French covering a period between 1912 and October 2018 were reviewed.       Results   A total of 37 articles were included in the review. The findings indicate that the burden of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC is increasing over time and space. The north-western north-eastern western and central regions have the highest burden of mosquito-borne viral infections compared to south and eastern highland regions. Yellow fever chikungunya dengue Zika Rift Valley fever West Nile and O’nyong’nyong have been reported in the country. These mosquito-borne viruses were found circulating in human wildlife and domestic animals. Yellow fever and chikungunya outbreaks have been frequently reported.     Aedes aegypti and     Ae. simpsoni were documented as the main vectors of most of the mosquito-borne viral infections. Heavy rains human movements forest encroachment and deforestation were identified as drivers of mosquito-borne viruses occurrence in DRC.          Conclusions   Mosquito-borne viral infections are becoming common and a serious public health problem in DRC. In the current context of climate change there is urgent need to improve understanding on ecological and epidemiology of the diseases and strengthen surveillance systems for prompt response to epidemics in DRC.    ,

During October 2016–September 2018 a total of 556 norovirus outbreaks were reported and positive fecal samples from 470 (84.5%) outbreaks were genotyped. Most of these outbreaks were associated with person-to-person transmission (95.1%) occurred in childcare centers or schools (78.2%) and were reported during November–March of each year (63.5%). During the 2-year study period 81.2% of all norovirus outbreaks were typed as GII.2[P16]. In China most norovirus outbreaks are reported by childcare centers or schools; GII.2[P16] is the predominant genotype. Ongoing surveillance by CaliciNet China will provide information about the evolving norovirus genotype distribution and outbreak characteristics important for the development of effective interventions including vaccines.  ,
PMC7046297,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\63_21_abstract.xml,   Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe acute respiratory illness with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 355%. The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012–2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear BL; Non-monotone NM; and Saturated SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015–2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (   R       0   ) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature indicating a high epidemic risk (1≤   R       0   ≤25) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible. These results indicate public health agencies should be aware that measures for strict containment are urgently needed before new epidemics take off in the region.    ,
PMC7046297,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\64_22_abstract.xml,   Author summary  There is currently no way to anticipate MERS-CoV epidemic outbreaks and strategies for disease prediction and containment are largely undermined by the limited knowledge of its epidemiological cycle. Not an effective treatment nor a vaccine for MERS-CoV exist to date. Instead using three two-strain mathematical models that incorporate human social behavior as different disease incidence functions (e.g. bilinear non-monotone and saturated) the best model combinations successfully anticipate the occurrence of the peak week in the season and the incidence at the peak. Our results confirm there are currently 2 strains co-circulating in the most populated regions in Saudi Arabia and highlight the high risk for large epidemic outbreaks while the role of super-spreaders appears irrelevant for disease spread.  ,
PMC7046835,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\65_16_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne alphavirus that causes hallmark debilitating polyarthralgia fever and rash in patients. T cell-mediated immunity especially CD4   + T cells are known to participate in the pathogenic role of CHIKV immunopathology. The other T cell subsets notably CD8   + NKT and gamma-delta (γδ) T cells can also contribute to protective immunity but their effect is not actuated during the natural course of infection. This review serves to consolidate and discuss the multifaceted roles of these T cell subsets during acute and chronic phases of CHIKV infection and highlight gaps in the current literature. Importantly the unique characteristics of skin-resident memory T cells are outlined to propose novel prophylactic strategies that utilize their properties to provide adequate lasting protection.    ,

The probability of remaining positive for Ebola RNA in semen was estimated at 93.02% and 60.12% after 3 and 6 months. Viral RNA in semen was more frequent in patients with eye pain (    P = .036) joint pain (    P = .047) and higher antibody levels to Ebola virus antigens (nucleoprotein [    P = .001] glycoprotein [    P = .05] and viral protein-40 [    P = .05]). Ebola RNA was only rarely detected in the following body fluids from EVD survivors: saliva (1 of 454) urine (2 of 593) breast milk (2 of 168) cervicovaginal secretions (0 of 273) and feces (0 of 330). Ribonucleic acid was detected in breast milk 1 month after delivery but 500 days after discharge of Ebola treatment unit (ETU) in 1 woman who became pregnant 7 months after discharge from the ETU.          Conclusions   The frequency and potential long-term presence of viral RNA in semen confirmed that systematic prevention measures in male survivors are required.

PMC7048310,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\69_22_abstract.xml,   Influenza A/H3N2 is a rapidly evolving virus which experiences major antigenic transitions every two to eight years. Anticipating the timing and outcome of transitions is critical to developing effective seasonal influenza vaccines. Using a published phylodynamic model of influenza transmission we identified indicators of future evolutionary success for an emerging antigenic cluster and quantified fundamental trade-offs in our ability to make such predictions. The eventual fate of a new cluster depends on its initial epidemiological growth rate––which is a function of mutational load and population susceptibility to the cluster––along with the variance in growth rate across co-circulating viruses. Logistic regression can predict whether a cluster at 5% relative frequency will eventually succeed with ~80% sensitivity providing up to eight months advance warning. As a cluster expands the predictions improve while the lead-time for vaccine development and other interventions decreases. However attempts to make comparable predictions from 12 years of    empirical influenza surveillance data which are far sparser and more coarse-grained achieve only 56% sensitivity. By expanding influenza surveillance to obtain more granular estimates of the frequencies of and population-wide susceptibility to emerging viruses we can better anticipate major antigenic transitions. This provides added incentives for accelerating the vaccine production cycle to reduce the lead time required for strain selection.    ,
PMC7048310,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\70_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The efficacy of annual seasonal influenza vaccines depends on selecting the strain that best matches circulating viruses. This selection takes place 9–12 months prior to the influenza season. To advise this decision we used an influenza A/H3N2 phylodynamic simulation to explore how reliably and how far in advance can we identify strains that will dominate future influenza seasons? What data should we collect to accelerate and improve the accuracy of such forecasts? And importantly what is the gap between the theoretical limit of prediction and prediction based on current influenza surveillance? Our results suggest that even with detailed virological information the tight race between the antigenic turnover dynamics and the vaccine development timeline limits early detection of emerging viruses. Predictions based on current influenza surveillance do not achieve the theoretical limit and thus our results provide impetus for denser sampling and the development of rapid methods for estimating viral fitness.  ,
PMC7048371,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\71_14_abstract.xml,          Influenza virus circulates in human avian and swine hosts causing seasonal epidemic and occasional pandemic outbreaks. Influenza neuraminidase a viral surface glycoprotein has two sialic acid binding sites. The catalytic (primary) site which also binds inhibitors such as oseltamivir carboxylate is responsible for cleaving the sialic acid linkages that bind viral progeny to the host cell. In contrast the functional annotation of the secondary site remains unclear. Here we better characterize these two sites through the development of an all-atom explicitly solvated and experimentally based integrative model of the pandemic influenza A H1N1 2009 viral envelope containing ∼160 million atoms and spanning ∼115 nm in diameter. Molecular dynamics simulations of this crowded subcellular environment coupled with Markov state model theory provide a novel framework for studying realistic molecular systems at the mesoscale and allow us to quantify the kinetics of the neuraminidase 150-loop transition between the open and closed states. An analysis of chloride ion occupancy along the neuraminidase surface implies a potential new role for the neuraminidase secondary site wherein the terminal sialic acid residues of the linkages may bind before transfer to the primary site where enzymatic cleavage occurs. Altogether our work breaks new ground for molecular simulation in terms of size complexity and methodological analyses of the components. It also provides fundamental insights into the understanding of substrate recognition processes for this vital influenza drug target suggesting a new strategy for the development of anti-influenza therapeutics.  ,

PMC7049568,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\73_22_abstract.xml,   Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I) is a cytosolic pathogen sensor that is crucial against a number of viral infections. Many viruses have evolved to inhibit pathogen sensors to suppress host innate immune responses. In the case of influenza nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) suppresses RIG-I function leading to viral replication morbidity and mortality. We show that silencing NS1 with    in-vitro-transcribed 5′-triphosphate containing NS1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (5′-PPP-NS1shRNA) designed using the conserved region of a number of influenza viruses not only prevented NS1 expression but also induced RIG-I activation and type I interferon (IFN) expression resulting in an antiviral state leading to inhibition of influenza virus replication    in vitro. In addition administration of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA in prophylactic and therapeutic settings resulted in significant inhibition of viral replication following viral challenge    in vivo in mice with corresponding increases of RIG-I IFN-β and IFN-λ as well as a decrease in NS1 expression.    ,

PMC7052239,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\75_13_abstract.xml,   Vertical transmission in    Aedes aegypti and    Aedes albopictus is considered a maintenance mechanism for dengue virus (DENV) during unfavorable conditions and may be implicated in dengue outbreaks. Since DENV infection dynamics vary among wild-type viruses and vector populations vertical transmission rates can also vary between regions. However even though São Paulo is the most populous city in the Americas and has experienced major dengue epidemics natural vertical transmission had never been detected in this area before. Here we confirm and describe for the first time natural vertical transmission of DENV-3 in two pools of male    Ae. albopictus from the city of São Paulo. The detection of DENV-3 in years when no human autochthonous cases of this serotype were recorded suggests that silent circulation of DENV-3 is occurring and indicates that green areas may be maintaining serotypes that are not circulating in the human population possibly by a vertical transmission mechanism.    ,
PMC7052542,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\76_22_abstract.xml,   Abstract     Background   Since their emergence in Indonesia in 2005 200 human infections with clade 2.1 highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 virus have been reported associated with exceptionally high mortality (84%) compared to regions affected by other genetic clades of this virus. To provide potential clues towards understanding this high mortality detailed clinical virological analyses were performed in specimens from 180 H5N1 patients representing 90% of all Indonesian patients and 20% of reported H5N1-infected patients globally.       Methods   H5N1 RNA was quantified in available upper- and lower-respiratory tract specimens as well as fecal and blood samples from 180 patients with confirmed infection between 2005 and 2017. Mutations in the neuraminidase and M2 genes that confer resistance to oseltamivir and adamantanes were assessed. Fatal and nonfatal cases were compared.       Results   High viral RNA loads in nasal and pharyngeal specimens were associated with fatal outcome. Mortality increased over time during the study period which correlated with increasing viral RNA loads on admission. Furthermore the prevalence of amantadine resistance–conferring M2 mutations increased over time and viral loads were higher in patients infected with viruses that harbored these mutations. Compared to observations from other regions viral RNA was detected more frequently in feces (80%) and particularly in blood (85%) and antiviral responses to oseltamivir appeared less pronounced.       Conclusions   These observations confirm the association of viral load with outcome of human H5N1 infections and suggest potential differences in virulence and antiviral responses to oseltamivir that may explain the exceptionally high mortality related to clade 2.1 H5N1 infections in Indonesia.    ,

PMC7053713,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\78_22_abstract.xml,   Dengue fever a mosquito-borne viral disease in humans has been endemic in many Southeast Asian countries. Since its first outbreak in 1978 in Foshan Guangdong province China dengue has been continually epidemic in recent years in Guangdong which raised the concern whether dengue infection is endemic in Guangdong. In this study we performed phylogenetic recombinant and nucleotide variation analyses of 114 complete genome sequences of dengue virus serotypes 1–4 (DENV1-4) collected from 2013 to 2017 in 18 of 21 cities of Guangdong. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that DENV sequences did not form a single cluster indicating that dengue fever was not endemic in Guangdong although DENV1-4 co-circulated in Guangdong. Twenty intra-serotype recombinant isolates involving DENV1-4 were detected but no inter-serotype recombinant events were identified in this study. Additionally the most recombinant events were detected simultaneously in the gene    NS3 of DENV1-4. Nucleotide variation analyses showed that no significant intra-serotype differences were observed whereas more significant inter-subtype differences were discovered in non-structural genes than in structural genes. Our investigation will facilitate the understanding of the current prevalent status of dengue fever in Guangdong and contribute to designing more effective preventive and control strategies for dengue infection.    ,
PMC7053713,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\79_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary  In 1978 dengue fever was first reported in Guangdong province China and this has been continuously prevalent in Guangdong in recent years. This is responsible for the heavy burden on the control of dengue and raises the concern about whether dengue outbreaks have become endemic in Guangdong. Previous studies based on single    E gene or few full-length genome sequences were inconclusive. In this study we sequenced 114 DENV complete genomes of DENV1-4 obtained from 2013 to 2017 in Guangdong and further analyzed the epidemiological and molecular characteristics. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that dengue fever was not endemic in Guangdong which was indirectly supported by results of our recombination analyses. Nucleotide variation analyses indicated that purification selection shaped dengue virus population. Our investigation will facilitate the development of more effective epidemiological surveillance strategies for dengue infection.    ,
PMC7054463,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\80_16_abstract.xml,   Associations between influenza infection and psychosis have been reported since the eighteenth century with acute “psychoses of influenza” documented during multiple pandemics. In the late 20   th century reports of a season-of-birth effect in schizophrenia were supported by large-scale ecological and sero-epidemiological studies suggesting that maternal influenza infection increases the risk of psychosis in offspring. We examine the evidence for the association between influenza infection and schizophrenia risk before reviewing possible mechanisms    via which this risk may be conferred. Maternal immune activation models implicate placental dysfunction disruption of cytokine networks and subsequent microglial activation as potentially important pathogenic processes. More recent neuroimmunological advances focusing on neuronal autoimmunity following infection provide the basis for a model of infection-induced psychosis potentially implicating autoimmunity to schizophrenia-relevant protein targets including the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Finally we outline areas for future research and relevant experimental approaches and consider whether the current evidence provides a basis for the rational development of strategies to prevent schizophrenia.    ,
PMC7054758,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\81_13_abstract.xml,   Enterovirus 71 (EV71) is the causative pathogen of hand foot and mouth disease (HFMD). However no effective antiviral therapy is currently available. Some viruses could escape the host's innate immunity by upregulating suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) proteins. Until now whether EV71 evades the host immune system by regulating the expression of SOCS proteins remains unknown. In this study we found that EV71 infection promoted SOCS expression at both mRNA and protein levels in vitro and in vivo. Consistently the infectivity of EV71 was decreased significantly in the SOCS3 or SOCS1 knockdown cells suggesting that SOCS1 and especially SOCS3 are crucial for EV71 infection. Further investigation showed that SOCS3 promoted virus infection by inhibiting interferon-induced STAT3 phosphorylation. SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expressions were independent on virus-induced type I interferon expression but were blocked by the inhibitor of NF-   κB. Therefore EV71 infection stimulates the expression of SOCS proteins in an interferon-independent way and negatively regulates the JAK/STAT signaling pathway thus escaping host immunity. All these results may add new information to the mechanism of EV71 in fighting against type I interferon responses.    ,
PMC7055223,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\82_13_abstract.xml,   Mosquito borne viral diseases are an emerging threat as evident from the recent outbreak of Zika virus (ZIKV) as well as repeated outbreaks of Chikungunya (CHIKV) Yellow fever (YFV) and Japanese encephalitis (JEV) virus in different geographical regions. These four arboviruses are endemic in overlapping regions due to the co-prevalence of the transmitting mosquito vector species    Aedes and    Culex. Thus a multivalent vaccine that targets all four viruses would be of benefit to regions of the world where these diseases are endemic. We developed a potential Virus Like Particle (VLP) based multivalent vaccine candidate to target these diseases by using stable cell lines that continuously secrete VLPs in the culture supernatants. Moreover inclusion of Capsid in the VLPs provides an additional viral protein leading to an enhanced immune response as evident from our previous studies with ZIKV. Immunization of Balb/c mice with different combinations of Capsid protein containing VLPs either as monovalent bivalent or tetravalent formulation resulted in generation of high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Interestingly the potential tetravalent VLP vaccine candidate provided strong neutralizing antibody titers against all four viruses. The 293 T stable cell lines secreting VLPs were adapted to grow in suspension cultures to facilitate vaccine scale up. Our stable cell lines secreting individual VLPs provide a flexible yet scalable platform conveniently adaptable to different geographical regions as per the need. Further studies in appropriate animal models will be needed to define the efficacy of the multivalent vaccine candidate to protect against lethal virus challenge.    ,
PMC7055873,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\83_30_abstract.xml,   A community outbreak of human influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus strains was observed in Myanmar in 2017. We investigated the circulation patterns antigenicity and drug resistance of 2017 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses from Myanmar and characterized the full genome of influenza virus strains in Myanmar from in-patients and out-patients to assess the pathogenicity of the viruses. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from out-patients and in-patients with acute respiratory tract infections in Yangon and Pyinmana City in Myanmar during January-December 2017. A total of 215 out-patients and 18 in-patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 were detected by virus isolation and real-time RT-PCR. Among the positive patients 90.6% were less than 14 years old. Hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titers against A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses in Myanmar were similar to the recommended Japanese influenza vaccine strain for 2017–2018 seasons (A/Singapore/GP1908/2015) and WHO recommended 2017 southern hemisphere vaccine component (A/Michigan/45/2015). Phylogenetic analysis of the hemagglutinin sequence showed that the Myanmar strains belonged to the genetic subclade 6B.1 possessing mutations of S162N and S164T at potential antigenic sites. However the amino acid mutation at position 222 which may enhance the severity of disease and mortality was not found. One case with no prior history of oseltamivir treatment possessed H275Y mutated virus in neuraminidase (NA) which confers resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir with elevated IC   50 values. The full genome sequence of Myanmar strains showed no difference between samples from in-patients and out-patients suggesting no additional viral mutations associated with patient severity. Several amino acid changes were observed in PB2 PB1 and M2 of Myanmar strains when compared to the vaccine strain and other Asian strains. However no mutations associated with pathogenicity were found in the Myanmar strains suggesting that viral factors cannot explain the underlying reasons of the massive outbreak in Myanmar. This study reported the first detection of an oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus in Myanmar highlighting the importance of continuous antiviral monitoring and genetic characterization of the influenza virus in Myanmar.    ,
PMC7055907,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\84_23_abstract.xml,      Introduction   Multiple outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever (RVF) with devastating effects have occurred in East Africa. These outbreaks cause disease in both livestock and humans and affect poor households most severely. Communities living in areas practicing nomadic livestock movement may be at higher risk of infection. This study sought to i) determine the human exposure to Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) in populations living within nomadic animal movement routes in Kenya; and ii) identify risk factors for RVFV infection in these communities.       Methods   A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used. Samples were collected from the year 2014 to 2015 in a community-based sampling exercise involving healthy individuals aged ≥18 years from Isiolo Tana River and Garissa counties. In total 1210 samples were screened by ELISA for the presence of immunoglobulin IgM and IgG antibodies against RVFV. Positive results were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test.       Results   Overall IgM and IgG prevalence for all sites combined was 1.4% (95% CI 0.8–2.3%) and 36.4% (95% CI 33.8–39.2%) respectively. Isiolo County recorded a non-significant higher IgG prevalence of 38.8% than Garissa 35.9% and Tana River 32.2% (Chi square = 2.5 df = 2     p = 0.287). Males were significantly at higher risk of infection by RVFV than females (OR = 1.67 95% CI 1.17–2.39     p&lt;0.005). Age was significantly associated with RVFV infection (Wald Chi = 94.2 df = 5     p&lt;0.0001). Individuals who had regular contact with cattle (OR = 1.38 95%CI 1.01–1.89) and donkeys (OR = 1.38 95%CI 1.14–1.67) or contact with animals through birthing (OR = 1.69 95%CI 1.14–2.51) were significantly at a greater risk of RVFV infection than those who did not.          Conclusion   This study demonstrated that although the Isiolo County has been classified as being at medium risk for RVF virus infection appeared to be as prevalent in humans as in Tana River and Garissa which have been classified as being at high risk. Populations in these counties live within nomadic livestock movement routes and therefore at risk of being exposed to the RVFV. Interventions to control RVFV infections therefore should target communities living along livestock movement pathways.    ,
PMC7055907,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\85_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a neglected mosquito-borne zoonotic disease that causes major outbreaks and economic harm to human and ruminants health leading to increased poverty within affected communities. RVF is caused by RVF virus (RVFV) affecting humans and a wide range of ruminants. The virus is transmitted through bites from mosquitoes and exposure to blood body fluids or tissues of infected ruminants. It was first isolated in Kenya in 1930 and several outbreaks have been recorded in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We studied pastoralist communities living along livestock migratory routes. Migratory livestock do move long distances in search of water and pasture and may be at higher risk of exposure to RVFV. We also determined risk factors for RVFV infection by studying age gender contact with animals through birthing and occupation. Prevention and control of RVFV infection can target significant risk factors to prevent spread and re-occurrence of outbreaks.  ,
PMC7056717,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\86_16_abstract.xml,   Ebolavirus (EBOV) infection in humans causes severe hemorrhagic fevers with high mortality rates that range from 30 to 80% as shown in different outbreaks. Thus the development of safe and efficacious EBOV vaccines remains an important goal for biomedical research. We have shown in early studies that immunization with insect cell-produced EBOV virus-like particles (VLPs) is able to induce protect vaccinated mice against lethal EBOV challenge. In the present study we investigated immune responses induced by Ebola VLPs via two different routes intramuscular and intradermal immunizations in guinea pigs. Analyses of antibody responses revealed that similar levels of total IgG antibodies against the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) were induced by the two different immunization methods. However further characterization showed that the EBOV GP-specific antibodies induced by intramuscular immunization were mainly of the IgG2 subtype whereas both IgG1 and IgG2 antibodies against EBOV GP were induced by intradermal immunization. In contrast antibody responses against the EBOV matrix protein VP40 induced by intramuscular or intradermal immunizations exhibited similar IgG1 and IgG2 profiles. More interestingly we found that the sites that the IgG1 antibodies induced by intradermal immunizations bind to in GP are different from those that bind to the IgG2 antibodies induced by intramuscular immunization. Further analyses revealed that sera from all vaccinated guinea pigs exhibited neutralizing activity against Ebola GP-mediated HIV pseudovirion infection at high levels. Moreover all EBOV VLP-vaccinated guinea pigs survived the challenge by a high dose (1000 pfu) of guinea pig-adapted EBOV while all control guinea pigs immunized with irrelevant VLPs succumbed to the challenge. The induction of both IgG1 and IgG2 antibody responses that recognized broader sites in GP by intradermal immunization of EBOV VLPs indicates that this approach may represent a more advantageous route of vaccination against virus infection.  ,
PMC7057477,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\87_13_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) is a newly emergent relative of the Flaviviridae family and linked to dengue (DENV) and Chikungunya (CHIVKV). ZIKV is one of the rising pathogens promptly surpassing geographical borders. ZIKV infection was characterized by mild disease with fever headache rash arthralgia and conjunctivitis with exceptional reports of an association with Guillain–Barre syndrome (GBS) and microcephaly. However since the end of 2015 an increase in the number of GBS associated cases and an astonishing number of microcephaly in fetus and new-borns in Brazil have been related to ZIKV infection raising serious worldwide public health concerns. ZIKV is transmitted by the bite of infected female mosquitoes of    Aedes species. Clarifying such worrisome relationships is thus a current unavoidable goal. Here we extensively described the current understanding of the effects of ZIKV on heath clinical manifestation diagnosis and treatment options based on modern alternative and complementary medicines regarding the disease.    ,
PMC7058363,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\88_19_abstract.xml,      Background   In the northeast United States (U.S.) mosquitoes transmit a number of arboviruses including eastern equine encephalitis Jamestown Canyon and West Nile that pose an annual threat to human and animal health. Local transmission of each arbovirus may be driven by the involvement of multiple mosquito species; however the specificity of these vector-virus associations has not been fully quantified.       Methodology   We used long-term surveillance data consistently collected over 18 years to evaluate mosquito and arbovirus community composition in the State of Connecticut (CT) based on land cover classifications and mosquito species-specific natural histories using community ecology approaches available in the R package VEGAN. We then used binomial-error generalized linear mixed effects models to quantify species-specific trends in arbovirus detections.       Primary results   The composition of mosquito communities throughout CT varied more among sites than among years with variation in mosquito community composition among sites explained mostly by a forested-to-developed-land-cover gradient. Arboviral communities varied equally among sites and years and only developed and forested wetland land cover classifications were associated with the composition of arbovirus detections among sites. Overall the avian host arboviruses mainly West Nile and eastern equine encephalitis displayed the most specific associations among mosquito species and sites while in contrast the mammalian host arboviruses (including Cache Valley Jamestown Canyon and Potosi) associated with a more diverse mix of mosquito species and were widely distributed throughout CT.       Conclusions   We find that avian arboviruses act as vector specialists infecting a few key mosquito species that associate with discrete habitats while mammalian arboviruses are largely vector generalists infecting a wide diversity of mosquito species and habitats in the region. These distinctions have important implications for the design and implementation of mosquito and arbovirus surveillance programs as well as mosquito control efforts.    ,
PMC7058363,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\89_20_abstract.xml,   Author summary  The numbers and types of mosquito species in a community vary across space and time and this variability may be linked to variation in risk of human exposure to mosquito-borne diseases. In this report the authors use a long-term mosquito-borne virus (i.e. arbovirus) surveillance dataset from the State of Connecticut (CT) United States to first examine whether or not the same land cover classes explain variation in mosquito and arbovirus community composition; they then used statistical models to determine which mosquito species were the most likely and unlikely to test positive for an infection for one of seven arboviruses circulating in CT. Multiple mosquito species tested positive for each arbovirus examined and blood feeding behaviors were the strongest predictor of whether or not a mosquito species tested positive for a particular arbovirus. Isolations of bird-host arboviruses aggregated in discrete habitat types while isolations of mammalian-host arboviruses showed no specific habitat associations. The authors conclude that risk of bird-host arbovirus exposures in humans is driven by only a few key mosquito species whereas risk of mammalian-host arbovirus exposure in humans could be attributed to the general presence and abundance of mammal-feeding mosquito species in the community.  ,
PMC7058406,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\90_17_abstract.xml,   Summary  Limited knowledge exists on the quality of polyclonal antibody response generated following Ebola virus (EBOV) infection compared with vaccination. Polyclonal antibody repertoire in plasma following EBOV infection in survivors was compared with ChAd3-MVA prime-boost human vaccination. Higher antibody binding and affinity to GP was observed in survivors compared with vaccinated plasma that correlated with EBOV neutralization. Surprisingly a predominant IgM response was generated after prime-boost vaccination whereas survivors demonstrated IgG-dominant antibody response. EBOV infection induced more diverse antibody epitope repertoire compared with vaccination. A strong binding to antigenic sites in the fusion peptide and another in the highly conserved GP2-HR2 domain was preferentially recognized by EBOV survivors than vaccinated individuals that correlated strongly with EBOV neutralization titers. These findings will help development and evaluation of effective Ebola countermeasures including therapeutics and vaccines.  ,

PMC7058646,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\94_17_abstract.xml,   After the mass campaign of Measles and Rubella vaccination in 2003 in Iran the cases of measles and rubella infection decreased but still the cases of rash and fever were reported. It is worth noting that some other viral infections show signs similar to measles and rubella such as some arboviruses. Considering the epidemic outbreak of arbovirus infections in countries neighbouring Iran we performed this study to estimate the possibility of chikungunya and dengue fever among measles and rubella IgM negative patients presenting with rash and fever from December 2016 to November 2017 in the National Measles Laboratory at Tehran University of Medical Sciences. Serum samples were selected at random from patients from eight provinces. The presence of DENV IgM and CHIKV IgM was examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of the 1306 sera tested 210 were CHIKV seropositive and 82 were dengue seropositive. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the CHIKV IgM antibody seropositivity rate in Kerman (OR = 2.07 95% CI: 1.10–3.92;    P = 0.024) and Fars (OR = 1.77 95% CI: 1.06–2.93;    P = 0.027). The DENV and CHIKV seropositivity rate in summer is higher than in other seasons (   P &lt; 0.01). Our seropositive samples suggest possible CHIKV and DENV infection in Iran. It is likely that these viruses are circulating in Iran and there is a need to study vector carriage of these two viruses.    ,
PMC7059383,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\95_13_abstract.xml,      Background   The 2013–2016 Ebola epidemic in West Africa began in Guinea’s Forest region a region now considered to be at high risk for future epidemics of viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF). Good knowledge attitudes and practices towards VHF amongst healthcare workers in such regions are a central pillar of infection prevention and control (IPC). To inform future training in IPC this study assesses the knowledge attitudes and practices (KAP) towards VHF amongst healthcare workers in public healthcare facilities in the most populated prefecture in Forest Guinea and compares results from urban and rural areas.       Methods   In June and July 2019 we interviewed 102 healthcare workers in the main urban and rural public healthcare facilities in the N’zérékoré prefecture in Forest Guinea. We used an interviewer-administered questionnaire adapted from validated KAP surveys.       Results   The great majority of respondents demonstrated good knowledge and favourable attitudes towards VHF. However respondents reported some gaps in preventive practices such as VHF suspect case detection. They also reported a shortage of protective medical equipment used in everyday clinical work in both urban and rural healthcare facilities and a lack of training in IPC especially in rural healthcare facilities. However whether or not healthcare workers had been trained in IPC did not seem to influence their level of KAP towards VHF.       Conclusions   Three years after the end of the Ebola epidemic our findings suggest that public healthcare facilities in the N’zérékoré prefecture in Forest Guinea still lack essential protective equipment and some practical training in VHF suspect case detection. To minimize the risk of future VHF epidemics and improve management of outbreaks of infectious diseases in the region current efforts to strengthen the public healthcare system in Guinea should encompass questions of supply and IPC training.    ,
PMC7059635,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\96_13_abstract.xml,      Background   The implementation of nurse-initiated management of antiretroviral therapy (NIMART) management training is a challenge in the primary health care (PHC). It is evident from the literature reviewed and the data obtained from the North West province that gaps still exist. There is no conceptual framework providing guidance to NIMART training and implementation.       Aim   Therefore the aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework to strengthen NIMART training and implementation in the North West province to improve patients and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) programme outcomes.       Setting   The study was conducted in the North West Province South Africa.       Methods   A pragmatic explanatory sequential mixed-methods research design was followed. A descriptive and explorative programme evaluation design was used. Data were collected from two sources: antiretroviral therapy (ART) statistics from District Health Information System (DHIS) &amp; Tier.net of 10 PHC facilities to evaluate and determine the impact of NIMART on the HIV programme and five focus group discussions conducted amongst 28 NIMART nurses and three HIV programme managers to describe challenges influencing NIMART training and implementation.       Results   The study revealed that there was low ART initiation compared to the number of clients who tested HIV-positive. There was poor monitoring of patients on ART which was evident in the low viral load collection and suppression high loss to follow-up and deaths related to HIV. Challenges exist and this was confirmed by the qualitative findings including human resource ratios training and mentoring and the entire absence of a conceptual framework or model that guides training and implementation.       Conclusion   The study findings were conceptualised to describe and develop a framework needed to facilitate and influence NIMART training and implementation to improve the HIV programme and patient outcomes. Dickoff James and Wiedenbach’s practice-oriented theory and Donabedian’s structure process outcomes model provided a starting point in the ultimate development of the framework. Although the study was limited to the North West province’s PHC clinics and community health centres and did not include hospitals it is of high significance as there is no such conceptual framework in the province or in even South Africa.    ,
PMC7059726,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\97_13_abstract.xml,   Based on available metabolomic studies influenza infection affects a variety of cellular metabolic pathways to ensure an optimal environment for its replication and production of viral particles. Following infection glucose uptake and aerobic glycolysis increase in infected cells continually which results in higher glucose consumption. The pentose phosphate shunt as another glucose-consuming pathway is enhanced by influenza infection to help produce more nucleotides especially ATP. Regarding lipid species following infection levels of triglycerides phospholipids and several lipid derivatives undergo perturbations some of which are associated with inflammatory responses. Also mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation decreases significantly simultaneously with an increase in biosynthesis of fatty acids and membrane lipids. Moreover essential amino acids are demonstrated to decline in infected tissues due to the production of large amounts of viral and cellular proteins. Immune responses against influenza infection on the other hand could significantly affect metabolic pathways. Mainly interferon (IFN) production following viral infection affects cell function via alteration in amino acid synthesis membrane composition and lipid metabolism. Understanding metabolic alterations required for influenza virus replication has revealed novel therapeutic methods based on targeted inhibition of these cellular metabolic pathways.  ,
PMC7059914,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\98_21_abstract.xml,      Background   In the generalised epidemics of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence shows patterns of clustered micro-epidemics. We mapped and characterised these high-prevalence areas for young adults (15–29 years of age) as a proxy for areas with high levels of transmission for 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa: Kenya Malawi Mozambique Tanzania Uganda Zambia and Zimbabwe.       Methods and findings   We used geolocated survey data from the most recent United States Agency for International Development (USAID) demographic and health surveys (DHSs) and AIDS indicator surveys (AISs) (collected between 2008–2009 and 2015–2016) which included about 113000 adults—of which there were about 53000 young adults (27000 women 28000 men)—from over 3500 sample locations. First ordinary kriging was applied to predict HIV prevalence at unmeasured locations. Second we explored to what extent behavioural socioeconomic and environmental factors explain HIV prevalence at the individual- and sample-location level by developing a series of multilevel multivariable logistic regression models and geospatially visualising unexplained model heterogeneity. National-level HIV prevalence for young adults ranged from 2.2% in Tanzania to 7.7% in Mozambique. However at the subnational level we found areas with prevalence among young adults as high as 11% or 15% alternating with areas with prevalence between 0% and 2% suggesting the existence of areas with high levels of transmission Overall 15.6% of heterogeneity could be explained by an interplay of known behavioural socioeconomic and environmental factors. Maps of the interpolated random effect estimates show that environmental variables representing indicators of economic activity were most powerful in explaining high-prevalence areas. Main study limitations were the inability to infer causality due to the cross-sectional nature of the surveys and the likely under-sampling of key populations in the surveys.       Conclusions   We found that among young adults micro-epidemics of relatively high HIV prevalence alternate with areas of very low prevalence clearly illustrating the existence of areas with high levels of transmission. These areas are partially characterised by high economic activity relatively high socioeconomic status and risky sexual behaviour. Localised HIV prevention interventions specifically tailored to the populations at risk will be essential to curb transmission. More fine-scale geospatial mapping of key populations—such as sex workers and migrant populations—could help us further understand the drivers of these areas with high levels of transmission and help us determine how they fuel the generalised epidemics in SSA.    ,

PMC7059914,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\100_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary     Why was this study done?            Previous studies showed that heterogeneity in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence exists among the general population in Eastern and Southern Africa the geographic area most severely affected by the HIV pandemic.             Whereas HIV prevalence among adults does not reveal when persons have been infected young adults are most likely recently infected and therefore high-prevalence areas among this subpopulation can proxy locations of ongoing transmission.             The location and underlying determinants of high HIV prevalence areas among young adults can help to shape spatially targeted and risk-group–tailored interventions to reduce transmission.              What did the researchers do and find?            We found clear areas of high prevalence in young adults in between vast regions with relatively low prevalence for all 7 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa.             HIV prevalence in young adults was partly explained by an interplay of behavioural socioeconomic and environmental (i.e. economic activity) factors and environmental factors were especially predictive of high transmission locations.              What do these finding mean?            Our findings together with the existing evidence indicate that key population dynamics especially related to seasonal and economic migration and associated sex work might play a major role in fuelling HIV transmission.             In further reducing HIV transmission in Eastern and Southern Africa areas of high HIV prevalence in young adults should be priority areas for tailored HIV prevention interventions towards reaching the fast-track commitments to end the HIV epidemic by 2030.           ,
PMC7061886,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\101_20_abstract.xml,      Introduction   Ebola virus disease (EVD) is one of the deadliest haemorrhagic fevers affecting humans and non-human primates. Thirty-four outbreaks have been reported in Africa since it was first recognised in 1976. This review analysed 42 years of EVD outbreaks and identified various challenges and opportunities for its control and prevention in Sub-Saharan Africa.       Methods   A literature search of relevant articles on EVD was done in PubMed Web of Science and Google Scholar electronic databases. Articles published from 1976 to 2019 were reviewed to document reports of EVD outbreaks in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data extraction focused on the year of outbreak geographical spread virus strain involved number of cases and deaths case fatality and outbreak management. Analyses of trends in case fatality were performed by calculating ORs between times.       Results   In the past four decades a total of 34 EVD outbreaks affecting 34 356 cases and causing 14 823 deaths were reported in 11 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. The overall case fatality rate (95% CI) was 66% (62 to 71) and did not change substantially over time (OR in 2019 vs 1976=1.6 (95% CI 1.5 to 1.8) p&lt;0.001). The results of this review indicate that challenges to control EVD outbreaks are related to epidemiological sociocultural and health system factors.       Conclusions   Sub-Saharan Africa continues to face considerable challenges in EVD control whereby there are no significant changes in case fatality rates observed during the past four decades. Socioeconomic and cultural processes need to be critically considered to shape the community behaviours that lead to exposure to EVD outbreaks. Areas that need to be addressed to prevent future EVD outbreaks include a broad-based one-health approach effective communication social mobilisation and strengthening of the health systems.    ,
PMC7064921,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\102_22_abstract.xml,   Abstract  The induction of polyarthritis and polyarthralgia is a hallmark of arthritogenic alphavirus infections with an exceptionally higher morbidity observed with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). While the mechanisms underlying these incapacitating acute symptoms remain partially understood the progression to chronic conditions in some cases remains unanswered. The highly pro‐inflammatory nature of alphavirus disease has suggested the involvement of virus‐specific joint‐infiltrating Th1 cells as one of the main pathogenic mediators of CHIKV‐induced joint pathologies. This review summarizes the role of cell‐mediated immune responses in CHIKV pathogenesis with a specific focus on pro‐inflammatory Th1 responses in the development of CHIKV joint inflammation. Furthermore due to the explosive nature of arthritogenic alphavirus outbreaks and their recent expansion across the world co‐infections with other highly prevalent pathogens such as malaria are likely to occur but the pathological outcomes of such interactions in humans are unknown. This review will also discuss the potential impact of malaria co‐infections on CHIKV pathogenesis and their relevance in alphavirus control programs in endemic areas.  ,

Six women who had been diagnosed with Zika virus infection during their pregnancies and whose fetus had suspected microcephaly participated in the investigation. Grounded theory was used and thematic content analysis was made for each category identified.       Results   Three main themes affecting access to healthcare services were identified: (1) women knew basic information about the virus but it was limited; (2) access to services was delayed due to their lack of availability or limited supply in the municipality; and (3) most of the participants made out‐of‐pocket payments to get access to services that were not provided.       Conclusions   Several gaps were identified in the provision of healthcare services to pregnant women during the Zika epidemic. Policy makers need to utilize the results from affected communities to develop and implement public policies that adapt and respond to their priorities and needs.    ,

Increases in     GBS from month to month were assessed using a Farrington test. In addition a cross‐sectional study was conducted analyzing 50 adults hospitalized for inflammatory polyneuropathies from 2015 to 2017. The extent to which Zika virus symptoms explained     GBS hospitalizations was evaluated using a calibration test.          Results   There were significant increases (Farrington test     P&lt;0.001) in the incidence of     GBS following the introduction of influenza A/H1N1 in 2009 dengue virus type 4 in 2013 and Zika virus in 2015. Of 50 patients hospitalized 14 (28.0%) were diagnosed with arboviruses 9 (18.0%) with other viruses and the remainder with other causes of such neuropathies. Statistical models based on cases of emerging viruses accurately predicted neurological sequelae such as     GBS.          Conclusion   The introduction of novel viruses increases the incidence of inflammatory neuropathies.    ,

PMC7066069,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\107_14_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the causative pathogen of chikungunya fever a mosquito-borne viral disease causing highly debilitating arthralgia that can persist for months and progress to chronic arthritis. Our previous studies have identified the CHIKV live-attenuated vaccine candidate CHIKV-NoLS. Like most live-attenuated vaccines attenuated replication of CHIKV-NoLS has the potential to limit scalable production. To overcome production limits as well as other drawbacks of live-attenuated vaccines we developed an    in vivo liposome RNA delivery system to deliver the self-replicating RNA genome of CHIKV-NoLS directly into mice allowing the recipients' body to produce the live-attenuated vaccine particles. CAF01 liposomes were able to deliver replication-competent CHIKV-NoLS RNA    in vitro. Immunodeficient AG129 mice inoculated with liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA developed viremia and disease signs representative of this lethal model of CHIKV infection demonstrating    de novo vaccine particle production    in vivo. In immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculation was associated with reduced IgM and IgG levels with low antibody CHIKV-neutralizing capacity compared to vaccination with the original live-attenuated vaccine CHIKV-NoLS. One dose of liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA did not provide systemic protection from CHIKV wild-type (WT) challenge but was found to promote an early onset of severe CHIKV-induced footpad swelling. Liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA inoculation did however provide local protection from CHIKV-WT challenge in the ipsilateral foot after one dose. Results suggest that in the presence of low CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody levels local inflammatory responses likely brought on by liposome adjuvants have a role in the protection of CHIKV-induced footpad swelling in the ipsilateral foot of mice inoculated with liposome-delivered CHIKV-NoLS RNA. Low IgG and CHIKV-specific neutralizing antibody levels may be responsible for early onset of severe swelling in the feet of CHIKV-WT-challenged mice. These results support previous studies that suggest CHIKV is vulnerable to antibody-mediated enhancement of disease. Further studies using booster regimes aim to demonstrate the potential for liposomes to deliver the self-replicating RNA genome of live-attenuated vaccines and offer a novel immunization strategy.    ,
PMC7066101,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\108_16_abstract.xml,   Respiratory viral infections are the most important triggers of asthma exacerbations. Rhinovirus (RV) the common cold virus is clearly the most prevalent pathogen constantly circulating in the community. This virus also stands out from other viral factors due to its large diversity (about 170 genotypes) very effective replication a tendency to create Th2-biased inflammatory environment and association with specific risk genes in people predisposed to asthma development (   CDHR3). Decreased interferon responses disrupted airway epithelial barrier environmental exposures (including biased airway microbiome) and nutritional deficiencies (low in vitamin D and fish oil) increase risk to RV and other virus infections. It is intensively debated whether viral illnesses actually cause asthma. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading causative agent of bronchiolitis whereas RV starts to dominate after 1 year of age. Breathing difficulty induced by either of these viruses is associated with later asthma but the risk is higher for those who suffer from severe RV-induced wheezing. The asthma development associated with these viruses has unique mechanisms but in general RV is a risk factor for later atopic asthma whereas RSV is more likely associated with later non-atopic asthma. Treatments that inhibit inflammation (corticosteroids omalizumab) effectively decrease RV-induced wheezing and asthma exacerbations. The anti-RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab decreases the risk of severe RSV illness and subsequent recurrent wheeze. A better understanding of personal and environmental risk factors and inflammatory mechanisms leading to asthma is crucial in developing new strategies for the prevention and treatment of asthma.    ,
PMC7067377,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\109_18_abstract.xml,   In recent years many studies have drawn attention to the important role of collective awareness and human behaviour during epidemic outbreaks. A number of modelling efforts have investigated the interaction between the disease transmission dynamics and human behaviour change mediated by news coverage and by information spreading in the population. Yet given the scarcity of data on public awareness during an epidemic few studies have relied on empirical data. Here we use fine-grained geo-referenced data from three online sources—Wikipedia the GDELT Project and the Internet Archive—to quantify population-scale information seeking about the 2016 Zika virus epidemic in the U.S. explicitly linking such behavioural signal to epidemiological data. Geo-localized Wikipedia pageview data reveal that visiting patterns of Zika-related pages in Wikipedia were highly synchronized across the United States and largely explained by exposure to national television broadcast. Contrary to the assumption of some theoretical epidemic models news volume and Wikipedia visiting patterns were not significantly correlated with the magnitude or the extent of the epidemic. Attention to Zika in terms of Zika-related Wikipedia pageviews was high at the beginning of the outbreak when public health agencies raised an international alert and triggered media coverage but subsequently exhibited an activity profile that suggests nonlinear dependencies and memory effects in the relation between information seeking media pressure and disease dynamics. This calls for a new and more general modelling framework to describe the interaction between media exposure public awareness and disease dynamics during epidemic outbreaks.  ,
PMC7067377,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\110_19_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Despite its importance for public health policy-makers understanding the impact of media coverage on collective attention during disease outbreaks remains an elusive research task due to the lack of available data especially at high spatial granularity. In this paper we study the dynamics of collective attention received by the 2016 Zika epidemic in the USA and its interplay with the media coverage of the outbreak at level of US states and cities. We measure the attention to Zika through geo-localized Wikipedia page view data and we compare it with mentions of Zika in US news outlets and TV shows. We also compare the collective attention received by the outbreak with the incidence of Zika reported by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in each state. We find that the attention dynamics was highly synchronized across states irrespective of the local risk of transmission of the virus. By building a linear regression model we show that the dynamics of collective attention is highly predictable even at state level only based on the national media coverage received by the outbreak.  ,
PMC7067471,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\111_25_abstract.xml,   In Brazil Dengue (DENV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses are reported as being transmitted exclusively by    Aedes aegypti in urban settings. This study established the vectors and viruses involved in an arbovirus outbreak that occurred in 2019 in a rural area of Espírito Santo state Brazil. Mosquitoes collected were morphologically identified sorted in samples and submitted to molecular analysis for arboviruses detection. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed for the viral sequence obtained. All 393 mosquitoes were identified as    Aedes albopictus. DENV-1 genotype V was present in one sample and another sample was positive for ZIKV. The DENV-1 clustered with viruses that have circulated in previous years in large urban centers of different regions in Brazil. This is the first report of    A.    albopictus infected by DENV and ZIKV during an outbreak in a rural area in Brazil indicating its involvement in arboviral transmission. The DENV-1 strain found in the    A.    albopictus was not new in Brazil being involved previously in epidemics related to    A.    aegypti suggesting the potential to    A.    albopictus in transmitting viruses already circulating in the Brazilian population. This finding also indicates the possibility of these viruses to disperse across urban and rural settings imposing additional challenges for the control of the diseases.    ,
PMC7067596,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\112_17_abstract.xml,   Although the current poliovirus immunization program has been extremely successful in reducing the number of cases of paralytic polio worldwide now more cases are caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses than by wild poliovirus.

PMC7067596,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\113_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  For enteroviruses such as poliovirus (PV) empty capsids which are antigenically indistinguishable from mature virions are produced naturally during viral infection. The production of such capsids recombinantly in heterologous systems such as yeast have great potential as virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates. Here using PV as an exemplar we show the production of VLPs in    Pichia pastoris by coexpression of the structural precursor protein P1 and the viral protease 3CD. The level of expression of the potentially cytotoxic protease relative to that of the P1 precursor was modulated by three different approaches: expression of the P1 precursor and protease from different transcription units separation of the P1 and protease proteins using the    Thosea asigna virus (TaV) 2A translation interruption sequence or separation of the P1 and protease-coding sequences by an internal ribosome entry site sequence from    Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV). We also investigate the antigenicity of VLPs containing previously characterized mutations when produced in    Pichia. Finally using transmission electron microscopy and two-dimensional classification we show that    Pichia-derived VLPs exhibited the classical icosahedral capsid structure displayed by enteroviruses.       IMPORTANCE Although the current poliovirus immunization program has been extremely successful in reducing the number of cases of paralytic polio worldwide now more cases are caused by vaccine-derived polioviruses than by wild poliovirus.

PMC7068348,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\114_15_abstract.xml,   Climate change is regarded as one of the major factors enhancing the transmission intensity of dengue fever. In this study we estimated the threshold effects of temperature on    Aedes mosquito larval index as an early warning tool for dengue prevention. We also investigated the relationship between dengue vector index and dengue epidemics in Taiwan using weekly panel data for 17 counties from January 2012 to May 2019. To achieve our goals we first applied the panel threshold regression technique to test for threshold effects and determine critical temperature values. Data were then further decomposed into different sets corresponding to different temperature regimes. Finally negative binomial regression models were applied to assess the non-linear relationship between meteorological factors and Breteau index (BI). At the national level we found that a 1°C temperature increase caused the expected value of BI to increase by 0.09 units when the temperature is less than 27.21 °C and by 0.26 units when the temperature is greater than 27.21 °C. At the regional level the dengue vector index was more sensitive to temperature changes because double threshold effects were found in the southern Taiwan model. For southern Taiwan as the temperature increased by 1°C the expected value of BI increased by 0.29 0.63 and 1.49 units when the average temperature was less than 27.27 °C between 27.27 and 30.17 °C and higher than 30.17 °C respectively. In addition the effects of precipitation and relative humidity on BI became stronger when the average temperature exceeded the thresholds. Regarding the impacts of climate change on BI our results showed that the potential effects on BI range from 3.5 to 54.42% under alternative temperature scenarios. By combining threshold regression techniques with count data regression models this study provides evidence of threshold effects between climate factors and the dengue vector index. The proposed threshold of temperature could be incorporated into the implementation of public health measures and risk prediction to prevent and control dengue fever in the future.    ,
PMC7068796,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\115_14_abstract.xml,   Although viruses and bacteria have been known as agents of diseases since 1546 250 years went by until the first vaccines against these pathogens were developed (1796 and 1800s). In contrast Malaria which is a protozoan-neglected disease has been known since the 5th century BCE and despite 2500 years having passed since then no human vaccine has yet been licensed for Malaria. Additionally no modern human vaccine is currently licensed against Visceral or Cutaneous leishmaniasis. Vaccination against Malaria evolved from the inoculation of irradiated sporozoites through the bite of Anopheles mosquitoes in 1930's which failed to give protection to the use of controlled human Malaria infection (CHMI) provoked by live sporozoites of    Plasmodium falciparum and curtailed with specific chemotherapy since 1940's. Although the use of CHMI for vaccination was relatively efficacious it has some ethical limitations and was substituted by the use of injected recombinant vaccines expressing the main antigens of the parasite cycle starting in 1980. Pre-erythrocytic (PEV) Blood stage (BSV) transmission-blocking (TBV) antitoxic (AT) and pregnancy-associated Malaria vaccines are under development. Currently the RTSS-PEV vaccine based on the circumsporozoite protein is the only one that has arrived at the Phase III trial stage. The “R” stands for the central repeat region of    Plasmodium (P.) falciparum circumsporozoite protein (CSP); the “T” for the T-cell epitopes of the CSP; and the “   S” for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg). In Africa this latter vaccine achieved only 36.7% vaccine efficacy (VE) in 5–7 years old children and was associated with an increase in clinical cases in one assay. Therefore in spite of 35 years of research there is no currently licensed vaccine against Malaria. In contrast more progress has been achieved regarding prevention of leishmaniasis by vaccine which also started with the use of live vaccines. For ethical reasons these were substituted by second-generation subunit or recombinant DNA and protein vaccines. Currently there is one live vaccine for humans licensed in Uzbekistan and four licensed veterinary vaccines against visceral leishmaniasis: Leishmune® (76–80% VE) and CaniLeish® (68.4% VE) which give protection against strong endpoints (severe disease and deaths under natural conditions) and under less severe endpoints (parasitologically and PCR-positive cases) Leishtec® developed 71.4% VE in a low infective pressure area but only 35.7% VE and transient protection in a high infective pressure area while Letifend® promoted 72% VE. A human recombinant vaccine based on the Nucleoside hydrolase NH36 of    Leishmania (L.) donovani the main antigen of the Leishmune® vaccine and the sterol 24-c-methyltransferase (SMT) from    L. (L.) infantum has reached the Phase I clinical trial phase but has not yet been licensed against the disease. This review describes the history of vaccine development and is focused on licensed formulations that have been used in preventive medicine. Special attention has been given to the delay in the development and licensing of human vaccines against Protozoan infections which show high incidence worldwide and still remain severe threats to Public Health.    ,
PMC7069216,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\116_19_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Genetic clustering is a popular method for characterizing variation in transmission rates for rapidly evolving viruses and could potentially be used to detect outbreaks in ‘near real time’. However the statistical properties of clustering are poorly understood in this context and there are no objective guidelines for setting clustering criteria. Here we develop a new statistical framework to optimize a genetic clustering method based on the ability to forecast new cases. We analysed the pairwise Tamura-Nei (TN93) genetic distances for anonymized HIV-1 subtype B    pol sequences from Seattle (   n =    1653) and Middle Tennessee USA (   n =    2779) and northern Alberta Canada (   n =    809). Under varying TN93 thresholds we fit two models to the distributions of new cases relative to clusters of known cases: 1 a null model that assumes cluster growth is strictly proportional to cluster size i.e. no variation in transmission rates among individuals; and 2 a weighted model that incorporates individual-level covariates such as recency of diagnosis. The optimal threshold maximizes the difference in information loss between models where covariates are used most effectively. Optimal TN93 thresholds varied substantially between data sets e.g. 0.0104 in Alberta and 0.016 in Seattle and Tennessee such that the optimum for one population would potentially misdirect prevention efforts in another. For a given population the range of thresholds where the weighted model conferred greater predictive accuracy tended to be narrow (±0.005 units) and the optimal threshold tended to be stable over time. Our framework also indicated that variation in the recency of HIV diagnosis among clusters was significantly more predictive of new cases than sample collection dates (ΔAIC &gt; 50). These results suggest that one cannot rely on historical precedence or convention to configure genetic clustering methods for public health applications especially when translating methods between settings of low-level and generalized epidemics. Our framework not only enables investigators to calibrate a clustering method to a specific public health setting but also provides a variable selection procedure to evaluate different predictive models of cluster growth.    ,
PMC7069648,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\117_25_abstract.xml,   Dengue virus (DENV) has caused recent outbreaks in coastal cities of Kenya but the epidemiological situation in other areas of Kenya is largely unknown. We investigated the role of DENV infection as a cause of acute febrile disease in non-epidemic settings in rural and urban study areas in Kenya. Altogether 560 patients were sampled in 2016–2017 in rural Taita–Taveta County (   n = 327) and urban slums of Kibera Nairobi (   n = 233). The samples were studied for DENV IgM IgG NS1 antigen and flaviviral RNA. IgG seroprevalence was found to be higher in Taita–Taveta (14%) than in Nairobi (3%). Five Taita–Taveta patients were positive for flaviviral RNA all identified as DENV-2 cosmopolitan genotype. Local transmission in Taita–Taveta was suspected in a patient without travel history. The sequence analysis suggested that DENV-2 strains circulating in coastal and southern Kenya likely arose from a single introduction from India. The molecular clock analyses dated the most recent ancestor to the Kenyan strains a year before the large 2013 outbreak in Mombasa. After this the virus has been detected in Kilifi in 2014 from our patients in Taita–Taveta in 2016 and in an outbreak in Malindi in 2017. The results highlight that silent transmission occurs between epidemics and also affects rural areas. More information is needed to understand the local epidemiological characteristics and future risks of dengue in Kenya.    ,
PMC7069648,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\118_26_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Dengue virus (DENV) is an emerging mosquito-borne global health threat in the tropics and subtropics. The majority of the world’s population live in areas at risk of dengue that can cause a wide variety of symptoms from febrile illness to haemorrhagic fever. Information of DENV in Africa is limited and fragmented. In Kenya dengue is a recognized disease in coastal cities that have experienced recent outbreaks. We investigated the role of DENV infection as a cause of acute febrile disease in non-epidemic settings in rural and urban study areas in Kenya. We found DENV-2 in five febrile patients from rural Taita–Taveta where no dengue has been reported before. Genetic analysis of the virus suggests it to be most likely of Indian origin. This Indian origin DENV-2 was detected in the Mombasa outbreak in 2013 in Kilifi in 2014 in Taita–Taveta in 2016 (our study samples) and again in the Malindi outbreak in 2017. The results suggest that dengue is unrecognized in rural Kenya and more studies are needed for local risk assessment. Our findings of virus transmission between epidemics contribute to better understanding of the epidemiological situation and origins of DENV in Kenya.  ,

A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled single-center phase IIb efficacy and safety trial was conducted. One hundred and fifty-three healthy individuals 18–55 years of age were randomized to receive one or two doses of adjuvanted FLU-v or adjuvanted placebo subcutaneously on days −43 and −22 prior to intranasal challenge on day 0 with the A/California/04/2009/H1N1 human influenza A challenge virus. The primary objective of the study was to identify a reduction in mild to moderate influenza disease (MMID) defined as the presence of viral shedding and clinical influenza symptoms. Single-dose adjuvanted FLU-v recipients (   n = 40) were significantly less likely to develop MMID after challenge vs placebo (   n = 42) (32.5% vs 54.8%    p = 0.035). FLU-v should continue to be evaluated and cellular immunity explored further as a possible important correlate of protection against influenza.    ,
PMC7070111,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\120_13_abstract.xml,   The H3 subtype of avian influenza virus (AIV) is widespread in avian species and is frequently isolated in surveillance projects; thus we have developed a more effective diagnostic approach of a monoclonal antibody (mAb)-based sandwich ELISA for the H3 AIV detection. First we have produced the essential reagent of mAb against AIV H3 strains with the development of an mAb-Mouse immunization with a purified H3-subtype AIV strain and cell fusion to generate hybridoma cells. These cells were screened with hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests and optimal cells were subcloned. We chose a hybridoma cell line that steadily secreted a specific H3-subtype AIV mAb designated 9F12 that belongs to the IgG1 subclass and has a K-type light chain. 9F12 was shown to bind specifically to the H3-subtype AIV antigen by both immunofluorescence assay and Western blot analysis. Finally a 9F12-based sandwich ELISA was successfully developed and used to specifically test for this antigen. The sandwich ELISA conditions were optimized and the specificity and sensitivity were validated. The results for clinical sample detection were consistent with viral isolation. Consequently the 9F12-based sandwich ELISA is a specific sensitive robust rapid and versatile diagnostic tool for H3-subtype AIV and provides a promising strategy for effective influenza virus prevention and control.  ,

In low-resource settings however sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are treated syndromically and many individuals with asymptomatic infection may be missed especially adolescents and young adults with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).          Methods   We enrolled patients aged 15–24 with HIV (N = 300) attending a family-centered HIV clinic in Mbabane Eswatini. Participants completed a sexual history questionnaire and provided urine as well as oropharyngeal and/or vaginal swabs if sexually active for testing with Xpert CT/NG and TV tests. Analysis included bivariate and multivariate odds ratios and test sensitivity and specificity.       Results   Sexually transmitted infection rates were highest (25.0%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 15.2–37.3) in females ages 20–24 who were ever sexually active. In patients with confirmed STIs NG (15 of 32 47%) was more common than CT (9 of 32 28%) and TV (8 of 32 25%). Syndromic screening alone had a sensitivity of 32.0% (95% CI 14.9–53.3) and specificity of 86.0% (95% CI 79.0–91.4) but varied by gender. The presence of an STI was associated with reporting new sexual partner(s) (OR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.1–6.4) sometimes to never using condoms (OR = 4.2; 95% CI 1.7–10.2) most recent sexual partner &gt;25 years old (OR = 3.2; 95% CI 1.3–7.9) and HIV diagnosis at age ≥15 years (OR = 3.4; 95% CI 1.4–8.2).       Conclusions   Syndromic screening alone performed poorly. Routine diagnostic testing significantly increases STI detection and should be considered in high-risk populations such as adolescents and young adults with HIV.    ,

PMC7072757,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\123_20_abstract.xml,   Although the influenza A virus H7N9 subtype circulates within several avian species it can also infect humans with a severe disease outcome. To better understand the biology of the H7N9 virus we examined the host response to infection in avian and human cells. In this study we used the A/Anhui/1/2013 strain which was isolated during the first wave of the H7N9 epidemic. The H7N9 virus-infected both human (Airway Epithelial cells) and avian (Chick Embryo Fibroblast) cells and each infected host transcriptome was examined with bioinformatic tools and compared with other representative avian and human influenza A virus subtypes. The H7N9 virus induced higher expression changes (differentially regulated genes) in both cell lines with more prominent changes observed in avian cells. Ortholog mapping of differentially expression genes identified significant enriched common and cell-type pathways during H7N9 infections. This data confirmed our previous findings that different influenza A virus subtypes have virus-specific replication characteristics and anti-virus signaling in human and avian cells. In addition we reported for the first time the new HIPPO signaling pathway in avian cells which we hypothesized to play a vital role to maintain the antiviral state of H7N9 virus-infected avian cells. This could explain the absence of disease symptoms in avian species that tested positive for the presence of H7N9 virus.  ,
PMC7073157,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\124_18_abstract.xml,   Influenza (flu) is a contagious viral disease which targets the human respiratory tract and spreads throughout the world each year. Every year influenza infects around 10% of the world population and between 290000 and 650000 people die from it according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Influenza viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and have a negative sense eight-segment single-stranded RNA genome that encodes 11 different proteins. The only control over influenza seasonal epidemic outbreaks around the world are vaccines annually updated according to viral strains in circulation but because of high rates of mutation and recurrent genetic assortment new viral strains of influenza are constantly emerging increasing the likelihood of pandemics. Vaccination effectiveness is limited calling for new preventive and therapeutic approaches and a better understanding of the virus–host interactions. In particular grasping the role of influenza non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and related known interactions in the host cell is pivotal to better understand the mechanisms of virus infection and replication and thus propose more effective antiviral approaches. In this review we assess the structure of NS1 its dynamics and multiple functions and interactions to highlight the central role of this protein in viral biology and its potential use as an effective therapeutic target to tackle seasonal and pandemic influenza.  ,

PMC7074708,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\126_19_abstract.xml,   Modern computational methods using patient Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1) genetic sequences can model population-wide viral transmission dynamics. Accurate transmission inferences can play a critical role in the characterization of high-risk transmission clusters important for enhanced epidemiological control. We evaluated a phylogenetics-based analysis pipeline to infer person-to-person (P2P) infection dates and transmission relationships using 139 patient HIV-1 polymerase Sanger sequences curated by the Southern Alberta HIV Clinic. Parameter combinations tailored to HIV-1 transmissions were tuned with respect to inference accuracy. Inference accuracy was assessed using clinically confirmed P2P transmission patient data. The most accurate parameter settings correctly inferred 48.56% of the P2P relationships (95% confidence interval 63.89–33.33%) slightly lower than next-generation-sequencing methods. The infection date was correctly inferred 43.02% (95% confidence interval 49.89–35.63%). Several novel unsuspected transmission clusters of up to twelve patients were identified. An accuracy trade-off between inferring transmission relationships and infection dates was observed. Using clinically confirmed P2P transmission data as benchmark our phylogenetic methods identified sufficient P2P transmission relationships using readily available low-resolution Sanger sequences. These approaches may give valuable information about HIV infection dynamics within a population and may be easily deployed to guide public health interventions without a need for next generation sequencing technology.  ,
PMC7074809,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\127_20_abstract.xml,   Despite the availability of a safe and effective vaccine in 2018 around 350000 measles cases were reported worldwide which resulted in an estimate of 142300 deaths from measles. Additionally in 2017 global measles cases spiked causing the death of 110000 people mostly children under the age of 5 years and immunocompromised adults. The increase in measles incidence is caused by the ongoing reduction of vaccination coverage. This event has triggered public and scientific interest. For this reason we reviewed the pathophysiology of measles infection focusing on mechanisms by which the virus spreads systemically through the host organism. By reaching the lymphocytes from the airways through a “trojan horse” strategy measles induces an immunosuppression status. H and F glycoproteins both expressed in the envelope ensure attachment of the virus to host cells and spreading from one cell to another by binding to several receptors as described in detail. The severity of the disease depends both on the age and underlying conditions of patients as well as the social and health context in which epidemics spread and is often burdened by sequelae and complications that may occur several years after infection. Particular attention was paid to special groups that are more susceptible to severe or atypical measles. An overview of microbiology symptoms diagnosis prevention and treatment completes and enriches the review.  ,
PMC7075273,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\128_15_abstract.xml,   Human noroviruses (NVs) are the leading cause of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. The majority of outbreaks are caused by genogroup II.4 (GII.4) with new variants emerging every 2 to 4 years. Immunocompromised patients are hypothesized to be important reservoirs where new NV variants emerge. Here we examined intra-host NV variants and assessed immune-driven NV evolution in chronically infected immunocompromised hosts. Three NV GII.4-positive samples were collected from the same patient in different clinical phases following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and had viral RNA concentrations of 2.46 × 10   6 1.47 × 10   6 and 2.26 × 10   6 genome copies/mL. The non-synonymous (dN) and synonymous (dS) substitution ratio of the sequences in the partial P domain were &gt;1 indicating strong positive selection in the patient. Both the number and the frequency of the single nucleotide variants increased over time in the patient. Also the majority of capsid amino acid changes were located at blocking epitopes and histo-blood group antigen (HBGA)-binding sites and 11 positive selection sites were found in the capsid region of which 8 sites were presented in blocking epitopes or HBGA-binding sites. Homodimeric P-domain capsid models also suggested a structural change in the epitopes and HBGA-binding sites. The results suggested that novel variants of NV GII.4 with HBGA and antigenic site changes were produced in the immunocompromised patient. Further functional and epidemiological studies are needed to determine whether the new variants are a risk to public health.    ,

However the antiviral effect of     Radix isatidis polysaccharide against pseudorabies virus (PRV) is still unknown.          Methods   The polysaccharide were isolated from extract of the roots of     Radix isatidis. MTT assays were used to determine the preventive effect inhibitory effect and antiviral effect of     Radix isatidis polysaccharide on PRV in vitro.          Results   This study found that different concentrations of polysaccharides from this plant can inhibit PRV replication by 14.674–30.840% prevent infection at rates of 6.668–14.923% and kill this virus at rates of 32.214–67.422%.       Conclusion   These results broaden the understanding of this traditional Chinese herb and provide a theoretical basis for further research. Moreover     Radix isatidis polysaccharide could be used for antiviral therapy.       ,
PMC7076942,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\130_13_abstract.xml,      Background   The abundance and diversity of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in the human respiratory microbiome remain poorly characterized. In the context of influenza virus infection interactions between the virus the host and resident bacteria with pathogenic potential are known to complicate and worsen disease resulting in coinfection and increased morbidity and mortality of infected individuals. When pathogenic bacteria acquire antibiotic resistance they are more difficult to treat and of global health concern. Characterization of ARG expression in the upper respiratory tract could help better understand the role antibiotic resistance plays in the pathogenesis of influenza-associated bacterial secondary infection.       Results   Thirty-seven individuals participating in the Household Influenza Transmission Study (HITS) in Managua Nicaragua were selected for this study. We performed metatranscriptomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses on nasal and throat swab samples and host transcriptome profiling on blood samples. Individuals clustered into two groups based on their microbial gene expression profiles with several microbial pathways enriched with genes differentially expressed between groups. We also analyzed antibiotic resistance gene expression and determined that approximately 25% of the sequence reads that corresponded to antibiotic resistance genes mapped to     Streptococcus pneumoniae and     Staphylococcus aureus. Following construction of an integrated network of ARG expression with host gene co-expression we identified several host key regulators involved in the host response to influenza virus and bacterial infections and host gene pathways associated with specific antibiotic resistance genes.          Conclusions   This study indicates the host response to influenza infection could indirectly affect antibiotic resistance gene expression in the respiratory tract by impacting the microbial community structure and overall microbial gene expression. Interactions between the host systemic responses to influenza infection and antibiotic resistance gene expression highlight the importance of viral-bacterial co-infection in acute respiratory infections like influenza.                         Video abstract                      ,
PMC7077197,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\131_16_abstract.xml,   Hydropericardium-Hepatitis Syndrome (HHS) caused by Fowl Adenovirus Serotype 4 (FAdV4) infection is a severe threat to the poultry industry worldwide especially in China since 2015. Recent studies show that FAdV4 induces liver injury through apoptosis. However the underlying molecular mechanism is still unclear. We report here that FAdV4 infection caused apoptosis in Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells and that PX a structural protein of FAdV4 acted as a major viral factor inducing apoptosis. Furthermore the nuclear localization of PX is determined by the R/K regions of PX and required for PX-induced apoptosis. Moreover alanines 11 and 129 of PX are crucial to PX-induced apoptosis. Inhibition of FAdV4-induced apoptosis by caspase inhibitors retarded viral replication suggesting that PX serves as a virulence factor for FAdV4 infection which may further our understandings of the pathogenesis of FAdV4 infection.  ,
PMC7077230,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\132_19_abstract.xml,   Viruses are evolving at an alarming rate spreading and inconspicuously adapting to cutting-edge therapies. Therefore the search for rapid informative and reliable diagnostic methods is becoming urgent as ever. Conventional clinical tests (PCR serology etc.) are being continually optimized yet provide very limited data. Could high throughput sequencing (HTS) become the future gold standard in molecular diagnostics of viral infections? Compared to conventional clinical tests HTS is universal and more precise at profiling pathogens. Nevertheless it has not yet been widely accepted as a diagnostic tool owing primarily to its high cost and the complexity of sample preparation and data analysis. Those obstacles must be tackled to integrate HTS into daily clinical practice. For this three objectives are to be achieved: (1) designing and assessing universal protocols for library preparation (2) assembling purpose-specific pipelines and (3) building computational infrastructure to suit the needs and financial abilities of modern healthcare centers. Data harvested with HTS could not only augment diagnostics and help to choose the correct therapy but also facilitate research in epidemiology genetics and virology. This information in turn could significantly aid clinicians in battling viral infections.  ,

However the use of entomological surveillance for arboviral infection vector control is often dependent on finding infected individuals. Although this method may suffice in highly endemic areas it is not as effective in controlling the spread of diseases in low endemic and non-endemic areas. In this study we examined the efficiency of using entomological markers to assess the status and risk of arbovirus infection in Ghana which is considered a non-endemic country by combining mosquito surveillance with virus isolation and detection. This study reports the presence of cryptic species of mosquitoes in Ghana demonstrating the need to combine morphological identification and molecular techniques in mosquito surveillance. Furthermore although no medically important viruses were detected the importance of insect-specific viruses in understanding virus evolution and arbovirus transmission is discussed. This study reports the first mutualistic relationship between dengue virus and the double-stranded RNA Aedes aegypti totivirus. Finally this study discusses the complexity of the virome of    Aedes and    Culex mosquitoes and its implication for arbovirus transmission.    ,
PMC7077299,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\134_19_abstract.xml,   Although seasonal influenza vaccines block most predominant influenza types and subtypes humans still remain vulnerable to waves of seasonal and new potential pandemic influenza viruses for which no immunity may exist because of viral antigenic drift and/or shift. Previously we described a human monoclonal antibody (hMAb) KPF1 which was produced in human embryonic kidney 293T cells (KPF1-HEK) with broad and potent neutralizing activity against H1N1 influenza A viruses (IAV) in vitro and prophylactic and therapeutic activities in vivo. In this study we produced hMAb KPF1 in tobacco plants (KPF1-Antx) and demonstrated how the plant-produced KPF1-Antx hMAb possesses similar biological activity compared with the mammalian-produced KPF1-HEK hMAb. KPF1-Antx hMAb showed broad binding to recombinant HA proteins and H1N1 IAV including A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1) in vitro which was comparable to that observed with KPF1-HEK hMAb. Importantly prophylactic administration of KPF1-Antx hMAb to guinea pigs prevented pH1N1 infection and transmission in both prophylactic and therapeutic experiments substantiating its clinical potential to prevent and treat H1N1 infections. Collectively this study demonstrated for the first time a plant-produced influenza hMAb with in vitro and in vivo activity against influenza virus. Because of the many advantages of plant-produced hMAbs such as rapid batch production low cost and the absence of mammalian cell products they represent an alternative strategy for the production of immunotherapeutics for the treatment of influenza viral infections including emerging seasonal and/or pandemic strains.  ,
PMC7077306,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\135_23_abstract.xml,   In Senegal chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is maintained in a sylvatic cycle and causes sporadic cases or small outbreaks in rural areas. However little is known about the influence of the environment on its transmission. To address the question 120 villages were randomly selected in the Kedougou region of southeastern Senegal. In each selected village 10 persons by randomly selected household were sampled and tested for specific anti-CHIKV IgG antibodies by ELISA. We investigated the association of CHIKV seroprevalence with environmental variables using logistic regression analysis and the spatial correlation of village seroprevalence based on semivariogram analysis. Fifty-four percent (51%–57%) of individuals sampled during the survey tested positive for CHIKV-specific IgG. CHIKV seroprevalence was significantly higher in populations living close to forested areas (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.90 (1.42–2.57)) and was negatively associated with population density (OR = 0.76 (0.69–0.84)). In contrast in gold mining sites where population density was &gt;400 people per km   2 seroprevalence peaked significantly among adults (46% (27%–67%)) compared to all other individuals (20% (12%–31%)). However traditional gold mining activities significantly modify the transmission dynamic of CHIKV leading to a potential increase of the risk of human exposition in the region.    ,
PMC7077324,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\136_17_abstract.xml,   Epidemics of the Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) from 2004 onwards were caused by the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype. However the pathogenesis of the genotype infection has not been fully explained. In this study we examined the pathogenic potential of CHIKV ECSA genotype M-30 (M-30) by comparing it with that of African genotype S-27 (S-27) in mice. Following low titer infections in type-I IFN receptor KO (A129) mice we found that the M-30 infection caused high and acute fatality compared with the S-27 infection. M-30-infected A129 mice showed higher viral loads in their central nervous systems and peripheral organs and increased levels of IFN-γ responses in their brains. Interestingly M-30-infected mice did not show the hypophagia and reductions in weight which were observed in S-27-infected mice. Our observations provide a novel explanation of the pathogenic mechanisms attributed to virus proliferation anti-type-II IFN response and metabolic activity in the CHIKV ECSA virus in mice.  ,
PMC7077838,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\137_26_abstract.xml,      Background   Rapid tests detecting both dengue virus (DENV) NS1 antigen and anti-DENV IgM and IgG antibodies facilitate diagnosis of dengue fever (DF) in resource-poor settings.       Methodology/principal findings   92 acute phase serum samples from patients with a PCR-confirmed DENV infection collected in Lao People’s Democratic Republic (Lao PDR) in 2013 and 2015 were analyzed with the SD Bioline Dengue Duo test. A subset of 74 samples was additionally tested with the Platelia NS1 antigen test the Panbio DENV μ-capture ELISA and the Panbio DENV IgG ELISA. IgM seroconversion was assayed using follow-up samples of 35 patients collected in the convalescent phase. 57.6% 22.8% and 44.6% of acute phase serum samples tested positive in the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 IgM and IgG test respectively. Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test strongly correlated with viral load decreased rapidly over the acute phase of the disease and was significantly reduced in presence of high anti-DENV IgG antibody titers resulting from secondary DENV infection. While a good concordance (Cohen’s kappa 0.78) was found between the SD Bioline Dengue Duo NS1 test and the Platelia NS1 antigen ELISA both the SD Bioline Dengue Duo IgM and IgG test displayed a significantly lower sensitivity than the corresponding ELISA tests.       Conclusions/significance   The SD Bioline Dengue Duo test is a valuable tool for diagnosis of DENV infections especially when analyzing early acute phase samples with high viral load. Nevertheless in endemic areas where secondary flavivirus infections are common diagnostic sensitivity of the NS1 and IgM test components may be compromised.    ,

An EV-A71 epidemic occurred in Southern Vietnam in 2011 but its scale is not clear. We collected residual sera from non-HFMD Vietnamese inpatients in 2012–2013 to determine seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibodies and measured cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers against three EV-A71 genogroups. About 23.5% of 1-year-old children in Southern Vietnam has been infected by EV-A71 and the median age of infection was estimated to be 3 years. No significant antigenic variation could be detected among the three EV-A71 genogroups. The high seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody in children living in southern Vietnam indicates the necessity of introducing EV-A71 vaccines in southern Vietnam particularly for children under 6 months of age. Moreover it is critical to understand EV-A71 disease burden for formulating national vaccination policy.  ,

EV-A71 mainly spreads through oral-fecal or oral-oral transmission as well as respiratory droplets. EV-A71 outbreaks have cyclically occurred throughout some Asian countries since 1997 with millions of people affected. The presence of serum neutralizing antibodies to EV-A71 can represent the prevalence of previous EV-A71 infections and seroprevalence studies are widely used to understand prevalence of infectious diseases. The results of our study demonstrate that about 50% of young children under 3 years of age were infected during the 2011 epidemic in southern Vietnam. The high seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody in children living in southern Vietnam indicates the necessity of introducing EV-A71 vaccines particularly for children under 6 months of age. Moreover it is critical to understand EV-A71 disease burden for formulating national vaccination policy in the future.  ,
PMC7077840,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\140_21_abstract.xml,   First reported in March 2014 an Ebola epidemic impacted West Africa most notably Liberia Guinea and Sierra Leone. We demonstrate the value of social media for automated surveillance of infectious diseases such as the West Africa Ebola epidemic. We experiment with two variations of an existing surveillance architecture: the first aggregates tweets related to different symptoms together while the second considers tweets about each symptom separately and then aggregates the set of alerts generated by the architecture. Using a dataset of tweets posted from the affected region from 2011 to 2014 we obtain alerts in December 2013    which is three months prior to the official announcement of the epidemic. Among the two variations the second which produces a restricted but useful set of alerts can potentially be applied to other infectious disease surveillance and alert systems.    ,

We analyzed data using descriptive statistics and constructed multivariable logistic regression models for willingness to use syphilis and HIV PrEP and PEP respectively.       Results   Among 424 participants (56.4% Toronto 43.6% Vancouver) median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 31.0 years (26.0–39.0 years) 61.7% had completed postsecondary education and 54.4% were white. Median (IQR) number of male partners in the past 6 months was 6.0 (3.0–13.0) and 18.2% had 1 or more prior syphilis diagnosis. 60.1%/44.1% indicated willingness to use syphilis PEP/PrEP; 36.6% were unwilling to use either. Among HIV-negative participants 74.0% and 75.2% were willing to use HIV PrEP and PEP respectively. Most participants were familiar with antibiotic resistance (89.0%) and agreed that syphilis rates are rising in Canada (68.2%) but only 55.4% believed they were at risk for syphilis. Agreement with the latter statement was associated with willingness to use syphilis PrEP (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.6; 95% confidence interval [95%CI] 1.0–2.5) as was previous/existing HIV PrEP use (aOR 2.2; 95% CI 1.1–4.3) and being “very concerned” about STI acquisition (aOR 1.9; 95% CI 1.0–3.4). Odds of being willing to use syphilis PEP were higher in Toronto versus Vancouver (aOR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2–3.4) and increased with the number of different STIs previously diagnosed (aOR 1.4; 95% CI 1.21.7).       Conclusions   There is considerable interest in syphilis PrEP/PEP in gbMSM attending Toronto/Vancouver STI clinics.    ,
PMC7080275,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\143_28_abstract.xml,   Understanding the transition of epidemic to endemic dengue transmission remains a challenge in regions where serotypes co-circulate and there is extensive human mobility. French Polynesia an isolated group of 117 islands of which 72 are inhabited distributed among five geographically separated subdivisions has recorded mono-serotype epidemics since 1944 with long inter-epidemic periods of circulation. Laboratory confirmed cases have been recorded since 1978 enabling exploration of dengue epidemiology under monotypic conditions in an isolated spatially structured geographical location. A database was constructed of confirmed dengue cases geolocated to island for a 35-year period. Statistical analyses of viral establishment persistence and fade-out as well as synchrony among subdivisions were performed. Seven monotypic and one heterotypic dengue epidemic occurred followed by low-level viral circulation with a recrudescent epidemic occurring on one occasion. Incidence was asynchronous among the subdivisions. Complete viral die-out occurred on several occasions with invasion of a new serotype. Competitive serotype replacement has been observed previously and seems to be characteristic of the South Pacific. Island population size had a strong impact on the establishment persistence and fade-out of dengue cases and endemicity was estimated achievable only at a population size in excess of 175 000. Despite island remoteness and low population size dengue cases were observed somewhere in French Polynesia almost constantly in part due to the spatial structuration generating asynchrony among subdivisions. Long-term persistence of dengue virus in this group of island populations may be enabled by island hopping although could equally be explained by a reservoir of sub-clinical infections on the most populated island Tahiti.  ,
PMC7080275,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\144_29_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Dengue virus is the most significant arthropod-borne virus infecting man. Understanding how long dengue virus can persist in populations of varying size is key to understanding its epidemiology. This is however impossible to achieve in settings where dengue is endemic because of continued human movement and is further complexified by the occurrence of several co-circulating serotypes. By contrast French Polynesia an isolated group of 72 inhabited islands in the South Pacific has had intermittent majoritarily monotypic dengue epidemics since the 1940s and offers a unique opportunity to address questions of viral persistence turnover and the importance of spatial sub-structure in determining dengue epidemiology. Collating and analyzing a database of laboratory-confirmed dengue cases from across French Polynesia over a 35 year period we were able to show that dengue virus die-out can occur with or without replacement by a new serotype monotypic transmission of dengue viruses fails to be maintained within small island populations but can persist for years among isolated islands connected via air and sea links. This remarkable long-term persistence of dengue virus in French Polynesia could be maintained by asynchronous viral transmission among connected islands and/or by repeated seeding from a reservoir of sub-clinical infections in the most populated island Tahiti.  ,
PMC7080822,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\145_13_abstract.xml,   Avian influenza virus (AIV) can cause severe diseases in poultry worldwide. H6N1 AIV was the dominant enzootic subtype in 1985 in the chicken farms of Taiwan until the initial outbreak of a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 virus in 2003; thereafter this and other LPAIs have been sporadically detected. In 2015 the outbreak of three novel H5Nx viruses of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) emerged and devastated Taiwanese chicken and waterfowl industries. The mechanism of variation in pathogenicity among these viruses is unclear; but in light of the many biological functions of viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) including interferon (IFN) antagonist and host range determinant we hypothesized that NS genetic diversity contributes to AIV pathogenesis. To determine the impact of NS1 variants on viral infection dynamics we established a reverse genetics system with the genetic backbone of the enzootic Taiwanese H6N1 for generation of reassortant AIVs carrying exogenous NS segments of three different Taiwanese H5N2 strains. We observed distinct cellular distributions of NS1 among the reassortant viruses. Moreover exchange of the NS segment significantly influenced growth kinetics and induction of cytokines [IFN-α IFN-β and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)] in an NS1- and host-specific manner. The impact of NS1 variants on viral replication appears related to their synergic effects on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and IFN response. With these approaches we revealed that NS1 is a key factor responsible for the diverse characteristics of AIVs in Taiwan.  ,

However there is a lack of real-time nationally representative data on hospital admissions for complications of influenza. Anecdotal information about hospital capacity problems during influenza epidemics can therefore not be substantiated.       Objective   The aim of this study was to assess whether media reports could provide relevant information for estimating the impact of influenza on hospital capacity in the absence of hospital surveillance data.       Methods   Dutch news articles on influenza in hospitals during the influenza season (week 40 of 2017 until week 20 of 2018) were searched in a Web-based media monitoring program (Coosto). Trends in the number of weekly articles were compared with trends in 5 different influenza surveillance systems. A content analysis was performed on a selection of news articles and information on the hospital department problem and preventive or response measures was collected.       Results   The trend in weekly news articles correlated significantly with the trends in all 5 surveillance systems including severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) surveillance. However the peak in all 5 surveillance systems preceded the peak in news articles. Content analysis showed hospitals (N=69) had major capacity problems (46/69 67%) resulting in admission stops (9/46 20%) postponement of nonurgent surgical procedures (29/46 63%) or both (8/46 17%). Only few hospitals reported the use of point-of-care testing (5/69 7%) or a separate influenza ward (3/69 4%) to accelerate clinical management but most resorted to ad hoc crisis management (34/69 49%).       Conclusions   Media reports showed that the 2017/2018 influenza epidemic caused serious problems in hospitals throughout the country. However because of the time lag in media reporting it is not a suitable alternative for near real-time SARI surveillance. A robust SARI surveillance program is important to inform decision making.    ,
PMC7081911,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\147_19_abstract.xml,   The mosquito-borne La Crosse virus (LACV; genus    Orthobunyavirus family    Peribunyaviridae order    Bunyavirales) is prevalent in the United States and can cause severe childhood meningoencephalitis. Its main virulence factor the nonstructural protein NSs is a strong inhibitor of the antiviral type I interferon (IFN) system. NSs acts by imposing a global host mRNA synthesis shutoff mediated by NSs-driven proteasomal degradation of the RPB1 subunit of RNA polymerase II. Here we show that RPB1 degradation commences as early as 1 h postinfection and identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Elongin C (and its binding partners Elongins A and B) as an NSs cofactor involved in RPB1 degradation and in suppression of global as well as IFN-related mRNA synthesis.    ,
PMC7081911,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\148_20_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Mosquito-borne La Crosse virus (LACV; genus    Orthobunyavirus family    Peribunyaviridae order    Bunyavirales) causes up to 100 annual cases of severe meningoencephalitis in children and young adults in the United States. A major virulence factor of LACV is the nonstructural protein NSs which inhibits host cell mRNA synthesis to prevent the induction of antiviral type I interferons (IFN-α/β). To achieve this host transcriptional shutoff LACV NSs drives the proteasomal degradation of RPB1 the large subunit of mammalian RNA polymerase II. Here we show that NSs acts in a surprisingly rapid manner as RPB1 degradation was commencing already at 1 h postinfection. The RPB1 degradation was partially dependent on the cellular E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Elongin C. Consequently removal of Elongin C but also of the subunits Elongin A or B by siRNA transfection partially rescued general RNAP II transcription and IFN-beta mRNA synthesis from the blockade by NSs. In line with these results LACV NSs was found to trigger the redistribution of Elongin C out of nucleolar speckles which however is an epiphenomenon rather than part of the NSs mechanism. Our study also shows that the molecular phenotype of LACV NSs is different from RNA polymerase II inhibitors like α-amanitin or Rift Valley fever virus NSs indicating that LACV is unique in involving the Elongin complex to shut off host transcription and IFN response.       IMPORTANCE The mosquito-borne La Crosse virus (LACV; genus    Orthobunyavirus family    Peribunyaviridae order    Bunyavirales) is prevalent in the United States and can cause severe childhood meningoencephalitis.

PMC7083705,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\149_21_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Environmental sources of infection can play a primary role in shaping epidemiological dynamics; however the relative impact of environmental transmission on host‐pathogen systems is rarely estimated. We developed and fit a spatially explicit model of African swine fever virus (ASFV) in wild boar to estimate what proportion of carcass‐based transmission is contributing to the low‐level persistence of ASFV in Eastern European wild boar. Our model was developed based on ecological insight and data from field studies of ASFV and wild boar in Eastern Poland. We predicted that carcass‐based transmission would play a substantial role in persistence especially in low‐density host populations where contact rates are low. By fitting the model to outbreak data using approximate Bayesian computation we inferred that between 53% and 66% of transmission events were carcass‐based that is transmitted through contact of a live host with a contaminated carcass. Model fitting and sensitivity analyses showed that the frequency of carcass‐based transmission increased with decreasing host density suggesting that management policies should emphasize the removal of carcasses and consider how reductions in host densities may drive carcass‐based transmission. Sensitivity analyses also demonstrated that carcass‐based transmission is necessary for the autonomous persistence of ASFV under realistic parameters. Autonomous persistence through direct transmission alone required high host densities; otherwise re‐introduction of virus periodically was required for persistence when direct transmission probabilities were moderately high. We quantify the relative role of different persistence mechanisms for a low‐prevalence disease using readily collected ecological data and viral surveillance data. Understanding how the frequency of different transmission mechanisms vary across host densities can help identify optimal management strategies across changing ecological conditions.  ,

In this manuscript we developed and fit a spatially explicit mechanistic epidemiological model to spatio‐temporal disease surveillance data using approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) to estimate the relative role of carcass‐based transmission in ASF virus persistence and spatial spread. We inferred that 53%‐66% of ASF virus transmission events occurred through the contact of susceptible hosts with dead carcasses and we found that the relative importance of transmission mechanisms depended critically on host density.              ,
PMC7083784,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\151_16_abstract.xml,      Background   Outbreaks of infectious diseases are the major concern after flooding. Flood makes people displacement which would be more complicated with inadequate sanitation. Settling in crowded shelters in absence of clean water and inaccessibility to health care services makes people more vulnerable to get infection. This review aimed to discuss about potential undesirable outcomes of flooding occurred in 2019 in Iran.       Methods   A comprehensive search was carried out in databases including PubMed Google scholar Scopus Science Direct Iran medex Magiran and SID (Scientific information database) from 2000 to 2019. All original descriptive articles on flood were concerned. Related articles on flood disturbance were considered. Also publication of red cross society was considered as only reliable reference in evaluation of consequences of flood occurred in 2019 in Iran.       Results   Flooding in Iran was started in March 2019 and lasted to April 2019. Flood affected 31 provinces and 140 rivers burst their banks and southwestern Iran being hit most severely. According the reports of international federation of red cross society 3800 cities and villages were affected by the floods with 65000 destroyed houses and 114000 houses partially damaged. Also 70 hospitals or health care centers with 1200 schools were damaged along with many infrastructures including 159 main roads and 700 bridges.       Conclusions   Considering 365000 displaced persons and estimation of mentioned damages it was one of the greatest natural disaster during the last 20 years. Various risk factors in favor of infectious diseases such as overcrowding disruption of sewage disposal poor standards of hygiene poor nutrition negligible sanitation and human contact among refugees provide suitable conditions for increased incidence of infectious diseases after flooding and also cause epidemics.   More attention is needed to provide hygienic situation for people after natural disasters including flood.    ,
PMC7084951,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\152_18_abstract.xml,   Mumps is an important childhood infectious disease caused by mumps virus (MuV). We reviewed the epidemiology pathogenesis and vaccine development of mumps. Previous studies were identified using the key words “mumps” and “epidemiology” “pathogenesis” or “vaccine” in MEDLINE PubMed Embase Web of Science and Google Scholar. We excluded the articles that were not published in the English language manuscripts without abstracts and opinion articles from the review. The number of cases caused by MuV decreased steeply after the introduction of the mumps vaccine worldwide. In recent years a global resurgence of mumps cases in developed countries and cases of aseptic meningitis caused by some mumps vaccine strains have renewed the importance of MuV infection worldwide. The performance of mumps vaccination has become an important issue for controlling mumps infections. Vaccine development and routine vaccination are still effective measures to globally reduce the incidence of mumps infections. During outbreaks a third of MMR vaccine is recommended for groups of persons determined by public authorities.  ,

The timing of and the potential IAVs involved in the next pandemic are currently unpredictable. We aim to build machine learning (ML) models to predict human-adaptive IAV nucleotide composition. A total of 217549 IAV full-length coding sequences of the PB2 (polymerase basic protein-2) PB1 PA (polymerase acidic protein) HA (hemagglutinin) NP (nucleoprotein) and NA (neuraminidase) segments were decomposed for their codon position-based mononucleotides (12 nts) and dinucleotides (48 dnts). A total of 68742 human sequences and 68739 avian sequences (1:1) were resampled to characterize the human adaptation-associated (d)nts with principal component analysis (PCA) and other ML models. Then the human adaptation of IAV sequences was predicted based on the characterized (d)nts. Respectively 9 12 11 13 10 and 9 human-adaptive (d)nts were optimized for the six segments. PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis revealed the linear separability of the optimized (d)nts between the human-adaptive and avian-adaptive sets. The results of the confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve indicated a high performance of the ML models to predict human adaptation of IAVs. Our model performed well in predicting the human adaptation of the swine/avian IAVs before and after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. In conclusion we identified the human adaptation-associated genomic composition of IAV segments. ML models for IAV human adaptation prediction using large IAV genomic data sets can facilitate the identification of key viral factors that affect virus transmission/pathogenicity. Most importantly it allows the prediction of pandemic influenza.  ,
PMC7086318,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\154_15_abstract.xml,   A 42-year-old man was hospitalized due to a fever orchiodynia and extremely severe myalgia predominantly in the extremities which made it difficult for him to stand or walk. He had a history of contact with his son who had acute upper respiratory infection. Based on the characteristic clinical symptoms and detection of the partial sequence of human parechovirus type 3 (HPeV3) in throat swabs as well as stool and serum samples he was diagnosed with epidemic myalgia associated with HPeV3 infection. Because HPeV3 infection is widespread among children in Japan HPeV3-associated myalgia should be considered when adult patients manifest such distinguishing clinical characteristics.   ,
PMC7089401,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\155_21_abstract.xml,   Flaviviruses such as yellow fever dengue or Zika viruses are responsible for significant human and veterinary diseases worldwide. These viruses contain an RNA genome prone to mutations which enhances their potential to emerge as pathogens. Bamaga virus (BgV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus in the yellow fever virus group that we have previously shown to be host-restricted in vertebrates and horizontally transmissible by    Culex mosquitoes. Here we aimed to characterise BgV host-restriction and to investigate the mechanisms involved. We showed that BgV could not replicate in a wide range of vertebrate cell lines and animal species. We determined that the mechanisms involved in BgV host-restriction were independent of the type-1 interferon response and RNAse L activity. Using a BgV infectious clone and two chimeric viruses generated as hybrids between BgV and West Nile virus we demonstrated that BgV host-restriction occurred post-cell entry. Notably BgV host-restriction was shown to be temperature-dependent as BgV replicated in all vertebrate cell lines at 34°C but only in a subset at 37°C. Serial passaging of BgV in Vero cells resulted in adaptive mutants capable of efficient replication at 37°C. The identified mutations resulted in amino acid substitutions in NS4A-S124F NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C all occurring close to a viral protease cleavage site (NS4A/2K and NS4B/NS5). These mutations were reverse engineered into infectious clones of BgV which revealed that NS4B-N244K and NS5-G2C were sufficient to restore BgV replication in vertebrate cells at 37°C while NS4A-S124F further increased replication efficiency. When these mutant viruses were injected into immunocompetent mice alongside BgV and West Nile virus chimeras infection and neurovirulence were enhanced as determined by clinical scores seroconversion micro-neutralisation viremia histopathology and immunohistochemistry confirming the involvement of these residues in the attenuation of BgV. Our studies identify a new mechanism of host-restriction and attenuation of a mosquito-borne flavivirus.    ,
PMC7089401,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\156_22_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Mosquito-borne pathogens include flaviviruses such as yellow fever virus dengue virus and Zika virus which continue to cause disease worldwide. Some of these flaviviruses have only recently emerged as major human pathogens despite having been discovered decades ago. Determining the mechanisms of host-restriction of viruses with cryptic ecological niches will help us to understand how new viral diseases may emerge. In this study we investigated the host-restriction of a recently discovered flavivirus Bamaga virus. We demonstrated that the virus host-restriction observed in vertebrate cells only occurs at 37°C and that the virus can replicate efficiently at lower temperatures. We identified three amino acid substitutions located at two viral protease cleavage sites which we have demonstrated are directly involved in BgV host-restriction    in vitro and attenuation    in vivo. Overall our data provide new insight into mechanisms flavivirus attenuation and host-restriction in vertebrates.    ,
PMC7089562,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\157_22_abstract.xml,   Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic arbovirus that causes severe disease in humans and ruminants. The infection is characterized by abortions in pregnant animals high mortality in neonates as well as febrile illness in humans that develop in 1% of cases encephalitis or hemorrhagic fever. There is presently no specific antiviral treatment for RVFV infection available. In this study two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against glycoprotein Gn were applied in a therapeutic study. Treatment of RVFV infected mice with neutralizing mAb Gn3 alone at two different time points (30 minutes before or 30 minutes after virus challenge) showed only moderate efficacy of about 58.3% survival in both applications. However a combination therapy together with non-neutralizing mAb Gn32 demonstrated complete protection (100% survival) when applied 30 minutes after the lethal challenge dose. The increase of mAb efficacy is probably based on cooperative neutralization effects. These data suggest that a combination therapy with mAbs Gn3 and Gn32 could be an effective treatment option against RVFV infection.  ,
PMC7089562,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\158_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Rift Valley fever virus represents an acute viral disease affecting animals especially livestock and humans and is responsible for widespread outbreaks throughout Africa and on the Arabian Peninsula. The virus causes abortions and high mortality especially in young animals whereas the symptoms in humans range from mild flu-like illness to    severe hemorrhagic manifestations that    can be    lethal. So far no antiviral therapeutics for animals nor humans were available yet. Therefore we evaluated two monoclonal antibodies—one neutralizing and one non-neutralizing—in a mouse model for therapeutic treatment against Rift Valley fever. We selected these antibodies since they exhibited cooperative effects    in vitro. During Rift Valley fever virus infection in mice the applied neutralizing antibody alone showed only partial protection. In contrast a combined application with both antibodies lead to a complete protection in one treatment group (100% survival). A detailed pathological and molecular analysis clearly indicated a strong reduction of virus replication in target tissues of treated mice. Taken together these results identified two monoclonal antibodies with strong antiviral effects against Rift Valley fever infection    which are promising candidates for therapeutic interventions against RVFV.    ,
PMC7092378,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\159_14_abstract.xml,   The constantly changing pattern in the dominance of viral strains and their evolving subclades during the seasons substantially influences influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE). In order to further substantiate the importance of detailed data of genetic virus characterization for IVE estimates during the seasons we performed influenza virus type and subtype specific IVE estimates. IVE estimates were assessed using a test-negative case-control design in the context of the intraseasonal changes of the heterogeneous mix of circulating influenza virus strains for three influenza seasons (2016/17 to 2018/19) in Austria. Adjusted overall IVE over the three seasons 2016/17 2017/18 and 2018/19 were −26 39 and 63% respectively. In accordance with the changing pattern of the circulating strains a broad range of overall and subtype specific IVEs was obtained: A(H3N2) specific IVE ranged between −26% for season 2016/17 to 58% in season 2018/19 A(H1N1)pdm09 specific IVE was 25% for the season 2017/18 and 65% for the season 2018/19 and Influenza B specific IVE for season 2017/18 was 45%. The results obtained in our study over the three seasons demonstrate the increasingly complex dynamic of the ever changing genetic pattern of the circulating influenza viruses and their influence on IVE estimates. This emphasizes the importance of detailed genetic virus surveillance for reliable IVE estimates.  ,

Syndromes of infected people range from asymptomatic infections to severe neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET) an alkaloid isolated from    Cephalotaxus drupacea was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity    in vitro (i.e. in Vero and A549 cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression inhibit ZIKV replication and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1–4 (DENV1-4). Taken together our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-   Flavivirus medications.    ,

PMC7093544,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\162_13_abstract.xml,   Mayaro virus (MAYV) is endemic in South American countries where it is responsible for sporadic outbreaks of acute febrile illness. The hallmark of MAYV infection is a highly debilitating and chronic arthralgia. Although MAYV emergence is a potential threat there are no specific therapies or licensed vaccine. In this study we developed a murine model of MAYV infection that emulates many of the most relevant clinical features of the infection in humans and tested a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate (MAYV/IRES). Intraplantar inoculation of a WT strain of MAYV into immunocompetent mice induced persistent hypernociception transient viral replication in target organs systemic production of inflammatory cytokines chemokines and specific humoral IgM and IgG responses. Inoculation of MAYV/IRES in BALB/c mice induced strong specific cellular and humoral responses. Moreover MAYV/IRES vaccination of immunocompetent and interferon receptor-defective mice resulted in protection from disease induced by the virulent wt MAYV strain. Thus this study describes a novel model of MAYV infection in immunocompetent mice and highlights the potential role of a live-attenuated MAYV vaccine candidate in host’s protection from disease induced by a virulent MAYV strain.  ,
PMC7094151,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\163_14_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis accounting for up to 75% of all conjunctivitis cases and affecting people of all ages and demographics. In addition to ocular complications it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis respiratory disease and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis and as such solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated both systemically and locally to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI) immunoglobulin-based therapy anti-inflammatory therapy and immunotherapy. More recently combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs cold atmospheric plasma N-chlorotaurine and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV pose a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.  ,

PMC7096110,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\165_14_abstract.xml,      Objective:   The study aimed to explore the seroprevalence of some bacterial (    Brucella spp.     Chlamydia abortus) and viral [Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV)] zoonoses in domestic ruminants in Medina.          Materials and Methods:   A total of 1000 blood samples from 665 sheep 228 goats and 107 camels were collected from the central slaughterhouse private farms and veterinary clinics affiliated to the Ministry of Agriculture. The samples were screened using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results were statistically analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.       Results:   Brucella was found in 7.7% 8.8% and 6.5% of sheep goats and camel’s sera respectively. In humans     Brucella abortus and     Brucella melitensis had higher frequencies in males (61.3% 59.8%) than in females (38.7% 40.2%).     Chlamydia abortus was reported only in sheep at a rate of 0.75%. RVFV was prevalent in sheep (10.7%) and goats (17.9%). FMDV was reported in 27.8% of sheep and 7.9% of goats. There was a highly statistical significance between Brucella RVFV and FMDV seropositivity and locally bred animals (    p &lt; 0.01). Multiple seropositivities have been reported among sheep and goats. Brucella was commonly observed in mixed infection with other bacterial and viral agents under study.          Conclusion:   The surveyed viral and bacterial agents were prevalent in ruminants in the Medina region. Since Medina is an important destination for pilgrims from all over the world therefore an integrated approach involving strict control measures and routine vaccination programs should be adopted to reduce the possibility of global epidemics.    ,

The use of phylogenetics and phylodynamics approaches has provided important insights to track the founder events that resulted in the spread of HIV-1 strains across vast geographic areas specific countries and within geographically restricted communities. In the recent years the use of phylogenetic analysis combined with the huge availability of HIV sequences has become an increasingly important approach to reconstruct HIV transmission networks and understand transmission dynamics in concentrated and generalised epidemics. Significant efforts to obtain viral sequences from newly HIV-infected individuals could certainly contribute to detect rapidly expanding HIV-1 lineages identify key populations at high-risk and understand what public health interventions should be prioritised in different scenarios.  ,

Cardiac injury was defined according to cardiac biomarkers electrocardiography or echocardiography. Among the 321 patients 203 (63.2%) showed evidence of cardiac injury. Compared with the uninjured group the cardiac injury group had lower Pa    o    2/F    io    2 (median 102.0 vs 148.4 mm Hg;     p &lt; 0.001) higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score (median 17.0 vs 11.0;     p &lt; 0.001) longer stay in the ICU (10.0 vs 9.0 d;     p = 0.029) and higher proportion of in-hospital death (64.0% vs 20.3%;     p &lt; 0.001). The proportion of virus clearance until discharge or death was lower in the cardiac injury group than in the uninjured group (58.6% vs 86.4%;     p &lt; 0.001). Multivariable-adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that cardiac injury was associated with higher mortality (hazards ratio 2.06; 95% CI 1.31–3.24) during hospitalization.          Conclusions:   Cardiac injury is a frequent condition among hospitalized patients infected with influenza A (H7N9) virus and it is associated with higher risk of mortality.    ,
PMC7098647,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\169_19_abstract.xml,   Estimation of pathogenic life-history values for instance the duration a pathogen is retained in an insect vector (i.e. retention period) is of particular importance for understanding plant disease epidemiology. How can we extract values for these epidemiological parameters from conventional small-scale laboratory experiments in which transmission success is measured in relation to durations of vector access to host plants? We provide a solution to this problem by deriving formulae for the empirical curves that these experiments produce called access period response curves (i.e. transmission success vs access period). We do this by writing simple equations for the fundamental life-cycle components of insect vectors in the laboratory. We then infer values of epidemiological parameters by matching the theoretical and empirical gradients of access period response curves. Using the example of    Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) which has emerged in sub-Saharan Africa and now threatens regional food security we illustrate the method of matching gradients. We show how applying the method to published data produces a new understanding of CBSV through the inference of retention period acquisition period and inoculation period parameters. We found that CBSV is retained for a far shorter duration in its insect vector (   Bemisia tabaci whitefly) than had previously been assumed. Our results shed light on a number of critical factors that may be responsible for the transition of CBSV from sub- to super-threshold    R   0 in sub-Saharan Africa. The method is applicable to plant pathogens in general to supply epidemiological parameter estimates that are crucial for practical management of epidemics and prediction of pandemic risk.    ,
PMC7098647,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\170_20_abstract.xml,   Author summary     Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) which was confined to coastal East Africa and the shores of Lake Malawi has rapidly expanded its geographic range and now threatens regional food security. A recent laboratory experiment in which vector access to plants infected with CBSV is varied has provided plausible ranges for epidemiological parameters such as pathogen retention period (i.e. the duration that the pathogen is retained by the vector). In this work we introduce a new computational and mathematical framework for estimating epidemiological parameter values instead of plausible ranges from experiments in vector access to host plants. Since long distance carriage of insect vectors occurs within atmospheric air flows the duration that the vector retains the pathogen (i.e. retention period) indirectly limits the scale of epidemics. Using our methods we found that CBSV is retained for a far shorter duration than had previously been assumed. Our methods can be applied to the many experiments in vector access to host plants that have been conducted for numerous arthropod-transmitted plant pathogens across a range of genera. The ensuing epidemiological parameter estimates can be used in landscape computer simulations to predict epidemic risk and the prospects for control.    ,

During the last decade considerable attention has been paid to influenza virus infections in dogs as two canine H3N8 and H3N2 subtypes caused several outbreaks through the United States and Southern Asia becoming endemic. Cats even though less documented in the literature still appear to be susceptible to many avian influenza infections. While influenza epidemics pose a threat to canine and feline health the risks to humans are largely unknown. Here we review most recent knowledge of the epidemiology of influenza A viruses in dogs and cats existing evidences for the abilities of these species to host sustain intraspecific transmission and generate novel flu A lineages through genomic reassortment. Such enhanced understanding suggests a need to reinforce surveillance of the role played by companion animals-human interface in light of the “One Health” concept and the potential emergence of novel zoonotic viruses.  ,
PMC7099755,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\172_20_abstract.xml,   Abstract  Influenza and pneumonia can be prevented by vaccination but they remain major causes of morbidity and mortality in age‐related diseases. In most areas of China the rates of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination are relatively low and public awareness of vaccination remains insufficient. Thus it is essential to recommend influenza and    Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccination to elderly people in clinical practice. Based on recently published studies and related documents issued by several vaccination authorities such as the World Health Organization the National Health and Wellness Committee the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices we propose official recommendations for influenza and    S pneumoniae vaccination in elderly people in China.    ,
PMC7100368,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\173_16_abstract.xml,   Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are two mosquito-borne flaviviruses afflicting nearly half of the world population. Human infection by these viruses can either be asymptomatic or manifest as clinical diseases from mild to severe. Despite more cases are presented as self-limiting febrile illness severe dengue disease can be manifested as hemorrhagic fever and hemorrhagic shock syndrome and ZIKV infection has been linked to increased incidence of peripheral neuropathy Guillain-Barre syndrome and central neural disease such as microcephaly. The current prevention and treatment of these infectious diseases are either non-satisfactory or entirely lacking. Because DENV and ZIKV have much similarities in genomic and structural features almost identical mode of mosquito-mediated transmission and probably the same pattern of host innate and adaptive immunity toward them it is reasonable and often desirable to investigate these two viruses side-by-side and thereby devise common countermeasures against both. Here we review the existing knowledge on DENV and ZIKV regarding epidemiology molecular virology protective immunity and vaccine development discuss recent new discoveries on the functions of flavivirus NS1 protein in viral pathogenesis and transmission and propose a one-two punch strategy using vaccine and vector blockade to overcome antibody-dependent enhancement and defeat Dengue and Zika viruses.  ,
PMC7100926,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\174_27_abstract.xml,   The HIV-1 epidemic in Brazil has been growing in northeast and north regions particularly an increase in AIDS cases among the younger male population has been observed. This study aims to characterize the HIV-1 genetic diversity and to evaluate its antiretroviral resistance profile among individuals presenting virological failure in the state of Maranhão—Brazil. HIV-1    pol gene sequences from 633 patients on antiretroviral therapy were obtained from the Department of Surveillance Prevention and Control of Sexually Transmitted Infections HIV/AIDS and Viral Hepatitis of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Phylogenetic and recombination analyses were performed to characterize viral genetic diversity. The presence of antiretroviral resistance mutations was assessed using the HIV Drug Resistance Database online platform of Stanford University. A predominance of subtype B (84.5%) was observed followed by recombinant BF (9.5%) where more than half of the sequences were dispersed in 3 clusters. Antiretroviral resistance was detected in 74.1% of the sequences and it was significantly higher for nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) than for non-nucleoside analogue reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) and protease inhibitors (PIs). Inference of putative transmissions clusters identified 11 clusters with 22 query sequences (22/633 3.5%). Thus we conclude that continuous monitoring of the molecular epidemiology of HIV-1 is essential for prevention strategies epidemic control and treatment adequacy.    ,
PMC7100975,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\175_29_abstract.xml,      Background   The chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging alphavirus that can cause chronic and potentially incapacitating rheumatic musculoskeletal disorders known as chronic chikungunya arthritis (CCA). We conducted a prospective cohort study of CHIKV-infected subjects during the 2013 chikungunya outbreak in Martinique. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of CCA at 12 months and to search for acute phase factors significantly associated with chronicity.       Methodology/Principal findings   A total of 193 patients who tested positive for CHIKV RNA via qRT-PCR underwent clinical investigations in the acute phase (&lt;21 days) and then 3 6 and 12 months after inclusion. The Asian lineage was identified as the circulating genotype. A total of 167 participants were classified as either with or without CCA and were analyzed using logistic regression models. The overall prevalence of CCA at 12 months was 52.1% (95%CI: 44.5–59.7). In univariate analysis age (RD 9.62 95% CI 4.87;14.38 p&lt;0.0001) female sex (RD 15.5 95% CI 1.03;30.0 p = 0.04) headache (RD 15.42 95% CI 0.65;30.18 p = 0.04) vertigo (RD 15.33 95% CI 1.47;29.19 p = 0.03) vomiting (RD 12.89 95% CI 1.54;24.24 p = 0.03) dyspnea (RD 13.53 95% CI 0.73;26.33 p = 0.04) intravenous rehydration (RD -16.12 95% CI -31.58; -0.66 p = 0.04) and urea (RD 0.66 95% CI 0.12;1.20 p = 0.02) were significantly associated with the development of CCA. For the subpopulation with data on joint involvement in the acute phase the risk factors significantly associated with CCA were at least one 1 enthesitis (RD 16.7 95%CI 2.8; 30.7 p = 0.02) and at least one tenosynovitis (RD 16.8 95% CI 1.4–32.2 p = 0.04).       Conclusions   This cohort study conducted in Martinique confirms that CCA is a common complication of acute chikungunya disease. Our analysis emphasized the importance of age and female sex for CCA occurrence and highlighted the aggravating role of dehydration during the acute phase. Early and adequate hydration were found to reduce the risk chronic chikungunya disorders.       Trial registration   clinicaltrials.gov (    NCT01099852).       ,
PMC7100975,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\176_30_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Chikungunya is a tropical mosquito-borne virus that has been re-emerging in the last decade. It has caused major epidemics in recent years including in Reunion Island and in Southeast Asia. Nearly 2.5 billion people around the world are at risk of contracting the virus. In the acute phase of the illness patients experience a flu-like syndrome with fever headache myalgia rash and severe arthralgia. These symptoms can persist for several months in some patients and can lead to significant functional disability. During the 2013 epidemic in Martinique we followed nearly 200 patients who had contracted chikungunya. More than half of the patients had a chronic form of the disease—mainly women over 50 years of age. Our statistical analyses indicate that poor hydration in the acute phase is a risk factor for developing chronic rheumatism. This suggests that in the context of a chikungunya epidemic patients should drink plenty of fluids as soon as the first symptoms appear.  ,

Among 861 arbovirus infections 845 were monoinfections (456 [53%] dengue 280 [32.5%] chikungunya 109 [12.7%] Zika) and 16 (1.8%) were co-infections. Most patients were travelers (56.3%) or immigrants returning to Spain after visiting friends or relatives (31.3%). Median patient age was 37 years; most (62.3%) were women and some (28.6%) had received pretravel advice. Only 12 patients were immunosuppressed. Six cases (all dengue monoinfections none in immunosuppressed patients) were severe. Since 2014 nondengue arbovirus infections increased; until 2016 chikungunya and Zika were most common. Imported arbovirus infections (mostly dengue) were frequently diagnosed although increased chikungunya and Zika virus infections coincided with their introduction and spread in the Americas. A large proportion of cases occurred in women of childbearing age some despite receipt of pretravel advice.  ,
PMC7101119,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\178_13_abstract.xml,   Zika virus is transitioning to become a long-term public health challenge and countries should remain informed of the risk for emergence. We developed a stochastic epidemiologic model to profile risk for Zika virus emergence including trimester-specific fetal risk across time in all 3208 counties in the United States including Puerto Rico. Validation against known transmission in North America demonstrated accuracy to predict epidemic dynamics and absolute case counts across scales (R   2 = 0.98). We found that although sporadic single transmission events could occur in most US counties outbreaks will likely be restricted to the Gulf Coast region and to late spring through autumn. Seasonal fluctuations in birth rates will confer natural population-level protection against early-trimester infections. Overall outbreak control will be more effective and efficient than prevention and vaccination will be most effective at &gt;70% coverage. Our county-level risk profiles should serve as a critical resource for resource allocation.    ,

PMC7102570,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\180_15_abstract.xml,   Favipiravir has been developed as an anti-influenza drug and licensed as an anti-influenza drug in Japan. Additionally favipiravir is being stockpiled for 2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus Lassa virus rabies and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important therapeutic agent for severe influenza the next pandemic influenza strain and other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not available.  ,
PMC7102739,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\181_16_abstract.xml,   Influenza causes significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Owing to its ability to rapidly evolve and spread the influenza virus is of global public health importance. Information on the burden seasonality and risk factors of influenza in countries of the World Health Organization Eastern Mediterranean Region is emerging because of collaborative efforts between countries WHO and its partners over the past 10 years. The fourth meeting of the Eastern Mediterranean Acute Respiratory Infection Surveillance network was held in Amman Jordan on 11–14 December 2017. The meeting reviewed the progress and achievements reported by the countries in the areas of surveillance of and response to seasonal zoonotic and pandemic influenza. The first scientific conference on acute respiratory infection in the Eastern Mediterranean Region was held at the same time and 38 abstracts from young researchers across the Region were presented on epidemiological and virological surveillance outbreak detection and response influenza at the animal-human interface use and efficacy of new vaccines to control respiratory diseases and pandemic influenza threats. The meeting identified a number of challenges and ways to improve the quality of the surveillance system for influenza sustain the system so as to address pandemic threats and use the data generated from the surveillance system to inform decision-making policies and practices to reduce the burden of influenza-associated illnesses in the Region.  ,
PMC7102740,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\182_16_abstract.xml,      Background   Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are a leading cause of mortality worldwide. We compared the epidemiology and severity of RVI in Ecuador during 2009–2016.       Methods   Respiratory specimens collected within the national surveillance system were tested for influenza viruses respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) adenovirus parainfluenza virus and human metapneumovirus. Overall and virus-specific positive detection rate (PDR) were calculated and compared the timing of epidemics caused by the different viruses. Logistic regression models were used to compare the age distribution and risk of death across respiratory viruses.       Results   A total of 41172 specimens were analyzed: influenza (PDR = 14.3%) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (PDR = 9.5%) were the most frequently detected viruses. Influenza epidemics typically peaked in December–January and RSV epidemics in March; seasonality was less evident for the other viruses. Compared to adults children were more frequently infected with RSV adenovirus parainfluenza and influenza B while the elderly were less frequently infected with influenza A(H1N1)p. The age-adjusted risk of death was highest for A(H1N1)p (odds ratio [OR] 1.73 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.38–2.17) and lowest for RSV (OR 0.75 95%CI 0.57–0.98).       Conclusions   Whilst influenza and RSV were the most frequently detected pathogens the risk of death differed by RVI being highest for pandemic influenza and lowest for RSV.    ,

PMC7102768,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\184_14_abstract.xml,   Parallel molecular evolution is the independent evolution of the same genotype or phenotype from distinct ancestors. The simple genomes and rapid evolution of many viruses mean they are useful model systems for studying parallel evolution by natural selection. Parallel adaptation occurs in the context of several viral behaviours including cross-species transmission drug resistance and host immune escape and its existence suggests that at least some aspects of virus evolution and emergence are repeatable and predictable. We introduce examples of virus parallel evolution and summarise key concepts. We outline the difficulties in detecting parallel adaptation using virus genomes with a particular focus on phylogenetic and structural approaches and we discuss future approaches that may improve our understanding of the phenomenon.  ,
PMC7105047,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\185_16_abstract.xml,      Background   Acute respiratory tract infections are commonly caused by viruses in children. The differences in clinical data and outcome between single and multiple viral infections in hospitalized children were analyzed.       Methods   We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of hospitalized children who had fever and a xTAG Respiratory Virus Panel (RVP) test over a 2-year period. The clinical data were analyzed and compared between single and multiple viral infections. Viral etiologies in upper and lower respiratory infections were analyzed and compared.       Results   A total of 442 patients were enrolled. Patients with positive viral detection (N = 311) had a significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p = 0.03) less evidence of bacterial infection (p = 0.004) and shorter duration of hospitalization (p = 0.019) than those with negative viral detection. The age of patients with multiple viral infections was younger than those with single viral infection; however there were no significant differences in duration of fever antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between these two groups.   The most commonly identified virus was human rhinovirus. About 27% (n = 83) of patients had multiple viral infections. Overall the highest percentage of human bocavirus infection was detected in multiple viral infections (79%). Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) was independently associated with multiple viral infections (p = 0.022) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection (p = 0.001) and longer hospitalization duration (p = 0.011).       Conclusion   Multiple viral infections were associated with younger age and a higher risk of developing LRTI. However multiple viral infections did not predict a worse disease outcome. More studies are needed to unveil the interplay between the hosts and different viruses in multiple viral infections.    ,

We analyzed surveillance data on hospitalized laboratory-confirmed influenza cases admitted to intensive care units to identify common determinants for fatal outcome and inform and target public health prevention strategies including risk communication.       Methods   We performed a descriptive analysis and used Poisson regression models with robust variance to estimate the association of age sex virus (sub)type and underlying medical condition with fatal outcome using European Union data from 2009 to 2017.       Results   Of 13 368 cases included in the basic dataset 2806 (21%) were fatal. Age ≥40 years and infection with influenza A virus were associated with fatal outcome. Of 5886 cases with known underlying medical conditions and virus A subtype included in a more detailed analysis 1349 (23%) were fatal. Influenza virus A(H1N1)pdm09 or A(H3N2) infection age ≥60 years cancer human immunodeficiency virus infection and/or other immune deficiency and heart kidney and liver disease were associated with fatal outcome; the risk of death was lower for patients with chronic lung disease and for pregnant women.       Conclusions   This study re-emphasises the importance of preventing influenza in the elderly and tailoring strategies to risk groups with underlying medical conditions.    ,
PMC7105594,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\187_18_abstract.xml,   Low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) virus of subtype H9N2 is the most frequently detected subtype among domestic poultry and is a public health concern because of its zoonotic potential. Due to the multiple and complex routes of LPAIV H9N2 between geographic regions little is known about the spatial diffusion of H9N2 virus to within and from Egypt where it is endemic among poultry since 2011. Using close to 800 publicly available hemagglutinin (HA) segment nucleotide sequences associated location and temporal data we conducted a Bayesian discrete phylogeographic analysis. Here we reconstructed and traced the origin spread and principal transmission routes of H9N2 across large geographical regions in addition to the transmission between Egypt and the rest of the world and between different Egyptian governorates. Our analysis suggests that during the last few decades H9N2 has been introduced back and forth continuously between the countries where it is endemic. Amongst these regions Saudi Arabia United Arab Emirates and Iraq act as main distribution hubs and drive the viral migration worldwide with bi-directional and long-distance diffusions. It is noteworthy that H9N2 was introduced once to Egypt via Israel in mid 2009 and that the descendants of the Egyptian LAIVs H9N2 were back-transmitted to Israel in 2015. Additionally governorates in middle Egypt (Giza Fayoum and Bani Souwaif) are major hubs in the LPAIV H9N2 transmission network in Egypt. This knowledge highlights that H9N2 is both a global and a national concern and can aid in updating the surveillance program and vaccine strain selection.  ,
PMC7106000,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\188_15_abstract.xml,   Abstract  African swine fever (ASF) is an acute viral haemorrhagic disease of pigs and wild boars. It presents a serious threat to pig production worldwide and since 2007 ASF outbreaks have been recorded in the Caucasus Eastern Europe and the Baltic States. In 2014 the disease was detected in Poland. ASF is on the list of notifiable diseases of the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Due to the lack of an available vaccine and treatment the countermeasures against the disease consist in early detection of the virus in the pig population and control of its spread through the elimination of herds affected by disease outbreaks. Knowledge of the potential vectors of the virus and its persistence in the environment is crucial to prevent further disease spread and to understand the new epidemiology for how it compares to the previous experience in Spain gathered in the 1970s and 1980s.  ,
PMC7106143,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\189_15_abstract.xml,      Objectives   Virus infection is underevaluated in older adults with severe acute respiratory infections (SARIs). We aimed to evaluate the clinical impact of combining point-of-care molecular viral test and serum procalcitonin (PCT) level for antibiotic stewardship in the emergency department (ED).       Design   A prospective twin-center cohort study was conducted between January 2017 and March 2018.       Setting and Participants   Older adult patients who presented to the ED with SARIs received a rapid molecular test for 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test.       Measures   To evaluate the clinical impact we compared the outcomes of SARI patients between the experimental cohort and a propensity score–matched historical cohort. The primary outcome was the proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED. The secondary outcomes included duration of intravenous antibiotics length of hospital stay and mortality.       Results   A total of 676 patients were included of which 169 patients were in the experimental group and 507 patients were in the control group. More than one-fourth (27.9%) of the patients in the experimental group tested positive for virus. Compared with controls the experimental group had a significantly higher proportion of antibiotics discontinuation or de-escalation in the ED (26.0% vs 16.1%     P = .007) neuraminidase inhibitor uses (8.9% vs 0.6%     P &lt; .001) and shorter duration of intravenous antibiotics (10.0 vs 14.5 days     P &lt; .001).          Conclusions and Implications   Combining rapid viral surveillance and PCT test is a useful strategy for early detection of potential viral epidemics and antibiotic stewardship. Clustered viral respiratory infections in a nursing home is common. Patients transferred from nursing homes to ED may benefit from this approach.    ,

PMC7106608,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\192_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Little is known about patient characteristics that contribute to initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) and achieving viral suppression among HIV people with opioid use disorder in Vietnam. The primary objective of this analysis was to evaluate associations between participant characteristics and the critical steps in the HIV care continuum of ART initiation and HIV viral suppression among people with opioid use disorder and HIV in Vietnam.       Methods   We assessed baseline participant characteristics ART status and HIV viral suppression (HIV RNA PCR &lt; 200 copies/mL) enrolled in a clinical trial of HIV clinic-based buprenorphine versus referral for methadone among people with opioid use disorder in Vietnam. We developed logistic regression models to identify characteristics associated with ART status and HIV viral suppression.       Results   Among 283 study participants 191 (67.5%) were prescribed ART at baseline and 168 of those on ART (90%) were virally suppressed. Years since HIV diagnosis (aOR = 1.12 95% CI 1.06 1.19) and being married (aOR = 2.83 95% CI 1.51 5.34) were associated with an increased likelihood of current prescription for ART at baseline. Greater depression symptoms were negatively associated with receipt of ART (aOR = 0.97 95% CI = (0.94 0.9963)). In the HIV suppression model once adjusting for all included covariates only receipt of ART was associated with viral suppression (aOR = 25.9 95% CI = (12.5 53.8). In bivariate analyses methamphetamine was negatively correlated with ART prescription (    p = 0.07) and viral suppression (    p = 0.08).          Conclusion   While fewer than 90% of participants had received ART 90% of those on ART had achieved HIV viral suppression at baseline suggesting that interventions to improve uptake of ART in Vietnam are essential for achieving UNAIDS 90–90-90 goals in people who use heroin in Vietnam. Social determinants of health associated with ART and HIV viral suppression suggest that social support may be a key to facilitating both of these steps in the HIV care continuum.    ,

PMC7108492,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\195_17_abstract.xml,   Abstract  The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was formed in the aftermath of the 2014–2015 Ebola outbreak in west Africa to support the development of vaccines that could improve the world’s preparedness against outbreaks of epidemic infectious diseases. Since its launch in 2017 CEPI has mobilized more than US$750 million to support its mission to develop vaccines against agents such as Lassa virus Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Nipah virus as well as several rapid-response vaccine platforms to accelerate response times to unexpected epidemic threats. CEPI has also played a leading role in fostering institutional partnerships between public- and private-sector organizations to optimize allocation of resources for vaccine development against its priority pathogens. CEPI’s priorities include diversification of its current vaccine research and development investment portfolio to include additional pathogens such as Rift Valley fever and chikungunya; establishment of technical and regulatory pathways for vaccine development across CEPI’s portfolio; development of sustainable manufacturing solutions for vaccine candidates nearing completion of safety and immunogenicity testing in humans; and creation of investigational stockpiles of its vaccine candidates for use in emergency situations. This commentary provides an overview of the global health challenges CEPI was established to address and its achievements to date and indicates priorities for funding and coordination in the coming years.  ,
PMC7109116,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\196_14_abstract.xml,   Gangliosides are structurally and functionally polymorphic sialic acid containing glycosphingolipids that are widely distributed in the human body. They play important roles in protecting us against immune attacks yet they can become targets for autoimmunity and act as receptors for microbes like the influenza viruses and toxins such as the cholera toxin. The expression patterns of gangliosides vary in different tissues during different life periods as well as in different animals. Antibodies against gangliosides (AGA) can target immune attack e.g. against neuronal cells and neutralize their complement inhibitory activity. AGAs are important especially in acquired demyelinating immune-mediated neuropathies like Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variant the Miller–Fisher syndrome (MFS). They can emerge in response to different microbial agents and immunological insults. Thereby they can be involved in a variety of diseases. In addition antibodies against GM3 were found in the sera of patients vaccinated with    Pandemrix® who developed secondary narcolepsy strongly supporting the autoimmune etiology of the disease.    ,
PMC7109256,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\197_17_abstract.xml,   The complement system is an ancient innate immune defense mechanism that can recognize molecular patterns on the invading pathogens. Factor H as an inhibitor of the alternative pathway down-regulates complement activation on the host cell surface. Locally synthesized factor H at the site of infection/injury including lungs can act as a pattern recognition molecule without involving complement activation. Here we report that factor H a sialic acid binder interacts with influenza A virus (IAV) and modulates IAV entry as evident from down-regulation of matrix protein 1 (M1) in H1N1 subtype-infected cells and up-regulation of M1 expression in H3N2-infected A549 cells. Far-western blot revealed that factor H binds hemagglutinin (HA ~70 kDa) neuraminidase (NA ~60 kDa) and M1 (~25 kDa). IAV-induced transcriptional levels of IFN-α TNF-α IL-12 IL-6 IFN-α and RANTES were reduced following factor H treatment for the H1N1 subtype at 6 h post-infection. However for the H3N2 subtype mRNA levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines were enhanced. A recombinant form of vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP) which like factor H contains CCP modules and has complement-regulatory activity mirrored the results obtained with factor H. Both factor H (25%) and VCP (45%) were found to reduce luciferase reporter activity in MDCK cells transduced with H1N1 pseudotyped lentiviral particles. Factor H (50%) and VCP (30%) enhanced the luciferase reporter activity for H3N2 suggesting an entry inhibitory role of factor H and VCP against H1N1 but not H3N2. Thus factor H can modulate IAV infection and inflammatory responses independent of its complement-related functions.  ,

However only a small percentage of HCV‐infected individuals globally have received therapy. Reducing the complexity of monitoring during HCV therapy if shown to be safe could facilitate greater access to HCV services particularly in resource‐limited settings such as sub‐Saharan Africa. We enrolled a total of 300 patients who were chronically infected with genotype 4 HCV in Rwanda and treated them with fixed‐dose ledispasvir/sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. For 60 consecutive participants enrolled we blinded the study clinician to on‐treatment laboratory results. We compared the efficacy safety and tolerability in those with blinded laboratory results to those with standard laboratory monitoring. Baseline characteristics among those with blinded laboratory values were comparable to those with standard monitoring. Among both groups the median age was 63 years and the median HCV viral load was 5.9 log (versus 64 years and 6.0 log respectively). Sustained virologic response rates at 12 weeks after treatment completion were similar in those with blinded laboratories (87%) compared to those with standard laboratory monitoring (87%). There was no increase in adverse events in those with blinded laboratory results and no participants discontinued the study medication because of an adverse event.    Conclusion: On‐treatment laboratory monitoring did not improve patient outcomes in those treated with ledispasvir/sofosbuvir. Eliminating this monitoring in treatment programs in resource‐limited settings may facilitate and accelerate scale‐up of HCV therapy.    ,

PMC7109593,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\200_15_abstract.xml,   Zoonoses represent a problem of rising importance in the transplant population. A close relationship and changes between human animal and environmental health (“One Health” concept) significantly influence the transmission and distribution of zoonotic diseases. The aim of this manuscript is to perform a narrative review of the published literature on emerging and neglected zoonoses in the transplant population. Many reports on donor-derived or naturally acquired (re-)emerging arboviral infections such as dengue chikungunya West Nile tick-borne encephalitis and Zika virus infection have demonstrated atypical or more complicated clinical course in immunocompromised hosts. Hepatitis E virus has emerged as a serious problem after solid organ transplantation (SOT) leading to diverse extrahepatic manifestations and chronic hepatitis with unfavorable outcomes. Some neglected pathogens such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus can cause severe infection with multi-organ failure and high mortality. In addition ehrlichiosis may be more severe with higher case-fatality rates in SOT recipients. Some unusual or severe presentations of borreliosis anaplasmosis and rickettsioses were also reported among transplant patients. Moreover toxoplasmosis as infectious complication is a well-recognized zoonosis in this population. Although rabies transmission through SOT transplantation has rarely been reported it has become a notable problem in some countries. Since the spreading trends of zoonoses are likely to continue the awareness recognition and treatment of zoonotic infections among transplant professionals should be imperative.  ,

PMC7110759,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\202_17_abstract.xml,   The Nipah virus has been transmitted from person-to-person via close contact in non-urban parts of India (including Kerala May 2018) Bangladesh and the Philippines. It can cause encephalitis and pneumonia and has a high case fatality rate. Nipah is a One Health zoonotic infectious disease linked to fruit bats and sometimes pigs or horses. We advocate anticipating and preparing for urban and larger rural outbreaks of Nipah. Immediate enhanced preparations would include standardized guidance on infection prevention and control and personal protective equipment from the World Health Organization (WHO) on their OpenWHO website and 2018 “Managing Epidemics” handbook along with adding best clinical practices by experts in countries with multiple outbreaks such as Bangladesh and India. Longer-term enhanced preparations include accelerating development of field diagnostics antiviral drugs immune-based therapies and vaccines. WHO-coordinated multi-partner protocols to test investigational treatments diagnostics and vaccines are needed by analogy to such protocols for Ebola during the unanticipated pan-epidemic in Guinea Liberia and Sierra Leone. Anticipating and preparing now for urban and rural Nipah outbreaks in nations with no experience with Nipah will help avoid the potential for what the United Nations 2016 report on Ebola in West Africa called a “preventable tragedy”.  ,

PMC7111037,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\204_16_abstract.xml,      Purpose   The seasonal distribution patterns of febrile seizures and of respiratory and enteric viral pathogens are similar. In this study we analyzed trends in febrile seizures and viral infection in Korean children using big data from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service (HIRA).       Methods   We analyzed children younger than 6 years who visited the hospital and were diagnosed with febrile seizures from 2009 to 2016 using medical records in the HIRA database. A total of 666136 medical records of children with a main or subdiagnosis of febrile seizure from 2008 to 2016 were included. Of these records patients younger than 1 month and records before 2009 were excluded. Finally 558130 records were extracted.       Results   The medical records included 315774 male children and 242356 (43.4%) female children with a mean age of 2.31 ± 1.31 years. The annual incidence of febrile seizure was 25.4 per 1000 person-years (27.9 for boys and 22.7 for girls). The ratio of male to female children was 1.30: 1 and records of 1-year-old children comprised the highest proportion (n = 210400 33.70%). The total monthly number of patients was highest in May (n = 64969 11.6%) and peaks were formed from April to July. The fewest patients were seen in October (n = 34424 6.17%). The most common viral pathogens were influenza in April and enterovirus during May–July.       Conclusion   The seasonal distribution of febrile seizures was high from late spring to summer and influenza virus and enterovirus were most frequently associated.    ,

PMC7112568,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\206_17_abstract.xml,      Objectives   The long-term dynamics of antibody responses in patients with influenza A(H7N9) virus infection are not well understood.       Methods   We conducted a longitudinal serological follow-up study in patients who were hospitalized with A(H7N9) virus infection during 2013–2018. A(H7N9) virus-specific antibody responses were assessed by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) and neutralization (NT) assays. A random intercept model was used to fit a curve to HAI antibody responses over time. HAI antibody responses were compared by clinical severity.       Results   Of 67 patients with A(H7N9) virus infection HAI antibody titers reached 40 on average 11 days after illness onset and peaked at a titer of 290 after three months and average titers of ≥80 and ≥40 were present until 11 months and 22 months respectively. HAI antibody responses were significantly higher in patients who experienced severe disease including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome compared with patients who experienced less severe illness.       Conclusions   Patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survived severe disease mounted higher antibody responses that persisted for longer periods compared with those that experienced moderate disease. Studies of convalescent plasma treatment for A(H7N9) patients should consider collection of donor plasma from survivors of severe disease between 1 and 11 months after illness onset.    ,

PMC7112655,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\208_22_abstract.xml,   Pathogen surveillance in free-ranging carnivores presents challenges due to their low densitie and secretive nature. We combined molecular and serological assays to investigate infections by viral pathogens (Canine parvovirus (CPV) Canine distemper virus (CDV) and Canine coronavirus (CCoV)) in Portuguese carnivores (Canis lupus Vulpes vulpes Lutra lutra Martes foina M. martes Meles meles and Genetta genetta) over a period of 16 years. Additionally we explored spatio-temporal patterns of virus occurrence in Canis lupus. Our study identified CPV DNA in all carnivore species with an overall prevalence of 91.9 %. CPV was detected in all sampled years and seasons in Canis lupus supporting its enzootic nature. CDV RNA was mainly detected in the Canidae family with viral nucleic acid recorded between 2005 and 2008 with a peak prevalence of 67 % among the wolf population followed by a sharp decline suggesting an epizootic behaviour of the virus. Antibodies show that mustelids and viverrids were often exposed to CDV. CCoV was first recorded by molecular methods in wolf samples in 2002 remaining in the wolf populations with marked fluctuations over time. The dual serological and molecular approach provided important epidemiological data on pathogens of wild carnivores in Portugal. These programmes should also include monitoring of other potential reservoir hosts such as domestic cats and dogs.  ,
PMC7112921,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\209_22_abstract.xml,   Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) represents an important respiratory disease accompanied by lethal outcome in one third of human patients. In recent years several investigators developed protective antibodies which could be used as prophylaxis in prospective human epidemics. In the current study eight human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with neutralizing and non-neutralizing capabilities directed against different epitopes of the MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike (MERS-S) protein were investigated with regard to their ability to immunohistochemically detect respective epitopes on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) nasal tissue sections of MERS-CoV experimentally infected alpacas. The most intense immunoreaction was detected using a neutralizing antibody directed against the receptor binding domain S1B of the MERS-S protein which produced an immunosignal in the cytoplasm of ciliated respiratory epithelium and along the apical membranous region. A similar staining was obtained by two other mAbs which recognize the sialic acid-binding domain and the ectodomain of the membrane fusion subunit S2 respectively. Five mAbs lacked immunoreactivity for MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE tissue even though they belong at least in part to the same epitope group. In summary three tested human mAbs demonstrated capacity for detection of MERS-CoV antigen on FFPE samples and may be implemented in double or triple immunohistochemical methods.  ,
PMC7115636,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\210_18_abstract.xml,      Background   The impact of annual influenza epidemics and prevailing strains varies worldwide and regional. The majority of vaccines used contained two influenza A strains and only one influenza B strain (trivalent vaccine).       Aim   The aim of the study was to compare laboratory confirmed influenza B cases during three consecutive years with respect to vaccination history clinical symptoms and molecular virology.       Methods   Partial HA gene sequences were analyzed for lineage determination and complete HA sequence in cases with reported vaccination and in fatal cases. Clinical data were retrieved from patient charts.       Findings   During the 2015/16 season 75 influenza B cases were retrieved; 11 in 2016/17 and 274 in 2017/18. The frequency of Yamagata-lineage strains increased from 7.6% to 100%. No difference was detected in the relative frequency of co-morbidities in season 2017/18. 37.7% of the adult patients and 4.5% of pediatric patients were vaccinated against influenza.       Interpretation   Phylogenetically Yamagata strains clustered similarly in 2017/2018 when compared to the previous two influenza seasons. While the relative frequency of influenza B cases differed the clinical symptoms remained similar.       Conclusion   World Health Organization recommendations for the use of tetravalent vaccines that contain two influenza B strains (Yamagata and Victoria) in addition to the two influenza A strains (H1N1 and H3N2) should be implemented in national vaccination guidelines.       Funding   This research was partially supported by the Association of Sponsors and Friends of Leipzig University.    ,
PMC7117767,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\211_23_abstract.xml,   Zika virus (ZIKV) is a    Flavivirus (   Flaviviridae) transmitted to humans mainly by the bite of an infected    Aedes mosquitoes.    Aedes aegypti is the primary epidemic vector of ZIKV and    Ae.    albopictus the secondary one. However the epidemiological role of both    Aedes species in Central Africa where    Ae.    albopictus was recently introduced is poorly characterized. Field-collected strains of    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus from different ecological settings in Central Africa were experimentally infected with a ZIKV strain isolated in West Africa. Mosquitoes were analysed at 14- and 21-days post-exposure. Both    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus were able to transmit ZIKV but with higher overall transmission efficiency for    Ae.    aegypti (57.9%) compared to    Ae.    albopictus (41.5%). In addition disseminated infection and transmission rates for both    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus varied significantly according to the location where they were sampled from. We conclude that both    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus are able to transmit ZIKV and may intervene as active Zika vectors in Central Africa. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological transmission of ZIKV in Central Africa and develop suitable strategy to prevent major ZIKV outbreaks in this region.    ,
PMC7117767,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\212_24_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Zika virus (ZIKV) isolated for the first time in Uganda in 1947 is transmitted to human beings mainly by the bite of an infected mosquitoes belonging to the    Aedes genus notably    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus. Both    Aedes species are present in Central Africa however their epidemiological role is poorly characterized. Here we assessed the ability of    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus collected in different ecological settings in Central Africa to transmit a ZIKV strain isolated in West Africa. Analysis showed that both    Ae.    aegypti and    Ae.    albopictus are able to transmit ZIKV but with higher overall transmission efficiency for    Ae.    aegypti compared to    Ae.    albopictus. In addition disseminated infection and transmission rates for both    Aedes species varied significantly according to the sampling location. Overall our result suggests that in Central Africa    Ae.    aegypti is more competent to transmit ZIKV than    Ae.    albopictus although parameters such as the feeding behaviour longevity and mosquito densities can modulate pathogens transmission in nature. These findings could contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiological transmission of ZIKV in Central Africa and develop suitable strategy to prevent major ZIKV outbreaks in this region.    ,
PMC7118414,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\213_19_abstract.xml,   Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a re-emerging pathogen of global importance. We attempted to gain an insight into the organisation distribution and mutational load of the virus strains reported from different parts of the world. We describe transmission dynamics and genetic characterisation of CHIKV across the globe during the last 65 years from 1952 to 2017. The evolutionary pattern of CHIKV was analysed using the E1 protein gene through phylogenetic Bayesian and Network methods with a dataset of 265 sequences from various countries. The time to most recent common ancestor of the virus was estimated to be 491 years ago with an evolutionary rate of 2.78 × 10   −4 substitutions/site/year. Genetic characterisation of CHIKV strains was carried out in terms of variable sites selection pressure and epitope mapping. The neutral selection pressure on the E1 gene of the virus suggested a stochastic process of evolution. We identified six potential epitope peptides in the E1 protein showing substantial interaction with human MHC-I and MHC-II alleles. The present study augments global epidemiological and population dynamics of CHIKV warranting undertaking of appropriate control measures. The identification of epitopic peptides can be useful in the development of epitope-based vaccine strategies against this re-emerging viral pathogen.    ,

The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that Zika virus (ZIKV) infection was more frequent in precarious pregnant women than in non-precarious pregnant women as reflected by their health insurance status.       Methods   A multicentric cross-sectional study was conducted in Cayenne hospital including ZIKV pregnant women with serological or molecular proof of ZIKV during their pregnancy between January and December 2016. Health insurance information was recorded at delivery which allowed separating women in: undocumented foreigners precarious but with residence permit and non-precarious.       Results   A total of 6654 women were included. Among them 1509 (227%) had confirmed ZIKV infection. Most women were precarious (2275/3439) but the proportion of precarious women was significantly greater in ZIKV-confirmed 728/906 (80.4%) than the ZIKV-negatives 1747/2533 (69.0%) p&lt;0.0001. There were 1142 women classified as non-precarious 1671 were precarious legal residents and 1435 were precarious and undocumented. Precariousness and undocumented status were associated with a higher prevalence of ZIKV during pregnancy (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.59 (95%CI = 1.29–1.97) p&lt;0.0001) (adjusted prevalence ratio = 1.5 (95%CI = 1.2–1.8) p&lt;0.0001) respectively.       Conclusions   These results illustrate that in French Guiana ZIKV transmission disproportionately affected the socially vulnerable pregnant women presumably because of poorer housing conditions and lack of vector control measures in poor neighborhoods.    ,

PMC7122823,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\216_22_abstract.xml,   In respect to the heterogeneity among influenza A virus strains and the shortcomings of current vaccination programs there is a huge interest in the development of alternative vaccines that provide a broader and more long-lasting protection. Gene-based approaches are considered as promising candidates for such flu vaccines. In our study innate signalling molecules from the RIG-I and the NALP3 pathways were evaluated as genetic adjuvants in intramuscular DNA immunizations. Plasmids encoding a constitutive active form of RIG-I (cRIG-I) IPS-1 IL-1β or IL-18 were co-administered with plasmids encoding the hemagglutinin and nucleoprotein derived from H1N1/Puerto Rico/8/1934 via electroporation in BALB/c mice. Immunogenicity was analysed in detail and efficacy was demonstrated in homologous and heterologous influenza challenge experiments. Although the biological activities of the adjuvants have been confirmed by    in vitro reporter assays their single or combined inclusion in the vaccine did not result in superior vaccine efficacy. With the exception of significantly increased levels of antigen-specific IgG1 after the co-administration of IL-1β there were only minor alterations concerning the immunogenicity. Since DNA electroporation alone induced substantial inflammation at the injection site as demonstrated in this study using Mx2-Luc reporter mice it might override the adjuvants´ contribution to the inflammatory microenvironment and thereby minimizes the influence on the immunogenicity. Taken together the DNA immunization was protective against subsequent challenge infections but could not be further improved by the genetic adjuvants analysed in this study.    ,
PMC7124917,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\217_18_abstract.xml,   Abstract.  A dengue outbreak occurred on Hawaii Island between September 2015 and March 2016. Entomological investigations were undertaken between December 2015 and February 2016 to determine which    Aedes mosquito species were responsible for the outbreak. A total of 3259 mosquitoes were collected using a combination of CDC autocidal gravid ovitraps Biogents BG-Sentinel traps and hand-nets; immature mosquitoes were collected during environmental surveys. The composition of species was    Aedes albopictus (58%)    Aedes aegypti (25%)    Wyeomyia mitchelli (7%)    Aedes vexans (5%)    Culex quinquefasciatus (4%) and    Aedes japonicus (1%). Adult mosquitoes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the presence of dengue virus (DENV) RNA. Of the 185 pools of female mosquitoes tested 15 containing    Ae. albopictus were positive for the presence of DENV type 1 RNA. No virus was detected in pools of the remaining species. Phylogenetic analysis showed the virus strain belonged to genotype I and was closely related to strains that were circulating in the Pacific between 2008 and 2014. This is the first report of detection of DENV in    Ae. albopictus from Hawaii.    ,
PMC7125191,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\218_13_abstract.xml,   Epidemics and evolution of many pathogens occur on similar timescales so that their dynamics are often entangled. Here in a first step to study this problem theoretically we analyze mutating pathogens spreading on simple SIR networks with grid-like connectivity. We have in mind the spatial aspect of epidemics which often advance on transport links between hosts or groups of hosts such as cities or countries. We focus on the case of mutations that enhance an agent’s infection rate. We uncover that the small-world property i.e. the presence of long-range connections makes the network very vulnerable supporting frequent supercritical mutations and bringing the network from disease extinction to full blown epidemic. For very large numbers of long-range links however the effect reverses and we find a reduced chance for large outbreaks. We study two cases one with discrete number of mutational steps and one with a continuous genetic variable and we analyze various scaling regimes. For the continuous case we derive a Fokker-Planck-like equation for the probability density and solve it for small numbers of shortcuts using the WKB approximation. Our analysis supports the claims that a potentiating mutation in the transmissibility might occur during an epidemic wave and not necessarily before its initiation.  ,

Of 30 children attending the same day care centre 26% and 59% had hMPV and multiple infections respectively; three of six children with pneumonia had a diagnosis of hMPV. hMPV infection is common in childhood viral co-infections but it can cause sudden death.  ,
PMC7128925,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\220_21_abstract.xml,      Objectives   Inappropriate use of antibiotics is associated with development of antimicrobial resistance. In respiratory infections it is often difficult to differentiate between viral and bacterial infections and empirical treatment is common. Enhanced viral testing is expected to clarify clinical decision-making and reduce the prescription of antibacterial agents but the impact of such information on patient care is unclear.       Methods   We conducted a (1:1) randomized controlled clinical trial involving 998 adults with respiratory symptoms fever chest pain or poor general condition in the emergency unit of a tertiary hospital. Multiplex PCR results for 496 patients were available in 24 hours (intervention group) and those for the remaining 502 patients were available in 7 days (control group). Our primary outcome measures were the duration of hospitalization and the consumption of antibiotics within 30 days of enrolment.       Results   In all 841 of 998 (84%) patients had respiratory symptoms at study entry. A respiratory virus was detected in 175 (17.5%). The mean duration of hospitalization was 4.2 days (SD 5.4) in the intervention group and 4.1 days (SD 4.9) in the control group (difference 0.1 95% CI –0.5 to 0.6 p 0.810). The mean days on antibiotics were 11.3 days (SD 12.6) in the intervention group and 10.4 days (SD 11.4) in the control group (difference 0.9 95% CI –0.6 to 2.4 p 0.235).       Conclusions   Multiplex PCR testing for respiratory viruses with results available within 24 hours did not reduce the consumption of bacterial antibiotics or the length of hospital stay in adults presenting with respiratory symptoms fever chest pain or reduced general condition in acute care.    ,
PMC7140199,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\221_14_abstract.xml,   H7N9 avian influenza virus (AIV) caused human infections in 2013 in China. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that H7N9 AIV is a novel reassortant strain with pandemic potential. We conducted a systemic review regarding virus-induced pathogenesis vaccine development and diagnosis of H7N9 AIV infection in humans. We followed PRISMA guidelines and searched PubMed Web of Science and Google Scholar to identify relevant articles published between January 2013 and December 2018. Pathogenesis data indicated that H7N9 AIV belongs to low pathogenic avian influenza which is mostly asymptomatic in avian species; however H7N9 induces high mortality in humans. Sporadic human infections have recently been reported caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses detected in poultry. H7N9 AIVs resistant to adamantine and oseltamivir cause severe human infection by rapidly inducing progressive acute community-acquired pneumonia multiorgan dysfunction and cytokine dysregulation; however mechanisms via which the virus induces severe syndromes remain unclear. An H7N9 AIV vaccine is lacking; designs under evaluation include synthesized peptide baculovirus-insect system and virus-like particle vaccines. Molecular diagnosis of H7N9 AIVs is suggested over conventional assays for biosafety reasons. Several advanced or modified diagnostic assays are under investigation and development. We summarized virus-induced pathogenesis vaccine development and current diagnostic assays in H7N9 AIVs.  ,
PMC7140399,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\222_17_abstract.xml,   The rubella virus (RV) was the first virus shown to be teratogenic in humans. The wealth of data on the clinical symptoms associated with congenital rubella syndrome is in stark contrast to an incomplete understanding of the forces leading to the teratogenic alterations in humans. This applies not only to RV but also to congenital viral infections in general and includes (1) the mode of vertical transmission even at early gestation (2) the possible involvement of inflammation as a consequence of an activated innate immune response and (3) the underlying molecular and cellular alterations. With the progress made in the development of pluripotent stem cell-based models including organoids and embryoids it is now possible to assess congenital virus infections on a mechanistic level. Moreover antiviral treatment options can be validated and newly emerging viruses with a potential impact on human embryonal development such as that recently reflected by the Zika virus (ZIKV) can be characterized. Here we discuss human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and ZIKV in comparison to RV as viruses with well-known congenital pathologies and highlight their analysis on current models for the early phase of human development. This includes the implications of their genetic variability and as such virus strain-specific properties for their use as archetype models for congenital virus infections. In this review we will discuss the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and derived organoid systems for the study of congenital virus infections with a focus on their prominent aetiologies HCMV ZIKV and RV. Their assessment on these models will provide valuable information on how human development is impaired by virus infections; it will also add new insights into the normal progression of human development through the analysis of developmental pathways in the context of virus-induced alterations. These are exciting perspectives for both developmental biology and congenital virology.  ,
PMC7140696,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\223_17_abstract.xml,   Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) aminopeptidases ERAP1 and ERAP2 (ERAPs) are crucial enzymes shaping the major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I) immunopeptidome. In the ER these enzymes cooperate in trimming the N-terminal residues from precursors peptides so as to generate optimal-length antigens to fit into the MHC class I groove. Alteration or loss of ERAPs function significantly modify the repertoire of antigens presented by MHC I molecules severely affecting the activation of both NK and CD8   + T cells. It is therefore conceivable that variations affecting the presentation of pathogen-derived antigens might result in an inadequate immune response and onset of disease. After the first evidence showing that ERAP1-deficient mice are not able to control Toxoplasma gondii infection a number of studies have demonstrated that ERAPs are control factors for several infectious organisms. In this review we describe how susceptibility development and progression of some infectious diseases may be affected by different ERAPs variants whose mechanism of action could be exploited for the setting of specific therapeutic approaches.    ,
PMC7141683,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\224_21_abstract.xml,   Influenza B virus (IBV) belongs to the    Orthomyxoviridae family and generally causes sporadic epidemics but is occasionally deadly to individuals. The current research mainly focuses on clinical and pathological characteristics of IBV. However to better prevent or treat the disease one must determine the strategies developed by IBV to invade and disrupt cellular proteins and approach to replicate itself to suppress antiviral innate immunity and understand how the host responds to IBV infection. The B/Shanghai/PD114/2018 virus was able to infect alveolar epithelial cells (A549) cells with good potential for replication. To identify host cellular responses against IBV infection differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained using RNA sequencing. The GO and KEGG pathway term enrichment analyses with the DEGs were performed and we found that the DEGs were primary involved in metabolic processes and cellular function which may be related to the host response including the innate immune response against the virus. Our transcriptome analysis results demonstrated robust induction of interferon and interferon-stimulated gene expression by IBV in human cells during the early stages of infection providing a foundation for further studies focused on antiviral drug development and interactions between the virus and host.    ,
PMC7141694,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\225_22_abstract.xml,      Background   Arboviruses are a cause of acute febrile illness and outbreaks worldwide. Recent outbreaks of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in dengue endemic areas have alarmed clinicians as unique clinical features differentiating CHIKV from Dengue virus (DENV) are limited. This has complicated diagnostic efforts especially in resource limited countries where lab testing is not easily available. Therefore it is essential to analyse and compare clinical features of laboratory confirmed cases to assist clinicians in suspecting possible CHIKV infection at time of clinical presentation.       Methodology   A prospective point prevalence study was conducted with the hypothesis that not all patients presenting with clinical suspicion of dengue infections at local hospitals are suffering from dengue and that other arboviruses such as Chikungunya West Nile viruses Japanese Encephalitis virus and Zika virus are co-circulating in the Sindh region of Pakistan. Out-patients and hospitalized (in-patients) of selected district hospitals in different parts of Sindh province of Pakistan were recruited. Patients with presumptive dengue like illness (Syndromic diagnosis) by the treating physicians were enrolled between 2015 and 2017.   Current study is a subset of larger study mentioned above. Here-in we compared laboratory confirmed cases of CHIKV and DENV to assess clinical features and laboratory findings that may help differentiate CHIKV from DENV infection at the time of clinical presentation.       Results   Ninety-eight (n = 98) cases tested positive for CHIKV by IgM and PCR and these were selected for comparative analysis with DENV confirmed cases (n = 171). On multivariable analysis presence of musculoskeletal [OR = 2.5 (95% CI:1.6–4.0)] and neurological symptoms [OR = 4.4 (95% CI:1.9–10.2)] and thrombocytosis [OR = 2.2 (95% CI:1.1–4.0)] were associated with CHIKV infection while atypical lymphocytes [OR = 8.3 (95% CI:4.2–16.7)] and thrombocytopenia [OR = 8.1 (95% CI:1.7–38.8)] were associated with DENV cases at time of presentation. These findings may help clinicians in differentiating CHIKV from DENV infection.       Conclusion   CHIKV is an important cause of illness amongst patients presenting with acute febrile illness in Sindh region of Pakistan. Arthralgia and encephalitis at time of presentation among patients with dengue-like illness should prompt suspicion of CHIKV infection and laboratory confirmation must be sought.    ,
PMC7141694,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\226_23_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Chikungunya and Dengue viral infection are prevalent in South Asia. These are spread by mosquito bites and present as acute febrile illness with clinical presentation difficult to differentiate. In this study we analysed clinical findings of patients with lab confirmed Dengue virus and Chikungunya virus infection and compared the clinical symptoms to assess significant features that can differentiate the two infections at time of presentation to clinics and hospitals. The study was conducted at the Aga Khan University Hospital Karachi Pakistan. Our study confirms presence of Chikungunya virus as an etiologic agent of fever among patients with dengue like illness in Sindh province of Pakistan. Presence of joint pains central nervous symptoms were more common in CHKV patients while gastrointestinal symptoms and elevated liver enzymes were more commonly associated with dengue patients. Both viruses are endemic in Pakistan and clinical and lab diagnosis is essential.  ,
PMC7142734,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\227_18_abstract.xml,   Dengue’s increasing trends raise concerns over global health and pose a challenge to the Brazilian health system highlighting the necessity of a strong surveillance system to reduce morbidity mortality and the economic burden of this disease. Although the Brazilian surveillance system reports more dengue cases than any other country recent studies suggest that non-reported cases are the majority. The aim of the study is to explore the strengths and weaknesses of the Brazilian surveillance system particularly looking at the functioning of data collection and reporting. This was done through qualitative semi-structured interviews with 17 experts in dengue surveillance supported by quantitative data from the official notification system. To select the interviewees purposive and theoretical sampling were used. Data were analyzed through thematic analysis. The research highlighted that a lack of human and technological resources in healthcare units and surveillance departments slows down the notification process and data analysis. Due to a lack of integration in the private sector the surveillance system fails to detect the socioeconomic profile of the patients. Investments in public healthcare human and technological resources for surveillance and better integration in the private healthcare system and vector surveillance may improve dengue surveillance.  ,

All sera that had cELISA anti-Flavivirus antibodies were further examined by the VNT. Thirteen wild boars (7.73%) were positive for Flavivirus by cELISA a single European wild boar serum was positive for VNT with a neutralizing antibody titer 1/14. No samples resulted positive for Flavivirus by RT-PCR assay.          Abstract   Background: A retrospective sero-survey for evidence of West Nile virus (WNV) infection in European wild boar (    Sus scorfa) was conducted in the Latium region Italy on stored serum samples of the period November 2011 to January 2012. Methods: Sera were collected from 168 European wild boars and screened for antibodies to WNV and other Flaviviruses by competitive enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (cELISA). All sera positive for Flavivirus antibodies by cELISA were further examined by virus neutralization test (VNT). To test the presence of Flavivirus RNA in samples an RT-PCR was performed using a pan-Flavivirus primers pair. Results: Thirteen wild boars (7.73%) were seropositive for Flaviviruses. The hemolysis of serum samples limited the interpretation of the VNT for 7 samples confirming the presence of specific antibody against WNV in a single European wild boar serum sample. The presence of ELISA positive/VNT negative samples suggests the occurrence of non-neutralizing antibodies against WNV or other antigen-related Flaviviruses. No samples resulted positive for Flavivirus by RT-PCR assay. Conclusion: Although a moderately high percentage of animals with specific antibody for WNV has been detected in wild boar in other surveillance studies in Europe this has not been reported previously in Italy. Together these data indicate that European wild boar are exposed to WNV and/or other related-Flavivirus in central Italy and confirm the usefulness of wild ungulates as suitable Flavivirus sentinels.       ,
PMC7143501,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\229_21_abstract.xml,   Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an emerging causative agent of acute hepatitis worldwide. To provide insights into the epidemiology of HEV in Italy a large-scale investigation was conducted into urban sewage over nine years (2011–2019) collecting 1374 sewage samples from 48 wastewater treatment plants located in all the 20 regions of Italy. Broadly reactive primers targeting the ORF1 and ORF2 regions were used for the detection and typing of HEV followed by Sanger and next generation sequencing (NGS). Real-time RT-qPCR was also used to attempt quantification of positive samples. HEV RNA detection occurred in 74 urban sewage samples (5.4%) with a statistically significant higher frequency (7.1%) in central Italy. Fifty-six samples were characterized as G3 strains and 18 as G1. While the detection of G3 strains occurred in all the surveillance period G1 strains were mainly detected in 2011–2012 and never in 2017–2019. Typing was achieved in 2 samples (3f subtype). Viral concentrations in quantifiable samples ranged from 1.2 × 10   3 g.c./L to 2.8 × 10   4 g.c./L. Our results suggest the considerable circulation of the virus in the Italian population despite a relatively small number of notified cases a higher occurrence in central Italy and a noteworthy predominance of G3 strains.    ,

The prevalence of HBV HCV and syphilis has geographic differences and varies from region to region among HIV-positive individuals. A retrospective study was carried out on HIV-positive individuals between June 2011 and June 2016 in Shaanxi Province. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses using stepwise regression analysis regarding risk factors for HIV–HBV HIV–HCV and HIV–syphilis co-infection. HBV–HCV HCV–syphilis HBV–syphilis and HBV–HCV–syphilis co-infection rates were 1.7% 2.2% 2.6% and 0.1% respectively. The rate of ineffective hepatitis B vaccine immunization was as high as 30.2% among HIV-positive individuals. Ethnicity (OR = 31.030 95% CI: 11.643–82.694) and HIV transmission routes (OR = 134.024 95% CI: 14.328–1253.653) were the risk factors for HCV infection in HIV-positive individuals. Among the HIV-positive individuals with the antibodies of TP the rate of homosexual transmission was also higher but heterosexual transmission was lower (OR = 0.549 95% CI: 0.382–0.789) The HIV-infected patients in Shaanxi Province had the characteristics of low active detection rate and late diagnosis. The high rate of ineffective vaccination against HBV suggests a need for improved vaccination services.  ,
PMC7144013,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\231_18_abstract.xml,   In recent years cases of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection have increased in Europe in association with the consumption of contaminated food mainly from pork products but also from wild boars. The animal’s serum is usually tested for the presence of anti-HEV antibodies and viral RNA but in many cases such as during hunting an adequate serum sample cannot be obtained. In the present study liver transudate was evaluated as an alternative matrix to serum for HEV detection. A total of 125 sera and liver transudates were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at different dilutions (1:2 1:10 1:20) while 58 samples of serum and liver transudate were checked for the presence of HEV RNA by RT-qPCR. Anti- HEV antibodies were detected by ELISA in 68.0% of the serum samples and in 61.6% of the undiluted transudate and in 70.4% 56.8% and 44.8% of 1:2 1:10 or 1:20 diluted transudate respectively. The best results were obtained for the liver transudate at 1:10 dilution based on the Kappa statistic (0.630) and intraclass correlation coefficient (0.841). HEV RNA was detected by RT-qPCR in 22.4% of the serum samples and 6.9% of the transudate samples all samples used for RT-qPCR were positive by ELISA. Our results indicate that liver transudate may be an alternative matrix to serum for the detection of anti-HEV antibodies.  ,
PMC7144238,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\232_17_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Infection of influenza A virus (IAV) can trigger exaggerated pulmonary inflammation and induce acute lung injury (ALI). Limiting IAV replication and alleviation of pulmonary inflammation are two important therapeutic strategies for influenza virus infection. Recent studies have shown that hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) is an essential factor for the development and repair of ALI; however the role and the underlying mechanisms of HIF-1α in IAV-induced ALI remain elusive. Here we demonstrated that lung epithelial cell-specific    Hif1α knockout mice infected with IAV developed more lung IAV replication and severe lung inflammation which led to increased mortality compared to IAV-infected control mice. Moreover knockdown of    HIF1A in A549 cells (human alveolar type II epithelial cell line) promoted IAV replication    in vitro. Mechanistically knockdown of    HIF1A reduced glycolysis by regulating transcription of glycolysis-related enzymes which subsequently activated the AMPKα-ULK1 signalling pathway. Interestingly AMPKα-ULK1 signalling promoted autophagy and augmented IAV replication. Taken together deficiency of HIF-1α in lung epithelial cells reduces glycolysis and enhances AMPKα-ULK1-mediated autophagy which finally facilitates IAV replication. These findings have deepened our understanding of the role of HIF-1α in regulating IAV replication and provided us novel therapeutic targets for combating influenza infection.    ,
PMC7144666,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\233_16_abstract.xml,   In human history the paper has long been used as a platform to record and preserve information. However over the decades paper has found its application in Biomedical Sciences too. Both paper-based microfluidic devices (μPADs) and paper-based cultures and scaffolds have shown immense potential to be used as a sensor as well as a supporting material for in vitro tissue engineering. μPADs can be used to perform low-cost and fast biomolecular assays at Point-Of-Care (POC). They are being used to detect various biomarkers like viral proteins metabolites oncogenes and antigens; and conditions like Venous Thromboembolism (VTE). On the other hand the paper has also been used to develop paper-based 3D cultures and scaffolds to test drugs and monitor cytotoxic effects in vitro cell microenvironments and also as implantable tissues. In this review we intend to enumerate the development in the field of μPADs paper-based cell cultures and paper-based scaffolds and their plethora of applications over the last decade.  ,
PMC7145403,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\234_19_abstract.xml,      Background: Increasing rates of HIV/AIDS in Eastern Europe and Central Asia contrast global trends but the scope of HIV/AIDS research originating from Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union has not been quantified.       Methods: We searched six major scientific databases in Russian and English languages with medical subject heading terms “HIV” or “AIDS” and “Russia” or “Soviet Union” from 1991 to 2016. Each abstract indexed was reviewed and tagged for 25 HIV/AIDS research themes location of research focus and first author.       Results and Discussion: A total of 2868 articles were included; 2156 (75.1%) and 712 (24.8%) described research in the Russian Federation and countries of the former Soviet Union respectively. There were 15 publications per million population in Russian Federation. Federal districts of the Russian Federation with the highest rates of HIV had the most limited publications. An interactive web-map with time-lapse features and links to primary literature was created using ArcGIS   ® technology [   http://arcg.is/2FUIJ5v].       Conclusion: We found a lower than expected publication rate in the Russian Federation relative to rising HIV prevalence. The greatest deficits were in the most HIV burdened regions in the Russian Federation. Our findings highlight opportunities for new research strategies and public health efforts among key populations and subnational regions.    ,
PMC7147054,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\235_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Vector-borne diseases are a major public health concern and cause significant morbidity and mortality. Zika virus (ZIKV) is the etiologic agent of a massive outbreak in the Americas that originated in Brazil in 2015 and shows a strong association with congenital ZIKV syndrome in newborns. Cache Valley virus (CVV) is a bunyavirus that causes mild to severe illness in humans and ruminants. In this study we investigated the vector competence of Virginia mosquitoes for ZIKV and CVV to explore their abilities to contribute to potential outbreaks.       Methods   To determine vector competence mosquitoes were fed a blood meal comprised of defibrinated sheep blood and virus. The presence of midgut or salivary gland barriers to ZIKV infection were determined by intrathoracic inoculation     vs oral infection. After 14-days post-exposure individual mosquitoes were separated into bodies legs and wings and saliva expectorant. Virus presence was detected by plaque assay to determine midgut infection dissemination and transmission rates.          Results   Transmission rates for     Ae. albopictus orally infected (24%) and intrathoracically inoculated (63%) with ZIKV was similar to     Ae. aegypti (48% and 71% respectively). Transmission rates of ZIKV in     Ae. japonicus were low and showed evidence of a midgut infection barrier demonstrated by low midgut infection and dissemination rates from oral infection (3%) but increased transmission rates after intrathoracic inoculation (19%).     Aedes triseriatus was unable to transmit ZIKV following oral infection or intrathoracic inoculation. CVV transmission was dose-dependent where mosquitoes fed high titer (ht) virus blood meals developed higher rates of midgut infection dissemination and transmission compared to low titer (lt) virus blood meals. CVV was detected in the saliva of     Ae. albopictus (ht: 68% lt: 24%)     Ae. triseriatus (ht: 52% lt: 7%)     Ae. japonicus (ht: 22% lt: 0%) and     Ae. aegypti (ht: 10%; lt: 7%).     Culex pipiens and     Cx. restuans were not competent for ZIKV or CVV.          Conclusions   This laboratory transmission study provided further understanding of potential ZIKV and CVV transmission cycles with     Aedes mosquitoes from Virginia. The ability for these mosquitoes to transmit ZIKV and CVV make them a public health concern and suggest targeted control programs by mosquito and vector abatement districts.           ,

We compared characteristics of ALRIs between patients with community-acquired versus nosocomial infections and in each group between children and adults.       Results   Community-acquired and nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs were diagnosed in 229 and 11 inpatients respectively. The burden of community-acquired infections was higher in children than in adults: 2.1% versus 0.2% of the total number of pediatric and adult inpatients respectively (p &lt; 0.0001); 4.2% versus 0.2% of the total number of hospitalization days in pediatric and adult units respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). Compared to inpatients with community-acquired ALRIs those with nosocomial infections were more frequently adults (45.5% versus 2.6% p = 0.0005) and subjects with at least one chronic complex condition (100.0% versus 41.0% p &lt; 0.0001). The total number of hospitalization days due to nosocomial ALRIs was higher in adults than in children (0.32% versus 0.11% p &lt; 0.0001).       Conclusions   Nosocomial RSV-associated ALRIs rarely occurred suggesting a good effectiveness of our infection control strategy. However the burden of nosocomial infection was higher in adults than in children suggesting that education and training of healthcare personnel patients and visitors about the risk of nosocomial RSV infections should be reinforced in adult wards.    ,
PMC7148740,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\240_15_abstract.xml,   Viruses of human or animal origin can spread in the environment and infect people via water and food. These viruses are released into the environment by various routes including water runoffs and aerosols. Furthermore zoonotic viruses may infect humans exposed to contaminated surface waters.  Viruses are emerging pathogens and are able to adapt by mutation recombination and reassortment and can thus become able to infect new hosts and to adjust to new environments. Enteric viruses are among the commonest and most hazardous waterborne pathogens causing both sporadic and outbreak-related illness.  While considerable research has documented the risk of enteric viruses to human health from contact with contaminated water the current bacterial indicator-based methods for the evaluation of water quality are often ineffectual proxies for pathogenic viruses but no correlation was established between the enteric bacteria and viruses studied.  The present chapter will focus on viral pathogens shown to be transmitted through water. It will also provide an overview of viruses that had not been a concern for waterborne transmission in the past but that may represent potentially emerging waterborne pathogens due to their occurrence and persistence in water environments.  Monitoring effluents from wastewater treatment plants is important to preventing both environmental contamination and the spread of disease.  ,

As our world becomes increasingly connected emerging diseases pose a greater threat requiring coordination at local regional and global levels. One Health is a multisectoral transdisciplinary and collaborative approach promoted to more effectively address these complex health threats. Despite strong advocacy for One Health challenges for practical implementation remain. Here we discuss the value of the One Health approach for addressing global health challenges. We also share strategies applied to achieve successful outcomes through the USAID Emerging Pandemic Threats Program PREDICT project which serve as useful case studies for implementing One Health approaches. Lastly we explore methods for promoting more formal One Health implementation to capitalize on the added value of shared knowledge and leveraged resources.  ,

Owing to the continued improvements in sequencing technologies and the dramatic reduction of per base costs of sequencing the use of next generation sequencing have been key factors in this progress. Discoveries linked to viral metagenomics are expected to be beneficial to the field of veterinary medicine starting from the development of better diagnostic assays to the design of new subunit vaccines with minimal investments. With these achievements the research has taken a giant leap even toward the better healthcare of animals and as a result the animal sector could be growing at an unprecedented pace.  ,

The World Health Organization recognizes the need to develop and implement prevention strategies to reduce the impact of RSV in early life as a global health priority. RSV vaccination during pregnancy is a feasible strategy to achieve this goal. Vaccines for maternal immunization against RSV are in active development and could be implemented in the near future within existing maternal-child health platforms. In addition infant protection may be achieved through either passive antibody administration or active immunization depending on infant health status given that options for these complementary interventions are being developed in parallel to vaccines for maternal immunization.  ,
PMC7149897,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\244_19_abstract.xml,   The emergence of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases throughout history has been the product of the interaction of infectious agents immunity selective pressure and environmental factors. The origin of the viral ancestors remains controversial the debate remains whether the viruses existed before their host cells evolved as molecular structures that adapted to the intracellular development or of the cells that infected or housed them as hosts. The nature of the viruses could propose a hypothetical evolutionary model based on the way they parasitize cells and the way they fuse with their host cells. So far there are no “universal” viral genes that have not allowed the hypotheses of the “common viral ancestor” to be conclusive. Insects have a special role in understanding viral evolution and how they became pathogens suggesting a coevolutionary scenario of colonization that would initially allow the survival of viruses and later an ecological niche required for the cycle of virus replication. The coevolution of viruses and defense systems of hosts represents a fundamental role in the evolution of both viruses and host cells a kind of arms race between viruses and hosts and the deescalation of that war could explain the coexistence of viruses and hosts. Viruses are playing an important role in the understanding of cell evolution and have earned the right to be included in the tree of life. The aim of this chapter is to review the viral evolution and the insects as host.  ,

PMC7149978,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\246_15_abstract.xml,   Dengue virus (DENV) belongs to the family Flaviviridae genus    Flavivirus. It is a single-stranded positive-sense ribonucleic acid virus with 10700 bases. The genus    Flavivirus includes other arthropod borne viruses such as yellow fever virus West Nile virus Zika virus tick-borne encephalitis virus. It infects ~50–200 million people annually putting over 3.6 billion people living in tropical regions at risk and causing ~20000 deaths annually. The expansion of dengue is attributed to factors such as the modern dynamics of climate change globalization travel trade socioeconomics settlement and also viral evolution. There are four antigenically different serotypes of DENV based on the differences in their viral structural and nonstructural proteins. DENV infection causes a spectrum of illness ranging from asymptomatic to dengue fever to severe dengue shock syndrome. Infection with one serotype confers lifelong immunity against that serotype but heterologus infection leads to severe dengue hemorrhagic fever due to antibody-dependent enhancement. Diagnosis of dengue infections is based mainly on serological detection of either antigen in acute cases or antibodies in both acute and chronic infection. Viral detection and real-time PCR detection though helpful is not feasible in resource poor setup. Treatment of dengue depends on symptomatic management along with fluid resuscitation and may require platelet transfusion. Although vaccine development is in late stages of development developing a single vaccine against four serotypes often causes serious challenges to researchers; hence the main stay of prevention is vector control and management.    ,

Alterations in the habitats produced by human activity result in global warming climatic changes which together with globalization increased trade the shortening of distances thanks to transport the increase in population and the socioeconomic activities of human cause imbalances. In many cases the vectors and hosts have adapted to the changes and have risen to higher latitudes and altitudes which could contribute to the appearance of outbreaks or new outbreaks of new arboviruses of public health importance. Different cohabiting species can be reservoirs or vectors of arboviruses such as alphaviruses and flaviviruses. Currently some viruses transmitted by mosquito vectors such as dengue virus Zika virus and chikungunya virus have caused epidemic outbreaks with important effects on human populations. It is possible that the expansion of vectors and their diseases reaches developed countries such as the United States and the European Union with a great impact on public health. The clinical signs of the diseases produced by arboviruses can vary from nonspecific febrile syndrome encephalitis hemorrhagic fever and even death. Vectors and reservoirs in some cases are insects such as mosquitoes and ticks; wild birds are reservoirs for the West Nile virus small wild mammals such as rodents bats and domestic animals involved in food production can potentially harbor arboviruses and the ecoepidemiological role of these is unknown.  ,
PMC7150362,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\248_13_abstract.xml,   The unpredictable emergence of new zoonotic diseases with viral etiology is currently a hot issue in the scientific and political circles. Viral emergence and reemergence as a sanitary event are only the visible part of the iceberg while the hidden one corresponds to a multitude of complex and interrelated factors including societal and environmental factors favoring the advent of the state of viral emergence and reemergence.  According to the World Health Organization 60% of the agents recognized as human pathogens come from the animal kingdom and 75% of the pathogens responsible for emerging and reemerging animal diseases present a potential transgression of interface between interspecies establishing favorable conditions for genetic exchange leading to the emergence of new highly pathogenic variants and strains of which the animal is often the host reservoir.  Therefore any public health prophylactic strategy requires a holistic approach to the health problem taking into account the interaction between the triad elements of the human animal and environment. This globalized approach has been realized by the international community through the new recently established concept of “One Health One World” making the old bipolar concept of separated human and animal health issues avoided and obsolete.  The extreme diversity of emerging and reemerging viral pathogens the change of human lifestyle the globalization of travel business exchanges and tourism potentiate the risk of emergence of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases. Promoting intersectorial collaboration will allow to unify the health and safety policies. The cross-cutting ecological and health data at the national and global scales are effective means for sustaining good health in human animal and ecosystem (in particular the viral ecology).  ,

We performed viral deep-sequence phylogenetic analyses to quantify transmission dynamics between the general population (GP) fisherfolk communities (FF) and women at high risk of infection and their clients (WHR) in central and southwestern Uganda. Between August 2014 and August 2017 6185 HIV-1 positive individuals were enrolled in 3 GP and 10 FF communities 3 WHR enrollment sites. A total of 2531 antiretroviral therapy (ART) naïve participants with plasma viral load &gt;1000 copies/mL were deep-sequenced. One hundred and twenty-three transmission networks were reconstructed including 105 phylogenetically highly supported source–recipient pairs. Only one pair involved a WHR and male participant suggesting that improved population sampling is needed to assess empirically the role of WHR to the transmission dynamics. More transmissions were observed from the GP communities to FF communities than vice versa with an estimated flow ratio of 1.56 (95% CrI 0.68–3.72) indicating that fishing communities on Lake Victoria are not a net source of transmission flow to neighboring communities further inland. Men contributed disproportionally to HIV-1 transmission flow regardless of age suggesting that prevention efforts need to better aid men to engage with and stay in care.  ,

Using laboratory-confirmed data from a Utah-based healthcare provider Intermountain Health Care we analyzed the time-specific patterns of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) influenza A influenza B human metapneumovirus rhinovirus and enterovirus circulation from 2004 to 2018 using descriptive methods and wavelet analysis (   n = 89462) on a local level. The results showed that RSV virus dynamics in Utah were the most consistent of any of the viruses studied and that the other seasonal viruses were generally in synchrony with RSV except for enterovirus (which mostly occurs late summer to early fall) and influenza A and B during pandemic years.    ,

Flavescence dorée is one of the most severely damaging diseases of Vitis vinifera and consequently a major threat to grape and wine production in several European countries. Control measures are compulsory but they mainly involve large-scale insecticide treatments with detrimental impacts on the environment. One possible solution is to exploit the largely unexplored genetic diversity of viruses infecting S. titanus as highly specific and environmentally benign tools for biological control.    (2) Methods: A metatranscriptomic approach was adopted to identify viruses that may infect individuals caught in the wild in both its native (United States) and invasive (Europe) areas. Reverse transcription PCR was used to confirm their presence in RNA pools and explore their prevalence.    (3) Results: We described nine new RNA viruses including members of “Picorna-Calici” “Permutotetra” “Bunya-Arena” “Reo” “Partiti-Picobirna” “Luteo-Sobemo” and “Toti-Chryso” clades. A marked difference in the diversity and abundance of the viral species was observed between the USA population and the European ones.    (4) Conclusions: This work represents the first survey to assess the viral community of a phytoplasma insect vector. The possibility to exploit these naturally occurring viruses as specific and targeted biocontrol agents of    S. titanus could be the answer to increasing demand for a more sustainable viticulture.    ,
PMC7150803,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\252_16_abstract.xml,   Canine distemper virus (CDV) is a highly contagious pathogen transmissible to a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic carnivores. Despite the availability of attenuated vaccines against CDV the virus remains responsible for outbreaks of canine distemper (CD) with significant morbidity and mortality in domesticated and wild carnivores worldwide. CDV uses the signaling lymphocytic activation molecule (SLAM or CD150) and nectin-4 (PVRL4) as entry receptors well-known tumor-associated markers for several lymphadenomas and adenocarcinomas which are also responsible for the lysis of tumor cells and apparent tumor regression. Thus CDV vaccine strains have emerged as a promising platform of oncolytic viruses for use in animal cancer therapy. Recent advances have revealed that use of the CDV reverse genetic system (RGS) has helped increase the understanding of viral pathogenesis and explore the development of recombinant CDV vaccines. In addition genetic engineering of CDV based on RGS approaches also has the potential of enhancing oncolytic activity and selectively targeting tumors. Here we reviewed the host tropism and pathogenesis of CDV and current development of recombinant CDV-based vaccines as well as their use as oncolytic viruses against cancers.  ,
PMC7150808,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\253_17_abstract.xml,   Peste des Petits Ruminants (PPR) is a highly contagious viral disease of both domestic (goats and sheep) and wild ruminants. Caused by a morbillivirus that belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae. The disease is clinically and pathologically similar to rinderpest of cattle and human measles. PPR is one of the most economically devastating viral diseases of small ruminants. In April 2015 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) launched the PPR Global Control and Eradication Strategy (PPR GCES) with the vision for global eradication by 2030. There is a strong and lasting international consensus to eradicate the disease in order to protect the livelihoods of the world’s poorest populations. As with any disease eradication is feasible when policy scientific and technical challenges are addressed. Ten majors challenges are described in this paper namely: understanding small ruminant production facilitating research to support eradication refining laboratory testing improving epidemiological understanding of the virus defining infection of wildlife and other species optimizing vaccine delivery and novel vaccines developing better control of animal movement heightening serological monitoring understanding socio-economic impact and garnering funding and political will.  ,

Analysis of 16 genotype-specific Single Nucleotides Polymorphisms identified the Asian genotype and suggested a Southeast Asia origin.  ,
PMC7150836,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\255_15_abstract.xml,   Emerging viruses have caused concerns about pollinator population declines as multi-host RNA viruses may pose a health threat to pollinators and associated arthropods. In order to understand the ecology and impact these viruses have we studied their host range and determined to what extent host and spatial variation affect strain diversity. Firstly we used RT-PCR to screen pollinators and associates including honey bees (   Apis mellifera) and invasive Argentine ants (   Linepithema humile) for virus presence and replication. We tested for the black queen cell virus (BQCV) deformed wing virus (DWV) and Kashmir bee virus (KBV) that were initially detected in bees and the two recently discovered    Linepithema humile bunya-like virus 1 (LhuBLV1) and Moku virus (MKV). DWV KBV and MKV were detected and replicated in a wide range of hosts and commonly co-infected hymenopterans. Secondly we placed KBV and DWV in a global phylogeny with sequences from various countries and hosts to determine the association of geographic origin and host with shared ancestry. Both phylogenies showed strong geographic rather than host-specific clustering suggesting frequent inter-species virus transmission. Transmission routes between hosts are largely unknown. Nonetheless avoiding the introduction of non-native species and diseased pollinators appears important to limit spill overs and disease emergence.    ,
PMC7150882,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\256_19_abstract.xml,   The Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne virus that can not only cause severe disease in domestic animals but also in humans. However the licensed vaccines or available therapeutics for humans do not exist. Here we report two Gn-specific neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) isolated from a rhesus monkey immunized with recombinant human adenoviruses type 4 expressing Rift Valley fever virus Gn and Gc protein (rHAdV4-GnGcopt). The two NAbs were both able to protect host cells from RVFV infection. The interactions between NAbs and Gn were then characterized to demonstrate that these two NAbs might preclude RVFV glycoprotein rearrangement hindering the exposure of fusion loops in Gc to endosomal membranes after the virus invades the host cell. The target region for the two NAbs is located in the Gn domain III implying that Gn is a desired target for developing vaccines and neutralizing antibodies against RVFV.  ,
PMC7150925,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\257_31_abstract.xml,   In the recent past peste des petits ruminants (PPR) emerged in East Africa causing outbreaks in small livestock across different countries with evidences of spillover to wildlife. In order to understand better PPR at the wildlife–livestock interface we investigated patterns of peste des petits ruminants virus (PPRV) exposure disease outbreaks and viral sequences in the northern Albertine Rift. PPRV antibodies indicated a widespread exposure in apparently healthy wildlife from South Sudan (2013) and Uganda (2015 2017). African buffaloes and Uganda kobs &lt;1-year-old from Queen Elizabeth National Park (2015) had antibodies against PPRV N-antigen and local serosurvey captured a subsequent spread of PPRV in livestock. Outbreaks with PPR-like syndrome in sheep and goats were recorded around the Greater Virunga Landscape in Kasese (2016) Kisoro and Kabale (2017) from western Uganda and in North Kivu (2017) from eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This landscape would not be considered typical for PPR persistence as it is a mixed forest–savannah ecosystem with mostly sedentary livestock. PPRV sequences from DRC (2017) were identical to strains from Burundi (2018) and confirmed a transboundary spread of PPRV. Our results indicate an epidemiological linkage between epizootic cycles in livestock and exposure in wildlife denoting the importance of PPR surveillance on wild artiodactyls for both conservation and eradication programs.  ,
PMC7150983,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\258_17_abstract.xml,   Influenza causes millions of cases of hospitalizations annually and remains a public health concern on a global scale. Vaccines are developed and have proven to be the most effective countermeasures against influenza infection. Their efficacy has been largely evaluated by hemagglutinin inhibition (HI) titers exhibited by vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies which correlate fairly well with vaccine-conferred protection. Contrarily non-neutralizing antibodies and their therapeutic potential are less well defined yet recent advances in anti-influenza antibody research indicate that non-neutralizing Fc-effector activities especially antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) also serve as a critical mechanism in antibody-mediated anti-influenza host response. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with Fc-effector activities have the potential for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of influenza infection. Inducing mAbs mediated Fc-effector functions could be a complementary or alternative approach to the existing neutralizing antibody-based prevention and therapy. This review mainly discusses recent advances in Fc-effector functions especially ADCC and their potential role in influenza countermeasures. Considering the complexity of anti-influenza approaches future vaccines may need a cocktail of immunogens in order to elicit antibodies with broad-spectrum protection via multiple protective mechanisms.  ,

HEV infection can be asymptomatic or it can cause icteric or fulminant hepatitis. Off late there have been a number of publications reporting the extra-hepatic manifestations of HEV infection and this systematic review is aimed at summarizing the available evidence in this regard. Two independent investigators searched PubMed PubMed Central and Embase databases using the search string “(((hepatitis E) AND (Extrahepatic OR Extra-Hepatic))) OR ((Hepatitis E) AND (Neurology OR Cardiology OR Respiratory OR Lung OR Gastrointestinal OR musculoskeletal OR immunology OR pulmonary)) Filters: Abstract availability English language and Human studies”. The extra-hepatic manifestations reported in each of the selected articles were classified and reported as neurological cardiovascular and hematological and miscellaneous manifestations. The total number of various manifestations reported in our study were    n = 324. These include neurological manifestations (   n = 178/324 (54.94%)) cardiovascular and hematological manifestations (   n = 113/324 (34.88%)) gastro-intestinal/pancreaticobiliary manifestations (   n = 24/324 (7.41%)) and other rarer manifestations involving systems such as renal (   n = 4/324; 1.24%) endocrine (   n = 1/324; 0.31%) dermatology (   n = 1/324; 0.31%) respiratory (   n = 1/324; 0.31%) muscular (   n = 1/324; 0.31%) and immune system (   n = 1/324; 0.31%). Thus HEV can have extra-hepatic manifestations affecting any system of the human body. Further research is needed to elucidate the underlying pathophysiological manifestations of these extra-hepatic manifestations and to prove causal association with HEV.    ,

Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate land development and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history calculation of an incubation time by exposure and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions and initiate a targeted public health response.  ,

PMC7151829,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\263_15_abstract.xml,   Fueled by globalization and human behavior communicable diseases pose a serious threat to humankind despite unparalleled technological advances. New viruses and devastating communicable diseases such as Ebola and Zika are emerging; diseases previously considered eradicated such as measles are reemerging while antibiotic resistance is increasing to dangerously high levels worldwide. Increased human population and accelerated global travel make local outbreaks instant global threats. Researchers are concerned that an avian influenza outbreak could kill many more people when it emerges because of the absence of immunity and human travel interaction patterns. Yet the threat of communicable disease varies by geographic location—where you live matters. This entry examines the spatial patterns of familiar communicable diseases including the syndemic of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis as well as new diseases such as Ebola Zika and dengue. It highlights the huge potential of mapping communicable disease genotypes while raising the alarm on the urgent need for effective global disease surveillance systems and new tools for fighting communicable diseases. Because communicable diseases do not respect political boundaries global cooperation is vital to prevent this threat to humankind.  ,

Disease is mostly limited to the upper airways and is self-limiting but a small percentage can progress to lower respiratory tract infections as bronchiolitis and pneumonia. Children and elderly people are at increased risk especially in developing countries.  The most important etiologic agents of severe lower respiratory illness are bacteria such as    Streptococcus pneumoniae and    Haemophilus influenzae and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus. Efficacious vaccines are available against the two bacteria and the influenza virus. Viruses are much more important in mild upper and middle respiratory tract infections and in bronchiolitis in children whereas bacteria are the main cause of pneumonia especially in adults. Clinical syndromes overlap considerably and there is increasing evidence of bacterial-viral co-infections and of bacterial pneumonia being secondary to viral respiratory tract infection.    ,

PMC7153335,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\268_16_abstract.xml,   Infectious diseases are caused by microorganisms belonging to the class of bacteria viruses fungi or parasites. These pathogens are transmitted directly or indirectly and can lead to epidemics or even pandemics. The resulting infection may lead to mild-to-severe symptoms such as life-threatening fever or diarrhea. Infectious diseases may be asymptomatic in some individuals but may lead to disastrous effects in others. Despite the advances in medicine infectious diseases are a leading cause of death worldwide especially in low-income countries. With the advent of mathematical tools scientists are now able to better predict epidemics understand the specificity of each pathogen and identify potential targets for drug development. Artificial intelligence and its components have been widely publicized for their ability to better diagnose certain types of cancer from imaging data. This chapter aims at identifying potential applications of machine learning in the field of infectious diseases. We are deliberately focusing on key aspects of infection: diagnosis transmission response to treatment and resistance. We are proposing the use of extreme values as an avenue of interest for future developments in the field of infectious diseases. This chapter covers a series of applications selectively chosen to showcase how artificial intelligence is moving the field of infectious disease further and how it helps institutions to better tackles them especially in low-income countries.  ,
PMC7153343,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\269_15_abstract.xml,   Emerging and infectious diseases have persisted as leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Caused by pathogens including bacteria viruses parasites or fungi they are known to pose serious health threats to the world's population dating back to ancient Egypt. In the 14th Century alone infectious diseases were responsible for decimating 20–45% of the world's population. The discovery of vaccines coupled with improved sanitation hygiene and health care witnessed the eradication of several infectious diseases although some have resurfaced or are resurfacing since the latter part of the 20th Century. While geography partly define hotspots for emerging and infectious diseases low socioeconomic development poverty and underfunded health care systems remain driving forces for the reoccurrence of these diseases among vulnerable populations who experience material deprivation. To eradicate infectious diseases a global response will have to prioritize the allocation of resources by way of expertise and technology to areas that are most affected. Furthermore an effective surveillance system and a rigorous vaccine deployment regime targeting vulnerable persons and regions is desirable in mitigating the impacts of these diseases.  ,
PMC7153856,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\270_24_abstract.xml,      Background   Risk communication (RC) is an essential tool for the prevention and control of diseases as it impacts risk perception increases awareness and might change behaviour. It is the interactive exchange of information about risks among experts and people. Effective RC can minimize the impact that diseases such as dengue chikungunya and Zika have on populations. This study aimed to understand RC regarding vector-borne diseases in its social context and from the viewpoint of the audience to strengthen RC strategies in Curaçao.       Methods   In 2015 a cross-sectional mixed-method study applying focus group discussions (n = 7) in-depth interviews (n = 20) and a structured survey questionnaire (n = 339) was done in Curaçao. The study was designed based on the Health Belief Model and the Theory of Planned Behaviour. In addition the Social Amplification of Risk Framework and the theory of cultural schemas were applied to understand RC in the social context.       Results   Television radio and newspapers were the most important channels of information regarding dengue and chikungunya. Moreover individuals also reported receiving information via social media the internet and family/friends. Interestingly the use of internet to obtain information diminished with age while females were more likely to use internet compared to men. These key findings were statistically significant. An important outcome was that the risk perception towards chikungunya at the beginning of the outbreak was attenuated. This might be due to the (perceived) lack of RC before the epidemic. This same risk perception was amplified later during the outbreak by the increased exposure to information. Lastly we show how cultural schemas influence people’s perception regarding preventive measures and treatment of chikungunya and dengue.       Conclusions   Data obtained emphasise the importance of understanding the     user of media platforms and sharing information in a timely fashion through a transparent process with the content that convinces people of the seriousness of the matter.       ,
PMC7153856,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\271_25_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Vector-borne diseases (VBDs) such as dengue chikungunya and Zika are an increasing public health concern worldwide. The mentioned VBDs are transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito from the    Aedes species. Preventing or reducing VBDs continues to depend mainly on vector control and interrupting human-vector contact. Risk communication (RC) is the interactive exchange of information about hazards among experts and individuals. As it influences individuals’ behaviour a better understanding of how it works is vital to improving RC strategies in the context of VBD prevention and control strategies. Our study highlighted the complexity of this matter as we found that there are multiple factors including the volume of information trust experience with a similar disease and cultural schemas that determine how people cope with risk and information. We recommend broadening the use and scope of media platforms to share information and to customise the messages taking the cultural schemas of the community into account.    ,
PMC7153886,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\272_21_abstract.xml,      Background   Influenza continues to cause seasonal epidemics and pandemics in humans. The burden of influenza is underestimated by traditional laboratory-based surveillance and modelled estimates are required for influenza-attributable morbidity and mortality. We aimed to estimate the influenza-attributable hospitalisation in Australia by influenza type.       Methods   A generalised-additive regression model was used to estimate type- and age-specific influenza-attributable hospitalisation rates per 100000 population by principal diagnosis in Australia from 2001 through 2013. Weekly counts of laboratory-confirmed influenza notifications and by type influenza A and B were used as covariates in the model. Main principal diagnosis categories of interest were influenza and pneumonia and respiratory admissions. A smoothing spline was used to control for unmeasured time varying factors. Results for 2009 in which the pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus circulated were not included in annual averages and are reported separately.       Results   During the study period the estimated annual average all-age annual respiratory hospitalisation rates attributable to seasonal influenza type A B and total influenza were 45.4 (95% CI: 34.9 55.9) 32.6 (95% CI: 22.8 42.4) and 76.9 (95% CI: 73.6 80.2) per 100000 population respectively. During 2009 the estimated total pandemic influenza-attributable all-age respiratory hospitalisation rate was 56.1 (95% CI: 47.4 64.9) per 100000. Older adults (≥85 years of age) experienced the highest influenza-attributable hospitalisation rates for both seasonal and 2009 pandemic influenza. Collinearity between influenza A and B time series in some years limited the ability of the model to resolve differences in influenza attribution between the two virus types.       Conclusion   Both seasonal and pandemic influenza caused considerable morbidity in Australia during the years studied particularly among older adults. The pandemic hospitalisation rate in 2009 was lower than the average overall annual rate for seasonal influenza but young to middle aged adults experience a hospitalisation rate similar to that of severe seasonal influenza.    ,

In the past large outbreaks of febrile illness related to bovine ephemeral fever and Ibaraki viruses severely affected the cattle industry in that region. In recent years vaccines against these viruses have reduced the occurrence of diseases although the viruses are still circulating and have occasionally caused sporadic and small-scaled epidemics. Over a long-term monitoring period many arboviruses other than the above-mentioned viruses have been isolated from cattle and    Culicoides biting midges in Japan. Several novel arboviruses that may infect ruminants (e.g. mosquito- and tick-borne arboviruses) were recently reported in mainland China based on extensive surveillance. It is noteworthy that some are suspected of being associated with cattle diseases. Malformed calves exposed to an intrauterine infection with orthobunyaviruses (e.g. Peaton and Shamonda viruses) have been observed. Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus serotype 6 caused a sudden outbreak of hemorrhagic disease in cattle in Japan. Unfortunately the pathogenicity of many other viruses in ruminants has been uncertain although these viruses potentially affect livestock production. As global transportation grows the risk of an accidental incursion of arboviruses is likely to increase in previously non-endemic areas. Global warming will also certainly affect the distribution and active period of vectors and thus the range of virus spreads will expand to higher-latitude regions. To prevent anticipated damages to the livestock industry the monitoring system for arboviral circulation and incursion should be strengthened; moreover the sharing of information and preventive strategies will be essential in East Asia.    ,
PMC7154156,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\274_16_abstract.xml,   Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) cause important health problems in all cattle husbandry systems. It contributes substantially to the use of antimicrobial substances and compromises animal welfare and the sustainability of the cattle industry. The existing preventive measures of BRD focus at the individual animal or herd level and include vaccination mass treatment with antimicrobials and improvement of the animal's environment and general health status. Despite progress in our understanding of disease mechanism and technological development the current preventive measures are not sufficiently effective. Thus there is a need for alternative sustainable strategies to combat the disease. Some of the primary infectious agents in the BRD complex are viruses that are easily transmitted between herds such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). This conceptual analysis presents arguments for combatting BRD through improved external biosecurity in the cattle herds. As an example of a population-based approach to the control of BRD the Norwegian BRSV/BCoV control-program is presented. The program is voluntary and launched by the national cattle industry. The core principle is classification of herds based on antibody testing and subsequent prevention of virus-introduction through improved biosecurity measures. Measures include external herd biosecurity barriers and regulations in the organization of animal trade to reduce direct and indirect transmission of virus. Improved biosecurity in a large proportion of herds will lead to a considerable effect at the population level. Positive herds are believed to gain freedom by time if new introduction is avoided. Vaccination is not used as part of the program. Dissemination of information to producers and veterinarians is essential. We believe that reducing the incidence of BRD in cattle is essential and will lead to reduced antimicrobial usage while at the same time improving animal health welfare and production. Alternative approaches to the traditional control measures are needed.  ,

Mechanisms explaining the efficient immune activation after single injection with the VSV-EBOV vaccine remain mainly unknown. Here using the clinically available VSV-EBOV vaccine (Ervebo) we show that the cell-intrinsic expression of the interferon-inhibitor    Usp18 in CD169   + macrophages is one important factor modulating the anti-Ebola virus immune response. The absence of    Usp18 in CD169   + macrophages led to the reduced local replication of VSV-EBOV followed by a diminished innate as well as adaptive immune response. In line    CD169-Cre   +/ki x    Usp18   fl/fl mice showed reduced innate and adaptive immune responses against the VSV wildtype strain and died quickly after infection suggesting that a lack of    Usp18 makes mice more susceptible to the side effects of the VSV vector. In conclusion our study shows that    Usp18 expression in CD169   + macrophages is one important surrogate marker for effective vaccination against VSV-EBOV and probably other VSV-based vaccines also.    ,
PMC7157486,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\276_14_abstract.xml,   The Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreak that began in Kivu province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in July 2018 is the second largest in history. It is also the largest and most deadly of the ten Ebola outbreaks to occur in DRC the country where Ebola was first identified during the 1976 Yambuku outbreak. The Kivu region is one of the most challenging locations in which to organize humanitarian assistance. It is an active conflict zone in which numerous armed groups are conducting violent acts often directed against the inhabitants healthcare and relief workers and peacekeepers. EVD has been especially problematic in pregnancy—previous outbreaks both in DRC and other countries have resulted in very high mortality rates among pregnant women and especially their infants with maternal mortality in some outbreaks reaching over 90% and perinatal mortality 100%. The development and implementation of the Merck rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine for Ebola infection has been a tremendous public health advance in preventing EVD being used successfully in both the West Africa Ebola epidemic and the Équateur DRC Ebola outbreak. But from the start of the Kivu outbreak policy decisions had resulted in excluding pregnant and lactating women and their infants from receiving it during extensive ring vaccination efforts. In June 2019 this policy was reversed 10 months after the start of the outbreak. Pregnant and lactating women are now permitted not only the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine in the continuing Kivu outbreak but also the newly implemented Ad26.ZEBOV/MVA-BN vaccine.  ,
PMC7157636,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\277_20_abstract.xml,   Nipah virus (NiV) is an emergent pathogen capable of causing acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis in pigs and humans. A high fatality rate and broad host tropism makes NiV a serious public and animal health concern. There is therefore an urgent need for a NiV vaccines to protect animals and humans. In this study we investigated the immunogenicity of bovine herpesvirus (BoHV-4) vectors expressing either NiV attachment (G) or fusion (F) glycoproteins BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK or BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK respectively in pigs. The vaccines were benchmarked against a canarypox (ALVAC) vector expressing NiV G previously demonstrated to induce protective immunity in pigs. Both BoHV-4 vectors induced robust antigen-specific antibody responses. BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK stimulated NiV-neutralizing antibody titers comparable to ALVAC NiV G and greater than those induced by BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK. In contrast only BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK immunized pigs had antibodies capable of significantly neutralizing NiV G and F-mediated cell fusion. All three vectored vaccines evoked antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses which were particularly strong in BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-GΔTK immunized pigs and to a lesser extent BoHV-4-A-CMV-NiV-FΔTK. These findings emphasize the potential of BoHV-4 vectors for inducing antibody and cell-mediated immunity in pigs and provide a solid basis for the further evaluation of these vectored NiV vaccine candidates.  ,

Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) cause severe disease in humans typically with high case fatality rates. HIS mouse studies have been performed to investigate the pathogenesis and immune responses to VHFs that must be handled in high-containment laboratory facilities. Here we summarize studies on filoviruses nairoviruses phenuiviruses and hantaviruses and discuss the knowledge gained from using various HIS mouse models. Furthermore we discuss the complexities of designing and interpreting studies utilizing HIS mice while highlighting additional questions about VHFs that can still be addressed using HIS mouse models.  ,
PMC7157703,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\279_15_abstract.xml,   Live-attenuated vaccines (LAV) represent one of the most important medical innovations in human history. In the past three centuries LAV have saved hundreds of millions of lives and will continue to do so for many decades to come. Interestingly the most successful LAVs such as the smallpox vaccine the measles vaccine and the yellow fever vaccine have been isolated and/or developed in a purely empirical manner without any understanding of the immunological mechanisms they trigger. Today the mechanisms governing potent LAV immunogenicity and long-term induced protective immunity continue to be elusive and therefore hamper the rational design of innovative vaccine strategies. A serious roadblock to understanding LAV-induced immunity has been the lack of suitable and cost-effective animal models that can accurately mimic human immune responses. In the last two decades human-immune system mice (HIS mice) i.e. mice engrafted with components of the human immune system have been instrumental in investigating the life-cycle and immune responses to multiple human-tropic pathogens. However their use in LAV research has remained limited. Here we discuss the strong potential of LAVs as tools to enhance our understanding of human immunity and review the past current and future contributions of HIS mice to this endeavor.   ,
PMC7157777,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\280_17_abstract.xml,   Efficient and safe vaccines against yellow fever (e.g. YFV-17D) that provide long-lasting protection by rapidly inducing neutralizing antibody responses exist. However the vaccine supply cannot cope with an increasing demand posed by urban outbreaks in recent years. Here we report that JE-CVax/Imojev a YFV-17D-based chimeric Japanese encephalitis vaccine also efficiently protects against YFV infection in mice. In case of shortage of the YFV vaccine during yellow fever outbreaks (off-label) use of JE-CVax/Imojev may be considered. Moreover wider use of JE-CVax/Imojev in Asia may lower the risk of the much-feared YFV spillover to the continent. More generally chimeric vaccines that combine surface antigens and replication machineries of two distinct flaviviruses may be considered dual vaccines for the latter pathogen without induction of surface-specific antibodies. Following this rationale novel flavivirus vaccines that do not hold a risk for antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection (inherent to current dengue vaccines and dengue vaccine candidates) could be designed.  ,
PMC7157777,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\281_18_abstract.xml,   ABSTRACT  Recent outbreaks of yellow fever virus (YFV) in West Africa and Brazil resulted in rapid depletion of global vaccine emergency stockpiles and raised concerns about being unprepared against future YFV epidemics. Here we report that a live attenuated virus similar to the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine JE-CVax/Imojev that consists of YFV-17D vaccine from which the structural (prM/E) genes have been replaced with those of the JEV SA14-14-2 vaccine strain confers full protection in mice against lethal YFV challenge. In contrast to the YFV-17D-mediated protection against YFV this protection is not mediated by neutralizing antibodies but correlates with YFV-specific nonneutralizing antibodies and T cell responses against cell-associated YFV NS1 and other YFV nonstructural (NS) proteins. Our findings reveal the potential of YFV NS proteins to mediate protection and demonstrate that chimeric flavivirus vaccines such as Imojev could confer protection against two flaviviruses. This dual protection may have implications for the possible off-label use of JE-CVax in case of emergency and vaccine shortage during YFV outbreaks. In addition populations in Asia that have been vaccinated with Imojev may already be protected against YFV should outbreaks ever occur on that continent as several countries/regions in the Asia-Pacific are vulnerable to international spread of the YFV.  ,
PMC7158580,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\282_15_abstract.xml,   Summary  WHO has listed several priority diseases with epidemic potential for which there are no or insufficient medical countermeasures. In response the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (with support from PricewaterhouseCoopers) coordinated subject matter experts to create a preparedness plan for Disease X. Disease X is caused by Pathogen X an infectious agent that is not currently known to cause human disease but an aetiologic agent of a future outbreak with epidemic or pandemic potential. We have identified crucial areas for acceleration in medical countermeasure product development and international coordination. We have also reviewed novel platforms and process improvements related to manufacturing which could revolutionise the response to the next pandemic. Finally we created several coordination and engagement guides. These guides range from the rational design of an intervention target product profile to the key facets of vaccine and therapeutic development to accelerated manufacturing and regulatory mechanisms. In this Personal View we provide a high-level summary of the outcomes of the medical countermeasure development workstream intended for a broad audience including academia medical countermeasure developers and multilateral coordinating bodies. We hope that they might find this piece useful in prioritising strategic investments and efforts to accelerate medical countermeasure development. We observed that in-depth analyses of clinical trial design chemistry manufacturing and control activities and accelerated regulatory pathways are necessary for shortening the timelines for the product development of medical countermeasures. We intend to cover these topics in future publications.  ,
PMC7158664,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\283_17_abstract.xml,   Growing interest in universal influenza vaccines and novel administration routes has led to the development of alternative serological assays that are able to detect antibodies against conserved epitopes. We present a competitive ELISA method that is able to accurately determine the ratio of serum immunoglobulin G directed against the different domains of the hemagglutinin the head and the stalk. Human serum samples were treated with two variants of the hemagglutinin protein from the A/California/7/2009 influenza virus. The signals detected were assigned to different groups of antibodies and presented as a ratio between head and stalk domains. A subset of selected sera was also tested by hemagglutination inhibition single radial hemolysis microneutralization and enzyme-linked lectin assays. Pre-vaccination samples from adults showed a quite high presence of anti-stalk antibodies and the results were substantially in line with those of the classical serological assays. By contrast pre-vaccination samples from children did not present anti-stalk antibodies and the majority of the anti-hemagglutinin antibodies that were detected after vaccination were directed against the head domain. The presented approach when supported by further assays can be used to assess the presence of specific anti-stalk antibodies and the potential boost of broadly protective antibodies especially in the case of novel universal influenza vaccine approaches.  ,
PMC7158820,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\284_16_abstract.xml,   Summary  Hemagglutinins (HAs) from human influenza viruses adapt to bind α2-6-linked sialosides overcoming a receptor-defined species barrier distinct from the α2-3 specificity of avian virus progenitors. Additionally human-adapted HAs gain glycosylation sites over time although their biological function is poorly defined. Using quantitative glycomic analysis we show that HAs from human pandemic viruses exhibit significant proportions of high-mannose type N-linked glycans throughout the head domain. By contrast poorly adapted avian-origin HAs contain predominately complex-type glycans which have greater structural diversity. Although oligomannose levels vary they are present in all tested recombinant HAs and whole viruses and can be specifically targeted for universal detection. The positions of high-mannose glycosites on the HA of human H1N1 and H3N2 strains are conserved. Additionally high-mannose-binding lectins possess a broad capacity to neutralize and prevent infection with contemporary H3N2 strains. These findings reveal the biological significance of HA glycosylation and therapeutic potential of targeting these structures.  ,

PMC7160973,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\288_13_abstract.xml,      Background   Tobacco consumption is more life-threatening in people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than within the general population; therefore people living with HIV (PLWH) should be highly motivated to take action towards quitting smoking at or after HIV diagnosis. The aim of this systematic review with meta-analysis was to investigate changes in smoking habits among PLWH over time.       Main text   We considered prospective and retrospective cohort studies including PLWH aged 15 years and above which have measured the prevalence of tobacco smoking (current former or never) at study initiation and completion and published between January 1 2000 and April 15 2018 without language or geographical restriction. We searched PubMed EMBASE Web of Science Africa Journal Online and Global Index Medicus. We used a random-effects model to pool data. Nine studies were included. The proportion of current and former smokers decreased slightly over time around 2.5 and 3.8% respectively. However the proportion of never smokers decreased sharply by 22.5% and there were 2.1 and 1.5% PLWH who shifted from never and former smoking to current smoking respectively. On the other hand 10.5% PLWH shifted from current to former smoking 7.1% tried to quit tobacco consumption but failed and 10.1% stayed in the “never smoking” category over time.       Conclusions   PLWH seem not to change positively their smoking habits towards quitting tobacco consumption. There is urgent need to increase actions aimed at helping this vulnerable population to quit tobacco consumption including individually tailored therapeutic education psychosocial and pharmacologic supports.    ,

However the use of such data as an alarm signal is rarely considered consciously when planning programmes. The present study aims to investigate the spatial distribution pattern of the infestation of     Aedes aegypti considering the data available in the     Ae. aegypti Infestation Index Rapid Survey (LIRAa) for the city of Campina Grande Paraíba State in Brazil.          Methods   The global and local Moranʼs indices were used in spatial analysis to measure the effects of spatial dependencies between neighbourhoods using secondary data related to HI and BI gathered from surveillance service.       Results   Our analysis shows that there is a predominance of high rates of mosquito infestation placing Campina Grande at a near-constant risk of arbovirus outbreaks and epidemics. A highly significant Moranʼs index value (    P &lt; 0.001) was observed indicating a positive spatial dependency between the neighbourhoods in Campina Grande. Using the Moran mapping and LISA mapping the autocorrelation patterns of     Ae. aegypti infestation rates among neighbourhoods have revealed hotpots that should be considered a priority to preventive actions of the entomological surveillance services. Predominance of high infestation rates and clearer relationships of these between neighbourhoods were observed between the months of May and July the period with the highest rainfall in the city.          Conclusions   This analysis is an innovative strategy capable of providing detailed information on infestation locations to the relevant public health authorities which will enable a more efficient allocation of resources particularly for arbovirus prevention.           ,
PMC7164675,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\290_31_abstract.xml,   Zoonotic diseases affect resource-poor tropical communities disproportionately and are linked to human use and modification of ecosystems. Disentangling the socio-ecological mechanisms by which ecosystem change precipitates impacts of pathogens is critical for predicting disease risk and designing effective intervention strategies. Despite the global “One Health” initiative predictive models for tropical zoonotic diseases often focus on narrow ranges of risk factors and are rarely scaled to intervention programs and ecosystem use. This study uses a participatory co-production approach to address this disconnect between science policy and implementation by developing more informative disease models for a fatal tick-borne viral haemorrhagic disease Kyasanur Forest Disease (KFD) that is spreading across degraded forest ecosystems in India. We integrated knowledge across disciplines to identify key risk factors and needs with actors and beneficiaries across the relevant policy sectors to understand disease patterns and develop decision support tools. Human case locations (2014–2018) and spatial machine learning quantified the relative role of risk factors including forest cover and loss host densities and public health access in driving landscape-scale disease patterns in a long-affected district (Shivamogga Karnataka State). Models combining forest metrics livestock densities and elevation accurately predicted spatial patterns in human KFD cases (2014–2018). Consistent with suggestions that KFD is an “ecotonal” disease landscapes at higher risk for human KFD contained diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation high indigenous cattle density and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Models predicted new hotspots of outbreaks in 2019 indicating their value for spatial targeting of intervention. Co-production was vital for: gathering outbreak data that reflected locations of exposure in the landscape; better understanding contextual socio-ecological risk factors; and tailoring the spatial grain and outputs to the scale of forest use and public health interventions. We argue this inter-disciplinary approach to risk prediction is applicable across zoonotic diseases in tropical settings.  ,
PMC7164675,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\291_32_abstract.xml,   Author summary  Worldwide impacts of zoonotic diseases that cycle between animals and people are concentrated in tropical communities and often linked to the way people use and change ecosystems. Interventions for zoonotic diseases could be targeted better using risk maps based on computer models that integrate social and ecological risk factors across degraded ecosystems. However such predictive models often perform poorly at local scales incorporate narrow ranges of risk factors and are disconnected from policy managers and interventions. Co-production brings together stakeholders and knowledge across the human health animal health and environmental sectors aligning with the OneHealth Initiative to develop more informative predictive tools for zoonotic diseases. Through co-production we develop predictive models for a fatal tick-borne disease Kyasanur Forest Diseases (KFD) that is spreading across the degraded Western Ghats forest in India. These models incorporating contextual risk factors identified by stakeholders accurately predicted patterns in human cases of KFD (2014–2018) in Shivamogga district Karnataka State and identified new hotspots of infection during the subsequent 2019 outbreak. Landscapes at highest risk encompassed diverse forest-plantation mosaics with high coverage of moist evergreen forest and plantation high indigenous cattle density and low coverage of dry deciduous forest. Co-production resulted in outbreak data that reflected where exposure occurred in the landscape and outputs of value for targeting of interventions matched to the scale of forest use and public health interventions.  ,
PMC7167862,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\292_19_abstract.xml,   Lassa fever is a viral hemorrhagic illness responsible for thousands of human deaths in West Africa yearly. Rodents are known as natural reservoirs of the causative Lassa mammarenavirus (LASV) while humans are regarded as incidental spill-over hosts. Analysis of genetic sequences continues to add to our understanding of the evolutionary history emergence patterns and the epidemiology of LASV. Hitherto the source of data in such investigations has mainly comprised human clinical samples. Presently a rise in the quantity of virus strains accessed through ecological studies over the last 15 years now allows us to explore how LASV sequences obtained from rodents might affect phylogenetic patterns. In this study we phylogenetically compared LASV sequences obtained from both rodents and humans across West Africa including those from two localities highly endemic for the disease: Ekpoma in Nigeria and Kenema in Sierra Leone. We performed a time-calibrated phylogeny using a Bayesian analysis on 198 taxa including 102 sequences from rodents and 96 from humans. Contrary to expectation our results show that LASV strains detected in humans within these localities even those sampled recently are consistently ancient to those circulating in rodents in the same area. We discuss the possibilities connected to this preliminary outcome. We also propose modalities to guide more comprehensive comparisons of human and rodent data in LASV molecular epidemiological studies.  ,

The aim of our study was to investigate which diagnostic test is most accurate to detect HEV infection in immunocompetent and immunosuppressed patients in a real world setting. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 1165 patients tested for HEV antibodies and HEV PCR at the same time point. Clinical laboratory and virological data were taken from patient charts. HEV IgA was measured in a subgroup of 185 patients. Results: HEV RNA was detectable in 61 patients (5.2%); most of them (n = 49 80.3%/n = 43 70.5%) were HEV IgM+ and IgG+; however 12 patients (19.6%) were HEV RNA positive/HEV IgM negative and 17 patients (27.8%) were HEV RNA positive/HEV IgG negative. Ten HEV RNA positive patients (16.4%) had neither HEV IgG nor IgM antibodies. Importantly all of them were immunosuppressed. HEV IgA testing was less sensitive than HEV IgM for HEV diagnosis. Conclusions: HEV infection can be overlooked in patients without HEV specific antibodies. Performing PCR is necessary to diagnose or exclude HEV infection in immunocompromised hosts. In immunocompetent patients a screening based on HEV antibodies (IgG/IgM) is sufficient.  ,
PMC7168596,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\294_16_abstract.xml,   Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) is one of the four major viral pathogens associated with acute respiratory tract infections (ARI) and creates a substantial burden of disease particularly in young children (&lt;5 years) and older individuals (≥65 years). The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiological behavior of HMPV in Mexico. This retrospective study was conducted over a nine-year period and used 7283 influenza-negative respiratory samples from hospitalized and deceased patients who presented Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI). The samples were processed with the help of qualitative multiplex RT-PCR for simultaneous detection of 14 respiratory viruses (xTAG   ® RVP FAST v2). 40.8% of the samples were positive for respiratory viruses mainly rhinovirus/enterovirus (47.6%) respiratory syncytial virus (15.9%) HMPV (11.1%) and parainfluenza virus (8.9%). Other respiratory viruses and co-infections accounted for 16.5%. HMPV infects all age groups but the most affected group was infants between 29 days and 9 years of age (65.6%) and adults who are 40 years and older (25.7%). HMPV circulates every year from November to April and the highest circulation was observed in late winter. The results of this study aim to raise awareness among clinicians about the high epidemiological impact of HMPV in young children and older individuals in order to reduce the economic burden in terms of health care costs.     ,
PMC7168622,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\295_15_abstract.xml,   West Nile virus (WNV) continues to be a major cause of human arboviral neuroinvasive disease. Susceptible non-human vertebrates are particularly diverse ranging from commonly affected birds and horses to less commonly affected species such as alligators. This review summarizes the pathology caused by West Nile virus during natural infections of humans and non-human animals. While the most well-known findings in human infection involve the central nervous system WNV can also cause significant lesions in the heart kidneys and eyes. Time has also revealed chronic neurologic sequelae related to prior human WNV infection. Similarly neurologic disease is a prominent manifestation of WNV infection in most non-human non-host animals. However in some avian species which serve as the vertebrate host for WNV maintenance in nature severe systemic disease can occur with neurologic cardiac intestinal and renal injury leading to death. The pathology seen in experimental animal models of West Nile virus infection and knowledge gains on viral pathogenesis derived from these animal models are also briefly discussed. A gap in the current literature exists regarding the relationship between the neurotropic nature of WNV in vertebrates virus propagation and transmission in nature. This and other knowledge gaps and future directions for research into WNV pathology are addressed.  ,
PMC7168633,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\296_16_abstract.xml,   Flaviviruses are enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA arboviruses infectious to humans and many other animals and are transmitted primarily via tick or mosquito vectors. Capsid is the primary structural protein to interact with viral genome within virus particles and is therefore necessary for efficient packaging. However in cells capsid interacts with many proteins and nucleic acids and we are only beginning to understand the broad range of functions of flaviviral capsids. It is known that capsid dimers interact with the membrane of lipid droplets aiding in both viral packaging and storage of capsid prior to packaging. However capsid dimers can bind a range of nucleic acid templates    in vitro and likely interact with a range of targets during the flavivirus lifecycle. Capsid may interact with host RNAs resulting in altered RNA splicing and RNA transcription. Capsid may also bind short interfering-RNAs and has been proposed to sequester these species to protect flaviviruses from the invertebrate siRNA pathways. Capsid can also be found in the nucleolus where it wreaks havoc on ribosome biogenesis. Here we review flavivirus capsid structure nucleic acid interactions and how these give rise to multiple functions. We also discuss how these features might be exploited either in the design of effective antivirals or novel vaccine strategies.    ,

The characteristics of the environment as well as the processes that support the maintenance of life and that characterize the execution of activities of daily life generally present periodic variations which are mostly synchronized with the light–dark cycle determined by Earth’s rotation on its axis. These rhythms with 24-h periodicity defined as circadian influence events linked to the interaction between hosts and hosted microorganisms and can dramatically determine the outcome of this interplay. As for the various pathological conditions resulting from host–microorganism interactions a particularly interesting scenario concerns infections by viruses. When a viral agent enters the body it alters the biological processes of the infected cells in order to favour its replication and to spread to various tissues. Though our knowledge concerning the mutual influence between the biological clock and viruses is still limited recent studies start to unravel interesting aspects of the clock–virus molecular interplay. Three different aspects of this interplay are addressed in this mini-review and include the circadian regulation of both innate and adaptive immune systems the impact of the biological clock on viral infection itself and finally the putative perturbations that the virus may confer to the clock leading to its deregulation.  ,
PMC7168643,3-part\_summary\myoutputdir\298_16_abstract.xml,   Seasonal influenza epidemics remain one of the largest public health burdens nowadays. The best and most effective strategy to date in preventing influenza infection is a worldwide vaccination campaign. Currently two vaccines are available to the public for the treatment of influenza infection the chemically Inactivated Influenza Vaccine (IIV) and the Live Attenuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV). However the LAIV is not recommended for parts of the population such as children under the age of two immunocompromised individuals the elderly and pregnant adults. In order to improve the safety of the LAIV and make it available to more of the population we sought to further attenuate the LAIV. In this study we demonstrate that the influenza A virus (IAV) master donor virus (MDV) A/Ann Arbor/6/60 H2N2 LAIV can inhibit host gene expression using both the PA-X and NS1 proteins. Furthermore we show that by removing PA-X we can limit the replication of the MDV LAIV in a mouse model while maintaining full protective efficacy. This work demonstrates a broadly applicable strategy of tuning the amount of host antiviral responses induced by the IAV MDV for the development of newer and safer LAIVs. Moreover our results also demonstrate for the first time the feasibility of genetically manipulating the backbone of the IAV MDV to improve the efficacy of the current IAV LAIV.  ,

Currently there are only two full-length genomic sequences of EV-B83 in the GenBank database and few    VP1 region sequences. The aetiology and epidemiology of EV-B83 is unclear. 24 stool specimens were collected from twelve AFP patients and 298 stool specimens were collected from 298 healthy children in support of polio eradication activities in Tibet in 1999. Two polioviruses (isolated by L20B cell) and one non-polio enterovirus (isolated by RD cell) were isolated from AFP patients and nine polioviruses (isolated by L20B cell) and 90 non-polio enteroviruses (isolated by RD cell) were isolated from health children. Through molecular typing we confirmed that the six of non-polio enteroviruses belong to EV-B83. The sequence similarity between the    VP1 region of the Tibet isolates and that of the EV-B83 prototype strain was 80%. The maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree of the partial    VP1 region in EV-B83 demonstrated that EV-B83 formed four genotypes globally during the evolution process. The six Tibet EV-B83 strains formed the D genotype alone. Recombination analysis of Tibet EV-B83 showed that CV-B4 CV-A9 EV-B80 and EV-B106 may act as recombinant donors in multiple regions. The serum neutralization test showed that the antibody-positive rate was 58.8% and GMT was 1:19.70 which was higher than the previously reported results of EV-B106 and EV-B80. Temperature sensitivity test results showed that the six Tibet EV-B83 strains were temperature-insensitive with stronger virulence and potential infectivity which was consistent with the results of the serum neutralization test. This study enriched the genome-wide sequence epidemiological characteristics and provided basic data for the follow-up study of EV-B83.    ,
