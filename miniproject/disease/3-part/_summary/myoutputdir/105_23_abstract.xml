  <title>Methods</title>
  <p>An ecological study was carried out to observe time trends in the number of hospitalizations with inflammatory polyneuropathy and Guillain‐Barré syndrome (
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GBS</styled-content>) in the state of Rio de Janeiro from 1997 to 2017. Increases in 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GBS</styled-content> from month to month were assessed using a Farrington test. In addition, a cross‐sectional study was conducted analyzing 50 adults hospitalized for inflammatory polyneuropathies from 2015 to 2017. The extent to which Zika virus symptoms explained 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GBS</styled-content> hospitalizations was evaluated using a calibration test.

  <title>Results</title>
  <p>There were significant increases (Farrington test, 
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001) in the incidence of 
   <styled-content style="fixed-case" toggle="no">GBS</styled-content> following the introduction of influenza A/H1N1 in 2009, dengue virus type 4 in 2013, and Zika virus in 2015. Of 50 patients hospitalized, 14 (28.0%) were diagnosed with arboviruses, 9 (18.0%) with other viruses, and the remainder with other causes of such neuropathies. Statistical models based on cases of emerging viruses accurately predicted neurological sequelae, such as
