 <p>Avian influenza virus (AIV) can cause severe diseases in poultry worldwide. H6N1 AIV was the dominant enzootic subtype in 1985 in the chicken farms of Taiwan until the initial outbreak of a low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) H5N2 virus in 2003; thereafter, this and other LPAIs have been sporadically detected. In 2015, the outbreak of three novel H5Nx viruses of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) emerged and devastated Taiwanese chicken and waterfowl industries. The mechanism of variation in pathogenicity among these viruses is unclear; but, in light of the many biological functions of viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1), including interferon (IFN) antagonist and host range determinant, we hypothesized that NS genetic diversity contributes to AIV pathogenesis. To determine the impact of NS1 variants on viral infection dynamics, we established a reverse genetics system with the genetic backbone of the enzootic Taiwanese H6N1 for generation of reassortant AIVs carrying exogenous NS segments of three different Taiwanese H5N2 strains. We observed distinct cellular distributions of NS1 among the reassortant viruses. Moreover, exchange of the NS segment significantly influenced growth kinetics and induction of cytokines [IFN-α, IFN-β, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)] in an NS1- and host-specific manner. The impact of NS1 variants on viral replication appears related to their synergic effects on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity and IFN response. With these approaches, we revealed that NS1 is a key factor responsible for the diverse characteristics of AIVs in Taiwan.</p>
