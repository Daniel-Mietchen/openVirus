<p>As FAdV4 PX plays a major role in FAdV4-induced apoptosis, we attempted to find out the localization of PX in FAdV4-infected cells or cells transfected with pRK5-FLAG-pX using an immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>a, PX was localized in the nucleus of cells with both FAdV4 infection and pRK5-FLAG-pX transfection, which prompted us to propose that the nuclear localization of PX might be necessary for PX-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a series of PX deletion mutants fused to the FLAG tag (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). We expressed these PX deletion mutants (from Δ1 to Δ6) and controls in LMH cells and examined the subcellular localization of these deletion mutants as well as apoptosis in these transfected cells. As a result, PX mutant Δ1(1-150 amino acids), similar to the full-length PX, was merely localized in the nucleus, while mutants Δ2 and Δ3 were distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. In comparison, PX mutants (Δ4-Δ6) were largely accumulated in the cytoplasm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>c), suggesting that the domains of amino acids 1-30 and 120-150 were associated with the distribution of PX. Interestingly, PX mutant Δ1 retained most of the apoptosis-inducing ability of PX. In comparison, the apoptosis induced by PX mutants Δ2-Δ4 markedly decreased, and little apoptosis was observed in cells with PX mutants Δ5 or Δ6 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00228-f003">Figure 3</xref>d,e). These data suggest that apoptosis induced by PX and its mutants is associated with their nuclear localization.
