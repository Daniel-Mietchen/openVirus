<p>FAdV4 is a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) virus, and its genome, 43.7 kb, encodes approximately 11 structural proteins and 32 non-structural proteins [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Currently, there are few reports available regarding the pathogenesis of FAdV4. It was found that Hexon and Fiber 2 genes of FAdV4 HNJZ strain (GenBank ID: KU558760.1) were closely associated with the virulence of the virus [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, the experimental evidence shows that the natural deficiency of 1966 bp in the viral genome was not essential for the increased virulence of the recently isolated FAdV4 in China [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Currently, the virulence-associated factors of FAdV4 responsible for clinical HHS are still unknown.
