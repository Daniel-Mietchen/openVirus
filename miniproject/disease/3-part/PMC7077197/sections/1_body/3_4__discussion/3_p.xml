<p>In human adenovirus (HAd), PX, also known as Mu, modulates the expression of E2 protein [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and plays an important role in attaching the linear double-stranded DNA genome to the capsid during replication [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the low homology (34.2%) of the PX amino acid sequence between HAd2/5 (GenBank ID: AC_000007.1/AC_000008.1) and FAdV4 (GenBank ID: NC_015323.1) indicates that the function of FAdV4 PX may vary from that of HAd. Our data indicate, for the first time, FAdV4 PX as a major viral protein inducing apoptosis in host cells, which may serve as a virulence factor for pathogenic FAdV4. In addition to PX, other structural proteins of FAdV4, such as Hexon and Fiber 2, were found to be the crucial factors determining the pathogenicity of FAdV4 [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00228" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It was reported that Hexon or Fiber2 of FAdV4 HNJZ strain caused apoptosis to more or less degree. Our data show that FAdV4 PX induced much greater apoptosis in LMH cells than Hexon or Fiber2.
