<p>In recent years, several virulent FAdV4 strains were isolated and identified, including HNJZ, SDDZ (GenBank ID: KU558761.1), SXCZ (GenBank ID: KU558762.1), AHBZ (GenBank ID: KU569295.1), JSXZ (GenBank ID: KU569296.1) and HuBWH in China [

Interestingly, we found that all these Chinese FAdV4 stains had the same spontaneous amino acid substitutions at residues 11 (T to A) and 129 (T to A) in the PX protein when compared with non-pathogenic FAdV4 ON1 strain. Surprisingly, mutation of A11T, A129T or both A11/129T back, referring the PX sequence of non-pathogenic FAdV4 ON1 dramatically reduced apoptosis compared to that of virulent FAdV4 PX, indicating that aa 11 and 129 alanines are critical for PX-induced apoptosis. It seems that PX may serve as a virulence factor for pathogenic FAdV4 isolates because inhibition of apoptosis by caspase inhibitors significantly reduced the viral growth in LMH cells. Thus PX-induced apoptosis contributed at least in part to FAdV4-induced apoptosis, which facilitates viral replication. Up to now, some researchers have established a reverse genetic system to generate recombinant FAdV4 [
