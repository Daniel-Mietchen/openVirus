<p>LMH cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were seeded on 12-well plates and cultured for 12 h, followed by infection with FAdV4 or transfection with indicated plasmids (1 μg per well). Thirty-six hours after treatment, the one-layer cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA). The expressions of FAdV4 PX or FLAG-PX were detected with mouse anti-PX monoclonal antibodies or mouse anti-FLAG monoclonal antibodies, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies. The cells were covered with ProLong
 <sup>TM</sup> Gold antifade reagent. The samples were observed under a confocal laser scanning microscope (Olympus Corporation, Tokyo, Japan).
