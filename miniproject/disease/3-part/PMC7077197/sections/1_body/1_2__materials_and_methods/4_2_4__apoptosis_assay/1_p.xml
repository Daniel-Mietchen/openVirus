<p>LMH cells (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>) were seeded on 12-well plates and cultured for 12 h, followed by infection with FAdV4 or transfection with indicated plasmids (1 μg per well). Twenty-four or forty-eight hours after treatment, cells were harvested, double stained with 7AAD and Annexin V-PE using apoptosis detection kit (BD Pharmingen
 <sup>TM</sup>), and examined by flow cytometry. The data were then analyzed with CellQuest Pro software, version 5.1 (BD).
