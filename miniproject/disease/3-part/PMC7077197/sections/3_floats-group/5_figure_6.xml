  <p>Inhibition of FAdV4-induced apoptosis by caspase-3 inhibitor restricted viral replication. LMH cells treated with z-DEVD-fmk (caspase-3 inhibitor) or DMSO or medium only as controls were infected with FAdV4 at a MOI of 0.1, respectively. At different time points (12, 24, 36, and 48h) post FAdV4 infection, the viral titers in cell cultures (
   <bold>a</bold>) and supernatants (
   <bold>b</bold>) were determined with TCID
   <sub>50</sub> using 96-well plates. Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean Â± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. The significance of the differences between the groups was performed by one-way ANOVA (* stands for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, and ** for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
