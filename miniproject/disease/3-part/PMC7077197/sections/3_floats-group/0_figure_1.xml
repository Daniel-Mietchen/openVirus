  <p>Fowl adenovirus serotype 4 (FAdV4) induced apoptosis in Leghorn male hepatocellular (LMH) cells. (
   <bold>a</bold>) FAdV4 infection caused a cytopathic effect (CPE) in LMH cells. LMH cells were mock-infected or infected with FAdV4 at an increased MOI of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10. Thirty-six hours after infection, LMH cells were visualized under a microscope. The scale bar represents 100μm. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Examination of the hexon viral protein in FAdV4-infected cells by Western Blot. Forty-eight hours after FAdV4 infection, structural protein hexon was examined with a Western Blot using an anti-hexon specific antibody. (
   <bold>c</bold>,
   <bold>d</bold>) FAdV4 infection caused apoptosis in LMH cells. LMH cells were infected with FAdV4 at an increased MOI of 0.01, 0.1, 1 and 10. At different time points (12, 24 and 48h) after infection, cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry. Mock-infected cells were used as controls. The percentage of apoptotic cells in (
   <bold>c</bold>) was quantified (
   <bold>d</bold>). (
   <bold>e</bold>) Inhibition of FAdV4-induced apoptosis by caspase inhibitors. LMH cells were seeded on 12-well plates and cultured overnight. Caspase inhibitors (z-VAD-fmk, z-DEVD-fmk, z-IETD-fmk and z-LEHD-fmk) were applied to cell culture for 2h prior to FAdV4 infection. Two hours after infection with FAdV4 at a MOI of 1, cells were cultured with indicated caspase inhibitors again. Forty-eight hours after infection, cells were harvested, stained with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD, and analyzed by flow cytometry. The percentage of apoptotic cells in (
   <bold>e</bold>) was quantified (
   <bold>f</bold>). Results are representative of three independent experiments. Data are presented as mean ± SD, 
   <italic>n</italic> = 3. The significance of differences between the groups was performed by one-way ANOVA (* stands for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05, ** for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01, and *** for 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001).
