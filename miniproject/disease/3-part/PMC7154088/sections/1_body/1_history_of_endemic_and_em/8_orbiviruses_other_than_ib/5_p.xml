<p>Yunnan orbivirus (YUOV) was first isolated from mosquitoes collected in the southern part of mainland China in 1997, and it was identified as a member of a new orbivirus species, 
 <italic>Yunnan orbivirus</italic>, in 2005 (
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>). A second serotype of 
 <italic>Yunnan orbivirus</italic> (YOUV-2), which is also called Middle Point virus, was obtained from healthy cattle in Australia in 1998 (
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>). In addition, another orbivirus related with YOUV was isolated from a blood sample of cattle in the southern part of mainland China in 2015 and was designated as Guangxi orbivirus (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>). Interestingly, YOUV was also isolated from cattle, sheep, a donkey, and a dog in Peru in 1997 (
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>). The infected animals showed neurological signs. Although no evidence of an association between YOUV and animal disease in East Asia has been described, this finding suggests its potential ability to cause neurological disease in domestic ruminants.
