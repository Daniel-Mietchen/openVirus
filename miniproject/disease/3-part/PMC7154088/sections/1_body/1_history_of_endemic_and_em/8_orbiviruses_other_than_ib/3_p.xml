<p>D'Aguilar virus (DAGV), which is a member of the species 
 <italic>Palyam virus</italic>, was first isolated in Australia in 1968 (

DAGV spread in southern Japan in the autumn of 2001, and affected calves with Chuzan disease-like symptoms were observed during the following winter and spring. During the epizootic period, no CHUV was isolated from cattle in the affected region. Precolostral sera of these calves clearly neutralized DAGV, suggesting its association with congenital malformations. The virus has been repeatedly isolated in the southern part of mainland Japan and Japan's southwestern Islands (
