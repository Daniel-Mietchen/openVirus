<p>Around the year 2000, the circulation of three orthobunyaviruses (genus 
 <italic>Orthobunyavirus</italic>) which were new in East Asia was identified. In 1999, Peaton virus (PEAV; species 
 <italic>Peaton orthobunyavirus</italic>), which was initially isolated in Australia in 1976 (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>), was obtained from sentinel cattle and 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges in Japan (
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>). A stocked virus isolated in 1987 was also identified as PEAV (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Australian researchers reported that the experimental infection of a pregnant ewe with PEAV induced congenital defects in its lamb (
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>). Precolostral sera obtained from 31 malformed calves between 1996 and 2016 were positive for PEAV, but negative for known teratogenic viruses (
 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>). These findings suggested that, like AKAV and AINOV, PEAV causes congenital malformations in calves and lambs. Antibodies to PEAV were detected in cattle in mainland China during large-scale sero-surveillance for AKAV (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). The seroprevalence (1.1%) of PEAV among cattle was also demonstrated in Korea during 2013â€“2015 surveillance (
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). In Taiwan, a partial sequence of PEAV was obtained from 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges (
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). The PEAV circulation was also observed in Israel (
 <xref rid="B158" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>). During the epizootic, PEAV specific gene was detected from a calf with hydranencephaly (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>).
