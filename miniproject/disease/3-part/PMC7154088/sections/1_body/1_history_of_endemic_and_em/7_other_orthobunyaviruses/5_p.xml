<p>It is of interest that the “S” and “L” RNA segments of SBV have a high degree of sequence identity with that of SHAV, but the sequence of the “M” RNA segment of SBV was genetically close to that of SATV (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> coinfection assays in mammalian and insect cells easily generate reassortants between SATV and SHAV (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>). The genetic reassortment might have also occurred among other orthobunyaviruses isolated from ruminants in East Asia and Australia in their evolutional history (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>). Although the impacts of PEAV, SATV, and SHAV remain unclear, these viruses should be listed among the teratogenic viruses in ruminants, and their circulation and the suspected cases associated with them should be monitored in East Asia.
