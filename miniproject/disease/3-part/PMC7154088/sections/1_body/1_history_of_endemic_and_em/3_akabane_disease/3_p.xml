<p>Outbreaks of encephalomyelitis caused by postnatal AKAV infection occurred in 2006 and 2011 with 180 and 165 deaths, respectively (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The AKAVs isolated in Japan since 1959 are clustered into two genogroups (I and II) (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). Genogroup I AKAVs have frequently been detected and/or isolated from affected cattle with encephalomyelitis (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). These isolates probably have high neurotropic and/or neurovirulence and cause the neurological disorders in cattle. Recent monitoring in Japan revealed that the frequent incursion of genogroup I AKAVs increased the number of postnatal encephalitis cases (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). There have been repeated epidemics of Akabane disease including both 
 <italic>in utero</italic> and postnatal infections in Japan (
