<p>Although the mortality rate of BEF is known to be &lt;1% (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), a high case-fatality rate due to a novel genogroup of BEFV was observed in several recent outbreaks in mainland China and Taiwan (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). This novel genogroup of BEFV was first isolated in mainland China in 2011 and was then detected in Taiwan and Japan 2 and 4 years later, respectively (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). These reports indicate that the virus rapidly spread in East Asia. The impact of BEF caused by the novel genogroup on dairy and beef production should thus be evaluated.
