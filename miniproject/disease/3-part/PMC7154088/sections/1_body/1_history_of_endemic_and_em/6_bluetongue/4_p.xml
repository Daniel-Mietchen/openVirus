<p>The genomic analysis of BTV isolates in East Asia demonstrated that most of them cluster within the eastern BTV topotype from Asia and Australia (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>). However, a part of segments of Chinese BTV-7 isolate probably originated from those of African BTV isolates which cluster within the western BTV topotype (
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>). The finding suggests that genetic reassortment events between different topotypes have occurred in regions neighboring to East Asia.
