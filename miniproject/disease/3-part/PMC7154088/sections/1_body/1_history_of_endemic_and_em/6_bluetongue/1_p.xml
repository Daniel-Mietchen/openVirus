 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> and consists of at least 27 serotypes (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges play a principal role in its transmission. The virus is widely distributed through the world. The circulation of a variety of BTV serotypes has been detected in East Asia. In 1974, bovine sera shown to be BTV-positive by a complement-fixation (CF) test were obtained from cattle in southern Japan (
