<p>BEFV has been isolated from several mosquito and 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species in Africa, Australia, and Central Asia (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but there has been no record of the isolation of BEFV from invertebrate vectors in East Asia so far (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). A laboratory experimental infection of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges indicated that, at the least, they are not efficient vectors of BEFV (
 <xref rid="B272" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>). The vector search will be essential to understand the epidemiology of BEFV in East Asia.
