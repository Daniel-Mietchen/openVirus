<p>A laboratory rearing system of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges was successfully established for limited species distributed in North America and Europe (
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>). This limitation hampers the progress in the assessments of the vector capacity of various other 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species. Instead, field-collected midges have often been used for checking the oral susceptibility and vector competence of ruminant arboviruses (
 <xref rid="B262" ref-type="bibr">262</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B266" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>). Unfortunately, the vector competence of 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges distributed in East Asia is poorly understood. The viral isolations from pools of field-collected midges which were identified at the species level have helped estimate vector species (
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>).
