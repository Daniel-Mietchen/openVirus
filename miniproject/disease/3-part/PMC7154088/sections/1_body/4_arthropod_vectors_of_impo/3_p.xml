 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species such as 
 <italic>C. imicola</italic> and 
 <italic>C. sonorensis</italic>, which play the principal role for ruminant arbovirus transmission in other regions, are not distributed in East Asia (
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>). The distribution of 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic>, which is a incriminate vector of ruminant arboviruses in Australia (
 <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>) was described in southern Japan and Taiwan (
 <xref rid="B255" ref-type="bibr">255</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B257" ref-type="bibr">257</xref>). However, molecular analyses using mitochondrial and nuclear DNA indicated that the specimens collected in southern Japan were distinct from the 
 <italic>C. brevitarsis</italic> specimens collected in Australia, and thus a new species was recorded: 
 <italic>Culicoides asiana</italic> (
 <xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B259" ref-type="bibr">259</xref>). The isolation of BTV from field-collected 
 <italic>C. asiana</italic> was successful (
 <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>), and an experimental infection indicated that this species is susceptible to AKAV (
 <xref rid="B261" ref-type="bibr">261</xref>).
