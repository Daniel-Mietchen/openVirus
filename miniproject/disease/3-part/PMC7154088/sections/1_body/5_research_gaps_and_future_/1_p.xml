<p>Vaccinations are probably the most effective preventive measures for arbovirus infections in domestic ruminants. The numbers of animals affected by AKAV, AINOV, CHUV, IBAV, and BEFV were dramatically reduced in Japan after the spread of vaccinations (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). However, limited effectiveness of the current vaccination strategy for BEFV was suggested in Taiwan and Israel (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>). It might be difficult to confer long-lasting effective immunity in vaccinated and infected cattle (
 <xref rid="B276" ref-type="bibr">276</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B277" ref-type="bibr">277</xref>), and this probably caused the repetition of BEF occurrence in the above-mentioned regions. It remains difficult to prevent the encephalomyelitis caused by postnatal AKAV infection (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). Vaccines for AKAV are generally administered to breeding cows but not other cattle such as fattening cattle and bulls. There is not yet enough preparation for the pathogens that have recently emerged, such as PEAV, SATV, SHAV, and YUOV, which are suspected to cause ruminant illnesses. Probable loss and future threat caused by these viruses also remain uncertain. Depending on the situation, the development of preventive measures for these arboviruses that have newly emerged in East Asia would be necessary.
