<p>The long-range dispersal of vector insects by winds is considered a principal cause of the introduction of arboviruses to geographically distant locations, including previously arbovirus-free areas (

 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne animal diseases from distant endemic areas have been estimated based on meteorological data (

 <italic>Culicoides</italic> species and BTVs into northern Australia (
 <xref rid="B291" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>). Atmospheric dispersion models would be useful to assess the potential sources of arbovirus incursions from outside of East Asia and their spread within the region.
