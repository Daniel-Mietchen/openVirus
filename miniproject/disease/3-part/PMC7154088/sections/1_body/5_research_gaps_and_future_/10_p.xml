<p>Finally, the construction of a network in East Asia and its neighboring countries would be essential to promote research on arbovirus infections of importance to livestock. The sharing of epidemiological information, diagnostic tools, and control/preventive strategies are highly important because neighboring countries are likely to experience the same problems due to arboviruses. Language barriers may present a challenge to information exchanging and sharing. Many scientific reports and public records from East Asian countries have been written in national languages such as Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, but a limited portion of them might have been translated in English. Unfortunately, the status of arbovirus infections in domestic ruminants in Mongolia and North Korea remains unclear. Regional cooperation would therefore be a crucial key to clarify the current status of arbovirus infections and minimize their impacts on the livestock industries in East Asia.</p>
