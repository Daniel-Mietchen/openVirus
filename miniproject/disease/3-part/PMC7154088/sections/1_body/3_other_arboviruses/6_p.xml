<p>A virus isolated from mosquitoes in Tibet, China in 2009 was identified as a novel species of the genus 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>). Designated as 
 <italic>Tibet Orbivirus</italic> (TIBOV), the virus has been obtained from mosquitoes and 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> biting midges in other regions of mainland China (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of inner core (T2) protein of known orbiviruses demonstrated that TIBOV is clearly categorized into the 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic>-borne group with BTV, EHDV, and PALV (
 <xref rid="B244" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B245" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>). The amino acid sequence diversity among outermost capsid proteins of TIBOV isolates indicated that the species consists of at least two serotypes (
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>). The neutralization antibodies to TIBOV were detected in cattle reared in the southern border region of mainland China (
 <xref rid="B246" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>).
