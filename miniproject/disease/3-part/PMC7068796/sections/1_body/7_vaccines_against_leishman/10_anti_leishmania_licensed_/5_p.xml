<p>In 2003, the FML-saponin vaccine was licensed to the Fort-Dodge-Pfizer-Zoetis company and started to be produced and commercialized in Brazil under the name of Leishmune®. It was the first worldwide-licensed vaccine against ZVL. The vaccine is given only to healthy and seronegative dogs. From 2004 to 2009, 550 dogs of Brazilian endemic and epidemic areas in Minas Gerais and São Paulo states were vaccinated with Leishmune® (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). This trial reported that Leishmune® kept the immunogenicity and efficacy potential previously described for the laboratory formulation. While 39% deaths and 20.6% symptomatic cases were detected among untreated dogs, the group vaccinated with Leishmune® showed only 1% deaths and 1.2% symptomatic cases (

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). The most frequent systemic AEs observed in humans were headache, fatigue, insomnia, pyrexia, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, anxiety, and back pain. Hematoma and injection site pruritus were also reported. To reduce AE, the QS21 saponin was formulated inside vesicles (ISCOM, ISCOMATRIX, or Matrix-M™) (

 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>). Local swelling reactions, vomit, and diarrhea were only detected in 15.90, 2.4, and 1.5% of the individuals, respectively. All effects showed significant declines from the first to the third dose and were mild. Adult dogs developed smaller swelling reactions than puppies, indicating that they had more resistance to the inflammatory response promoted by the saponins. No death due to anaphylaxis occurred, and allergic reactions were noted only in 0.1% and transient alopecia at the injection site in 0.28% of the injected dogs. All the mild adverse events in response to Leishmune injection were transient and disappeared before the injection of the following vaccine dose, confirming the tolerability of the vaccine (

 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). Leishmune® was also immunotherapeutic in naturally (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>) and experimentally infected dogs (
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>). There were no deaths due to ZVL 22 months after complete immunotherapy, and 90% of the dogs were asymptomatic, healthy, and parasite-free. In contrast, 37% of infected untreated control dogs died of ZVL (
 <xref rid="B108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>). In addition, Leishmune® promoted the clinical and parasitological cure of ZVL and reduced the deaths (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>), while in combination with Amphotericin, it additionally promoted negative results in PCR, thus determining the sterile cure (
