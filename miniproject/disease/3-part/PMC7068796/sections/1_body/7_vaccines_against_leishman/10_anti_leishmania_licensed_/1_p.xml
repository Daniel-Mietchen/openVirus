<p>LeishmuneÂ® was the first vaccine licensed for the prevention of canine visceral leishmaniasis (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). It is composed of the FML glycoproteic fraction of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> (L.) 
 <italic>donovani</italic> and has the QS21 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> acylated and de-acylated saponins as adjuvants (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). The FML complex inhibited the penetration of promastigotes (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>) and amastigotes (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>) into macrophages in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays in a species-specific manner (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). In addition, FML was immunogenic for mice and rabbits, and most of the anti-FML monoclonal antibodies reacted with its 36-kDa main component (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>), which was disclosed to be a Nucleoside hydrolase (NH36) phylogenetic marker of the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). FML also showed high sensitivity and specificity in the serological diagnosis of human (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>) and dog VL (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>) and can be used in ELISA assays for the control of transfusional VL (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Furthermore, when used for vaccination, FML protected mice (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>) and hamsters from 
 <italic>L</italic>. (L.) 
 <italic>donovani</italic> infection (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Its main component, the antigen GP36, also promoted vaccine efficacy against VL in mice (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>). The 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> (Molina) saponins were the best adjuvants for the FML-vaccine in mice (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>).
