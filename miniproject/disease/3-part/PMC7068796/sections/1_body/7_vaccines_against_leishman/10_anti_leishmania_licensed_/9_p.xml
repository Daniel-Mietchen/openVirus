<p>Additionally, Leishtec® was the second vaccine licensed for commercialization in Brazil, in 2008 (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Remarkably, the vaccine was licensed without any information about efficacy in field assays. In fact, the first Phase III trial assay of Leishtec® was only published in 2016 (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). Moreover, the experiment was performed in a Brazilian endemic area with low infective pressure. Accordingly, the end-points of efficacy were not severe disease or deaths in canine visceral leishmaniasis, as were used for evaluation of Leishmune® previously (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>), but instead, seropositivity confirmed by parasitological assays alone or in combination with xenodiagnosis (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). Considering these less severe standards and based on the parasitologically positive cases, the vaccine efficacy of Leishtec® was 71.4%. When parasitologically and xenodiagnosis-positive cases were considered, vaccine efficacy was 58.1% (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). While the first field trial of Leishtec® was performed in a low infective pressure area, a second Phase III trial was run in a high transmission rate area, and the vaccine efficacy was only 35.7% (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). In fact, the incidence of canine VL was 42% in controls and 27% in vaccinated dogs (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). Furthermore, 43% of the vaccinated dogs developed the disease over time, and seroconversion was higher in vaccinated dogs than in controls (
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>).
