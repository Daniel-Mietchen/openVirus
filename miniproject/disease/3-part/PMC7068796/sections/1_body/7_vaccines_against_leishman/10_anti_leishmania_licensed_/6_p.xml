<p>Furthermore, seronegative dogs vaccinated with Leishmune® and exposed to phlebotomines in a highly epidemic area showed a lack of 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> antigen in their skins and 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> DNA in their blood and lymph nodes. In contrast, 25, 15.7, and 56.7% of positivity was recorded in the same respective variables in untreated control dogs (

 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). In fact, anti-FML antibodies raised by Leishmune® in dogs prevent the binding of the parasite to the phlebotomine insect guts 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and the development of promastigotes in the guts of colony-reared phlebotomines 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Sandflies were fed human blood, parasites, and sera. Insects that ingested anti-FML antibodies showed 74% fewer parasites in their guts than insects that fed upon sera of pre-immune dogs (
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). In contrast, sera of naturally infected dogs promoted a 431% increase in the parasite load observed in insect guts. Therefore, Leishmune® is not only capable of reducing the exposition of parasites in vaccinated dogs but also induces a robust antibody response that curtails the transmission of the disease in nature (
