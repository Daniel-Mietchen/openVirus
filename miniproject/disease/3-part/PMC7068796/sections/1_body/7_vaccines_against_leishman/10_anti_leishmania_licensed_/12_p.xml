<p>It was only in 2011 that the first European anti-
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> vaccine was licensed to Virbac, under the name of CaniLeish® (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The vaccine is composed of the 
 <italic>Leishmania (L.) infantum</italic> Excreted Secreted Proteins (ESP) and the purified extract of 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> (QA-21). Canileish® promotes a Th1 predominant immune response that lasts for a full year (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>) and induces an increase in IgG and IgM immunoglobulins in sera after the third dose, which is probably due to the induction of a pro-inflammatory response (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>). A Phase III trial performed in two highly endemic areas of the Mediterranean basin, one near Naples and the other near Barcelona, used PCR and parasite cultures to confirm infection (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). In this assay, 63% of vaccine efficacy was observed on month 24 after vaccination if active infection is considered as the main end-point. Considering the VL symptoms, the vaccine efficacy was 68.4% and the protection rate was 92.7% (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). Accordingly, it has been admitted that there are only two licensed vaccines that are able to confer significant protection against the most severe endpoints: disease and death under natural conditions. One is the FML-saponin (Leishmune®) vaccine in Brazil, and the other is the LiESP/QA-21 (CaniLeish®) vaccine in Europe (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). Both Leishmune® and Canileish® are composed of purified parasite complex fractions and both are adjuvanted by 
 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic> Molina adjuvants (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). In addition, Canileish® induces leishmanicidal activity in macrophages and increases the iNOS and NO expressions, which finally kills the parasite (
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>).
