<p>Therefore, in contrast to Leishmune®, which showed 76–80% efficacy based on strict end-points (deaths and clinical cases) (

In contrast, a higher potency was described for Leishmune®, which, when used for immunotherapy, gave an 80% reduction in symptomatic cases, a 100% reduction in parasite-positive cases, and a 100% reduction in deaths, and, when used in combination with chemotherapy, also promoted a sterile cure with negative PCR results (
