<p>Recently, the NH36-SMT-GLA-SE vaccine (Leish-F3) was tested in a phase I trial in healthy volunteers in the USA, in a non-endemic area for VL (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>). Increased secretion of IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-5, and IL-10 cytokines was detected in response to the vaccine antigen (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>). Additionally, a strong cytokine response to each component of the vaccine was also found in VL patients from Bangladesh. They exhibited CD4 Th1 cell responses to NH36 and SMT, with secretion of IFN-γ, TNF, and IL-2 (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>) and also IL-5 and IL-10 in whole blood assays. In contrast, low levels of IL-5 and IL-10 and sustained levels of IL-2 (against NH36 and SMT) and TNF-α (against NH36) were found in vaccinated mice, in which the parasite load was reduced (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>). The vaccine was finally considered safe and well-tolerated in human volunteers (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>). In fact, the NH36-SMT vaccine (LEISH-F3) is the first human subunit vaccine against VL that has reached the Phase I clinical trial stage (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>), although no human vaccine has yet been licensed against the disease.
