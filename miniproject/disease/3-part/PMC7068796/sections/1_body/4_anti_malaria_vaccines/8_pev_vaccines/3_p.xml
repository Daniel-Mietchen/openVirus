<p>Several Phase III trials were performed with the RTS,S vaccine. In the first attempt, 46% of vaccine efficacy was obtained in children, with higher efficacy in young children than in infants (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and administration in prime-boost strategies using different vectors (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) have been tried in order to optimize the response to the antigen (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, important challenges still remain, such as inducing protection against all strains of the genetically diverse parasites found in nature. Evidence indicates that the RTS,S/A02 does not induce any preferential effect against any of the alleles of the CSP with sequence similarity to the 3D7 pfcsp sequence used for the vaccine preparation (
