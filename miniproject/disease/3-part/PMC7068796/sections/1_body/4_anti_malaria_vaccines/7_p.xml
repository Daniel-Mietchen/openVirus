<p>The fundamental problem of the development of a Malaria vaccine is the lack of reliable correlates of protection (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). There is evidence that antibodies are the main components of the immune response (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>), but the results of different studies are not consistent. However, epidemiological observations, IgG passive transfer studies, and experimental infections in humans all support the feasibility of developing highly effective malaria vaccines. Although 5,400 antigens have been described, the precise ones that induce protective immunity still remain uncertain (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). The urgent need for a tool for malaria prevention promoted a joint initiative of funding agencies, private companies, and international agencies (
