<p>An important feature of our three-in-one MMR ELISA assay is affordability; it costs only a fraction of the commercially available assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6a, b</xref>). An important component for improving the signal-to-noise ratio (background reduction) is a self-developed, low-cost reagent, a protein-free PVA-based blocking buffer (Supplementary Fig. S5). Another important feature is the reduced assay duration time; compared to the ~1.5/2.5 h of timeframe of commercially available tests (used for parallel and justificatory measurements), our test can be performed within 1 h (
