<p>As mentioned in the Introduction section, in Hungary, between February 2017 and July 2019, 70 measles cases were laboratory confirmed according to ECDC reports [
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. During the epidemics of 2017, there have been 36 measles cases in Hungary (five imported, 26 import-related, four unknown/not reported and one endemic). Regarding the infections by age group and vaccination status for 2017, according to WHO data, among the individuals 20–29 years of age, ≈35% had not been vaccinated, and ≈65% received two or more doses of vaccine. Of individuals older than 30 years, ≈18% had not been vaccinated, ≈24% received one dose, ≈26% received two or more doses of vaccine and ≈32% were of unknown vaccination status. Based on these data, it can be hypothesised that in the case of vaccinated adults (≥20 years of age), who had received two or more doses of vaccine, vaccine insufficiency may have underlaid the infections [

 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the 2007 local mumps outbreak, the epidemic started from an individual who returned home from Ukraine in December 2007. Soon after his case, individuals from his personal connections became affected (later all nine cases were laboratory confirmed). Previously, in 2003, comparably small outbreaks were reported in close communities of unvaccinated people (student houses, schools) [

 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. This is a significant development compared to the end of 1990s and beginning of 2000s, when ~100 rubella cases per year were reported (WHO statistics). By 2006, this number decreased by 80% (22 reported cases in year 2006). Measles, mumps and rubella statistics (cases per year) are shown in Supplementary Figure S2.
