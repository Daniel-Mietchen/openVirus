  <p>Summary of seronegativity ratios within different age groups. Age or vaccination groups (X-axis): (I) Born before 1969 (not vaccinated; high probability of wild-type infection), (II) vaccinated between 1969-77, (III) vaccinated between 1978-87, (IV) vaccinated between 1988-90, (V) vaccinated between 1991-95, (VI) vaccinated between 1996-98, (VII) vaccinated between 1999-2002, (VIII) vaccinated in 2003, (IX) vaccinated between 2004-2005, (X) vaccinated between 2006-2010, (XI) Vaccinated between 2011-2015. P-values indicating statistically significant differences between adjacent age groups: (*) vaccinated between 1969-77 and 1978-87 p=0.00003841; (* *) vaccinated between 1978-1987 and 1988-90 p=0.0015; (#) vaccinated between 1969-77 and 1978-87 p=0.00008437; (##) vaccinated between 1988-90 and 1991-95 p=0.008532. We identified samples in the cluster ‘
   <italic>Vaccinated between 1978–1987</italic>’ as the lowest seropositivity group for measles.
