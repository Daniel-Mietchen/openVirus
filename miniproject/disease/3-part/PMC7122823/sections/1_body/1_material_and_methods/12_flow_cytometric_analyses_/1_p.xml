<p>BALF from infected mice were centrifuged (5 min, 5000×g) and one quarter of the cellular fraction was stained with anti-Gr1-FITC (clone RB6-8C5, eBioscience, 1:1000), anti-CD49b-PE (clone DX5, eBioscience, 1:1000), anti-CD45-PerCP (clone 30-F11, BD Biosciences, 1:300), anti-CD19-PE-Cy7 (clone 1D3, BD Biosciences, 1:2000), anti-F4/80-APC (clone BM8, eBioscience, 1:300), anti-CD11b-APC-Cy7 (clone M1/70, BD Biosciences, 1:300), anti-CD11c-Pacific-Blue (clone HL3, BD Biosciences, 1:300), and anti-CD3e-BV510 (clone 145-2C11, BD Biosciences, 1:100) for 20 min at 4°C. CD4 and CD8 T cells were stained in a second staining panel with anti-CD8-Pacific blue (clone 53–6.7, BD Biosciences, 1:300) and anti-CD4-PerCP (clone RM4-5, eBioscience, 1:2000).</p>
