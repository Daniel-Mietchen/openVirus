<p>Confluent B16 cells were transfected in a 96-well plate with 0.1 μg of the respective reporter plasmid for promoter (binding) activity of IFN-β, IRF3, NFκB, AP-1, STAT3, ISRE or p53, respectively, 0.2 μg of the adjuvant plasmids (or a GFP-encoding control plasmid), and 0.3 μg polyethylenimine in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. After 48 hours incubation at 37°C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the cells were lysed with 100 μl Glo-lysis buffer, 25 μl Bright-Glo Luciferase substrate (both Promega) was added, and the signal was measured on a microplate luminometer (Orion L, Titertek Berthold).
