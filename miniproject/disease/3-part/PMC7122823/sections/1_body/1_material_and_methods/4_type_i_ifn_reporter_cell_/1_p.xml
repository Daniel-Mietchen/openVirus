<p>For the analysis of type I IFN induction, a virus free, cell-based assay was used [
 <xref rid="pone.0231138.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Briefly, the adjuvant plasmids, an IFN-α2 plasmid, or a GFP-encoding vector (as negative control) were transfected into HEK293T cells (24-well plate, 2 μg/well plasmid, 2 μg/well polyethylenimine). After 48 hours of cultivation, supernatants were cleared and 100 μl of each was given on Mx/RAGE7 reporter cells in a 96-well plate. After 24 hours at 37°C, the supernatants were omitted and 200 μl medium was added for another 48 hours. Then, cells were detached using Trypsin/EDTA (Gibco) and stained with a live/dead dye for exclusion of dead cells in the later analysis (Fixable Viability Dye eFluor® 780; 1:4000 eBioscience). The type I IFN-dependent GFP expression in the reporter cells was assessed by flow cytometry (BD FACS Canto II) using FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.).
