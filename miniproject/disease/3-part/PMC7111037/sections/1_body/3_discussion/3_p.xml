<p id="par0090">Influenza virus, enterovirus, rotavirus, RSV, and adenovirus were the most frequent types of viral infection among cases of febrile seizures in the HIRA database. Of these viruses, the pattern of enterovirus infection was most similar to that of febrile seizure, and these patterns exhibited a significant correlation. Previous studies internationally and in South Korea have reported the high prevalence of enterovirus infection in the summer

Enterovirus has an affinity for neuronal cells and is a major cause of central nervous system infections, such as viral meningitis. These central nervous system infections may present with mild symptoms, or with severe infection and consequent encephalitis associated with disability and death
