  <p>Quaternary epitopes on dengue virus dimeric envelope proteins and stabilizing dimeric structure of E proteins through the addition of disulfate bonds between two monomers. Based on the published structure of DENV-2 E dimer (PDB access NO:1OAN), three domains of E monomer were denoted with different colors on backbones (D-I, red; D-II, yellow; D-III, blue). One of the E monomers in the dimeric structure was circled with dash line. On the tip of domain II, the fusion loop was labeled in pink. The structural image presented the top view, distal from virus membrane. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Epitopes distribution of EDE epitopes, the residues (cyan spheres) critical for EDE antibody binding were determined by Dejnirattisai et al. Fab binding regions of EDE antibodies were mapped to either end of the dimer (cyan shadow), covering the interface of two monomers. Figure adapted from

   <bold>(B)</bold> Stabilization of dimeric E proteins was achieved through adding disulfate bonds, after introducing mutations into domain II, L107C (yellow spheres) A259C (red spheres) and domain III, A313C (blue spheres). Figure adapted from
