<p>Despite filling in the void of dengue vaccine, its phase II and phase III trials revealed concerns regarding the vaccine’s safety. First, the immunogenicity and efficacy of this vaccine varied by age and prior dengue-infections: vaccinees of seronegative and children younger than 9 years’ old had increased risk of diseases (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Hadinegoro et al., 2015</xref>). Vaccination of flavivirus seronegative individuals induced significant lower level of neutralizing antibodies comparing to those having pre-existing flavivirus immunity, specifically, the Geometric Mean Titer (GMTs) of seronegative groups were 47.4–90.8% lower than those of seropositive ones (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Dayan et al., 2013a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">Hss et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, during long-term follow-up of participants of the two Phase III trials and one Phase IIb trial, vaccinated Asians between ages 2 and 5 years old have had an increased risk of hospitalization in the first year, with a relative risk of 7.5; and vaccinated Thai children between ages 4 and 5 had a relative risk of 2.44 in the 3rd year after vaccination. The vaccine efficacies in children younger than 9 years of age were significantly lower than those of 9 years or older according to a number of criteria (VCD:44.6% vs. 67.8%; hospitalization: 56.1% vs. 86.1%; DHF: 66.7% vs. 90.9%). Further analysis indicated that the lowest vaccine efficacy of 14.4% was in dengue seronegative children younger than 9 years of age (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">Hadinegoro et al., 2015</xref>). It is postulated that vaccination in dengue seronegative recipients had mimicked a course of asymptomatic primary dengue infection, which induced antibodies that enhance subsequent natural dengue infection. Consistently, after the large scale vaccination in Philippines, several vaccinated children and adults have died from lethal dengue diseases. By the time Sanofi Pasteur and WHO modified the instruction for 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> vaccination after those long-term follow-up studies, limiting its use to people who has a previous dengue infection (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Vannice et al., 2018</xref>), 800,000 Philippine children had already been vaccinated, among them only 100,000 were seropositive, the rest were thus placed at the increased risk of severe DHF/DSS (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Fatima and Syed, 2018</xref>). Second, 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> has a low protective efficacy against dengue-2 viruses that are endemic in Asia. In a Phase IIb trial, 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> showed poor protection against dengue-2 virus, reached an efficacy of merely 9%, despite having generated decent neutralization antibodies to DENV-2, with similar GMT (Geometric Mean Titer) as those specific for other serotypes when tested at 28 days after the final immunization (
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">Sabchareon et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, in a Phase III trial in Latin America, the GMTs of neutralization antibodies to DENV-1,-2,-3,-4 were 395, 574, 508, and 241, respectively, at 28 days after the 3rd injection; but the corresponding protective efficacy during the 1st year were 50.3, 42.3, 74, and 77.7% for each of the four serotypes (
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">Villar et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these large scale clinical studies, an expected correlation between efficacies and neutralizing antibody titer PRNT (Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Test) values were not found for all four serotypes. It should be noted that a waning of cross-genotype neutralization was observed for monovalent CYD-2 vaccine induced antibodies at 6 months post immunization in a Phase I trial; specifically, GMT of neutralizing antibody specific for dengue-2 clinical isolates of heterologous genotype dropped as much as 10-fold compared with those that were specific for laboratory strain 16681 of autologous genotype (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Guirakhoo et al., 2006</xref>). All these may indicate that high serotype-2 specific neutralization antibodies had been elicited by CYD-TDV, but it only sustained for a short time and was restricted to a limited number of genotypes. Such unsatisfied efficacy and lower neutralizing titers toward one serotype will also increase the risk of infection by that serotype, especially in those who are seronegative at the baseline. Third, although the highest level of protection was supposed to be achieved after the 3rd vaccination, its efficacy was found to be similar with that in peoples only received the 1st dose. How to modify the immunization schedule of this live attenuated vaccine to boost immune responses is still unclear, but it will probably be helpful to improve the efficacy of vaccine itself. Last but not the least, whether the emergence of Zika virus in DENV endemic regions and prior ZIKV immunity in vaccine recipients will affect the efficacy of 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> is unknown, and whether vaccination by 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> will enhance or prevent Zika virus infection is also uncertain. As co-circulation of two viruses and complicated interference between Dengue and Zika virus-specific immunity have already been observed (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Bardina et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Fowler et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">Leborgne et al., 2019</xref>), it is worthwhile taking the probable influence of ZIKV into consideration during dengue vaccine development. Therefore, either the currently licensed dengue vaccine 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> or other new vaccines must be applied judiciously in epidemic regions.
