<p>With effort that lasted two decades, the first licensed vaccine 
 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic> (called CYD-TDV before licensure) has been developed by Sanofi Pasteur. It is a live attenuated vaccine comprised of four Dengue-Yellow Fever virus chimeras in one dose at 1:1:1:1 ratios, and it has been approved to use in over 20 dengue endemic countries and European Union and USA (

Through such a strategy, CYD-TDV was developed and showed to elicit neutralizing antibodies to four serotype of dengue viruses; moreover, this vaccines has high genetic stability, with limited mosquito transmission, and it is less hepatotropic (one major adverse effect of YF vaccine) (

In the large multicenter phase III trials, this vaccine had showed protective efficacies against symptomatic virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) of 54.8% in Asian, and 64.7% in Latin America; the general efficacies against hospitalization and severe dengue cases reached 80.3 and 95.5%, respectively, in Latin America (

 <italic>Dengvaxia</italic>) was licensed at the end of 2015, accompanied by the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) recommendation that this vaccine be used in all dengue-endemic counties (
