<p>Novel vaccine strategy such as lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated modified mRNA has also been used to develop Zika vaccine. An mRNA that contains prM-E genes of ZIKV and optimized 5′ and 3′ untranslated sequences with type-1 cap was obtained through enzymatically synthesis using modified nucleoside, and packaged into lipid nanoparticles (LNP). Such mRNA-LNP vaccine could efficiently produce virus like particle in cells. After intramuscular delivery, two doses of mRNA-LNP vaccine were able to elicit high titers (∼1/100,000) of neutralizing antibodies, and conferred protection against ZIKV challenge in mice (
