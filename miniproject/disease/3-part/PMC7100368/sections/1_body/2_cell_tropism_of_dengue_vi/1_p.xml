<p>Transmission of DENV and ZIKV are mainly mediated by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. When human is bitten by infected mosquitoes, viruses are inoculated directly into the blood vessels or epidermis where keratinocytes, skin dendritic cells (DC) (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">Limon-Flores et al., 2005</xref>), monocytes and myeloid DC are probably infected and become the first virus carriers for further dissemination (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">Khaiboullina S. F. et al., 2019</xref>). An earlier investigation on dengue virus has indicated that immature skin DC, Langerhans cells were infected by dengue virus and then emigrated from the skin to transmit the virus to other organs (

 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Consistently, two other studies also provided evidences that circulating CD14 + monocytes were the primary cellular targets of ZIKV infection in PBMCs (
