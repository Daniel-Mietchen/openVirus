<p>The sequences used for this study were obtained from 139 PLWH attending the SAC (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00196">Table S1</xref>). The HIV transmission risk categories included sexual contact (heterosexual (92, 66%), MSM (men who have sex with men) (33, 24%), and bisexual (14, 10%)), IVDU (intravenous drug use; (11, 8%), being from an endemic area (15, 11%), and maternal foetal transmission (3, 2%). The sex distribution was 88 males and 51 females. The difference between diagnosis dates and dates of sampling were an average of 436 days, with a median of 41 days, and ranging from 4 to 5600 days. The HIV sequences used for analysis consisted of the HIV polymerase (
 <italic>pol</italic>) region and were collected through Sanger sequencing as part of routine genotypic antiretroviral drug resistance testing (GART). Multiple HIV-1 subtypes were included and consisted of subtypes A (14, 10%), B (72, 52%), C (32, 23%), D (3, 2%), G (8, 6%), and several different recombinants (10, 7%).
