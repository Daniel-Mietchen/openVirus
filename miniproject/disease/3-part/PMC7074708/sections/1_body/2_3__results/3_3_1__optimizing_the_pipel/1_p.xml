<p>The vast majority of sequences supplied to us through the drug resistant testing program were curated and thus lacked indel gaps. Therefore, using either MUSCLE or HIVAlign produced the same multiple sequence alignment, leading to ML (maximum likelihood) phylogenetic trees with similar tree properties and summary statistics (
