<p>PLWH with clinically reported and confirmed transmission relationships as well as a set of individuals with an unknown source of infection were included (described in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-microorganisms-08-00196">Table S1</xref>.) Transmission and infection dates were inferred based on combinations of the Last Negative (LN) and First Positive (FP) HIV test dates, and were subdivided in three infection groups (IC1, IC2, and IC3;

 <xref rid="microorganisms-08-00196-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). IC 1 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 87) were patients with both LN and FP dates available. IC2 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 48) were patients with a documented FP date, but no LN date. IC3 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 4) were patients for which no LN or FP dates were available. In addition, these patients were divided into three transmission categories (TC). These consisted of “Recipients” (
 <italic>n</italic> = 36), which are patients (or secondary cases) for whom the source of their HIV had been clinically reported and confirmed. “Donors” (
 <italic>n</italic> = 29) were patients (or primary cases) confirmed to be the source of infection for Recipients. The sequences of the Donor and Recipient groups, were considered the “gold standard data set”. The final group of “Controls” (
 <italic>n</italic> = 74) were randomly selected patients with no known epidemiological connections, and served as control patients in the data.
