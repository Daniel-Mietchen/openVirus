  <p>The Southern Alberta HIV Clinic (SAC) patient sequence and transmission data. Patient (A) has HIV, and their estimated infection date is the red star on their branch. They have a positive (First Positiveâ€”FP) HIV test result after their infection. At some time-point, represented by a red star and the red arrow, (
   <bold>a</bold>) infects (
   <bold>b</bold>). Previously, (
   <bold>b</bold>) had a negative HIV test. Afterwards, (
   <bold>a</bold>) has a positive HIV test result. The HIV sequences of samples from (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>) are phylogenetically related, as represented by the tree. (
   <bold>b</bold>) is in transmission category 1 and infection category 1. (
   <bold>a</bold>) is in transmission category 2 and infection category 2. Samples for (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>) were collected at the end of their respective branches.
