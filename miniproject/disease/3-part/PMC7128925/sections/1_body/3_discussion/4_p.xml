<p id="p0120">The fact that the proportion of patients with a virus detected in their nasal swab was low, only 17.5%, can be largely explained by the definition of our population. We recruited patients with respiratory infection symptoms and also patients with chest pain and poor general condition to see whether respiratory viruses play a role in these conditions and to evaluate whether viral testing should be part of the routine diagnostics. There were subgroups with more positive results, however, in that 34% of the patients tested for influenza had some respiratory virus detected. Influenza-like symptoms have been associated with more positive virus detections in other studies as well [

Even though 31%–39% of our participants with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a virus detected, this was true of only 6%–11% of the individuals with acute coronary syndrome, suggesting that targeting the testing to patients with respiratory infection symptoms or respiratory co-morbidities would probably be more beneficial.
