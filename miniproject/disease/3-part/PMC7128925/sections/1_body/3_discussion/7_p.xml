<p id="p0135">One limitation of this study is that even in the intervention group, the viral detection results were received about 24Â hours after sampling, so that this information was not available during the primary evaluation of the patient. This concerns particularly those individuals that were discharged home from the emergency room. The low number of viruses may also be considered as a limitation. Partially this was due to an exceptionally low incidence of viral epidemics during our study. Annual variation in the severity of viral outbreaks is a well-known phenomenon, which could only be controlled in a clinical trial by extending the study period to several years. As Finland is a country with fairly low antibiotic consumption, the effect might have been more prominent in a different setting.</p>
