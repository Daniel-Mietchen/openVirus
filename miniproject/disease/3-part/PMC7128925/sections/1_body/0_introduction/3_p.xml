<p id="p0020">Identification of the influenza virus can reduce the number of hospital admissions, the length of hospitalizations and the duration of antimicrobial medication [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], but the evidence regarding the impact of testing for other respiratory viruses is limited. We set out to test in a randomized controlled trial whether active use of multiplex respiratory virus PCR tests can reduce the use of antimicrobial medication in adult patients in acute care. Our hypothesis was that rapid viral diagnostics reduces antibiotic consumption and the length of hospital stay.
