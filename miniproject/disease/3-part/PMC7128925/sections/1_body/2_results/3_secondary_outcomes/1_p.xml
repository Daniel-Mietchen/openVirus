<p id="p0095">The mean number of radiological examinations was 2.5 (SD 3.3) in the intervention group and 2.2 (SD 3.0) in the control group (difference 0.2, 95% CI –0.3 to 0.8). There was no statistically significant difference between groups. The mean of the total costs of hospital treatment per patient was higher (€3539 (SD €7303)) in the intervention group than in the control group (€3339 (SD €6664), difference 200, 95% CI –669 to 1069), as were the mean costs of the radiological examinations (€262 (SD €404) versus €223 (SD €385), difference 39, 95% CI –14 to 92). The laboratory expenses were also higher in the intervention group, but it should be remembered that the costs of multiplex PCR testing were included in the laboratory costs in the case of the intervention group but not in the control group.</p>
