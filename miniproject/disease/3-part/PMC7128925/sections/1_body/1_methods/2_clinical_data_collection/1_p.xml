<p id="p0050">The nurse collected systematic data from the patients on co-morbidities, current medication and symptoms at entry, and we followed this up 2 weeks later by means of a questionnaire on the duration of the symptoms and any additional medical care needed. We reviewed the medical records after the 30-day follow-up time and extracted data on co-morbidities, the course of the disease, the duration of antibiotic medication, the length of hospitalization and the duration of intensive care. All microbiological and radiological findings were recorded, and the number of deceased participants was ascertained from the national population register (Statistics Finland). The total costs of patients' hospital stays were obtained from the hospital administration. The costs of using the multiplex PCR method for respiratory viral detection (€78 per test for the intervention group and €36 per test for the control group) were included in the hospital costs in the case of the intervention group, whereas the detection costs for the control group were covered from the research grants and were not included in the analysis.</p>
