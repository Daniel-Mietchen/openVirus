<p id="p0030">Possible participants were informed about the study by a trained nurse working during office hours on weekdays. After obtaining informed consent, this nurse took nasal swabs for viral detection. The patients were randomly allocated into two groups upon enrolment: a rapid viral diagnostics group (intervention group) and a delayed viral diagnostics group (control group). The attending physician received the viral results for the intervention group within 24 hours, except for samples obtained on Fridays, the results for which were available on the next office day, whereas the viral results for the control group were received 7 days after sampling.</p>
