<p>In our previous reports, migratory birds could also carry and spread H5N1 A/QH virus, which is likely the reasons for human infections throughout China and Europe over the past several years. We tried to analyze and compare the common genes regulated by IAV and IBV infection in A549 cells, and we found that there were very few common genes, so the infection processes of these two viruses differ [

Further, other cell types will also be investigated in our future work, to learn more about the pathogenic mechanisms of influenza virus. According to the literature, MDCK cells, human HEK 293T cells, huh7 hepatic cells [
