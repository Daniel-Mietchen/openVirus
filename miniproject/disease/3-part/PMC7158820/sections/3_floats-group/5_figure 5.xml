  <p>Structural Comparison of a Matched High-Mannose versus Complex Glycosite in H1 and H5 HAs</p>
  <p>(A and B) Cal/04 H1 and Viet/04 H5 show strong structural and sequence conservation around the N289 glycosite (A, top line and B) with the exception of position 290 at the center of the N-glycosylation sequon. Substitution of S290 in H5 for T290 in H1 leads to structural deviation of the amino acid backbone (A, lower line, separation of matched C
   <sub>α</sub>s is maximal at position 290) as the hydrophobic side chain becomes rotated into the HA surface (B; H1 colored green, H5 in purple).
  </p>
  <p>(C) shows an alternate view with HA residues around the glycosite shown as gray surface. Here, H1 T290 (green) is positioned closer to the hydrophobic rear face of T280 and the side chain of P306.</p>
  <p>(D) To counter distortion of the backbone structure caused by T290, the side chain of N289 is rotated down and in toward HA by approximately 45 degrees, leading to a shift in conformation of the N289 glycan . MD simulations predict that the chitobiose core of the N-glycan in H1 becomes shifted approximately 20 degrees closer to the protein surface , likely creating steric hindrance to glycan processing. Glycans in (D) are shown in green surface for high-mannose in H1 and purple surface for complex type in H5.</p>
