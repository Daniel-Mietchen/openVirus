  <p>GNL Binding to High-Mannose Glycans Broadly Neutralizes Recent H3N2 Viruses</p>
  <p>(A) Virus microneutralization of assays of whole Cal/04 (H1N1) and Per/09 (H3N2) viruses pre-treated with either PBS, anti-Cal/04 mAb, anti-Per/09 mAb, or GNL. Bars depict average titers with error bars showing standard deviation.</p>
  <p>(B) Broad virus microneutralization assays, utilizing an expanded panel of five recent H3N2 vaccine strain viruses and eleven specific antiviral mouse monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant HA from three viruses, and GNL. Shown are respective virus neutralization titers as bars (A) or with cells colored in red according to neutralization potency (B). GNL neutralizes all H3N2 viruses tested, with comparable or superior strength to the best mAb but does not neutralize Cal/04 H1N1.</p>
