<p id="p0070">To investigate the potential for broad neutralization of H3N2 viruses, we conducted expanded MN screening against five recent human H3N2 vaccine strains and a panel of eleven mAbs raised against the HAs from three of these strains, plus GNL (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Selected H3N2 IAVs included: Bris/07 (A/Brisbane/10/2007), Per/09, Vic/11, Switz/13 (A/Switzerland/9715293/2013), and HK/14 (A/Hong Kong/4801/2014). As expected, various mAb clones exhibited neutralization in a mainly strain-specific manner, generally favoring the parent IAV or HA against which they were raised, with the exception of anti-Vic/11 clone FR1122, which failed to neutralize any IAV tested (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). All four anti-Bris/07 mAbs weakly neutralized Bris/07, while two, FR509 and 512, showed similar cross-neutralization of Vic/11 (509 and 512) and HK/14 (509 only). Correspondingly, one anti-Vic/11 mAb (FR1124) showed similar neutralizing titer against Bris/07, suggesting a shared epitope shared between the two viruses. Interestingly, despite evolving between Bris/07 and Vic/11, Per/09 appears to show little cross-reactivity with anti-Bris/07 mAbs (and vice versa), despite highly potent neutralization by both anti-Per/09 and anti-Vic/11 species (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>B). Vic/11 was the most widely neutralized virus, revealing mainly weak titers against eight out of eleven mAbs tested. Interestingly, however, anti-Vic/11 mAbs appeared to give strongest MN titers against Per/09 virus, although observed titer differences of generally 1-log or less are comparatively small within the context of this assay. In terms of broad neutralization, none of the antiviral mAb samples tested were able to neutralize all five H3N2 strains. Two anti-Vic/11 clones, FR1124 and 1125, neutralized four of five viruses with generally weak potency. Unsurprisingly, given their later appearance in evolution and likely advanced antigenic drift, Switz/13 and HK/14 were only relatively weakly neutralized—with Switz/13 sharing reactivity with closely related anti-Vic/11 mAbs, and HK/14 with one anti-Vic/11 and one anti-Bris/07 sample.
