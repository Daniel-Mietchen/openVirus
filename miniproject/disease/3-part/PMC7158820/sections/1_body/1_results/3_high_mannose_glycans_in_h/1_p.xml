<p id="p0065">Since both human H1N1 and H3N2 viruses feature high-mannose glycans at potentially key positions within the HA head domain, we investigated the ability of GNL to inhibit receptor binding and neutralize infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using cell culture microneutralization (MN) and hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assays (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figures 3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>). Relative to a specific anti-H1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) with known MN function, GNL failed to protect Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells from infection with Cal/04 (H1N1) virus, suggesting that the observed high-mannose glycans are located some distance from the RBS (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref> A). Conversely, however, GNL showed potent neutralization of Per/09 (A/Perth/16/2009; H3N2) compared with a control anti-H3 mAb (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A), indicating that at least one oligomannose site in the more-heavily glycosylated H3 head is likely suitably positioned for strong inhibition of receptor engagement. Comparable data were also obtained for HAI assays, where GNL showed successful inhibition of Per/09 only, while comparison of GNL with a panel of lectins with diverse glycan specificities revealed potent neutralization to be confined to high-mannose-targeted reagents only (
