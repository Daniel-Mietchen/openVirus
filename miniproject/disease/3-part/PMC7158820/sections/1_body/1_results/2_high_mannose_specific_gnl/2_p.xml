<p id="p0060">To examine utility of GNL as a serology-independent reagent for labeling whole IAV samples, we analyzed a subset of four viruses: A/California/04/2009 (pH1N1; Cal/04), Vic/11, and A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9; Anhui/13), with close similarity to recombinant HA samples investigated above, plus a pre-pandemic human seasonal strain, A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1; NC/99). Despite their distinct antigenicities, when detected with GNL, specific binding to the array was clearly observed for all virus samples (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figures 2</xref>A and 2B. For Anhui/13 and NC/99, we also sought to compare glycan-specific labeling with serological methods for detection, including an antiviral mouse antibody (Anhui/13) and sheep-derived antisera (NC/99). Again, GNL reproduced receptor specificities identified by serological staining, with Anhui/13 showing mixed linkage preferences for both α2-3 and α2-6-linked N-glycans, and NC/99 appearing majority α2-6 specific with minor interactions with some α2-3 receptors (
 <xref rid="mmc1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Figures S1</xref>D and S1E). Since labeling with GNL offers comparable data to antibody or antisera-based detection, this method may provide a simple future alternative for detection of HAs and IAVs in glycan-binding assays when specific antiviral reagents are not available.
