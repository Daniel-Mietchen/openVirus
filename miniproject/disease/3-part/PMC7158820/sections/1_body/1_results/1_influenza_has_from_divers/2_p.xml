<p id="p0050">The results reveal differences in glycosylation between individual HAs, and particularly between human and avian IAVs (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref> ). Both of the human HAs, Cal/07 (H1) and Vic/11 (H3) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A and 1B), exhibit a large proportion of high-mannose type glycans, particularly at glycosites on the HA head domain, which also contains the RBS. Conversely, the majority of glycosites present on avian-derived HAs are uniformly more processed to complex-type glycans (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>C–1F). Interestingly, although contemporary human H3 HAs are regarded as “highly glycosylated” (Vic/11 has 13 potential glycosites), we observed that one position (N122) is entirely unoccupied, and a further two sites (N45 and N144) are occupied by a glycan less than 50%, suggesting that H3 HAs on an average have a more modest 11–12 fully occupied glycosites, in line with recent proposals of a HA glycan saturation limit (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Altman et al., 2019</xref>). Several poorly occupied glycosites in Vic/11 H3 and a single unoccupied site at N296 (H3 numbering, used here and throughout) in Jiang/13 H10 fall in close proximity to other glycosites in the primary amino acid sequence (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>B and 1F). Similarly, the adjacent glycosites at positions at N278 and N289 in Cal/07 H1, N126 and N133 in Vic/11 H3, and N158 and N169 in Viet/04 H5 appear to result in minimal processing, with at least one glycosite of each pair observed as oligomannose-type (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A–1C). Notably, however, glycan crowding is not the only reason for under-processing of glycans since isolated glycosites at N94 in Cal/07, N165 and N285 in Vic/11, and N242 in Jiang/13 display significant proportions of high-mannose glycans (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A, 1B, and 1F), suggesting that the architecture of the folded HA structure may also influence the extent of glycan processing. All six HAs have a conserved glycosite at N483 that is predominantly complex type (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), while group 1 HAs (H1, H5, and H6) contain a pair of predominantly complex glycans at N21 and N33, and group 2 HAs (H3, H7, and H10) feature a directly comparable pair of glycosites at positions N22 and N38, also found to be mostly complex type (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figures 1</xref>A–1F).
