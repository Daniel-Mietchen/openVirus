<p id="p0045">To investigate differences in IAV glycosylation, we performed global site-specific analysis of glycan occupancy and degree of processing from high-mannose to complex-type glycans for all potential N-linked glycosylation sites present on six representative HA ectodomains from both human and avian IAVs, including: A/California/07/2009 (pH1N1, human 2009 pandemic; Cal/07), A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2, human seasonal; Vic/11), A/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1, avian origin; Viet/04), A/Taiwan/2/2013 (H6N1, avian origin; Tai/13), A/Shanghai/2/2013 (H7N9, avian origin; Shang/13), and A/Jiangxi Donghu/346/2013 (H10N8, avian origin; Jiang/13). These strains were selected to include HAs from two contemporary human IAV strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and four avian IAVs, which together comprise the two major HA phylogenetic subgroups, group 1 (H1, H5, and H6) and group 2 (H3, H7, and H10). This proteomics-based method for site-specific analysis of N-linked glycan processing uses endoglycosidases to introduce mass signatures that contain either no glycan, minimally processed high-mannose or hybrid-type, or more extensively processed complex-type N-glycans. This allows a semi-quantitative assessment of the proportion of each glycoform present at each glycosite (
