<p id="p0120">Increased oligomannose glycoforms on the head domain of human IAV HAs is particularly relevant to seasonal H3N2 viruses, where vaccine protection has reduced significantly in recent years due to substantial antigenic drift and mismatching between egg-grown vaccines and circulating strains. In this regard, it is of interest that GNL is able to neutralize recent H3 viruses independent of antigenic variances, underscoring HA glycosylation as a potentially important consideration for future human vaccines and therapeutic mAb development (a small number of papers have reported anti-HA antibodies that make direct contact with head-domain glycans [

In this regard, a recent report describes an engineered Banlec that exhibits anti-influenza activity in mice and is extremely well tolerated (
