<p id="p0115">Further to potential biological rationales for shifts favoring oligomannose glycosylation in human IAV HAs, we were also interested in the structural and molecular basis of how these modifications arise since directly comparable glycosites feature highly diverse occupancies on different HAs. While the presence of under-processed oligomannose rich glycosites on the influenza HA is consistent with mechanisms leading to steric interference of the biosynthetic processing pathway, our observations were unexpected since HA is substantially less glycosylated than the surface glycoproteins of numerous other viruses. With up to thirty N-linked glycans per monomer, both HIV gp120 and MERS CoV S-2P are well-characterized examples that comprise numerous oligomannose sites arising due to close packing of their many structurally proximal glycosites (

 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that in this case, presence of oligomannose glycans is not due to steric restrictions imposed by neighboring glycan chains. We have found that appearance of glycosites with significant high-mannose incorporation in HA is more strongly associated with global placement on the molecule, particularly when located within the head domain, and with local structural and/or sequence adaptations that serve to alter the positioning or conformation of the attached glycan. Observations that some high-mannose glycans span the gap between protomers within the HA trimer, notably N165 in Vic/11 H3 and N169 in Viet/04 H5 (
