<p id="p0035">Human IAVs comprise three strains: H1N1, H2N2, and H3N2, which were introduced into the population from avian and swine species during pandemic outbreaks over the last century (

While hemagglutinins (HAs), from human IAVs bind specifically to N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) linked α2-6 to galactose (Neu5Acα2-6Gal) present on human upper airway cells, HAs from avian IAV strains preferentially recognize α2-3-linked sialosides (Neu5Acα2-3Gal) (

 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Rogers and Paulson, 1983</xref>). This divergence of receptor structures and/or chemistries forms a protective “species barrier,” preventing transmission and circulation of avian IAV subtypes within humans without adapting to human-type receptors (

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Tumpey et al., 2007</xref>). In addition to well-studied specificity changes, “humanized” HAs have been shown to acquire other adaptations including increased thermal stability, decreased fusion-pH, and increased N-linked glycosylation (

 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). While many of these changes reflect escape from immune responses or represent adaptative alterations to improve binding, infection, and replication in human cells, the role of additional glycans, and particularly details of their composition and structure, remain comparatively under-investigated. Indeed, only two recent literature examples report site-specific and quantitative analysis of N-linked glycans from representative influenza HAs providing limited information with regard to the impact of species of origin and evolution during passage in humans (
