<p id="p0180">Of note, the simultaneous detection of multiple viruses does not necessarily implicate the pathogenic effect at the time of detection, especially when molecular methods are used. It is also difficult to distinguish between active viral infection, viral shedding, and potentially non-pathogenic viral infection. For instance, HBoV and HAdV may have prolonged viral shedding.

 </xref> The detection of two viruses may represent an episode of acute infection in the presence of other viral persistence from a recent infection.

 </xref> Moreover, the mechanisms of disease virulence and viralâ€“viral interaction in multiple infections are not clearly understood. They may result from direct interactions of viral genes or indirect interactions resulting from alterations in the host-environment or immunological interactions.

 </xref> Different pathogenic mechanisms may be triggered by different viruses, which may potentiate or inhibit the effects on each other. For instance, RSV or influenza coinfection with other viruses may associate with a worse outcome.
