<p id="p0185">Of all the respiratory viruses analyzed, HRV, RSV, and PIV were the most commonly identified viruses in descending order. Previous studies have shown slightly different rankings of common respiratory pathogens; nevertheless, HRV has consistently been the most common cause in all age groups.

This was underestimated because patients with a positive quick adenovirus antigen test without proceeding to have xTAG RVP testing were not included in our analysis. Six percent (19/311) of children were reported positive for HCoV, of which 2.5% were positive for OC43 (8/311), 2.2% for NL63 (7/311), 0.6% for 229E (2/311), and 0.6% for HKU1 (2/311). These are similar to previous results.
