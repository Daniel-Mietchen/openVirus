<p id="p0150">The clinical characteristics, laboratory data and outcome of patients with single and multiple viral infections were compared (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> ). Multiple viral infections accounted for 27% (83/311) of patients with a positive RVP report whereas 228 patients had single viral detection. To minimize the confounding effects of bacterial infection on outcome analysis, we excluded patients with AOM, acute sinusitis, and evidence of bacterial infection. As a result, the clinical data of 188 patients with single viral infection and 69 patients with multiple viral infections were compared. Using a multivariable logistic regression model with adjustment by comorbidity, patients with multiple viral infections were younger (OR = 0.812, 95% CI 0.70–0.96, p = 0.015) than those with single viral infection. Interestingly, there was no statistically significant difference in the duration of fever, antibiotics treatment and hospitalization between patients with single and multiple viral infections.
