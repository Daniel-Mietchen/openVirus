<p id="p0145">As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> , 311 patients (mean age 2.68 ± 2.88 years; range 3 days–16 years old) had positive detection for viral pathogens in comparison to 131 patients (mean age 4.21 ± 5.28 years; range 2 days–17 years old) with negative detection. Patients without viral detection were older and had longer duration of fever than those with positive detection for viral pathogens. In multivariable analysis, patients with positive viral detection had significantly lower rate of leukocytosis (p = 0.03), less evidence of bacterial infection (OR = 0.420, 95% CI 0.23–0.75, p = 0.004), and shorter duration of hospitalization (OR = 0.947, 95% CI 0.90–0.99, p = 0.019).
