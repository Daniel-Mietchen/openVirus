<p id="par0300">Since 1997, virological data have been shared and monitored on the Internet through FluNet. This was complemented by FluID in 2009 for reporting epidemiological data. The FluNet and FluID databases support the interpretation of the global influenza situation and also allow a local and regional perspective. In 2016, the Global Influenza Programme of WHO launched a two year pilot project on Respiratory Synctial Virus (RSV) surveillance using the GISRS platform which was participated by 14 countries across all six WHO Regions. The primary objective of this project was to determine seasonality of RSV estimate the burden of RSV-associated hospitalization and provide evidence for introduction of vaccines through informed public health decisions.</p>
