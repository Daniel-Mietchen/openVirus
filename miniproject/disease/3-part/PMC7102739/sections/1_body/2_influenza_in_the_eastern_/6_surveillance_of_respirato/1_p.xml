<p id="par0355">Respiratory syncytial viruses cause about 33 million episodes of acute lower respiratory infections in children under five years worldwide, with about 10% requiring hospital admission and up to 199 000 dying from the infection every year [

 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>]. The countries used the existing surveillance platform for severe acute respiratory infections and identified the highest number of influenza-positive cases in children between 6 and 12 months of age whereas the highest number of cases positive for respiratory syncytial virus were in children between 2 and 6 months [
