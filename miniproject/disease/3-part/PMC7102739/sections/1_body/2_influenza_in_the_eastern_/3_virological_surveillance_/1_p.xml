<p id="par0330">There are 16 national influenza centres in 15 countries of the Region. At least 11 of these centres regularly share influenza virological data with the GISRS. Many of them have laboratory capacity for viral isolation, molecular diagnosis through polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. The capacity of these centres, especially the viral sequencing capacity, has been critical for determining genetic changes in the seasonal influenza virus and for identifying new influenza strains or subtypes. An important function of the centres is to share seasonal influenza viruses with the WHO collaborating centres for vaccine strain selection. Between 2010 and 2017, more and more countries from the Region are, now, sharing seasonal influenza viruses with the WHO Collaborating Center for influenza vaccine strain selection.</p>
