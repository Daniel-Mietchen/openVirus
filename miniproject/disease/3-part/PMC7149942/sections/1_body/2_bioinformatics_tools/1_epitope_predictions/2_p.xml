<p id="p0225">IEDB (Immune Epitope DataBase) Analysis Resource provides a collection of tools for the prediction and analysis of immune epitopes. T-cell and B-cell epitopes prediction tools in the software suite can predict binding affinities for MHC Class I and Class II molecules. It includes tools to predict intrinsic potential for a peptide to be a T-cell epitope based on proteasomal processing, transporter associated with processing (TAP), and MHC Class I binding. The B-cell tools predict linear epitopes, and include Ellipro which analyses a protein antigenâ€™s 3D structure in terms of complex geometrical shapes to predict possible linear and conformational epitopes. An important analyses tool in IEDB is population coverage where the fraction of individuals that can respond to a given set of epitopes is predicted based on the HLA genotypic frequencies assumed for the target population.</p>
