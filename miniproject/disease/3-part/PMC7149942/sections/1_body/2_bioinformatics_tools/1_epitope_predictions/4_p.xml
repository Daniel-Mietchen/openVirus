<p id="p0235">VaxiJen is the first on-line server for alignment-free prediction of protective antigens based on physicochemical properties of proteins. It derives from the principal amino acid properties of the protein sequences and uses bacterial, viral, and tumor protein datasets to design models for protein antigenicity prediction. Test sets showed prediction accuracy of between 70% and 89%.</p>
