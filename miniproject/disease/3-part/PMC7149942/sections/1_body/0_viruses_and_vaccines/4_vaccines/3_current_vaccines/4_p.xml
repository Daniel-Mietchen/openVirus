<p id="p0095">An interesting application of these ideas, as yet at an experimental stage, has been reported recently. A group at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Seattle, United States, has created a malaria parasite vaccine by genetically deleting three genes that are expressed in the preerythrocytic stage from the
