<p id="p0070">Vaccines relate to adaptive immunity, being very specific to the pathogen addressed. This is of vital importance to the success of the vaccination program. RNA viruses such as influenza mutate very rapidly and vaccines developed against an influenza strain in one year may not work against the strain of the next year; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the USA prescribes different vaccines every year to combat flu strains they expect would be the major trends in the year. Drugs face the same hurdle: drugs such as Relenza developed against influenza have been rendered useless in a few years because of specific mutations in the flu strains, and the current favorite oseltamivir drugs, marketed as Tamiflu, are also reported to be facing resistance in some parts of the United States and Japan due to viral mutations. No vaccines have been devised yet against a common viral disease like dengue; rotavirus, an intestinal viral infection that kills millions of infants each year, have witnessed repeated vaccine failures, albeit with some complications in postvaccination situation. DNA viruses are much more stable and vaccines can be active for far longer periods. This is the reason smallpox could be eradicated, most of the world is almost polio-free, and human papillomavirus can be addressed by commercially available vaccines.</p>
