<p id="p0045">Adaptive immunity is the body’s response to specific pathogens, referred to as antigens, that pass the innate immunity barrier through various means. Adaptive immunity is of two types—humoral immunity that is rooted in blood serum and other body fluids (known as humors in ancient times) and cell-based immunity. In both cases the immune response is mediated primarily by two cell types—B-lymphocytes (B-cell) and T-lymphocytes (T-cell), both produced in the bone marrow. The B-cells mature in the bone marrow and on leaving express antigen-binding receptors, called antibodies which are unique to each B-cell, on their membrane; the T-lymphocytes, or T-cells, move from the bone marrow to the thymus to mature, on leaving which each T-cell expresses a unique membrane-bound molecule called T-cell receptor which also binds to antigens under certain conditions. Each of the antibodies or receptors is encoded by specific genes which undergo random rearrangements and create different antibodies. Every B-cell or T-cell has thousands of antibodies or receptors on their surface, each cell having their own unique and identical antibodies; collectively, there would be about 10
 <sup>10</sup> B-cells and 10
 <sup>9</sup> T-cells produced in the bone marrow, but these numbers are reduced to some extent by filters to prevent autoimmune threats from the antibodies. These antibodies bind to the antigens with extreme specificity; each antibody can bond with a specific antigen and even a change in one amino acid of the antigen can nullify the bonding. The availability of millions of B- and T-cells with their own antibodies provides diversity and specificity in the antibody–antigen binding against multifarious pathogens.
