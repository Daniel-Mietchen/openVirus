There is a long history of efforts to aid the process and combat viral menace; some of the landmark achievements are listed in 
 <xref rid="t0015" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref> , but much more needs to be done to fight against recurrent and new epidemics. Current efforts at rational design of antiviral vaccines to augment this effort are based on our understanding of the microbiology and genomics of viruses and the human immune system, which we recount here very briefly.
