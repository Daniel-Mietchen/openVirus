<p id="p0115">The most widely accessed preeminent resources in bioinformatics are provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) of the National Institute of Health, United States, and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) which have extensive databases of biological information and analytical software. Databases include GenBank, a repository of all sequences at NCBI which are augmented by submissions by researchers of new sequence data, Protein Data Bank (PDB) which contains information on protein sequences and structures, PubChem that contains data on chemical structures, and several other databases; equivalent records and access to the databases are maintained by EMBL and by DDBJ (DNA Databank of Japan), part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC). Nucleotide sequences record evolution of organisms more directly than any other biological information and thus the INSDC constitute an invaluable resource for study of living systems. The initial submissions to these databases are mainly from regional researchers and these are then distributed among the collaborating institutions in approved format for worldwide access. To aid in comparative and homology studies of sequences, popular software tools available with these institutional sources include BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), ClustalW for multiple alignment of sequences, Cn3D for viewing the 3D structure of available protein structure data, and many others. Complementing the efforts of these major institutions are numerous other bioinformatics tools developed for specific tasks available across the web. We cover a selection of these in a later section in some detail.</p>
