<p id="p0110">Bioinformatics plays a central role in the new paradigm of vaccine design. Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field bringing together concepts of biology, mathematics, statistics, and computer science to provide a quantitative basis for understanding, classifying, modeling, querying, and analyzing biological data. With the development of bioinformatics, it has been possible to construct extensive databases of various biological quantities such as DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, analyze the huge quantities of accumulated data for similarities and dissimilarities to understand newly sequenced sequences and their interrelationships, and gain new insights, for example, where we learnt of the fractal nature of DNA sequences; the newly evolved science of molecular evolution would scarcely have been possible without bioinformatics. Recent progress in and wide dissemination of Internet resources have enabled several tools of bioinformatics analyses to be available and universally accessible across the web. These developments have spurred innovation and progress in biological data analyses and are contributing significantly to new ways of analyzing viral structures and designing vaccines.</p>
