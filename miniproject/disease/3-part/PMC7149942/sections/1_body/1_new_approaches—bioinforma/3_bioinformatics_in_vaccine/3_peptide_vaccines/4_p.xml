<p id="p0145">As an alternative approach, alignment-free techniques, barely a couple of decades old, are becoming increasingly prevalent. Several methods were proposed to compute sequence differences by the concept of k-mer/word frequencies where the bases were grouped in batches and analyzed; other techniques involved analyses by substrings within sequences and by information theory. In another technique which has gathered a lot of momentum, the initial impetus was provided by graphical representations of DNA sequences in 2D, 3D, and higher dimensions, which then were assessed quantitatively to provide a measure of the degrees of similarity and dissimilarity between sequences; the quantitative measures are computed either by geometrical means or by matrix methods (see Video 1 for a brief introduction). In the 2D model, specifically, the geometrical approach is intuitive and simple: For a DNA or RNA sequence of N nucleotides, one starts from the origin of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and proceeds one step in the negative x-direction for an adenine, one step in the positive y-direction for a cytosine, one step in the positive x-direction for a guanine, and one step in the negative y-direction for a thymine (uracil for RNA). Doing this successively for each base in the sequence starting from the beginning traces out a graph in the xy-plain which reflects the base distribution in the sequence. For each base there is the a (

 </disp-formula>which enables a phylogenetic tree to be drawn to show the relationship between the sequences of a closely knit family. The beauty of the graph radius defined earlier is that identical values of the gR imply identical sequences or sequence segments. This enabled the current authors to trace the movements of avian flu viral strains across countries and determine incidences of recombination events in influenza hemagglutinin. There are other methods of computing sequence descriptors, mainly by matrix methods where the eigenvalues, especially the leading eigenvalue, of the defining matrix serve to identify a sequence, as can be seen in the reviews listed in Further Reading.
