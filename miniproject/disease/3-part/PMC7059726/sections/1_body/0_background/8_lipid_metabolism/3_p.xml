<p id="Par36">Evidently, higher production of these complex lipids in the cell will require increased biosynthesis of fatty acids. In this regard, the results of a study revealed that influenza infection could induce fatty acid biosynthesis and cholesterol metabolism in human lung basal epithelial tumor cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. Since SREBPs are thoroughly identified as stimulators of expression of many genes involved in lipid and sterol biosynthesis, including fatty acid synthase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">104</xref>], their upregulation by the influenza virus (through induction of mTORC1 signaling, as discussed earlier) may logically explain the increased rate of lipogenesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. A coincidence between increased fatty acid synthesis and a decline in fatty acid β-oxidation has been found during influenza infection, which is attributed to a variety of mechanisms directly or indirectly related to viral replication. For instance, the sharp increase of proinflammatory cytokines during influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] causes decreased hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation both in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>], most likely through excessive nitric oxide and other related free radicals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>]. In addition, increased temperature of cells during infection (which could be the result of virus replication and fever) causes heat stress which in turn can considerably downregulate carnitine palmitoyltransferase II (CPT II) activity and reduce the β-oxidation and ATP levels in fibroblasts of influenza-associated encephalopathy patients and healthy volunteers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. A study on influenza-infected mice demonstrated a significant depression in long hepatic chain fatty acid β-oxidation at both the mRNA and protein level, as several β-oxidation essential enzymes were reduced by &gt; 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>]. A significant decrease in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation simultaneously with increased biosynthesis of fatty acids and membrane lipids may reflect the fact that the virus stores structural lipids to produce more infectious particles. In addition to impaired metabolism in mitochondria, influenza infection induces severe peroxisomal lipid metabolism disorders, which can be inferred from abnormal levels of several specific long-chain fatty acids [
