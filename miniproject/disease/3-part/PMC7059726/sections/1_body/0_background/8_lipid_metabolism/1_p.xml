<p id="Par34">Following infection, levels of phospholipids and several lipid derivatives undergo perturbations. Several lines of evidence have shown that in obese mice due to abnormalities in the metabolism of fatty acids and phospholipids, induction of influenza infection produces a more severe inflammatory response in comparison with non-obese mice [

According to a study, diacyl glycerophosphocholine (PC) and diacyl glycerophosphoethanolamine (PE) species (containing 20:4 or 22:6 as precursors of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) respectively) are associated with influenza-related diseases. Interestingly, glycerophospholipid species (PC (18:1/20:4) and PC (16:0/22:6)) yields increase during the influenza infection. In addition, upsurge in PC (18:1/20:4) and PE (18:0/22:4) species is associated with tissue lesions in the lungs and trachea. Several phospholipids containing 20:4, especially PC (18:1/20:4), serve as AA reservoirs in cells, breakdown of which increases the cellular levels of AA [

In a prospective cohort study on influenza-infected subjects, lipid inflammatory mediators in serum samples of patients were mainly AA-derived oxylipins, including TXB2, 15-deoxy-12,14-PGD2, 20-HETE, 5,6-DHET, 5-oxoETE, LTE4, and 12-HpETE. Although all of these metabolites were shown to be elevated shortly after the infection, 5,6-DHET and 5-oxoETE levels remained considerably high up to 4â€‰weeks post-infection, indicating a constant pulmonary inflammation [
