<p id="Par32">Molecular mechanisms through which the virus can control the metabolic pathways have been thoroughly identified. Smallwood et al. have shown that an increase in glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glutaminolysis following influenza infection may be related to the loss of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway homeostasis and subsequent increase in c-Myc expression in the infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Regarding the available results, the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2 signaling can be activated by a variety of influenza virus proteins. The viral hemagglutinin (HA) protein, along with virus replication, can upregulate PDPK1-mediated phosphorylation and activate AKT, which is required for induction of the mTORC1 signaling pathway by the influenza virus. On the other hand, influenza M2 protein is capable of down-regulation of the mTORC1 inhibitor REDD1, thereby enhancing the mTORC1 activation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. mTORC1 signaling, in turn, promotes c-Myc expression at the translational level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Additionally, the NS1 protein can effectively promote the activity of mTORC2, which, in turn, upregulates c-Myc through FoxO inhibition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Moreover, AKT-dependent inactivation of FoxOs can increase glycolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>] by removing the suppressive force of c-Myc [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Myc enhances glycolysis by upregulating expression of the glucose transporter GLUT1, glycolytic genes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as the converter of pyruvate to lactate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. mTORC1 also mediates upregulation of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), a factor that increases the expression of various genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>], including several glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters, and LDH [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. AKT is able to promote the expression and membrane localization of GLUT1 as well as the function of phosphofructokinase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. Furthermore, AKT is demonstrated to activate SREBP in an mTORC1-dependent manner [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and to upregulate SREBP by enhancing the stability of its processed form [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. SREBP1 is shown to be required for the mTORC1-induced increase in the expression of G6PD, which is the rate-limiting enzyme of the PPP oxidative branch [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>].
