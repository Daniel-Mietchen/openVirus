<p id="Par41">Innate immune cells can recognize influenza A viruses and their infected cells by toll-like receptors (TLRs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. This recognition can lead to the induction of an inflammatory response that, in turn, controls the replication and spread of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. H5N1, H7N7, and H7N9 were correlated with increased transcription of the cytokine response in mice. Severe infection with H7N9, H7N7, H5N1, or 1918 virus can lead to upregulation of inflammatory cytokine genes along with downregulation of lipid metabolism and coagulation genes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. This uncontrolled proinflammatory response accompanied by an inadequate anti-inflammatory response is referred to as the cytokine storm [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils, and lung epithelial cells have useful roles in the cytokine storm developed by influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. Severe cytokine storm, with greater levels of interferons and tumor necrosis factors, has been recognized in patients hospitalized due to influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Such influenza-induced cytokine storms, together with viral virulence, can develop severe lung injury in patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. It is believed that the level of the cytokine storm is directly associated with the severity of the disease caused by influenza infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>]. Some specific polymorphisms in immune system genes have determinative roles in the outcome of influenza infection. Our previous studies have shown a relationship between cytokine gene polymorphisms and severity of the influenza disease. Several cytokines were evaluated after influenza A/H3N2 virus infection, among which IL-17 rs2275913 GG and AG, GG and GT of IL-10 (rs1800872) and IL-28 (rs8099917) genotype TT polymorphisms were associated with increased risk of influenza infection.
