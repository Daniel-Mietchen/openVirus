<p id="Par43">IFNs are known to be capable of depletion of polyamines to limit virus replication. Polyamines are small ornithine-derived polycationic molecules which encompass three molecules: putrescine, spermidine, and spermine. Spermidine and spermine depletion is one of the compelling mechanisms through which IFNs produce their antiviral effects on the replication of RNA viruses. Mechanistically speaking, polyamines appear to play a pivotal role in the processes of RNA transcription and protein translation of viruses, making them a promising target to combat viral infections [
