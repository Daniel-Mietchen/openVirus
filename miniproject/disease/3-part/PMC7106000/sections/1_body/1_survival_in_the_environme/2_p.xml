<p>The virus is not sensitive to the process of decomposition of carcasses. Dead wild boars often remain in the environment until they are completely decomposed. The virus from carcasses of wild boars also passes into the soil. In experimental studies, it was shown that the virus survives up to 112 days in forest soil. The probability of infection with the virus depends on the susceptibility of the wild boar and on the intensity and frequency of contact with the soil on which a wild boar carcass lay. Removal of their carcasses would seem to be important in the reduction of ASF epidemics (
