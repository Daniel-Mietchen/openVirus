<p>African swine fever (ASF) is an infectious and highly contagious slow-spreading viral disease of domestic pigs and wild boars. The aetiological agent is African swine fever virus (ASFV) belonging to the 
 <italic>Asfarviridae</italic> family. ASFV is a large enveloped virus with icosahedral symmetry and a virion diameter of 200 nm. The viral genome is double-stranded DNA (

 <italic>et al</italic>. (
 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0001_ref_032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), the ASF virus strains that have caused the current Eurasian epidemic are usually highly pathogenic, and they cause acute disease in experimental conditions in wild boars and domestic pigs. However, very small doses of the virus that do not cause clinical symptoms in wild boars or domestic pigs may cause asymptomatic spread and virus shedding. From the epidemiological point of view, the asymptomatic carriage of ASFV by wild boars poses an additional threat in the form of long-term disease persistence without any signs by which to be aware of the situation.
