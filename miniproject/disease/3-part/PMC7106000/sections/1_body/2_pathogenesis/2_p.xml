<p>The sites of initial viral replication are monocytes and macrophages of the lymph nodes located closest to where the virus enters the body. Macrophages are cells that are responsible for the development of an effective immune response in the case of an infection. Replication of the virus in macrophages leads to dysfunction of these cells (

After infection, macrophages are destroyed, but before they are, the phenomenon of haemadsorption occurs, involving the attachment of erythrocytes to their surface (

Based on this phenomenon, it can be concluded that after initial replication in macrophages the virus is transported in blood, which leads to the spread of the virus throughout the body. It also has the ability to multiply in hepatocytes and epithelial neutrophils. Viraemia or a general blood infection usually starts from four to eight days after infection. Due to the lack of neutralising antibodies in pigs, the viral load may persist for a long period.
