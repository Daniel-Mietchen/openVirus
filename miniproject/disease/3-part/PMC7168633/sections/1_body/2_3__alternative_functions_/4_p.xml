<p>Affinity purification and mass spectrometry determined that ZIKV C interacts with various NMD proteins, including poly-A binding protein C1 (PABPC1) and up-frameshift protein 1 (UPF1) [
 <xref rid="B58-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. This provides some insight into the global transcriptome changes, but there has also been evidence of DENV C binding core histones in the nucleus and death domain associated protein (DAXX) [

 <xref rid="B60-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. These interactions can hinder nucleosome remodeling or prevent binding to necessary transcription factors, respectively, ultimately perturbing gene expression. Although these and other studies have shed some light on alternative functions of flavivirus capsid, capsid has been shown to interact with many host proteins [
