<p>Various groups have shown that, in addition to its association with lipid droplets, flavivirus capsids localize in the nucleoli [

 <xref rid="B54-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The basic regions of the final helix of capsid protein appear to serve as a bi-partite nuclear localization sequence (NLS), identified by importin-α [

 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B36-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Importin-α binds these sequences in the cytoplasm and is then recognized by importin-β, which mediates transport of flavivirus capsid into the nucleus. However, across the mosquito-borne flavivirus capsids from different viruses there appear to be differing additional NLSs [
 <xref rid="B45-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] which may use alternative pathways to enter the nucleus. Considering capsid’s role in viral packaging and the replication factories described above, it is interesting that capsid can dissociate with the phospholipid membranes of the ER and lipid droplets. This localization has indicated that capsid may have other functions or additional roles in flavivirus pathogenesis aside from packaging.
