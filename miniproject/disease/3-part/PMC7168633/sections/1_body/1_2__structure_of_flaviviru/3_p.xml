<p>Opposite the hydrophilic or basic face of the capsid dimer is a relatively hydrophobic surface, which is thought to interact with membranes and lipid droplets aiding in the assembly of flavivirus particles [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Mutations to select hydrophobic residues on the hydrophobic surface of capsid can prevent its association with lipid droplets and attenuate virus. For example, L50 and L54 residues in the α2 helices of DENV C dimers are necessary for the capsid protein’s association with lipid droplets (location indicated by blue circles in the bottom portion of 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00042-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Mutations in these residues prevented this interaction with lipid droplets but also resulted in the production of fewer virus particles without affecting replication of the viral genome or translation of any viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It appears that capsid proteins are stored on lipid droplets in the cytoplasm and mobilized for RNA packaging when needed, as lipids are constantly shuffled between the ER membrane and lipid droplets.
