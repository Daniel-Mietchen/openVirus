<p>Based on the very basic surface of capsid proteins it is reasonable to consider that capsid binds to the negatively charged phosphate backbone in all nucleic acids. In 2018, Shang et al. [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] performed an isothermal titration calorimetry assay to measure the binding affinity of ZIKV C to four types of nucleic acid: 5′ UTR of the ZIKV genome (ssRNA), dsRNA, ssDNA, and dsDNA, which may be found in the nucleus. Interestingly their studies indicated that ZIKV C bound all nucleic acids with affinities in the nanomolar range. This high affinity for all nucleic acids lends itself to the dsRNA binding ability which prevents dicer activity in mosquitos, as noted previously [

 <xref rid="B49-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Although the affinity for all nucleic acids is high, the specificity appears to be low. The dissociation constant for DENV capsid is roughly 20 nM [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Considering the wide range of nucleic acid binding and the varied localization of flavivirus capsid it is reasonable that there may be additional (potentially transient) nucleic acid interactions for the capsid proteins that have yet to be described.
