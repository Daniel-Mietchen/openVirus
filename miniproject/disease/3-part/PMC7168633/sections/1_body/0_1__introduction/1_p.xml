<p>Flaviviruses are arthropod-borne viruses that plague both tropic and sub-tropic regions. These viruses belong to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> and genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>. There are slightly over 70 species of flaviviruses that have been discovered so far [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Of these, roughly half are mosquito-borne, including the heavily studied: yellow fever (YFV), West Nile (WNV), dengue (DENV), Japanese encephalitis (JEV), and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, which will be the focus of this review [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These viruses appear to affect tropic and sub-tropic regions but pose a serious global health risk due to geographic expansion of mosquito vectors [

 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].Only a small subset of infections result in symptoms, ranging from mild fever to hemorrhagic fever or encephalitis to potentially death. The 2015â€“2016 outbreak of ZIKV in South America was also associated with microcephaly in infants and the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults [

 <xref rid="B6-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. There are only a few Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved vaccines for humans currently available for a few mosquito-borne flaviviruses (namely YFV, JEV, and DENV). However, the DENV vaccine has shown limited efficacy against all DENV serotypes [

 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and resulted in injury to children in the Philippines, causing safety concerns [
 <xref rid="B9-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Even with developments in the design of safe and efficacious vaccines, there are unfortunately no anti-viral treatments clinically available for infected individuals. As the features of the life cycle appear to be conserved across flaviviruses, there has been much work done to identify pan-flaviviral anti-viral targets and to engineer drugs to halt pathogenesis at various stages [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Thus, it is important to work towards a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms throughout the viral life cycle.
