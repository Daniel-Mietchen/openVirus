<p>Here, we emphasize the importance of the capsid in pathogenesis of mosquito-borne flaviviruses, from its role in genome packaging to alternative functions that are emerging. Although flavivirus genome structure and replication strategies are largely the same, this review focuses on the mosquito-borne flaviviruses. These viruses are more globally distributed than that of the tick-borne viruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus [

Capsidâ€™s various interactions throughout the host cell provide a larger scope of targets than the other flavivirus structural proteins. A greater understanding of these interactions and their implications should lead to insightful drug and vaccine design.
