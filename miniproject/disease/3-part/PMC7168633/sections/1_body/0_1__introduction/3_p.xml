<p>The structural proteins are necessary for the formation of virus particles. Of these proteins, (pr)M and E are integral membrane proteins, with E protruding on the particle surface. This protein is the primary antigen associated with recognition by neutralizing antibodies [

This is the primary function of capsid protein. Prior to encapsidation, and discrete from genome replication, capsid dimers are stored on lipid droplets. Their ability to interact with lipid droplets is essential for efficient production of virus particles [

 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Capsid is also able to enter the nucleus and wreak havoc on ribosome biogenesis and the host transcriptome [

 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The function of these interactions within the nucleus and nucleolus in the context of the flavivirus life cycle is poorly understood. While the non-structural proteins are necessary for viral replication, virion assembly, and evasion of immune response, capsid appears to have additional roles aside from genome encapsidation as we will highlight throughout this review.
