<p>As translation, replication, and packaging are all distinct processes of the viral life cycle, they are separated spatiotemporally into compartments generated by the rearrangement of the ER membrane [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The rearrangement results in invaginations into the ER, which resemble vesicles with a pore connecting the interior to the cytoplasm. This creates a replication-favorable environment for the virus and has been viewed using 3D-electron tomography (ET), transmission and scanning electron microscopy (TEM and SEM, respectively) in both mammalian and insect cells [

 <xref rid="B25-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,

 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Similar compartments have been seen for alpha- and nodaviruses [
 <xref rid="B11-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. These compartments have been referred to as “replication factories” and are roughly 60 to 90 nm in diameter, depending on cell type [
 <xref rid="B27-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Within these replication factories three viral proteins are known to interact with the primarily double-stranded viral RNA: NS3, NS5, and capsid. Specific mutations in NS2A appear to hinder packaging [

 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. It has recently been shown that dengue and ZIKV NS2A recruits the viral genome by binding specifically to the highly-structured 3′ UTR and the C-prM-E complex and protease to site of virion assembly coordinating capsid loading and subsequent virion assembly [

 <xref rid="B31-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The NS3 helicase separates nascent (+) strand from template (−) strand starting at the 3′ end [
 <xref rid="B32-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and NS5 binds the 5′ UTR of the (+) sense viral genome and translocates to the 3′ end upon cyclization of the RNA to begin genome replication [
