<p>With climate change broadening the range of mosquito vectors and the potential severity of symptoms associated with flavivirus infections, these emerging viruses are becoming a global issue. Flaviviruses are already the most prevalent viral infections in the world, with almost 400 million cases per year, roughly a quarter of those symptomatic, and resulting in 25,000 deaths per year [

 <xref rid="B77-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-pathogens-09-00042" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. It appears that changing the focus from the surface proteins (E and M) to capsid would be substantiated. There is certainly potential in designing vaccine with capsid mutations or deletions or even providing a subunit vaccine containing the capsid protein.
