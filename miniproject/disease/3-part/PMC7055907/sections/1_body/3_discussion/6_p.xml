<p>RVF can infect many species of animals causing severe disease in domesticated animals including cattle, sheep, camels and goats. Sheep and goats appear to be more susceptible than cattle or camels [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Donkeys were included in this study because they are domesticated in large numbers in the study area and mosquito blood meal analysis have shown donkey blood making donkeys a possible reservoir for RVFV that should be looked into. We found out that persons who made regular contact with cattle and donkeys were at a significantly greater risk of RVFV infection than those who did not, a finding which was also observed by a study conducted by Anyangu et al, 2010, during the 2007 outbreak in Kenya [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This can be attributed to the fact that the animals they come in contact with through high risk related activities mentioned earlier could be infected with RVFV hence transmission. Animal contact can occur through slaughtering, herding, sheltering sick animals within the homestead, birthing, or consuming and handling products from sick animals such as milk, meat, and blood [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007979.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Our study has shown that participants with regular contact with animals through birthing were at higher risk of RVFV infection. Community education should be done on these risk factors to minimise disease transmission.
