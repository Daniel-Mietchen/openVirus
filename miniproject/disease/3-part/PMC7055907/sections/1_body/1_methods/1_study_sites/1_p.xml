These areas are inhabited by nomadic pastoral communities who make use of this harsh environment by keeping sheep, goats, camels, and cattle as agricultural production is not feasible. The lifestyle of communities in these areas is characterized by periodic nomadic movement and temporary and/or permanent settlements in areas with sufficient pasture and water. The livestock migratory routes were monitored using GPS collar (Followit Sweden AB) installed on five selected herds in the three counties and their movement was monitored for two years. County and sub-county shapefiles were obtained from Kenya Open Data portal.
