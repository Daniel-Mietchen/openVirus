    <bold>Additional file 5: Table S5.</bold> DEGs in the host modules enriched with differentially expressed genes. Pathway enrichment analysis was done on the genes in the host modules with significant responses to influenza infection. Corrected p-values of 0.05 were used as cut off and the pathways with non-significant p-values are shown as N/A.
