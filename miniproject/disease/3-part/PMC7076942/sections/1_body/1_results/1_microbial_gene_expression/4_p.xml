<p id="Par31">To characterize antibiotic resistance gene expression profiles, we aligned the metatranscriptomic sequence reads (approximately 7.5 M reads per sample) to an antibiotic resistance database (MEGARes). On average, around 3100 reads per sample are aligned to the ARG database; assignment to an ARG required matches to at least two regions per gene, with a minimum of 10 mapped reads. Across the dataset, we identified genes that confer resistance to 13 classes of antibiotics (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) with variations across the samples. Genes identified that confer resistance to beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, tetracycline, and macrolide were also found to be expressed in another study that focused on the human gut microbiome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Specific ARGs were also differentially expressed between the two groups identified by clustering the microbial gene expression profiles. For example, genes conferring resistance to phenicol were overexpressed in group 1 compared to group 2 (cutoff of 0.05 for Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected
