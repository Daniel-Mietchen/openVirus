<p id="Par34">We identified 567 co-expressed host gene modules (subnetworks); 38 of these were enriched with genes with a significant response to influenza virus infection (|FC| &gt; = 2, 5% FDR) (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>). The samples were separated into group 1 and group 2 based on the metatranscriptomic data, and a differentially expressed gene (DEG) analysis from the host transcriptome was performed within each of the two groups. By overlapping the group-based DEGs with the DEGs in the 38 enriched host modules identified from all samples (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">S5</xref>), we identified some host modules with genes only upregulated or downregulated within one of the two groups (Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM6" ref-type="media">S6</xref>), such as modules M44, M45, and M46. This suggests a correlation between microbial gene expression and the host response to influenza virus infection.
