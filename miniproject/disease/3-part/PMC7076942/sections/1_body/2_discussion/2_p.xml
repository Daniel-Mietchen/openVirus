<p id="Par37">We identified several genes as being differentially expressed between the two subject groups that were clustered based on their microbial gene expression profiles. Pathways found to be enriched included a number of genes involved in bacterial physiology, such as the bacterial secretion system, which is one of the strategies used by pathogenic bacteria to secrete virulence factors for host invasion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. ABC transporters, which contribute to substrate transport across the bacterial membrane and are related to antibiotic resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], were also enriched with differentially expressed genes between the two groups. Several bacterial taxa were differentially abundant between the two groups, including

 <italic>Moraxella</italic>, which have a number of species that can carry ARGs [
