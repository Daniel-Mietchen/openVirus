<p id="Par40">Using gene co-expression network analysis, we characterized associations between host responses to influenza virus infection and the microbiome, as well as ARG expression in the upper respiratory tract. By integrating the microbiome information, we observed correlations between specific host modules and microbial community composition and gene expression. For example, 
 <italic>Veillonellaceae,</italic> a family commonly represented in the respiratory tract, had positive correlations with some of the host modules that were enriched with genes involved in the response to viral and bacterial invasion, such as type I interferon signaling. Influenza virus is known to stimulate type I interferons and promote bacterial colonization in mice; type I interferon signaling is also known to have both protective and detrimental responses to bacterial infections depending on the invading pathogens [

The host module M47, enriched with genes involved in interferon signaling, also had strong correlations with ARGs against the sulfonamides and the bacterial secretion system. One of the key regulators in this host module, GBP1, was upregulated during influenza infection. GBP1 is a GTPase induced by interferon with antiviral and antimicrobial activities [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] that can recruit NADPH enzyme components and antimicrobial peptides to help bacterial killing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. A recent study determined that even when there is no identifiable bacterial co-infection or super-infection following influenza virus infection, host responses to “bacterial” patterns are detected in whole blood transcriptomic analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. While the subjects in our study were not tested for bacterial infection, we observed correlations between host responses to influenza virus infection and specific bacterial taxa. Observations from the network analysis could be the result of how influenza virus infection impacts the host and the microbial community, and how, in return, the host alters the microbiome in the respiratory tract. The expression of some ARGs is regulated by signal transduction systems, such as the two-component systems, which are also involved in other physiological processes, such as adhesion and autolysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Correlations between the host response and ARG expression indicate an effect of the host on the microbiome, which in turn impacts ARG expression that can be regulated by the bacterial response to stress. Thus, the network suggests several specific connections between the host modules (especially the interferon signaling pathway and GBP1), the respiratory tract microbial composition, and the microbial gene expression.
