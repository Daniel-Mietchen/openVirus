<p id="Par52">The genus-level assignments from the 16S rRNA gene profiles were centered log-ratio (clr) transformed, and filtered to the genera, which are highly variable. The analysis was performed by combining the compPLS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and spls packages in Rstudio [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] with the antibiotic resistance gene expression profiles as the response matrix, and the filtered 16S rRNA gene profiles as predictors.
