<p id="Par44">Total RNA was isolated from 80% of the volume of each respiratory sample with the QIAGEN RNeasy Micro Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations and stored at − 80 °C. No mRNA enrichment or rRNA depletion steps were performed due to the limited biomass of the starting material. Double-stranded cDNA was synthesized and amplified from 200–500 pg of input RNA with the NuGEN Ovation RNA-seq V2 kit (NuGEN Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA) and purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). cDNA was sheared to 250 bp using the S220 Focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA) and purified using Agencourt RNAClean XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA). Sequencing libraries were prepared from 100 ng of purified, sheared cDNA with the NuGen Ovation Ultralow System V2 1-16 (NuGEN Technologies, Inc., San Carlos, CA). Libraries were quantified by qPCR using the KAPA Library Quantification Kit (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, MA) on a Roche 480 LightCycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland); their size distributions were measured on a 2200 TapeStation using a D1000 ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Libraries were diluted to 2 nM in dilution buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 8.5) and combined with equimolar input into 4 sequencing pools (9 libraries per pool). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 100 bp) was performed at the Genomics Core Facility (Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, New York University) on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument with TruSeq SBS V3 chemistry according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA). Each pool was run on one lane of a High Output flowcell.</p>
