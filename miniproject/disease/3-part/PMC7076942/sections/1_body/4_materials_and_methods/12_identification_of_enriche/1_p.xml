<p id="Par56">To functionally annotate gene signatures and gene modules identified in this study, enrichment analysis using Fisher’s exact test (FET) was performed of the established pathways and signatures—including the gene ontology (GO) categories and MSMicrobial gene expression profiling of subjectsigDB—and the subject area-specific gene sets—including influenza host factors, Inflammasome, Interferome, and InnateDB. The hub genes in each subnetwork were identified using the adopted Fisher’s inverse chi-squared approach in MEGENA; Bonferroni-corrected 
 <italic>p</italic> values smaller than 0.05 were set as the threshold to identify significant hubs.
