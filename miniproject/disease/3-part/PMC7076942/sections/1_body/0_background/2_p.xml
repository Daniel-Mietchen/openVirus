<p id="Par26">Whereas the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance has been widely studied in the gut microbiome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], there have been limited attempts to profile antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) expression in the respiratory tract, the focus of the current study. The gut microbiome is considered to be a reservoir of antibiotic resistance, and studies have reported that antibiotics, by modifying the microbial community, can indirectly affect the immune response. This was demonstrated through the display of microbial-associated molecular patterns to the receptors on immune and epithelial cells in the host [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The possible consequence of this indirect response is varied stimulation of toll-like receptors, resulting in an altered immune response downstream [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Whether similar effects occur in the respiratory tract has not been fully addressed.
