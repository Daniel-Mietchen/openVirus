<p>Much debate still exists regarding the legislation of nanomaterials, which is in an early stage of development. In addition, there is a lack of a clear definition of nanomaterials, lack of standard methods for assessment of pharmacology, toxicology and efficacy evaluation of nano-based formulations and lack of worldwide network for gathering and sharing pertinent information. According to Schnell-Inderst et al. (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) 12% of the documents related to the test of medical devices are written by academics and the regulators write the rest. In addition, there is a low number of experts in nanomaterials in regulatory agencies, resulting in the delayed development of these documents. Another issue is that FDA use the traditional regulatory frameworks to approve products, which contains nanomaterials (Jones et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Nano-based formulations are evaluated by FDA using case-by-case approach, through combination product framework in order to determine regulatory framework will be used. Three main challenges should be addressed by FDA to boost the market of nano-based formulations: (i) development of a regulatory framework specific to nanomaterials; (ii) development of methods capable of characterize and quantify the toxicological impacts of nanomaterials, and (iii) deal with public acceptance and understanding through awareness programs and product labeling (Hua et al.,
