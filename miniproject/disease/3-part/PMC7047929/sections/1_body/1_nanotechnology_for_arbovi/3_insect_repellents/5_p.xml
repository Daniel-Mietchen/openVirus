<p>Werdin González et al. prepared and characterized polymeric nanoparticles (composed of PEG and chitosan) for the encapsulation of essential oils (geranium and bergamot). Evaluation was also made of the acute and residual larvicidal activities of the formulations against 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>. Physicochemical characterization showed that the PEG nanoparticles containing the essential oils had a mean size of &lt;255 nm and provided encapsulation efficiencies between 68 and 77%, while the chitosan nanoparticles presented a mean size of &lt;535 nm and encapsulation efficiencies between 22 and 38%. Both systems showed high larvicidal activity (acute and residual), with the chitosan-based formulations having the best effects. These findings demonstrated the potential of polymeric nanoparticles containing essential oils for use as eco-friendly larvicidal products (Werdin González et al.,
