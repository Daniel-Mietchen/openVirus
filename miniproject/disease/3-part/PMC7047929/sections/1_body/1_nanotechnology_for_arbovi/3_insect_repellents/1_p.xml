<p>The development of new nanotechnology-based formulations for the encapsulation of natural and synthetic repellents is an important strategy for obtaining systems that are more effective and have fewer undesirable impacts. These sustained-release formulations provide controlled or slow release of active agents into the environment, increasing the duration of action and reducing human exposure to the agent (for example, by permeation through the skin). Encapsulation also protects the active agent against premature degradation caused by the effects of light, temperature, oxidation, and humidity, among others (Tavares et al.,

Numerous matrices (synthetic and natural) can be used for the preparation of carrier systems, including polymers, proteins, lipids, polysaccharides, and others. It should be noted that the main desirable characteristics of such matrices are biocompatibility and biodegradability, as well as low cost (Barradas et al.,
