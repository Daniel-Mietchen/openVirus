<p>Forgearin et al. prepared and characterized permethrin-loaded lipid nanocapsules and tested their application as repellents in clothes. The formulations presented a mean particle diameter of 201 ± 4 nm, with a monomodal size distribution and permethrin content of 4.6 ± 0.1 mg/mL. It was observed that even after washing and with the action of temperature, the polyester fabrics containing the nanoparticles had higher concentrations of permethrin, compared to those containing only the free compound. The results showed that the innovative repellent spray composed of the nanoparticle formulation was useful for the impregnation of clothes and was promising for the protection of an individual against insects (Forgearini et al.,
