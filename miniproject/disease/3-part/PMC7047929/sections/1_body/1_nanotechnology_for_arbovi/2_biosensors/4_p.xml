<p>Several recent studies have used mainly LFAs as the basis for the construction of ASSURED biosensing devices. These assays can be performed using microfluidic technologies such as paper-based miniaturized devices that combine several recognition steps in a small area for naked-eye detection and quantification of compounds in complex mixtures, with the sample being collected on a test device and the results being displayed in real time (Koczula and Gallotta, 
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Glucose, urine, and pregnancy test strips are examples of LFA devices, where the fluid containing the sample (blood, saliva, serum, etc.) moves by capillary action through various stages were antibodies and conjugated labels (nanoparticles, for instance) can interact and react to the fluid and, finally, show (sandwich assays) or not (competitive assays) a colored line at the test line position. More detailed information about LFAs can be found at (Sajid et al.,

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
