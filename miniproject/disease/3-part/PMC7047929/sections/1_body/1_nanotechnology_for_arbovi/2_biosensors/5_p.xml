<p>The detection of dengue and yellow fever has been performed with a platform for multiplexed pathogen detection employing multi-colored silver nanoplates (Yen et al., 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) as demonstrated by Yen et al. (
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). In this study, the authors showed that the color of test lines could differentiate among different bioreceptors, with the analyses being performed in various ways, including the use of mobile phone applications. Current improvements in LFA technology are associated with the use of nanotechnological tools, such as lab-on-a-chip devices and nanoparticles that change color when aggregated. These improvements have significantly enhanced diagnosis sensitivity and selectivity.
