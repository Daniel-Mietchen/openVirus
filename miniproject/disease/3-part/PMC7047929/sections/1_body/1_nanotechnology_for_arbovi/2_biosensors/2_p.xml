<p>Given such difficulties in the early detection of an impending epidemic of a viral infection, such as dengue, chikungunya, zika, and yellow fever (Nakata and RÃ¶st, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), there has been an urgent need for the improvement of existing tools and development of new biosensing technologies that are rapid, effective, and applicable in terms of real-time diagnosis. Biosensors are biologically-selective analytical devices that are able to recognize analytes in a complex sample matrix without the need for lengthy sample treatments. The biologically-selective part of biosensors enables them to produce highly specific responses by means of a transduction system that acts to convert the biological recognition into a quantifiable electrical signal (
