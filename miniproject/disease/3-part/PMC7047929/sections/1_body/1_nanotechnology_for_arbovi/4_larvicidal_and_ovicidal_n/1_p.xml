<p>The green or biological synthesis of nanoparticles, also called biogenic synthesis, can offer advantages over the classical nanotechnological techniques currently employed. The new synthesis methods are economical, fast, and less expensive, and are performed at ambient temperature and pressure. In contrast, standard physical and chemical techniques typically involve high energy consumption, due to the need for high pressures and temperatures (Benelli et al.,

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The technique can be used to produce nanoparticles composed of metals, metal oxides, silica, and carbon (Benelli et al.,
