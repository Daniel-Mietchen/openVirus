HCQ is administered orally in doses ranging from 100 to 600Â mg daily. HCQ has also been tested for other indications such as cancers [

In the current context of this extreme worldwide emergency, it is reasonable to propose that even if we could only reduce viral replication by 10 to 30% there would likely be a significantly reduced transmission and severity of COVID19, and improved clinical outcome. By using EC50, we are describing the proposed thresholds of efficacy at values that exceed those values, specifically, we are describing that these 4-aminoquinoline drugs could decrease virus replication or viral survival by 50%. Based on that proposal, lower plasma concentrations of HCQ, which we can easily obtain from a standard dosage regimen, is likely to be of significant clinically and public health impact.
