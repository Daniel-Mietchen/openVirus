 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] conducted standard assays to determine the potency (half-maximal effective concentration or EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and the cytotoxicity at 50% (the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration or CC
 <sub>50</sub>) of Chloroquine. Wang's study showed CQ has potency against SARS-CoV-2 at 1.13 μM (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.13 μM) and great safety at therapeutic doses since CQ did not show significant toxicity until the concentration exceeded 100 μM (CC
 <sub>50</sub> greater than 100 μM). A previous study showed that CQ had an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.5 ± 0.7 μM with a CC
 <sub>50</sub> of 31.5 ± 14.8 [

 <sub>50</sub> = 0.72 and EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 5.47 μM respectively) at 48 h [
