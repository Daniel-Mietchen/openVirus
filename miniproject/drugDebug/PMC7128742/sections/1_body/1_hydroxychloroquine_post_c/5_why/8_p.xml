<p id="p0105">Signs of anosmia and hyposmia are common in coronaviruses, and currently, loss of smell is noted in as many as 30% of patients with COVID-19 [

These signs likely arise as a consequence of the SARS-CoV2 passing through the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory areas of the brain, a concept supported by studies of other coronaviruses [
