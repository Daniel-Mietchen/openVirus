<p id="p0060">We recommend the post-exposure regimen of HCQ for asymptomatic people, whether or not they have been tested for SARS-CoV-2, in close contact with symptomatic patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 and to start the regimen as soon as possible. For HCQ blood concentration to reach a steady-state takes time (approximately six days), while the incubation period of COVID-19 before symptoms is also approximately six days; thus, the regimen should be started on the first day of exposure to the risk.</p>
