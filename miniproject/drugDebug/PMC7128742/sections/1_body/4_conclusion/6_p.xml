<p id="p0185">Using post-exposure HCQ is in line with WHO's strategic objectives to limit human-to-human transmission. If we do not seriously consider using this easy and safe option, we are taking the risk of allowing the pandemic to sore further out of control. As recently stated, the urgency of the epidemic necessitates choices about which interventions to employ. Early HCQ administration to all people at risk of infection from close contact with a positive patient is one of the most reasonable choices. Moreover, it is a choice that could potentially have a considerable impact on the early termination of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its administration should be done under medical control to avoid potential side effects and to prevent an uncontrolled use leading to supply shortages.</p>
