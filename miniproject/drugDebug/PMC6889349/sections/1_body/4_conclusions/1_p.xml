<p id="Par82">Overall, we found that the strains of extremophilic actinomycetes K-192, K-340, and K-362 are interesting for further research as possible producers of biologically active substances with antiviral activity. Based on results of SI indexes higher than 10, it can be suggested that this study identified specific preparations of extremophilic actinomycetes that can be considered as a promising source for isolation and study of compounds that can block the reproduction of influenza virus type A. Future studies will focus on isolation and characterization of active compounds responsible for the antiviral actions followed by elucidation of the mechanism of action for the viral inhibitory activities.</p>
