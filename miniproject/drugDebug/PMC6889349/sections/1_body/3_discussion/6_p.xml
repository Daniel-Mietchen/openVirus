<p id="Par80">Our previous study showed that the plant extracts Virospan and Flavovir were prepared by extraction of plant tissues using 5 ethyl acetate and ethyl alcohol [

The final preparations tested in in-vitro experiments on chicken embryos showed that Virospan in a dose of 0.2 mg inhibited reproduction of influenza A virus, specifically H5N3 and H3N2 subtypes by 40%, and by 60% when 1.0 mg of the preparation was added [

Additionally, in-vivo experiments showed that residual infectivity of influenza A virus H3N2 in the lungs of infected mice after addition of 200 micrograms of the Flavovir extract decreased by 0.501 g. These results were comparable with the effect of Relenza and Remantadin, while Tamiflu showed a decrease in 0.71 g [

The fact that our extracts with comparable activities to our established plant extracts Virospan and Flavovir which also showed very good SI index is highly promising for further identification and characterization. Therefore our extracts should be developed further potentially as an effective antiviral medication. A similar study reported active antiviral activity of 27 plant extracts from Nigeria against 3 serotypes of echoviruses which suggested the significance of these extracts to be further developed as therapeutic antiviral agents [
