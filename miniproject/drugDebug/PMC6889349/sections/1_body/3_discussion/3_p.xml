<p id="Par77">Hemagglutination activity testing showed inhibition of only one influenza virus strain- H1N1. The least concentration of 2S preparations in K-192, K-340 and K-522 and 2 N preparations in K-362 and K-525 was required to inhibit hemagglutination activity, thus indicating high effectiveness. However, the CBS preparations of the most strains showed less effectiveness in inhibiting hemagglutination activity of H1N1. The K-192-1 N, K-192-2 N, and K-192-2S extracts were able to suppress the neuraminidase activity of all tested influenza virus strains. In addition, extracts K-192, K-362 in 2 N, 1S and 2S conditions had the ability to suppress the neuraminidase activity of epidemic-significant H3N2 influenza virus strain. Also, these strains were more effective in neuraminidase inhibition than in 1 N, CBN and CBS conditions. Overall, 2S and 2 N preparations were the most effective in neuraminidase inhibition of influenza virus H1N1 for all strains, while the most effective strain was K-525. Moreover, K-362-1S extract suppressed neuraminidase activity of influenza viruses A/Vladivostok/2/09 (H1N1) and A/tern/South Africa/1/61 (H5N3) resistant to commercial antiviral drugs. Interestingly one recent study reported the identification of an antiviral butanolide from the culture broth of 
 <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. SMU03 which inhabit the intestines of 
 <italic>Elephas maximus</italic>, which displayed broad and potent activity against a panel of influenza viruses including the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given that this compound was found to interfere with the early stage of influenza A virus lifecycle, it was postulated that the target could be the HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin enzyme. From the results of our study, we found that most of our preparations that exhibited antiviral activities were effective to suppress the neuraminidase activity, and not the hemagglutinin enzyme activity.
