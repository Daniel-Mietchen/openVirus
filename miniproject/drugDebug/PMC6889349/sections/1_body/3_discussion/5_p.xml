<p id="Par79">Even with the significant findings summarized here, there are some limitations of this study which we are currently addressing and incorporating for designs of future studies. The active compounds responsible for these antiviral activities are yet to be identified but we are currently working towards the goal of identification of the producer strains, active antiviral compounds within the extracts and elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of actions. Since this is a preliminary screening study of selected extracts from our collection, it represents the first step in our efforts to identify extracts and producer strains with promising potential to be further researched for development of efficacious antiviral therapeutic agents. The strength and uniqueness here is that this represents the only study reporting antiviral activity from actinomycetes producer strains that are also extremophiles grown in optimized culture environment that mimics the environment that these strains were isolated from. K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2 N, K-362-2S and K-362-1S extracts were comparable with virus-inhibition properties of herbal preparations “Virospan” and “Flavovir”.</p>
