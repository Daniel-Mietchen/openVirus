<p id="Par39">The specific virus-inhibitory activity of the studied preparations was determined in accordance with the guidelines of the “Pre-clinical Drug Research Guide” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Various doses of extract preparations obtained from extremophilic actinomycetes were mixed with an equal volume of 100 EID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml of the tested virus. After 30 min of incubation at 37
 <sup>0</sup> С, the mixture was inoculated into the chorionic-allantoic cavity of 10-days old chicken embryos. Viruses were grown for 24–72 h at 37
 <sup>0</sup>С depending on the viral strain. The presence of the viruses was indicated by the hemagglutination test (HA-test). The ability of investigated preparations to inhibit virus infectious activity was estimated by comparison of the results of HA-test in experimental and control samples. As a control, the buffered saline pH 7.2, was used and the allantoic fluid with viruses but without the addition of preparations obtained from extremophilic actinomycetes.
