<p id="Par28">First, hemolytic activity was tested on a 2% solution of chicken erythrocytes. The actinomycetes samples were mixed with chicken erythrocytes in a 1:5 ratio, and then incubated for 120 min at 37
 <sup>0</sup>С. Following incubation, an equal volume of cold buffered saline at pH 7.2 was added into the samples, which further underwent centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. Supernatants were collected and the optical density of supernatant fluids was measured at 412 nm using spectrophotometer “Tecan M200” (Switzerland).
