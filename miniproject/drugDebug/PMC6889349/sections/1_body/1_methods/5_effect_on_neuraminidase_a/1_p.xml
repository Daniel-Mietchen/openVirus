<p id="Par36">The same strains of orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses were used in neuraminidase activity tests as in hemagglutination activity analysis. Also, the following reagents were used: enzyme buffer (32.5 mM MES, pH 6.0, Sigma, USA), substrate solution in enzyme buffer (0.2 mM MUNANA, 4 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, Sigma, USA), and stop-solution (25% ethanol, 0,1 M glycine, pH 10, Sigma, USA).
