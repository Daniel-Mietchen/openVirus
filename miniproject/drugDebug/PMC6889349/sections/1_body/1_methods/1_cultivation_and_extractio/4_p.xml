<p id="Par25">After 120 h of growth at 28 °C in a 100 ml total growth culture, the broth from 3 separate flasks were combined (3 flasks were cultured per strain) and separated from the mycelium (cells) by filtration through a coarse cloth using Büchner porcelain funnels in order to prepare cell-free culture broth. The rest of the actinomycetes cells were separated by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm. The native solution obtained after filtration and centrifugation was extracted using n-butanol (in a ratio 5:1). Extraction was further carried out in the refrigerator at 4 °C for 24 h. The n-butanol layer was separated on a separatory funnel and filtered through a filter paper. The collected n-butanol fraction was concentrated in a vacuum on a rotary evaporator “RV-10 Basic” to a dry residue, and the extracted substances were dissolved in chemically pure ethanol (80%) in an amount of 3 ml, and stored in the refrigerator until further analysis. Extracts prepared from culture broth are designated as “sample 1”; for example, culture broth from strain K-192 is labeled as “K-192-1”.</p>
