<p id="Par16">Research highlights that drug-resistance in type A influenza virus is of high concern since it led to three pandemics in the twentieth century and can still do so in the future [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] . Genetic mechanisms that alter two main surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase caused the influenza viruses to develop resistance to already available antivirals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it was suggested that continuous antigenic variations in the virus can result in a new outbreak due to infections by the influenza virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].
