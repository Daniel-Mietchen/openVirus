<p id="Par58">The quantitative measurement of specific inhibition of hemagglutination activity in influenza virus H1N1 by preparations from 5 selected strains of actinomycetes is indicated by mean and standard deviation measures of hemagglutination inhibition (HI) of the H1N1 virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). Thus, the lower the value for HI indicates better effectiveness of the preparation to inhibit the agglutinating activity of the studied virus. Preparations CBS of most strains required the highest concentrations for HI
 <sub>50</sub> (hence less effective), while preparations 2S from strains K-192, K-340 and K-362, and preparation 2 N from strains K-362 and K-525 required the least concentration when compared with the other preparations (and thus more effective) to induce inhibition of the hemagglutination activity of the H1N1. Culture broth preparations CBN and CBS from strains K-192 and K-362 are similar in the ability to induce HI while CBN from K-340, K-522 and K-525 showed more effective inhibitory effects on hemagglutination activity. Comparing extracts prepared from culture broths of strains grown in a neutral condition (1 N) when compared to strains grown in saline condition (1S), preparations 1S are more effective than 1 N for strains K-192, K-362 and K-525. For preparations of biomass from strains grown in a neutral condition (2 N) and saline condition (2S), preparations 2S are more effective 2 N for strains K-192, K-340, and K-522.
