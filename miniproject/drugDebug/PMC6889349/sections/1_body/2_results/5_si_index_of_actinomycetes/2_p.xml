<p id="Par69">It was established that the culture broth of actinomycetes strains K-192, K-340 and K-362 (having SI index of 0) were not able to inhibit the reproduction of all investigated influenza virus strains and paramyxoviruses. Four extracts of culture broth of actinomycetes strain K-192-1 N, K-340-2 N, K-340-1S and K-522-1 N also did not express antiviral activity in the tested interval of doses (having SI index of 0). However, culture broth of actinomycetes strains K-525 and K-522, and actinomycetes extract K-522-1S, K-525-1S, K-525-1 N, K-522-2 N, K-340-1 N had good SI-index in the relation of at least one of tested viruses (Table
