<p id="Par71">An SI value that is higher than 10 is considered a good selective index that can give an idea about the selectivity of actinomycetes preparations on selectively killing the virus, and not the host. Overall, specific antiviral action of K-340-2S, K-362-2 N, K-362-1S, and K-362-2S had shown SI-index to be more than 10 against all strains of influenza type A viruses investigated. Additionally, both K-362-1S and K-362-2S had the highest SI with a value of 40 against H3N2, H1N1, and H5N3. Only K-192-1S and K-192-2S extracts had good antiviral specificity result against PMV-1/Beadette, SI being 10, whereas the effective SI against Sendai, strain 960 was found in K-192-1S, K-340-1 N, K-362-2S, K-522-CBN, K-522-1S, K-525-CBN, K-525-2 N, K-525-1S and K-525-2S.</p>
