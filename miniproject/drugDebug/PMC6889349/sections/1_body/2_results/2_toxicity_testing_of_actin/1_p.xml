<p id="Par55">Toxicity of the 30 preparations described above were tested using three different assays; effect of the preparations to induce 50% lysis of erythrocytes (ТC
 <sub>50</sub> mean value, mg/ml), effect of the preparations to induce 50% death of chicken fibroblast cells (ТC
 <sub>50</sub> mean value, mg/ml) and effect of the preparations to induce 50% death of chicken embryos (ТC
 <sub>50</sub> mean value, mg/ml). The results of investigation are presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S1, Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM2" ref-type="media">2</xref>: Figure S2 and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref>: Figure S3. In these assays, the lower concentrations of preparations to induce the measured effect indicated a higher level of toxicity. We observed that the level of measured toxicity varied according to the doses of the preparations as well as the assays. Furthermore, the toxicity effects vary according to the different biological models used (when tested using either 2% chicken erythrocytes, chicken fibroblast cells, or 10-days chicken embryos) for the toxicity tests. Overall, lower toxicity was observed when preparations were tested on the chicken embryos, while higher toxicity in preparations tested on chicken fibroblast cells. Strain K-525 showed the least amount of sample preparation needed to kill 50% of the erythrocytes under neutral conditions, while CBS preparations required the highest concentration (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) to destroy 50% of the erythrocytes. Overall, the CBS and CBN as growth conditions resulted in lower toxicity of preparations since these samples required the highest concentrations to kill 50% of chicken fibroblasts. We found that actinomycetes grown in 2 N, 1 N, and 1S, and 2S conditions showed higher toxicity towards chicken fibroblasts when compared to culture broth preparations. The ability of sample preparations to induce the death of chicken embryos when tested showed that the 1 N preparation condition also showed high toxicity for preparations from all strains except for K-362. As expected, the preparations CBS showed relatively low toxicity in comparison to other conditions for all selected preparations. Furthermore, strain K-340 showed the lowest toxicity (highest TC
 <sub>50</sub>) for preparation 1S, when compared to preparations 1S for other strains which exhibited comparatively high toxicity. From the output of Kruskal-Wallis H test that was run for each individual strain separately used in hemolytic activity testing, it was shown that there was no statistically significant difference in toxicity between 6 different extracts, since all 
 <italic>p</italic>-values were more than 0.05 (
 <italic>p-</italic>value = 0.4159) for all strains analyzed. The results of analysis are presented in Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>: Table S1. The toxic dose of preparations that induced 50% lysis of erythrocytes, chicken fibroblasts and chicken embryos (ТC
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined and used to calculate the selective index (SI) that is represented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref> (SI was determined by the ratio of average toxic substance concentration (TC
 <sub>50</sub>) to average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) ).
