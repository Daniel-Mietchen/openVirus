<p id="Par61">It was shown that 3 extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes: K-192-1 N, K-192-2 N and K-192-2S were capable to inhibit the neuraminidase activity of all tested strains of influenza virus A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a-d). Moreover, the extracts of actinomycetes K-362-2 N, K-525-2 N and K-525-2S inhibited the neuraminidase activity of epidemically significant strain of influenza virus, subtype H3N2 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
