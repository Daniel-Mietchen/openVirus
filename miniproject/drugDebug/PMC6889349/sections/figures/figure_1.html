 <caption> a The effect of preparations on the hemagglutination inhibition (HI mean, mg/ml) of influenza virus H1N1. Tested samples were mixed with equal volume of viruses with hemagglutination titer of 1:256. After 30 min incubation at 37 °C, hemagglutination activity was determined by a standard method [ 2, 4]. Hemagglutination inhibition activity was calculated by comparison of hemagglutination titers in the control and tested sample. b Effective Inhibition Concentration (EIC50, mg/ml) of six preparations against influenza virus H1N1 </caption>
