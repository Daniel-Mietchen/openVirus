This is an urgent problem currently that needs to be addressed because several viruses including influenza and paramyxoviruses are acquiring multi-drug resistance. A potential solution for this emerging issue is to create new antiviral drugs from available compounds of natural products. It is known that the majority of drugs have been developed using compounds derived from actinomycetes, which are naturally occurring gram-positive bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts from strains that were isolated from extreme environments in Kazakhstan.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Five strains of extremophilic actinomycetes isolated from the unique ecosystems of Kazakhstan were extracted and tested for antiviral activity against influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1 and H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai Virus and Newcastle Disease Virus). The antiviral activity of these selected extracts was tested by checking their effect on hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities of the studied viruses. Additionally, actinomycetes extracts were compared with commercially available antiviral drugs and some plant preparations that have been shown to exhibit antiviral properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">The main findings show that extracts from strains K-192, K-340, K-362, K-522 and K525 showed antiviral activities when tested using influenza viruses, Sendai Virus, and Newcastle Disease Virus.

However, the development of new antibiotics is compromised due to several complications such as challenges in finding natural compounds that possess characteristics suitable for a good pharmacological response when applied in the treatment of infections. There is also cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit issue that pharmacological companies face whereby the financial and other industrial resources outweigh the need for new drugs. Moreover, naturally derived compounds have complex chemical structures that make them difficult to first be discovered and then to create new drugs from these compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The complexity of the studied preparations suggests the breadth of therapeutic use. Therefore, in our studies we investigated the presence of antiviral properties of new preparations that were isolated from extremophilic microorganisms.</p><p id="Par16">Research highlights that drug-resistance in type A influenza virus is of high concern since it led to three pandemics in the twentieth century and can still do so in the future [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] . Genetic mechanisms that alter two main surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase caused the influenza viruses to develop resistance to already available antivirals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it was suggested that continuous antigenic variations in the virus can result in a new outbreak due to infections by the influenza virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par17">Other viruses that serve as a threat to the animal populations come from the family <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, specifically Newcastle disease virus and Sendai virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For example, the Newcastle disease virus is distributed worldwide and has the potential to cause large economic losses in the poultry industry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The Sendai virus, also known as murine and human parainfluenza virus type 1, severely infects the respiratory system of rodents and only mildly in humans, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Thus, it is crucial to undertake research that focuses on the development of new compounds for advancing drug-based therapies against viral infections such as influenza and paramyxoviruses.</p><p id="Par18">Known sources for new antibiotics are naturally derived compounds; such compounds can be produced by actinomycetes. Actinomycetes are gram-positive bacteria that can be cultivated from soil and marine samples. Majority of actinomycetes can live in extreme environments, such as those found in saline soil distances and saltwater [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A vast majority of well-known anti-infective commercial drugs particularly antibiotics (such as streptomycin, neomycin and chloramphenicol) are derived from naturally produced compounds that originate from Actinobacteria particularly the actinomycetes strains from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Several studies have reported actinomycetes producing novel metabolites with antiviral activities against several pathogenic viruses which include Western equine encephalitis virus, HIV-1, Zika virus, acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus type 1 as well as influenza A and B viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">The genomic RNA (3&#x02032;-5) of Newcastle disease virus that is 15,186 nucleotides long encodes the nucleocapsid, P/V proteins, matrix or membrane protein, fusion protein, hemagglutinin-neuraminidase glycoprotein and large proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The structure of genomic RNA of the Sendai virus, which is 15,384 nucleotides long, is like the Newcastle disease virus except in having the PCV proteins and hemagglutinin glycoprotein only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. From the structural composition of paramyxoviruses, we can see their similarity with influenza viruses in that their genomes also encode the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins. Therefore, the effects of actinomycetes extracts on these viruses in our study were checked by specifically assessing antiviral activity targeting these 2 glycoproteins. In this study, we investigated the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts from strains that were isolated from extreme environments in Kazakhstan against the influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1, H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai Virus, Newcastle Disease Virus).</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Cultivation and extraction of Actinomycetes</title><p id="Par20">To study the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts, 5 strains of extremophilic actinomycetes isolated from the unique ecosystems of Kazakhstan were selected: these are strains K-192, K-340, K-362, K-522, and K-525.

Furthermore, the toxicity effects vary according to the different biological models used (when tested using either 2% chicken erythrocytes, chicken fibroblast cells, or 10-days chicken embryos) for the toxicity tests.

Additionally, both K-362-1S and K-362-2S had the highest SI with a value of 40 against H3N2, H1N1, and H5N3. Only K-192-1S and K-192-2S extracts had good antiviral specificity result against PMV-1/Beadette, SI being 10, whereas the effective SI against Sendai, strain 960 was found in K-192-1S, K-340-1&#x02009;N, K-362-2S, K-522-CBN, K-522-1S, K-525-CBN, K-525-2&#x02009;N, K-525-1S and K-525-2S.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Comparison of actinomycetes preparations with commercial antiviral drugs and plant preparations</title><p id="Par72">We found that the virus-inhibition activity of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2S, K-362-2&#x02009;N, and K-362-1S is comparable with antiviral activity of commercial anti-flu drugs Tamiflu and Rimantadine and plant antiviral preparations Virospan and Flavovir (Figs.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>).

In general, samples of the actinomycetes coming from CBN and CBS had lower toxicity than other preparations against studied ortho- and paramyxoviruses. Comparison of virus-inhibition activity of selected extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes with virus-inhibition properties of commercial anti-flu drugs Rimantadine and Tamiflu and herbal preparations &#x0201c;Virospan&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Flavovir&#x0201d;, have shown that all selected extracts of extremophilic actinomycetes were comparable in anti-viral activity with commercial and plant preparations by the indices of selective index (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>).</p><p id="Par76">It was assumed that with all variables and observations being independent, the results obtained showed true effect because the methodology used to conduct all experiments was based on standard protocols and guidelines, and thus random errors were minimized. We found that the toxicity of investigated actinomycetes preparations depended on the conditions of cultivation and varied on different biological models used for toxicity hemolytic activity testing. The lower toxicity was observed on the model of chicken embryos, whereas the higher one was on the culture of chicken fibroblasts cells during hemolytic activity testing. Overall, samples of actinomycetes culture broth possessed the lower toxicity in comparison with the extracts of actinomycetes biomass. The results of toxicity testing which were found not to be significantly different based on the output of the Kruskal-Wallis H test (comparing the 3 assays used) were used to determine the intervals of doses suitable for antiviral activity analysis. This was based on the SI values (calculated based on the ratio of average toxic substance concentration (TC<sub>50</sub>) to average effective virus-inhibiting concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>)). Similar to the approach we described here for our study, many other researchers have modified nutrients and other physicochemical factors, and also used statistical optimization approaches to enhance production and identification of several bioactive compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, a set of 13 antiherpetic antiviral derivatives known as fattiviricins identified from the producer organism <italic>Streptomyces microflavus,</italic> were also shown to have potent activity against some enveloped RNA viruses such as the influenza A and B viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. AH-135Y produced from the culture filtrate of <italic>Streptomyces albovinaceus</italic> strain number AH-135 which was reported to be a new glutarimide antibiotic, was shown to be active against HSV-1 as well as influenza virus A and RSV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However thus far no study has reported antiviral activities against our tested viral strains in extracts from actinomycetes strains grown in-vitro in saline and alkaline culture conditions, enhancing the possibility of the novelty of active compounds within our active extracts. Furthermore, our preliminary investigations on the identity of producer strains with antiviral activities that we have in our collection (data not presented here) do not include the two strains reported here (<italic>Streptomyces microflavus</italic> and <italic>Streptomyces albovinaceus</italic>), further supporting the idea that our active antiviral compounds described in this study are novel.</p><p id="Par77">Hemagglutination activity testing showed inhibition of only one influenza virus strain- H1N1. The least concentration of 2S preparations in K-192, K-340 and K-522 and 2&#x02009;N preparations in K-362 and K-525 was required to inhibit hemagglutination activity, thus indicating high effectiveness. However, the CBS preparations of the most strains showed less effectiveness in inhibiting hemagglutination activity of H1N1. The K-192-1&#x02009;N, K-192-2&#x02009;N, and K-192-2S extracts were able to suppress the neuraminidase activity of all tested influenza virus strains. In addition, extracts K-192, K-362 in 2&#x02009;N, 1S and 2S conditions had the ability to suppress the neuraminidase activity of epidemic-significant H3N2 influenza virus strain. Also, these strains were more effective in neuraminidase inhibition than in 1&#x02009;N, CBN and CBS conditions. Overall, 2S and 2&#x02009;N preparations were the most effective in neuraminidase inhibition of influenza virus H1N1 for all strains, while the most effective strain was K-525. Moreover, K-362-1S extract suppressed neuraminidase activity of influenza viruses A/Vladivostok/2/09 (H1N1) and A/tern/South Africa/1/61 (H5N3) resistant to commercial antiviral drugs. Interestingly one recent study reported the identification of an antiviral butanolide from the culture broth of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. SMU03 which inhabit the intestines of <italic>Elephas maximus</italic>, which displayed broad and potent activity against a panel of influenza viruses including the H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Given that this compound was found to interfere with the early stage of influenza A virus lifecycle, it was postulated that the target could be the HA2 subunit of hemagglutinin enzyme. From the results of our study, we found that most of our preparations that exhibited antiviral activities were effective to suppress the neuraminidase activity, and not the hemagglutinin enzyme activity.</p><p id="Par78">Analysis of the virus-inhibition has shown that 8 preparations: culture broth of strains K-525 and K-522 and actinomycetes extracts K-522-1S, K-525 -1S, K-525-1&#x02009;N, K-522-2&#x02009;N, K-362-1&#x02009;N, and K-340-1&#x02009;N possessed significant virus-inhibition activity against ortho- and paramyxoviruses. The highest antiviral activity was demonstrated within 5 extracts, which were K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2&#x02009;N, K-362-2S, and K-362-1S. These extracts can block the reproduction of all investigated strains of influenza virus. Overall, 2S extracts of actinomycetes demonstrated a higher antiviral activity than CBS extracts of all actinomycetes strains except K-525, when investigated on influenza type A and paramyxoviruses. However, the K-525 strain was the most effective in inhibiting Sendai strain 960 for all 6 extracts, when compared with other actinomycetes strains. Fifteen preparations obtained from actinomycetes, cultivated under extreme and neutral conditions, had SI-index greater than or equal to 10, thus indicating good antiviral specificity. Even when the exact composition of the active components within the extracts are yet to be identified, we have demonstrated in this preliminary study the great potential of discovering novel antiviral compounds that can be further characterized to produce therapeutically effective antivirals for treatment of infections caused by our tested viral strains. As previously mentioned, several studies reported antiviral activities of natural compounds that originated from Actinobacteria whereby some of the antiviral mechanisms of actions of these compounds have been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. A recent study reported that one of the two novel antimicrobial compounds isolated from the culture broth of <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. AM-2504 showed antiviral activity against dengue virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. As summarized in one report, Antimycin A1a isolated from <italic>Streptomyces kaviengensis</italic> was found to disrupt mitochondrial transport and pyrimidine biosynthesis in WEEV and that Ahmpatinin &#x02018;Bu from <italic>Streptomyces</italic> sp. CPCC 202950 inhibit the activity of HIV protease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Yet another study showed that high-mannose type saccharide chains of gp120 are the molecular targets of actinohivin, which was isolated from <italic>Longispora albida</italic> which is a relatively new actinomycetes species, in its anti-HIV activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par79">Even with the significant findings summarized here, there are some limitations of this study which we are currently addressing and incorporating for designs of future studies. The active compounds responsible for these antiviral activities are yet to be identified but we are currently working towards the goal of identification of the producer strains, active antiviral compounds within the extracts and elucidation of the antiviral mechanism of actions. Since this is a preliminary screening study of selected extracts from our collection, it represents the first step in our efforts to identify extracts and producer strains with promising potential to be further researched for development of efficacious antiviral therapeutic agents. The strength and uniqueness here is that this represents the only study reporting antiviral activity from actinomycetes producer strains that are also extremophiles grown in optimized culture environment that mimics the environment that these strains were isolated from. K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2&#x02009;N, K-362-2S and K-362-1S extracts were comparable with virus-inhibition properties of herbal preparations &#x0201c;Virospan&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Flavovir&#x0201d;.</p><p id="Par80">Our previous study showed that the plant extracts Virospan and Flavovir were prepared by extraction of plant tissues using 5 ethyl acetate and ethyl alcohol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The final preparations tested in in-vitro experiments on chicken embryos showed that Virospan in a dose of 0.2&#x02009;mg inhibited reproduction of influenza A virus, specifically H5N3 and H3N2 subtypes by 40%, and by 60% when 1.0&#x02009;mg of the preparation was added [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Additionally, in-vivo experiments showed that residual infectivity of influenza A virus H3N2 in the lungs of infected mice after addition of 200 micrograms of the Flavovir extract decreased by 0.501&#x02009;g. These results were comparable with the effect of Relenza and Remantadin, while Tamiflu showed a decrease in 0.71&#x02009;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The fact that our extracts with comparable activities to our established plant extracts Virospan and Flavovir which also showed very good SI index is highly promising for further identification and characterization. Therefore our extracts should be developed further potentially as an effective antiviral medication. A similar study reported active antiviral activity of 27 plant extracts from Nigeria against 3 serotypes of echoviruses which suggested the significance of these extracts to be further developed as therapeutic antiviral agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p id="Par81">The most promising results were that, extract preparations K-192-2S, K-340-2S, K-362-2&#x02009;N, and K-362-1S in this study exhibited higher SI values compared to Rimantadine and Tamiflu, which are well established antivirals with the mechanism of antiviral actions on viral replicative cycle and inhibiting the neuraminidase enzyme, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Our findings thus indicate that these extracts are great potential producers of new antiviral drugs. One of the possible mechanisms of antiviral action would be as inhibitors of the neuraminidase enzyme found on the influenza virus surface which would prevent budding from the host cell, viral replication, and infectivity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par82">Overall, we found that the strains of extremophilic actinomycetes K-192, K-340, and K-362 are interesting for further research as possible producers of biologically active substances with antiviral activity. Based on results of SI indexes higher than 10, it can be suggested that this study identified specific preparations of extremophilic actinomycetes that can be considered as a promising source for isolation and study of compounds that can block the reproduction of influenza virus type A. Future studies will focus on isolation and characterization of active compounds responsible for the antiviral actions followed by elucidation of the mechanism of action for the viral inhibitory activities.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec20"><p>
