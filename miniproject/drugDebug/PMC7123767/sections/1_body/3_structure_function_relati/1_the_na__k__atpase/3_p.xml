<p>In the 
 <italic>α</italic> subunit of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase several negatively charged amino acids can be localized in intramembraneous domains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>) that may be involved in interaction with the transported cations. Mutation of some of these amino acids to Ala indeed alters the apparent dielectric length of the access channel that is represented by the effective valencies
