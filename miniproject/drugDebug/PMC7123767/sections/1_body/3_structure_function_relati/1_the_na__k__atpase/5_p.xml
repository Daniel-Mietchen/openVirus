<p>We have described above (Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_7) that palytoxin transfers the Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup> pump into a channel. During long-lasting voltage-clamp pulses the palytoxin-induced current inactivates at very positive potentials (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3a</xref>).
