<p>The Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase (for a review, see [Vasilets and Schwarz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1993</xref>]) is a heterodimer composed of an α subunit of about 100 kDa and a smaller glycosylated β subunit of about 60 kDa (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>). At least four isoforms of the 
 <italic>α</italic> subunit have been identified, and three isoforms of the 
 <italic>ß</italic> subunit that all show tissue-specific distribution. The 
 <italic>α</italic> subunits host all functionally significant sites including ATP-binding and phosphorylation sites, the sites for interaction with the transported cations and for specific inhibitors like cardiotonic steroids, and the binding site for palytoxin (see Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_7) .
