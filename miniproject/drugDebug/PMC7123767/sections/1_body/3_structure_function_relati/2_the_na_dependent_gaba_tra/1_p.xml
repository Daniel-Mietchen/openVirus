<p>The activity of neurotransmitter transporters plays an important role in termination of synaptic transmission. Therefore, a detailed knowledge of structure-function relationships is essential for understanding the physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology of brain function. We have already mentioned the importance of regulatory phosphorylation of the Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup> pump by protein kinases, and this is also the case for neurotransmitter transporters. The strategy for identification of such sites is the same as described for the Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup> pump. Possible candidates for phosphorylation of GAT1 (see Fig.â€¯
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref>) have been mutated; the mutants are then functionally characterized and compared with the wild-type transporter. Again, transporter-mediated current can serve as a measure for transport activity.
