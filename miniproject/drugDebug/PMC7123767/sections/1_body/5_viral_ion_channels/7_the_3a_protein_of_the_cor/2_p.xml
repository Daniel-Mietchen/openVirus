<p>Patch-clamp analysis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">8.16</xref>) revealed a single-channel conductance of about 20–30 pS. The channel is selectively permeable for monovalent cations with highest selectivity for K
 <sup>+</sup>. As a result of 3a channel activity the membrane potential will depolarize, which results in Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channel activation. The increase in intracellular Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> activity then facilitates the exocytotic release of viruses from the host cell (Lu et al.
