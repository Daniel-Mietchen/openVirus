<p>The virus attaches to the host cell, followed by incorporation of the virus, uncoating of the viral genome and replication processes with transcription and translation; finally, new viral particles are assembled, and the viruses are released from the host cell to infect new cells. In the case of coronavirus, the release is dependent on the activity of an ion channel, which is encoded by the viral genome and inserted into the membrane of the host cell. For SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) the membrane protein is called 3a protein. Inhibition of any of these steps could represent a potential target for antiviral drugs.</p>
