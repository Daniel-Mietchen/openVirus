<p>For many of the transporters the amino acid sequence and the possible orientation of the protein in the membrane, or even the three-dimensional structures have been determined. In the following, we will illustrate the strategy of an electrophysiologist in investigating structure, function and regulation of membrane transport using as an example the Na
 <sup>+</sup>,K
 <sup>+</sup>-ATPase (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>), the neurotransmitter transporter GAT (Na
 <sup>+</sup>-dependent GABA transporter; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref>; Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">8.1</xref>), and the nucleotide receptors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">8.6</xref>) that form channels in the presence of extracellular ATP (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">8.2</xref>).
