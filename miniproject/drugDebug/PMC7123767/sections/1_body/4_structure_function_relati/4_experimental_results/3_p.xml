<p>Since P2X
 <sub>1</sub> and P2X
 <sub>3</sub> receptors show fast activation and desensitization (within 1 s), a fast and well-defined solution exchange is a prerequisite for correctly time-resolved measurements. Due to the large size of the oocyte (with a diameter of 1.2 mm) a fast solution exchange is not easy to achieve, but is possible with a special design: a solution exchange system where the oocyte is placed in a small oocyte chamber of about 10 µl volume in combination with fast perfusion (200 µl/s). This design allows an exchange time (5–95 %) in the range of 100–200 ms. This can be determined, for example, by activating expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors with 30 µM acetylcholine (ACh) or by monitoring the current change induced by a concentration change from Na
 <sup>+</sup>-rich to Na
 <sup>+</sup>-deficient solution (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8.8</xref>). The reproducibility of the solution change is obvious in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8.8</xref>(a) where seven consecutive responses to application of ACh at 1 min intervals are shown.
