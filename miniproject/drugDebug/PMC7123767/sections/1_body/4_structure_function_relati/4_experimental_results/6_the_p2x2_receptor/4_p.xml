<p>The electrophysiological analysis showed that removal of the third N-glycosylation site alters the apparent affinity of the receptor for ATP by a factor of about 3. None of the other N-glycosylation sites seem to have any influence on the ATP sensitivity. Figureâ€¯
 <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8.13</xref> gives a graphical representation of these results.
