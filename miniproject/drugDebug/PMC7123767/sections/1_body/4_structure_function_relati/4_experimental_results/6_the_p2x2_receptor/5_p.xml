<p>Taken together, results from the combination of molecular biology, biochemistry, and electrophysiology demonstrate that an increased number of missing glycosylation sites lead to a decrease in the surface appearance of the receptors (reflected by decreasing currents and the decreasing intensity of bands on the SDS-gel). A functional difference was only found for the constructs that were deficient of the third glycosylation site. These constructs showed the effect of decreased ATP sensitivity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2 µM compared to the wild-type receptor with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.6 µM.
