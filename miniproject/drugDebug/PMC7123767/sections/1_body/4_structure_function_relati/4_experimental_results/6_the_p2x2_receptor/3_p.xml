<p>Analysis of the amino-acid sequence of the P2X
 <sub>1</sub> receptor revealed the presence of five consensus sequences for putative glycosylation localized on the extracellular loop of the protein (N1–N5, see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">8.6</xref>). Biochemical analysis of the receptor protein (expressed in oocytes) demonstrated that four out of these five sites are used for glycosylation. A question that cannot be answered with biochemical methods is whether functional properties of the expressed receptors (ATP dependence, kinetic parameters, etc.) are changed. Therefore, different constructs at which one or several glycosylation sites were removed by mutation of single amino acids were characterized electrophysiologically in respect to their ATP dependency and the magnitude of the ATP-activated current.
