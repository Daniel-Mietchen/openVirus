<p>In the following paragraphs we will present some results on the functional properties of the P2X
 <sub>1</sub>, and P2X
 <sub>2</sub> receptor. Although analysis of single-channel activity can provide the most valuable insight into ion-channel characteristics, it is sometimes difficult to detect single channel events depending on single-channel conductance, gating behaviour and channel density. In the case of the P2X receptors, mainly macroscopic currents have been analyzed either due to fast desensitization (P2X
 <sub>1</sub> and P2X
 <sub>3</sub>) or due to fast gating (flickering) of the P2X
 <sub>2</sub> receptors (Ding and Sachs 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1999</xref>). Figureâ€¯
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">8.7</xref> shows a current trace of the P2X
 <sub>1</sub> receptor in an outside-out oocyte-membrane patch. It is only at the end of the trace that current fluctuations caused by the opening and closing of the channels can be resolved.
