<p>This comparison demonstrates that onset as well as offset of the current are significantly different for both methods. This difference can be explained by the difference in speed of solution exchange that was complete within 2â€‰ms by using the patch-clamp method, and hence two orders of magnitude faster than for the TEVC. Nevertheless, the TEVC method is commonly used, also for the analysis of fast receptor currents, but one should be careful with the quantitative interpretation of the data.</p>
