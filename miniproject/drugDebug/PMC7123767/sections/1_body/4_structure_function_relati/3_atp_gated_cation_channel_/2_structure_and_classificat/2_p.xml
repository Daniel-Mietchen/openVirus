<p>Because the common feature of these channels is the sensitivity to extracellular ATP, they are termed nucleotide receptors. Another commonly used name is P2X receptors, and formerly they were known under the name purinoceptors . Although it was already proposed in 1972 that ATP plays a functional role as a neurotransmitter, it took until 1994 for the first two isoforms P2X
 <sub>1</sub> and P2X
 <sub>2</sub> to be cloned from rat vas deferens and PC12 cells, respectively.
