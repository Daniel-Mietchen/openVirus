<p>Before we introduce some of the electrophysiological data obtained for the P2X
 <sub>1</sub> and P2X
 <sub>2</sub> receptor, we give a short overview of the most evident differences between the subtypes. Although extracellular ATP is able to activate each of the ATP receptors, the ATP derivative 
 <italic>α</italic>-
 <italic>ß</italic>-methylene-ATP is an agonist only for P2X
 <sub>1</sub> and P2X
 <sub>3</sub>. More or less pronounced desensitization is obtained for all P2X receptors subtypes, which means that the agonist induces an opening of the ion channels, but then channels close even in the presence of the agonist.
