<p>The α subunits of the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> and Na
 <sup>+</sup> channels are about four times as large as the K
 <sup>+</sup>-channel subunits and possess four sequence repeats, with each repeat being homologous to the single subunit in the homotetrameric K
 <sup>+</sup> channels (compare Fig. 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_6 and 10.1007/978-3-319-30012-2_6). There are five types of Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> channels (L, N, P, Q and T), and at least six types of Na
 <sup>+</sup> channels (I, II, III, µ1, H1 and PN3).
