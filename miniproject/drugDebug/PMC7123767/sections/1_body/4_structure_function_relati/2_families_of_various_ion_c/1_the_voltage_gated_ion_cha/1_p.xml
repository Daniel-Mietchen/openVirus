<p>Although some members of this family are in addition controlled by ligand binding, their activity is generally controlled by the transmembrane electrical field. Functionally characterized members are selectively permeable for K
 <sup>+</sup>, Na
 <sup>+</sup>, or Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> ions. Members of the VIC family play a role in the generation of action potentials and modulation of excitability of cells.
