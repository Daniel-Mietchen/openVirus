<p>Members of the LIC family of ionotropic neurotransmitter receptors are activated by acetylcholine, serotonin, glycine, glutamate or γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). All of these receptor channels are homo- or heteromers of three, four or five subunits. The best characterized ones are the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, which are pentameric channels of

 <italic>βγδ</italic> subunit composition. Channels of the LIC family are selective for cations or anions (e. g. the acetylcholine receptors are cation-selective, while glycine receptors are anion-selective).
