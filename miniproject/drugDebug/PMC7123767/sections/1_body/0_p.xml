<p>All the techniques that we have discussed, flux measurements, steady-state and transient current measurements, as well as single-channel recordings and the corresponding analysis can be applied to the analysis of structure-function relationships. Such structure-function information can be obtained if we characterize and compare the function of wild-type and chemically or genetically modified transporters by using these techniques. The latter also includes naturally occurring mutations that are the source of various diseases; this is an important feature for the understanding and curing of such diseases.</p>
