<p id="Par23">MD interrupted viral protein synthesis, so we also examined whether the transcription of viral genes was interrupted in the presence of MD. We found that the transcription of 
 <italic>UL5, UL9, UL29, UL30, UL42</italic> and 
 <italic>UL52</italic>, all of which are necessary for viral DNA synthesis, was inhibited by MD. Moreover, the HSV-1 immediate early genes play important roles in regulating the expression of the early genes and late genes. Notably, we also found that the transcription of immediate early genes 
 <italic>ICP0, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47,</italic> was also reduced in the presence of MD. Therefore, MD inhibits viral protein synthesis by interrupting the transcription of viral immediate early genes.
