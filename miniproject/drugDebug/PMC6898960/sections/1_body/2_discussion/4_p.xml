<p id="Par21">Viral infection is a complex process consisting of virus entry into host cells, replication and transcription of the viral genome, viral protein synthesis, viral assembly, and release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Antiviral medications act by impeding any of these steps. To elucidate whether MD protects cells from HSV-1 infection at viral entry or post viral entry, we changed the order in which HSV-1 and MD were added to cells. The results showed that MD still suppressed viral protein synthesis and viral titers in host cells even after the virus had entered the host cells. Therefore, MD showed antiviral efficacy mainly by suppressing viral protein synthesis rather than blocking the entry of viruses into host cells.
