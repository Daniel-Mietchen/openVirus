<p id="Par22">The transcription factor NF-κB, a heterodimer of the P65 and P50 subunits, is involved in many cellular events, such as innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. The efficient replication of HSV-1 relies on the activation of the NF-κB pathway in host cells. Moreover, it has been reported that the MAPK signalling pathway is also involved in the regulation of cytokine production and viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on whether MD inhibits HSV-1 replication by blocking the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. According to our results, the phosphorylation of IκBα and the nuclear translocation of the P65 protein were affected by MD treatment. In addition, we did not find that MD had any effect on the activation of the MAPK pathway. Therefore, MD exerts antiviral activity in a manner that is dependent on disturbing the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways.
