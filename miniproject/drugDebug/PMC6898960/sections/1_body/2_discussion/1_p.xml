<p id="Par18">HSV-1 is a highly contagious virus that establishes a lifelong latent infection in host cells. During the latent period, the virus infects sensory neurons near the site of primary infection, and the virions hide in the nucleus of the neuron. When the virus is reactivated by the proper stimulus, the virus initiates a lytic infection. HSV-1 infects the epithelium and initiates lytic replication, which further leads to cellular toxicity and tissue lesions. With the participation of cellular transcription factors, HSV-1 genes are transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II in a highly regulated cascade. Once the viral genome invades the host nucleus, the immediate early genes, including ICP0 and ICP4, play an essential role in initiating viral transcription. Regulated by the immediate early genes, early genes are expressed approximately 2–8 h after infection. The products of early genes are involved in viral replication, while the products of late genes are usually structural proteins [
