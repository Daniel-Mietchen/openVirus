<p id="Par19">HSV-1 is a threat to human health and causes a number of diseases ranging from simple cold sores to keratitis and lethal encephalitis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Current anti-HSV-1 drugs including acyclovir, penciclovir and foscarnet are viral DNA synthesis inhibitors. Acyclovir and penciclovir are commonly used for the treatment of HSV-1 infection. Phosphorylated by virus-encoded thymidine kinases, acyclovir serves as a substrate for the virus DNA polymerase and prevents chain elongation and synthesis of the viral DNA. Penciclovir exerts antiviral activity by a similar mechanism as acyclovir [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Foscarnet is a phosphonic acid derivative that inhibits HSV-1 replication by inhibiting the pyrophosphate site on the herpesvirus DNA polymerase [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, with the chronic administration of anti-HSV drugs, drug-resistant HSV-1 strains have become a major threat worldwide. In particular, patients with immunodeficiencies are prone to develop drug-resistant HSV-1 strains. Considering that attempts to develop a vaccine against HSV-1 have been found to be ineffective, there is an urgent need to develop new effective antiviral drugs.
