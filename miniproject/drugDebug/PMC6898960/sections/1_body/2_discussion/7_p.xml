<p id="Par24">As one of the immediate early proteins, ICP0 has many biological functions. Some studies found that HSV-1 ICP0 mutant viruses might yield avirulent progeny, suggesting that ICP0 plays a pivotal role during lytic and latent infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, according to our results, MD had no effect on the promoter activity of 
 <italic>ICP0,</italic> which suggests that MD interrupts the transcription of viral immediate early genes without affecting the promoter activity of 
 <italic>ICP0</italic>. It is still an interesting future direction to examine the promoter activities of other immediate early genes to explore the precise molecular mechanism of action of MD against HSV-1.
