<p id="Par16">Having shown that MD suppressed the transcription of immediate early genes, we sought to characterize whether MD affects the promoter activity of immediate early genes. We generated a pGL4.17-based luciferase construct containing the ICP0 promoter sequence. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that MD had no effect on the promoter activity of 
 <italic>ICP0,</italic> which suggests that MD interfered with the transcription of viral immediate early genes without affecting the promoter activity of 
 <italic>ICP0</italic> (Fig.
