<p id="Par15">Given that MD inhibited viral toxicity and suppressed the expression levels of viral proteins, we further confirmed whether the transcription levels of viral genes were also affected by MD. To examine the effects of MD on HSV-1 gene expression, total RNA was extracted from the treated cells, and Q-PCR was performed using specific primers as described in the Methods. The transcription levels of the 
 <italic>ICP6</italic> and 
 <italic>GB</italic> genes were reduced by MD (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). This result was consistent with the observation of the protein levels by western blot (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). HSV-1 genes such as 
 <italic>UL5</italic>, 
 <italic>UL8</italic>, 
 <italic>UL9</italic>, 
 <italic>UL42</italic> and 
 <italic>UL52</italic> are required for viral DNA replication. We found that the transcription levels of these genes were also inhibited by MD (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). Remarkably, MD also reduced the transcription levels of the immediate early genes 
 <italic>ICP0, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47,</italic> all of which are required for the expression of early and late viral gene products (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). These results suggest that MD inhibits HSV-1 replication by suppressing the expression of immediate early genes.
