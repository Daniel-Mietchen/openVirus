<p id="Par12">In our previous study, we screened the LOPAC small-scale library to identify small molecules that can inhibit HSV-1-induced toxicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and identified MD as a potential inhibitor of human herpes simples virus. MD has been reported as a topoisomerase II inhibitor. It has been used as an approved chemotherapy drug to treat lymphoma and prostate cancer in consideration of its antitumour activity. Since its effect on HSV-1 was unknown, we further tested the antiviral effect of MD on HSV-1. L929 cells were treated with various concentrations of MD for 1 h prior to HSV-1 infection. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, we found that HSV-1-induced cell death was inhibited significantly in a dose-dependent manner with an estimated IC:50 value of 1.21 μM. MD treatment with an estimated CC:50 value of 11.6 μM completely suppressed HSV-1-induced toxicity at 3.13 μM and had no obvious cytotoxicity to cells under this concentration (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and e). We further estimated whether the HSV-1 titers were affected by the present of MD by plaque forming assay. The results showed that the viral titers were significantly suppressed by MD in HeLa cells (t = 7.56, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005) and L929 cells (t = 10.02, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and d). Moreover, the HeLa cells were infected with GFP-labelled HSV-1 to observe the efficacy more directly. We found that the GFP-labelled HSV-1 virus was significantly inhibited by MD compared with the DMSO control (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). Thus, these data show that MD robustly inhibits HSV-1-induced toxicity and viral replication.
