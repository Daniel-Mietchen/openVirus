 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. ICP6 is a HSV-1 ribonucleotide large subunit that is critical for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. We then investigated whether MD suppressed the expression levels of HSV-1 proteins. In this study, the results of western blot analysis showed that the expression levels of gB and ICP6 were significantly suppressed in a dose-dependent manner in both the mouse cell line (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b) and the human cell line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c and d).
