<p id="Par14">Viral infection is a complex procedure consisting of entry into host cells, replication and transcription of the viral genome, viral protein synthesis, viral assembly and release [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Antiviral medications acting at any step of these processes will block viral infection. To investigate whether MD inhibited the expression levels of viral proteins even after HSV-1 entry, we washed cells with PBS at the indicated time points after HSV-1 infection at which HSV-1 had completed entry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Then, the cells were cultured with fresh medium supplemented with MD for an additional 18 h. We found that MD inhibited HSV-1-induced toxicity even after HSV-1 cell entry. (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). However, the later the MD was added, the worse the antiviral efficacy. MD consistently inhibited the expression of viral proteins in both human and mouse cells even after HSV-1 entered cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d). Viral titers were also reduced in HSV-1-infected cells by post-treatment with MD (t = 7.76, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.005) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). Overall, MD likely exhibits antiviral efficacy by suppressing the expression levels of HSV-1 proteins rather than blocking entry of virus into host cells.
