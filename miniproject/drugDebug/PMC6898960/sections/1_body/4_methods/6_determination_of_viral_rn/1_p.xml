<p id="Par31">Viral total RNA for real-time PCR was extracted by using TRIzol isolation (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription reactions were performed with reverse transcriptase (Life technology). Levels of various genes were finally analyzed by real-time PCR. The real-time was performed using specific primers for the ICP6, ICP0, ICP22, ICP27, ICP47, UL5, UL8, UL9, UL42, UL52. The sequence of primers used for Q-PCR analysis is shown in Additional file
