<p id="Par11">There is a number of available antiviral medications with activity against HSV-1. As a nucleoside analogue, acyclovir is commonly used for the treatment of HSV-1 infection. Because its structure is similar to that of a nucleoside, acyclovir serves as a substrate for the viral DNA polymerase and terminates the extension of the viral DNA to inhibit the proliferation of the HSV-1 virus [

However, with the increasing drug resistance of HSV-1 to acyclovir, research and development of new effective anti-HSV-1 agents is becoming increasingly important. It has been reported that the small molecular compound mitoxantrone dihydrochloride (henceforth MD) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that shows promising efficacy in clinical trials targeting lymphomas, breast cancer, and prostate cancer [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the current study, using a compound library screen, we found that MD effectively blocked not only HSV-1-induced toxicity but also viral titers in multiple cell lines. MD also showed a potent effect on the expression of essential HSV-1 genes without activating the NF-κB and MAPK pathways or the ICP0 promotor.
