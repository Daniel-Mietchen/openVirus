 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When the immune state of the host is compromised, the virus can be reactivated by the proper stimulus. Although HSV-1 mainly causes innocuous diseases, such as labialis, pharyngitis and keratitis, it can also result in serious life-threatening diseases, including encephalitis [
