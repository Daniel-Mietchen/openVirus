 <caption> MD suppressed the transcription of viral genes. a- c L929 was pretreated with DMSO or MD (3.0 μM) for 1 h prior to HSV-1 infection for additional 2 h. The expression levels of indicated genes were measured by quantitative PCR. The 293 T cells were transfected with the vector and ICP0 promoter after treated with DMSO and MD (1 μM) for 1 h. Cells were harvested to determine luciferase activity 36 h post transfection ( d) </caption>
