 <caption> MD inhibited viral replication and the expression levels of HSV-1 proteins even after HSV-1 entry. a Schematic view. b L929 cells were infected with HSV-1 and washed twice with PBS at the indicated time points. Then cells were cultured with fresh medium added with MD (3.0 μM) for additional 18 h. Then the cell survival rate was determined by measuring ATP levels. HeLa ( c) and L929 ( d) was infected with HSV-1 for 2 h, then the cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in viral free medium containing DMSO or MD (3.0 μM) for additional 6 h. The expression levels of viral proteins were measured by western blot analysis. The viral titers in HeLa cells ( e) were measured by plaque forming assay </caption>
