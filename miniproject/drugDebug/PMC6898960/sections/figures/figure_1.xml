   <bold>b</bold> L929 cells were pretreated with DMSO or the indicated concentrations of MD for 1 h, then the cells were infected with HSV-1(MOI = 2) for 18 h. Identical MOI was used in later experiments unless otherwise stated. The cell-survival rate was determined by measuring ATP levels.

   <bold>d</bold>) L929 cells were pretreated with DMSO or MD (3.0 μM) for 1 h, then the cells were infected with HSV-1 for 6 h. Viral titers were determined by plaque forming assay. 
   <bold>e</bold> L929 cells were pretreated with the indicated concentrations of MD for 18 h, then the cell-survival rate was determined by measuring ATP levels. 
   <bold>f</bold> HeLa cells were pretreated with DMSO or MD (3.0 μM) for 1 h, then the cells were infected with green fluorescent protein (GFP) labeled HSV-1 for additional 16 h. Images were captured by inverted fluorescence microscope
