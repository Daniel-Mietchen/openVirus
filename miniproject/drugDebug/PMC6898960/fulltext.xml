HSV-1 causes numerous infection-related diseases, some of which are severely life-threatening. There are antiviral medications with activity against HSV-1. However, with the emergence of drug-resistant mutant strains of HSV-1, there is an urgent need to develop new effective anti-HSV-1 agents.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">Therefore, we screened a chemical library of approximately 1500 compounds to identify inhibitors of HSV-1-induced toxicity for further drug development.

Furthermore, the viral titers and expression levels of HSV-1 viral proteins were potently reduced by the presence of MD in many cell lines. Using Q-PCR analysis, we found that MD efficiently reduced the transcription of viral genes that are essential for DNA synthesis, namely, <italic>UL5, UL9, UL29, UL30, UL42</italic> and <italic>UL52</italic>. Notably, MD also significantly inhibited the transcription of the immediate early genes <italic>ICP0, ICP22, ICP27</italic> and <italic>ICP47</italic>, all of which are required for the expression of early and late viral gene products.

HSV-1 is recognized as one of the most common human pathogens infecting 50&#x02013;90% of the population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. After infection, HSV-1 is dormant in sensory neurons and persists for the lifetime of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. When the immune state of the host is compromised, the virus can be reactivated by the proper stimulus. Although HSV-1 mainly causes innocuous diseases, such as labialis, pharyngitis and keratitis, it can also result in serious life-threatening diseases, including encephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Mature HSV-1 contains a large DNA genome core enveloped by a protein capsid. The middle layer is referred to as tegument, which is composed of viral proteins and mRNA. The outer layer is surrounded by the glycoproteins gB, gC and gD, all of which are necessary for viral entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Once the HSV-1 virus enters the cytoplasm of the infected cell, its genome is released into the cell nucleus and encodes several gene products that enable viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Viral gene expression is strictly regulated in a cascade fashion. Immediate early genes, early genes and late genes are expressed successively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The immediate early genes include <italic>ICP0, ICP4, ICP22, ICP27</italic> and <italic>ICP47</italic>, whose products are required to initiate and regulate the efficient expression of early genes and late genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, ICP0 mediates the degradation of several cellular proteins and induces the conjugation of ubiquitin. Mutation of <italic>ICP4</italic> or <italic>ICP27</italic> significantly blocked the expression of early and late viral genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Regulated by the immediate early genes, early genes are expressed approximately 2&#x02013;8&#x02009;h after infection. Most early genes are involved in viral replication. As the infection progresses the late genes begin to be expressed, and the products of late genes are structural proteins whose expression also depends on immediate early genes. Some HSV-1 viral proteins are known to be necessary for viral DNA synthesis and include proteins encoded by the <italic>UL5, UL8, UL29, UL30, UL42</italic> and <italic>UL52</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. For example, UL9 helps to unwind the DNA strain by flanking the origins of DNA replication. UL30 and UL42 are two subunits of the DNA polymerase, so losing one of these proteins impedes the elongation of viral DNA chains.</p><p id="Par11">There is a number of available antiviral medications with activity against HSV-1. As a nucleoside analogue, acyclovir is commonly used for the treatment of HSV-1 infection. Because its structure is similar to that of a nucleoside, acyclovir serves as a substrate for the viral DNA polymerase and terminates the extension of the viral DNA to inhibit the proliferation of the HSV-1 virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Peciclovir and foscarnet can also hinder the elongation of HSV DNA by similar mechanisms of action as acyclovir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, with the increasing drug resistance of HSV-1 to acyclovir, research and development of new effective anti-HSV-1 agents is becoming increasingly important. It has been reported that the small molecular compound mitoxantrone dihydrochloride (henceforth MD) is a topoisomerase II inhibitor that shows promising efficacy in clinical trials targeting lymphomas, breast cancer, and prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the current study, using a compound library screen, we found that MD effectively blocked not only HSV-1-induced toxicity but also viral titers in multiple cell lines. MD also showed a potent effect on the expression of essential HSV-1 genes without activating the NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways or the ICP0 promotor.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Screening of small molecular inhibitors against HSV-1</title><p id="Par12">In our previous study, we screened the LOPAC small-scale library to identify small molecules that can inhibit HSV-1-induced toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and identified MD as a potential inhibitor of human herpes simples virus. MD has been reported as a topoisomerase II inhibitor. It has been used as an approved chemotherapy drug to treat lymphoma and prostate cancer in consideration of its antitumour activity. Since its effect on HSV-1 was unknown, we further tested the antiviral effect of MD on HSV-1. L929 cells were treated with various concentrations of MD for 1&#x02009;h prior to HSV-1 infection. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b, we found that HSV-1-induced cell death was inhibited significantly in a dose-dependent manner with an estimated IC:50 value of 1.21&#x02009;&#x003bc;M. MD treatment with an estimated CC:50 value of 11.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;M completely suppressed HSV-1-induced toxicity at 3.13&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and had no obvious cytotoxicity to cells under this concentration (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b and e). We further estimated whether the HSV-1 titers were affected by the present of MD by plaque forming assay. The results showed that the viral titers were significantly suppressed by MD in HeLa cells (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.56, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005) and L929 cells (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;10.02, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>c and d). Moreover, the HeLa cells were infected with GFP-labelled HSV-1 to observe the efficacy more directly. We found that the GFP-labelled HSV-1 virus was significantly inhibited by MD compared with the DMSO control (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>f). Thus, these data show that MD robustly inhibits HSV-1-induced toxicity and viral replication.

ICP6 is a HSV-1 ribonucleotide large subunit that is critical for the synthesis of deoxyribonucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

Antiviral medications acting at any step of these processes will block viral infection. To investigate whether MD inhibited the expression levels of viral proteins even after HSV-1 entry, we washed cells with PBS at the indicated time points after HSV-1 infection at which HSV-1 had completed entry (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). Then, the cells were cultured with fresh medium supplemented with MD for an additional 18&#x02009;h. We found that MD inhibited HSV-1-induced toxicity even after HSV-1 cell entry. (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b). However, the later the MD was added, the worse the antiviral efficacy. MD consistently inhibited the expression of viral proteins in both human and mouse cells even after HSV-1 entered cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c and d). Viral titers were also reduced in HSV-1-infected cells by post-treatment with MD (t&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.76, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e).

To examine the effects of MD on HSV-1 gene expression, total RNA was extracted from the treated cells, and Q-PCR was performed using specific primers as described in the Methods. The transcription levels of the <italic>ICP6</italic> and <italic>GB</italic> genes were reduced by MD (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a).

It has been reported that efficient replication of HSV-1 relies on the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. We further tested whether MD suppressed the expression of viral genes by disturbing the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway. Both viral evasion and antiviral cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1; are able to induce activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, so we used recombinant protein TNF-&#x003b1; to trigger the pathway. As shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a, MD did not abolish TNF-&#x003b1;-induced phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and P65 (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>a). Using confocal microscopy, we found that MD did not block nuclear translocation of the P65 protein in response to TNF-&#x003b1; stimulation, which was consistent with the western blot results (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>b). Therefore, MD had no effect on the NF-&#x003ba;B signalling pathway. Moreover, the MAPK signalling pathway has also been reported to be involved in the regulation of cytokine production and viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], so we also investigated whether this pathway was affected by MD. We found that MD showed no effect on the activation of ERK and AKT, which are critical components of the MAPK pathway (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>c, d). Thus, all these data show that MD exhibits anti-HSV-1 activity independent of the cellular NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways.

During the latent period, the virus infects sensory neurons near the site of primary infection, and the virions hide in the nucleus of the neuron. When the virus is reactivated by the proper stimulus, the virus initiates a lytic infection. HSV-1 infects the epithelium and initiates lytic replication, which further leads to cellular toxicity and tissue lesions. With the participation of cellular transcription factors, HSV-1 genes are transcribed by cellular RNA polymerase II in a highly regulated cascade. Once the viral genome invades the host nucleus, the immediate early genes, including ICP0 and ICP4, play an essential role in initiating viral transcription. Regulated by the immediate early genes, early genes are expressed approximately 2&#x02013;8&#x02009;h after infection. The products of early genes are involved in viral replication, while the products of late genes are usually structural proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par19">HSV-1 is a threat to human health and causes a number of diseases ranging from simple cold sores to keratitis and lethal encephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Current anti-HSV-1 drugs including acyclovir, penciclovir and foscarnet are viral DNA synthesis inhibitors. Acyclovir and penciclovir are commonly used for the treatment of HSV-1 infection. Phosphorylated by virus-encoded thymidine kinases, acyclovir serves as a substrate for the virus DNA polymerase and prevents chain elongation and synthesis of the viral DNA. Penciclovir exerts antiviral activity by a similar mechanism as acyclovir [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Foscarnet is a phosphonic acid derivative that inhibits HSV-1 replication by inhibiting the pyrophosphate site on the herpesvirus DNA polymerase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. However, with the chronic administration of anti-HSV drugs, drug-resistant HSV-1 strains have become a major threat worldwide. In particular, patients with immunodeficiencies are prone to develop drug-resistant HSV-1 strains. Considering that attempts to develop a vaccine against HSV-1 have been found to be ineffective, there is an urgent need to develop new effective antiviral drugs.</p><p id="Par20">It has been reported that MD has antitumour effects, especially against lymphoma, breast cancer and prostate cancer, by targeting DNA topoisomerase II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. However, its anti-HSV-1 effect has not been reported. In our study, we found that MD suppressed HSV-1-induced toxicity at 3.13&#x02009;&#x003bc;M and had no obvious cytotoxicity to cells at this concentration. Further experiments demonstrated that MD suppressed GFP-tagged HSV-1 replication and viral titers in host cells. We tested our hypothesis, that MD shows antiviral activity against HSV-1 by inhibiting the expression levels of viral proteins. We found that the expression levels of viral genes, including ICP6 and gB, were significantly suppressed by western blot analysis. Therefore, we found that MD blocked HSV-1-induced toxicity and suppressed viral protein synthesis. Given that MD can interact with topoisomerase II to regulate DNA synthesis, examination of whether MD reduces the expression level of viral genes by directly binding topoisomerase II is a promising direction to evaluate the possible mechanism of antiviral efficacy of MD in the future.</p><p id="Par21">Viral infection is a complex process consisting of virus entry into host cells, replication and transcription of the viral genome, viral protein synthesis, viral assembly, and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Antiviral medications act by impeding any of these steps. To elucidate whether MD protects cells from HSV-1 infection at viral entry or post viral entry, we changed the order in which HSV-1 and MD were added to cells. The results showed that MD still suppressed viral protein synthesis and viral titers in host cells even after the virus had entered the host cells. Therefore, MD showed antiviral efficacy mainly by suppressing viral protein synthesis rather than blocking the entry of viruses into host cells.</p><p id="Par22">The transcription factor NF-&#x003ba;B, a heterodimer of the P65 and P50 subunits, is involved in many cellular events, such as innate and adaptive immunity and inflammation. The efficient replication of HSV-1 relies on the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway in host cells. Moreover, it has been reported that the MAPK signalling pathway is also involved in the regulation of cytokine production and viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on whether MD inhibits HSV-1 replication by blocking the NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways. According to our results, the phosphorylation of I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; and the nuclear translocation of the P65 protein were affected by MD treatment. In addition, we did not find that MD had any effect on the activation of the MAPK pathway. Therefore, MD exerts antiviral activity in a manner that is dependent on disturbing the activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK pathways.</p><p id="Par23">MD interrupted viral protein synthesis, so we also examined whether the transcription of viral genes was interrupted in the presence of MD. We found that the transcription of <italic>UL5, UL9, UL29, UL30, UL42</italic> and <italic>UL52</italic>, all of which are necessary for viral DNA synthesis, was inhibited by MD. Moreover, the HSV-1 immediate early genes play important roles in regulating the expression of the early genes and late genes. Notably, we also found that the transcription of immediate early genes <italic>ICP0, ICP22, ICP27, and ICP47,</italic> was also reduced in the presence of MD. Therefore, MD inhibits viral protein synthesis by interrupting the transcription of viral immediate early genes.</p><p id="Par24">As one of the immediate early proteins, ICP0 has many biological functions. Some studies found that HSV-1 ICP0 mutant viruses might yield avirulent progeny, suggesting that ICP0 plays a pivotal role during lytic and latent infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. However, according to our results, MD had no effect on the promoter activity of <italic>ICP0,</italic> which suggests that MD interrupts the transcription of viral immediate early genes without affecting the promoter activity of <italic>ICP0</italic>. It is still an interesting future direction to examine the promoter activities of other immediate early genes to explore the precise molecular mechanism of action of MD against HSV-1.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par25">In conclusion, mitoxantrone dihydrochloride is an interesting candidate for the development of a novel therapeutic drug against HSV-1 infectious disease that relies on its effective anti-HSV-1 activity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p id="Par26">The following antibodies were used for Western-blotting: &#x003b2;-actin (A2066; Sigma), gB (6506; Abcam), p-ERK (4370; cell signaling) and p-I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; (9246; Cell Signaling).
