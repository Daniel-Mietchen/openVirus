<p>The relative ranking of utilities for different choices is based on studies showing preferences for unprotected sex amongst highly active individuals. Although relative rankings are easier to establish, it is difficult to quantify the precise values of these utilities, which is why we varied the value of

 </sub> in the univariate sensitivity analysis. We found that increasing or decreasing this parameter influences prevalence and risk assessment as we might expect, but our primary qualitative conclusion that multiple pathways can determine behavior and prevalence remains unchanged under this sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, exploring the impact of homogeneously mixing core group dynamics on stable, concurrent partnerships with individuals outside the core group of interest (e.g. long-term partners) may also be relevant

Future work could improve the realism of the model with respect to decision making processes and population structure (for instance, by allowing behavior and risk perception to be more heterogeneous in both HIV+ and HIVâˆ’ groups); incorporate age-specific mortality rates; or attempt to replicate specific empirical findings concerning HAART. Future work could also better assess how prophylactic HIV vaccines could best be used, including optimal design of booster and catch-up programs.
