<p>Other studies have found that HAART caused no change in risky behavior

 <italic>et al.</italic>â€™s cross-sectional study in MSM found no increased risk behavior associated with HIV positive individuals being on HAART

 <italic>et al.</italic> conducted a cross-sectional study of HIV positive homosexual men, finding that men on HAART had fewer sexual partners, less unprotected anal intercourse and fewer acute sexually transmitted infections than men not on HAART. These cross-sectional studies studies illustrate the potential complexity of perceptual and behavioral responses to interventions. Differing study conclusions may reflect different study populations or study design. Moreover, because disease dynamics unfold over time, cross-sectional studies may fail to capture how disease dynamics may also influence risk perception and sexual behavior.
