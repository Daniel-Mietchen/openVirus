<p>A person infected with HIV passes through the acute, latent, pre-AIDS, and AIDS stages. The duration of each stage is a fixed time interval (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). Individuals die at the end of the AIDS stage (or the AIDS with treatment stage, see subsection on HAART below). The different stages of infection are illustrated by 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>. During unprotected sex, an infected person infects a susceptible person with a probability dependent on their current infection stage, with the relative infectivity during the various stages being highly variable (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). However, individuals in the AIDS stage are assumed not to engage in sexual encounters at all, due to symptomaticity. In order to account for newly infected individuals unaware of their status who continue under the assumption they are HIV−, we introduced 
 <italic>ζ</italic> = 0.1 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table 2</xref>), meaning that an HIV infected individual has a 10% chance of being tested (and thereby discovering their true HIV status) per timestep (one month). We note that the proportion of individuals unaware of their HIV status varies significantly between populations, and in many populations this proportion is higher than what we have assumed here
