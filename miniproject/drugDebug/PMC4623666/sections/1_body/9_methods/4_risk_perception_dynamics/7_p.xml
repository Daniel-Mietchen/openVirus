<p>This expression captures how the utility for risky sex, in the presence of HAART, is a function of both utility for unprotected sex without the availability of HAART (
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>US</italic>
 </sub>) and the utility of unprotected sex if HAART is available to them (
 <italic>U</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>US</italic>
 </sub> + 
 <italic>d</italic>), weighted according to the perceived availability of HAART in the population (
 <italic>ρ</italic> modified by misperception of true HAART coverage, 
 <italic>k</italic>). By adjusting the utility, the choices made by individuals are altered and risky sex is perceived as more attractive under HAART.
