<p>In order to model risk perception evolution, we define 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> to be an individual’s personal risk assessment at time 
 <italic>t</italic>. Each actor has a specific 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub> value. This value varies over the course of the simulation as actors update their 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>-value based on their encounters. Each actor draws their initial 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>-value 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> randomly from a normal distribution of mean 
 <italic>μ</italic> = 0.05 and standard deviation 
 <italic>σ</italic> = 0.1; sampled values less than 0 or greater than 1 are discarded. We chose a relatively small value for the initial 
 <italic>b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>t</italic>
 </sub>-value because recruited individuals in the model are younger, and both the perceived prevalence of HIV in a population as well as the perceived risk of contacting HIV or other STIs are less within younger age groups
