<p>In each time step, there is a probability that an individual engages in an encounter that may lead to sex (i.e., plays the ‘risky sex game’). The probability of engaging is highest in 20-year-olds and declines with age (see

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. There is a random chance that any given actor will be assigned to be “Actor 1” in an interaction. Actor 2 represents the randomly chosen individual fitting the age requirement, and must not be engaged in a current interaction. Actor 2 must interact with Actor 1, if Actor 1 decides to interact with Actor 2 (although they do not have to choose sex). Individuals decide by calculating utilities based on the value of sex (protected or unprotected), the risk of contracting HIV (which depends on behavior of the other individual, perceived , and perceived vaccine coverage), the health impact of contracting HIV, and how the impact might be modified by HAART (see following subsection on HAART). A detailed description of the interaction between individuals in an encounter appears in the
