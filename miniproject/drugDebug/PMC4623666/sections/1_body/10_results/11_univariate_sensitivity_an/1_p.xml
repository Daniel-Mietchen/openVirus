 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S16</xref>). This occurs because a higher vaccine efficacy protects more vaccinated individuals and thus leads to more US offers, however, individuals do not take vaccine efficacy into account in their risk perception, only vaccine coverage. Increasing the transmission rate
