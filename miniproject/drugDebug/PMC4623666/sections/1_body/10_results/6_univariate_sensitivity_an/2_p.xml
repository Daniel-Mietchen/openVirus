<p>As the value of 
 <italic>d</italic> is increased above the baseline value 
 <italic>d</italic> = 20, US becomes increasingly attractive, which increases actual post-treatment HIV prevalence as well as the average perceived infection risk (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). For 
 <italic>d</italic> &gt; 60, the post-treatment HIV prevalence exceeds the pre-treatment HIV prevalence: for these parameter values, the effects of HAART optimism cause a net increase in HIV in the population. At 
 <italic>d</italic> = 60 for an HIV− actor, US with an HIV+ actor still provides a lower utility than PS. Hence, sufficiently strong HAART optimism could actually cause a net increase in HIV prevalence.
