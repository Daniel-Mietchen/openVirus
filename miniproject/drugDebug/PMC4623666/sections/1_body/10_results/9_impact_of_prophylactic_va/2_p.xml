<p>Implementation of a vaccination program at year 50 covering 75% of entering 15-year-olds, and providing protection for approximately 10 years, causes a rapid decrease in infected 15-29-year-olds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). The intervention causes a particularly rapid reduction in HIV prevalence in the 15–20 year-old age group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). Because HIV becomes so rare in this group, its dynamics are highly stochastic and caused corresponding changes in the offers of US versus PS, which in turn causes great variability in the value of

 </sub> over time in HIV+ individuals in this age group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>). A delayed and more moderate decrease in HIV prevalence occurs in infected 30–39 year-olds, but the number of infected individuals actually increases in 40+ year-olds (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5d</xref>). This occurs because individuals who normally would have been infected when young, are no longer becoming infected due to the vaccine, but instead they become infected when they are older and vaccine protection has worn off. As a result, the total number of infected individuals remains relatively constant after vaccination is introduced, although the number of HIV− individuals increases, which reduces the HIV prevalence (
