<p>In summary, HAART causes HAART optimism in the short term along with a transient spike in unprotected sex acts between HIV+ and HIV− individuals. However, in the longer term, it activates other pathways that provide protective effects by modifying risk perception and population composition. The effect of HAART on multiple pathways—some of which are protective and some of which are not—illustrates the complex nature of interactions between interventions, individual risk perception and behavior, and population dynamics. This suggests one reason why different surveys of HAART effects conducted at different times in different populations might provide different results
