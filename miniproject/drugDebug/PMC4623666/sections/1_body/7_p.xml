<p>Game theoretical and other behavioral modeling frameworks formalize how individuals make decisions in a strategic environment. Schroeder 
 <italic>et al.</italic> used a signalling game to investigate sexually transmitted disease epidemics. They constructed simple signalling game models which demonstrate that uninfected individuals engage in high-risk sex with both uninfected and potentially infected partners, if the perceived prevalence of infection is sufficiently low

Applying a decision-making model to infectious diseases, Auld investigated how a population’s choices and beliefs impact infectious diseases and the spread of HIV. Using a dynamical model, he showed that the success of an intervention is highly dependent on whether the population anticipates the presumed changes and adjusts their behavior. This demonstrated that a population’s behavior leading up to introduction of an intervention could impact its spread, and thus is important to consider
