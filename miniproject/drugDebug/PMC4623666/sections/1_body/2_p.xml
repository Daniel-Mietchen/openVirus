<p>As such, it is important to assess a population’s perception of how the risks associated with contracting HIV might evolve due to introducing HAART or prophylactic vaccines, and the resulting changes in disease dynamics. Cross-sectional surveys can provide valuable information on a population’s perception and behavior at a specific time. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from surveys to determine how perception and behavior might evolve under different circumstances, such as when a new intervention is introduced to the population (indeed, it is only possible to gauge how individual’s think they would respond under different circumstances). In contrast, mathematical models can be used to extrapolate to different circumstances, but they also require making simplifying assumptions. Combining insights from both mathematical models and surveys may provide a clearer understanding of how policy resistance to HIV interventions can emerge. Using empirically informed mathematical models in particular may help us understand how HIV interventions change the interplay between individual risk perception, sexual behavior, and population disease dynamics.</p>
