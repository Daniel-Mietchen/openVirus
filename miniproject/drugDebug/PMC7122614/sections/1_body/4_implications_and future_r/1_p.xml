<p id="Par41">Currently, circulating strains of influenza are primarily resistant to the M2 inhibitors but are generally susceptible to the clinically available neuraminidase inhibitors. Sporadic cases of neuraminidase inhibitor resistance have been recognized, and limited regional transmission has been demonstrated [

Lastly, NA inhibitor resistance has been demonstrated to emerge during therapy in highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses that infect humans, with the highest frequency in A/H7N9 viruses [

As such, most regions of the world are currently limited to a single class of drug, the neuraminidase inhibitor, for the management of influenza infections. The risk that resistance could emerge and result in global spread poses a serious threat and requires the development of novel agents and combinations [
