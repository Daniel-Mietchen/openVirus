<p id="Par11">Historically, human isolates of influenza A/H1N1, A/H2N2, and A/H3N2 were initially susceptible to amantadine and rimantadine [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Even after licensure of the M2 inhibitors, there were low levels of primary resistance in community isolates (see Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">71.1</xref>). This began to change when field isolates of A/H3N2 viruses from China were noted to have a significant increase in the resistance to the M2 inhibitors, possibly related to increased use of over-the-counter amantadine after the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. During the 2004–2005 influenza season, approximately 70 % of the A/H3N2 isolates from China and Hong Kong and nearly 15 % of those from the United States and Europe showed resistance due to a Ser31Asn mutation, and this frequency increased to over 90 % in the United States during the 2005–2006 season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Since then, most clinical isolates of A/H3N2 were noted to have Ser31Asn mutations in the M gene conferring resistance to M2 inhibitors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">71.1</xref>). This spread occurred despite the absence of sustained selective drug pressure, possibly because the resistant M gene was incorporated into efficiently spreading HA antigenic variants. Phylogenetic analyses of the HA1 and M2 genes have suggested a common origin of these viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. This experience clearly indicates that this resistance mutation does not reduce transmissibility and is stable over time.
