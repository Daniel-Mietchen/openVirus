<p id="Par14">Although the initial human isolates of highly pathogenic avian A/H5N1 viruses in Hong Kong in 1997 were M2 inhibitor susceptible, resistance to this class of drugs has become more prevalent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Most clade 1 A/H5N1 viruses are resistant to the M2 inhibitors as a result of the Ser31Asn substitution, while most (~80 %) of clade 2.1 A/H5N1 are resistant secondary to Ser31Asn or Val27Ala substitution [
