<p id="Par23">While the M gene mutations do not appear to attenuate or potentiate the virulence of human influenza viruses, more subtle effects on biologic fitness cannot be excluded by studies to date. In occasional patients wild-type virus replaces resistant variants after cessation of amantadine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. As noted for some avian A/H7 viruses, this reversion in the absence of selective drug pressure suggests diminished replication competence of some resistant genotypes. However, the most common resistant variant with Ser31Asn has no apparent loss of replication competence or transmissibility. In studies in birds and ferrets, influenza viruses with Val27Ala, Ala30Val, or Ser31Asn mutations had no impact of virulence, mortality, febrile responses, peak nasal viral titers, or nasal inflammatory cell counts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In general, it appears that M2 inhibitor-resistant human influenza A viruses that emerge inÂ vivo do not differ substantially in replication ability or pathogenicity from drug-susceptible wild-type viruses, and resistance phenotypes were typically retained in the absence of drug.
