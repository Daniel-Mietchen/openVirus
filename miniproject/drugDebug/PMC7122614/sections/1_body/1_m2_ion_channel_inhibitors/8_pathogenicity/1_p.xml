<p id="Par22">M2 inhibitor-resistant influenza A viruses appear to cause typical influenza illness without obviously enhanced or attenuated symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Illness occurs in both the presence and absence of the drug, a finding that indicates the loss of antiviral effectiveness inÂ vivo. Although severe and progressive infection with resistant virus has been noted in immunocompromised and debilitated elderly patients, this is likely more of a marker of the patients underlying condition than virulence of the resistant virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. In most patients, M2 inhibitor-resistant virus has similar risks of pneumonia, hospitalization, or death compared to those with wild-type illness [
