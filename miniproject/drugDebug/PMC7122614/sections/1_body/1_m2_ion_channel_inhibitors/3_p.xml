<p id="Par8">During routine treatment with M2 inhibitors for documented influenza, resistant variants emerge frequently. The clinical implications of resistance became apparent in studies during the 1980s of treated children, in whom a high frequency of resistance emergence was documented, and subsequently of households and nursing homes, where transmission of drug-resistant variants was implicated in failures of drug prophylaxis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. About 30 % of adults treated with M2 inhibitors will have resistant variants detected during the course of their illness with high frequency (up to 80 %) of resistance emergence in immunocompromised patients, patients hospitalized for influenza, and children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Since 2002, though, the prevalence of resistance to M2 inhibitors among circulating influenza A/H3N2 increased globally, and now the majority of A/H3N2 globally is resistant to this class of drugs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Resistance has resulted from the S31N substitution of the M2 inhibitor. M2 inhibitor resistance has also been documented in several important novel strains of influenza: A/H5N1, A/H7N9, and 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Most clade 1 A/H5N1 viruses and all swine-origin A/H1N1 are resistant to the M2 inhibitors as a result of the S31N substitution, while most (~80 %) of clade 2.1 A/H5N1 are resistant secondary to S31N or V27A substitution [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Since most circulating strains of influenza are currently resistant to the M2 inhibitors, this class is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of influenza currently [
