<p id="Par19">The transmissibility of M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses has been demonstrated in animal models and in several clinical settings. Competition-transmission studies with an avian A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 A/H5N2 virus compared the transmissibility of wild-type virus with resistant variants possessing M2 substitutions at positions 27, 30, or 31 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Contact birds shedding resistant virus due to earlier incorporation of amantadine in the drinking water of donors (4Â days only) were caged with birds shedding susceptible virus, and the virus was allowed to transmit through three more sets of contact birds in the absence of selective drug pressure. Resistant virus was detected from the final set of contact birds in three of four experiments over four cumulative transmission cycles.
