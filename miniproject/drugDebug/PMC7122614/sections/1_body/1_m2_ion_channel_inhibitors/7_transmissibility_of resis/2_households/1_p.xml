<p id="Par20">Both amantadine and rimantadine are effective for postexposure prophylaxis of illness due to susceptible strains in household contacts, when ill index cases are not given concurrent treatment (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">71.3</xref>). In contrast, two studies have found no significant reduction in secondary influenza illness in household contacts receiving either amantadine or rimantadine for postexposure prophylaxis, when the ill index cases received treatment with the same drug, and one of these documented failures of prophylaxis due to infection by drug-resistant variants, most likely transmitted from the treated index cases [
