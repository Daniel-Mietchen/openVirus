<p id="Par17">Resistant variants arise commonly and rapidly in M2 inhibitor-treated children and adults with acute influenza (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">71.2</xref>). One study of adults found that resistant virus could be detected in 50 % of six rimantadine recipients by day 3 of treatment, although the nasal lavage titers were lower than in placebo recipients shedding susceptible virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. A larger pediatric trial found emergence of resistant virus in 27 % of 37 rimantadine recipients, including 45 % of those still virus positive on day 7, compared to 6 % of 32 acetaminophen recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Resistant virus was detected as early as day 3 in one child but was usually present on days 5–7. A study of Japanese children treated with amantadine found that 30 % of 81 in the 1999–2000 season and 23 % of 30 during the following season had resistant virus detected on day 3–5 after a 3-day course [

Another study employing sensitive molecular cloning detection methods found mutations conferring resistance in 80 % of 15 hospitalized children during or immediately after amantadine treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Nine (75 %) of 12 children had 2–4 resistance mutations detected in clones from a single sample, sometimes mixed with wild-type virus. In a randomized study patients hospitalized with influenza were to receive either rimantadine alone or rimantadine plus nebulized zanamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Rimantadine-resistant virus was detected in 2/20 (10 %) of rimantadine monotherapy patients, while non-resistant variants were detected in the 21 patients receiving combination therapy [
