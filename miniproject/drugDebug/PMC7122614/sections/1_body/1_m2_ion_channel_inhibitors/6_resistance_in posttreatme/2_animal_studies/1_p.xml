<p id="Par16">The rapid emergence of resistant variants in M2 inhibitor-treated patients has been found also in studies of experimentally infected animals. In a study of a chicken A/H5N2 virus, resistant viruses are detectable by 2â€“3 days after starting drug administration and persisted thereafter [
