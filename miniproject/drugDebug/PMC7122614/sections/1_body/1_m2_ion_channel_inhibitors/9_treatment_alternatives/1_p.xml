<p id="Par25">Amantadine and rimantadine share susceptibility and resistance, so that resistance to one M2 inhibitor confers high-level cross-resistance to another one and the entire class of compounds targeting M2 protein. Because of their different mechanism of antiviral action, neuraminidase inhibitors and protease inhibitors (discussed below) retain full activity against M2 inhibitor-resistant viruses and are appropriate choices for both prophylaxis and treatment of suspected M2 inhibitor-resistant infections. Clinical studies suggest that both oseltamivir and zanamivir are successful in terminating institutional outbreaks where amantadine resistance is proven or highly probable [
