<p id="Par32">With the exception of the influenza seasons between 2007 and 2009 when the oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 viruses were circulating, the global incidence of circulating A and B viruses with de novo resistance to the NA inhibitors has been very low since the approval of these drugs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">71.5</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. A recent study in which 10,641 viruses were collected globally in 2013–2014 by collaborating National Influenza Centers to determine IC
 <sub>50</sub> data for NA inhibitors oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and laninamivir 172 viruses (1.6 %) showed highly reduced inhibition (&gt;100-fold) against at least one of the four drugs and 32 viruses (0.3 %) with only reduced inhibition (between 10- and 100-fold reduction) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. Most of these highly resistant isolates were 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 viruses with a His274Tyr amino acid change (
 <italic>n</italic> = 169). Only a single resistant A/H3N2 virus was detected, which carried a Glu119Val amino acid change. Two influenza B viruses with and Glu119Gly (B/Victoria) and His273Tyr (B/Yamagata) were detected. In a recent global observational multicenter clinical trial (IRIS) with follow-up sampling of influenza-infected patients after admission to a clinic (2009–2013; 
 <italic>n</italic> = 1799), no genotypic resistance was detected at baseline in respiratory specimens of influenza A or B virus-infected patients apart from the A/H1N1 viruses with an inherited His275Tyr amino acid change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>]. In 19 of 1014 patients (1.9 %) receiving an antiviral, emergence of resistance to oseltamivir could be detected during treatment, in most cases children below the age of 5 (
 <italic>n</italic> = 14; 74 %). In 17 of these cases, a 2009 A/H1N1 His274Tyr amino acid change was detected. In two oseltamivir-treated children with an A/H3N2 virus infection, an Arg292Lys change emerged posttreatment. Although the incidence of NA inhibitor-resistant viruses is currently low, the occasional clusters of 2009 oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H1N1 viruses with an His274Tyr are a reason for concern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Resistance to zanamivir was reported due to an amino change Gln136Lys [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">126</xref>]. The presence of this mutation, however, may be caused by an artifact propagation of the virus in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell cultures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. With regard to the highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses and low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses, these are susceptible to the NA inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>]. Like A/H1N1 influenza viruses, amino acid changes at 119, 274, and 294 were found in 2.4 % of human and 0.8 % of avian A/H5N1 virus sequences, which were deposited to GenBank [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Additionally, markers of reduced NA inhibitor susceptibility at amino acid positions 116, 117, 150, 222, and 246 were found in 0.8 % of human and 2.9 % of avian A/H5N1 isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">129</xref>]. Although the His275Tyr change has been the major antiviral resistance pattern found in highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>], a A/H5N1 isolate was reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>], with an Asp295Ser amino acid change causing an 80-fold and sevenfold increase of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for oseltamivir and zanamivir, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. This Asn295Ser change has also been observed in A/H5N1 virus isolates. The emergence of an Arg292Lys amino acid change in the low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses circulating in China since 2013 causes high NA inhibitor resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir and reduced resistance to zanamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>]. Unlike A/H3N2 viruses carrying the Arg292Lys amino acid change, A/H7N9 virus does not seem to be much attenuated by this change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">128</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. Like the influenza A viruses, NA inhibitor resistance in influenza B viruses is currently low [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">141</xref>]. Nevertheless, several oseltamivir-resistant B viruses have been isolated from treated or untreated patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. Antiviral resistance to neuraminidase may be caused by changes at residues Asp198 and Ser250. In addition, also influenza B viruses have been found with an Ile221 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. These mutations cause only a two- to threefold increase in IC
 <sub>50</sub> to oseltamivir, zanamivir, and peramivir.
