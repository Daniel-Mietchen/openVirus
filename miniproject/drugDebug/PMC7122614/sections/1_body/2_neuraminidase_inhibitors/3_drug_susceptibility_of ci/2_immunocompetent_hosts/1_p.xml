<p id="Par33">In natural infections, oseltamivir-resistant variants have been detected much more commonly in treated children than adults (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">71.6</xref>). In the past, analysis of samples from over 2500 influenza patients treated with oseltamivir as outpatients indicated that the frequency of resistance detection is about 0.4 % in adults and about 4.5 % in children [

Similar observations were made more recently in the IRIS trial where 14 of 19 oseltamivir-treated outpatients with resistance development were children aged below 5. The higher level of replication with longer duration of virus shedding increases the chance of developing antiviral resistance as compared to adults. Two studies in Japanese children reported high frequencies of 16 and 18 % oseltamivir resistance emergence during oseltamivir therapy [

The use of weight-based dosing for children in Japan, as contrasted with unit dosing in most countries, is associated with lower drug exposure in young children. This has been postulated to be a major factor in the higher frequency of resistance detected in these studies. Among 54 volunteers experimentally infected with an A/H1N1 virus, oseltamivir-resistant variants with His274Tyr mutation were detected in two subjects in association with apparent rebounds in viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">148</xref>]. This study found that oseltamivir-treated subjects were less likely than placebo to have late viral isolates showing reversion of the egg-adapted inoculum virus to a human receptor HA genotype. The His274Tyr finding suggests that HA mutations with reduced affinity for human receptors might have a replication advantage over viruses with human receptor preference during oseltamivir use in humans. Interestingly, amino acid changes in the HA of the influenza A/H1N1 viruses prior to the emergence of the oseltamivir-resistant A/H1N1 virus in the 2007–2008 season have been predicted to have facilitated the emergence of the His274Tyr amino acid change [
