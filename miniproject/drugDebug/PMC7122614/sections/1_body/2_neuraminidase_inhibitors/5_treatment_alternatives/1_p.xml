<p id="Par36">The patterns of NA inhibitor cross-resistance vary by virus type and subtype, such that zanamivir retains inhibitory activity for the most common resistant variants that emerge during the therapeutic use of oseltamivir or peramivir. Zanamivir is fully inhibitory for oseltamivir-resistant variants possessing the Glu119Val substitution in N2 or His275Tyr or Asn294Ser in N1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>]. Depending on the virus and assay, zanamivir is partially inhibitory for resistant variants with Arg292Lys substitution in N2, in that the loss of susceptibility is about 5–25-fold compared to the wild type [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">172</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>]. There is controversy about the role of peramivir in the management of variants that are resistant to oseltamivir as in vitro and in vivo models have given conflicting results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. Oseltamivir is not inhibitory for the Arg152Lys mutation in influenza B NA that confers reduced susceptibility to zanamivir [
