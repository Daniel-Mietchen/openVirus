<p id="Par37">Given these findings, most experts recommend using zanamivir for the treatment of patients who develop resistance or virologic failure to oseltamivir. Inhaled zanamivir has been utilized in a few patients with variable success but has not been studies systematically in oseltamivir-resistant infections; success is less likely in patients with influenza pneumonia [
