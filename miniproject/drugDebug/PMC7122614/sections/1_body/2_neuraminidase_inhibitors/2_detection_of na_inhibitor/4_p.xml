<p id="Par31">HA binding efficiency and associated susceptibility to NA inhibitors are affected by amino acid changes in the receptor binding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. Consequently, HA mutations have been looked for in clinical isolates usually by comparing the sequence of pre- and post-therapy isolates and in some instances by examining changes in receptor affinity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. HA variants that have reduced receptor affinity show cross-resistance in vitro to all NA inhibitors but in general retain susceptibility to NA inhibitors in vitro and in animal models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>].
