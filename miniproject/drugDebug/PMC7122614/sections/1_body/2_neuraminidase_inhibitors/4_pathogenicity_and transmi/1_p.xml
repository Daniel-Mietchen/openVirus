<p id="Par35">Before the 2007–2008 influenza season, it was thought that NA inhibitor resistance development was to go hand in hand with reduction of virus fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>]. Mathematical modeling predicted a 10 % relative transmissibility of oseltamivir-resistant variants would result in low levels of resistant viruses circulating in the community [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Based on animal experiments, the reduced fitness and replication competence of certain NA resistance mutations appeared to be depending on virus subtype and resistance mutation. For instance, an oseltamivir-resistant influenza A/H3N2 virus with an Arg292Lysine amino acid change did not transmit between infected and naïve ferrets and showed a 10–100-fold reduction in nasal virus titers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>]. For the Glu119Val oseltamivir-resistant mutant, however, it was found that the mutant was as transmissible as wild type with comparable nasal virus titers in both donor and recipient animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. An influenza A/H1N1 virus with a His275YTyr mutation required 100-fold higher inoculum to infect the donor ferret, but once infected, they transmitted the virus to contact animals with a delay of 1–3 days compared to wild-type virus. Early after the outbreak of the 2009 pandemic, it was questioned whether a His275Tyr oseltamivir-resistant mutant would be attenuated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. In vitro replication and in vivo pathogenicity studies were performed using resistant isolates; however, the answers were conflicting. Some researchers found slight attenuation of the early His275Tyr mutant A/H1N1 viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>], while others did not find such differences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. At most, from these conflicting data, it can be concluded that the differences between a wild-type 2009 pandemic A/H1N1 virus and its His275Tyr-resistant counterpart are too close to call by means of its pathogenicity and transmissibility [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Additional compensatory mutations may facilitate the emergence of NA inhibitor resistance mutations, which cause an initial loss of virus fitness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. For instance, for the His275Tyr amino acid change in 2007–2009 A/H1N1 viruses, several permissive amino acid changes have been suggested to have facilitated the emergence of this oseltamivir resistance change. The Asp344Asn amino acid change, which appeared before the 2007–2008 season, had increased the enzymatic properties of NA prior to the introduction of the His275Tyr amino acid change [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. Amino acid changes Val234Met and Arg222Gln maintained high NA expression in vitro, which was reduced if the single His275Tyr was expressed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. In A/H3N2, compensatory roles for amino acid changes at position 222 have been assigned to compensate for the loss of fitness due to the Glu119Val oseltamivir resistance mutation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">171</xref>]. The observed community clusters of 2009 A/H1N1 viruses with a His275Tyr amino acid change do not seem to be attenuated by the His275Tyr amino acid change either [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. These viruses contain, in addition to the His275Tyr change, changes at amino acid positions 241, 369, and 386. These mutations may also have permissive effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>].
