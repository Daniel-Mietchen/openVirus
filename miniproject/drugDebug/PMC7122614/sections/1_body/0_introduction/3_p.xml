<p id="Par4">The frequency of resistance emergence during therapy is higher with M2 inhibitors than NA inhibitors. Development of resistance during the course of therapy was very common among initially M2 inhibitor-susceptible viruses in the past. Mutations in one of five amino acids in the M2 gene result in cross-resistance to both amantadine and rimantadine. Resistance emergence during therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors generally remains rare for circulating strains of A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B viruses, with higher rates in children and immunocompromised patients. A common feature of patients who develop resistance despite ongoing therapy is high-level replication and longer duration of replication in the presence of antiviral therapy. Resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors results from mutations in the neuraminidase gene, the hemagglutinin gene, or both. The specific mutation determines the degree of resistance and which neuraminidase inhibitor has reduced susceptibility. Further, the frequency and magnitude of NA inhibitor resistance vary with drug, virus, and neuraminidase type and subtype. Resistance has been demonstrated to develop during the course of therapy with avian viruses, particularly A/H7N9, with greater frequency than seasonal human viruses. Compensatory mutations may also occur that improve the fitness and transmissibility of resistant viruses and may play a role in establishing persistent transmission, as was demonstrated with the seasonal A/H1N1 during the 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 seasons.</p>
