  <p>Flow chart showing the electronic alert system (EAS) for screening of viral hepatitis markers in patients undergoing haematological therapy. In collaboration with the Haematology and Pharmacy Departments, a software linked to the prescription application was created to remind physicians and facilitate testing for HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV in haematological patients. In patients with positive results or an absence of data, the EAS automatically sends an e-mail to the Hepatology Department. To facilitate the physiciansâ€™ work and obtain relevant data, 3 preconfigured test requests were created, one for patients with chronic hepatitis B, one for those with chronic hepatitis C, and one for anti-HBc-positive patients and those lacking data on viral hepatitis markers. NA, not available.</p>
