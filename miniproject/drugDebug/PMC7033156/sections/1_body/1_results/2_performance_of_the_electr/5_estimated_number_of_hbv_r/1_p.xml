<p id="Par12">According to previously published meta-analyses and controlled trials, the estimated risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc-positive patients receiving treatment for hematological malignancies is 2.4% in those with antiviral prophylaxis and 7.2% in those without

 </sup>. Based on these rates, the number needed to treat (NNT)—that is, the number of antiHBc-positive patients in this setting who should receive antiviral prophylaxis to avoid 1 case of HBV reactivation—would be 20.8 (95% CI -18.2-13.9). As 25 antiHBc-positive patients diagnosed by the EAS received antiviral prophylaxis, the estimated number of avoided HBV reactivations was 1.2.
