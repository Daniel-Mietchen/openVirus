<p id="Par11">Ten out of 57 antiHBc-positive patients died during follow-up. However, in 3 of these subjects data on HBV reactivation was available during therapy. Therefore, prospective data on HBsAg and HBV DNA was available in 50 anti-HBc positive patients. No cases of HBV reactivation were observed during a mean follow-up of 11 ± 4 months (time from the first prescription to the last analytical control). Twenty-five (50.0%) of these patients were receiving antiviral prophylaxis. There were no differences between baseline and follow-up anti-HBs titres (321 vs 292, respectively, p = 0.232). The two HBsAg-positive patients received antiviral treatment and achieved virological suppression (undetectable HBV DNA), which was maintained during follow-up.</p>
