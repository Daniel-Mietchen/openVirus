<p id="Par9">Despite the EAS recommendations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>), HBV DNA analysis was performed in only 43 (75.4%) of the 57 anti-HBc-positive individuals, and it was undetectable in all cases. Antiviral prophylaxis was prescribed in 28 (49.1%) patients. Patients receiving anti-CD20-containing regimens and those with the malignancies most commonly treated with these drugs (DLBCL and follicular lymphoma) were statistically more prone to receive antiviral prophylaxis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). There was also a trend to prescribe prophylaxis in patients with low baseline levels of anti-HBs (&lt;10 mIU/mL), although mean baseline anti-HBs titres did not differ between those who received antiviral prophylaxis or not (274.4 vs 337 mIU/mL, p = 0.556), neither did age (67.3 vs 69.2 years, p = 0.5). Patients with CLL or CML and those treated with tyrosine-kinase inhibitors tended not to receive antiviral prophylaxis. Among patients receiving tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, the underlying haematological disease had an impact on the prescription rate of antiviral prophylaxis, with only 2/40 (5%) patients with CLL or CML receiving prophylaxis versus 4/11 (26.7%) with the remaining indications (p = 0.041), in particular patients who had undergone stem cell transplantation.
