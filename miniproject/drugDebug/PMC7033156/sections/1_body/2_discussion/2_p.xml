 </sup>. In the present study, addition of HCV to the test panel in our EAS was also found to be useful for diagnosing new cases of chronic hepatitis C, which led to the start of treatment with direct-acting antiviral agents and sustained virological response. Currently, considerable effort worldwide is devoted to promoting HCV screening programs (including microelimination programs in targeted populations) to achieve elimination of the virus. Implementation of an EAS, mainly in those at high-risk such as haematological patients, could be a useful step toward eliminating HCV in hospitals.
