<p id="Par18">This observational study was carried out in the first year of EAS implementation, with prescription of antiviral prophylaxis left to the discretion of the treating haematologist in patients testing positive only for anti-HBc. This design also provided interesting data on the awareness of physicians regarding the risk of HBV reactivation in this population. In our cohort, and in line with current international guidelines, most patients prescribed anti-CD20-containing regimens received prophylaxis, including all patients with follicular lymphoma. However, our data indicated an alarmingly low concern about reactivation risk in anti-HBc-positive patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors or schemes including corticosteroids. Apart from R-CHOP and anti-CD20-containing regimens, the risk of HBV reactivation in anti-HBc-positive hematological patients is poorly stratified, especially concerning the latest approved drugs. In the case of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, although a few case reports have shown a risk of HBV reactivation, including development of acute liver failure

 </sup>, only one retrospective study including 10 anti-HBc-positive patients assessed this potential hazard. No cases of HBV reactivation were found after a mean follow-up of more than 3 years, despite an absence of antiviral prophylaxis

 </sup>. In our cohort, although the concern for screening was low in the population receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (62.5%), the complete testing data showed 17 anti-HBc-positive individuals. Among these, 12 (70.6%) did not receive prophylaxis and there were no cases of reactivation during the first year of therapy.
