<p id="Par4">In view of the high prevalence of HCV in haematological patients and the potential risk of HBV reactivation in this population, we developed an electronic alert system (EAS) to increase the screening rate in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing specific therapy. This application is linked to the hospital prescription software and requires introduction of the patientsâ€™ HBV (HBsAg and antiHBc) and HCV serology results every time a new therapy scheme is prescribed. The data are transferred by e-mail to the Liver Department, which facilitates referral of individuals with positive serology and requests testing in patients without this information. The aim of this study was to analyse the impact of the EAS in the first year of its implementation on the rate of HBV and HCV screening in patients with haematological malignancies undergoing specific therapies. In addition, the estimated number of HBV reactivations avoided as a result of the EAS was calculated.</p>
