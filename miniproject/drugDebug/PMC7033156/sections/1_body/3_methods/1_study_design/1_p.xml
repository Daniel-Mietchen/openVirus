<p id="Par22">An EAS was developed to remind physicians of the need for HBV and HCV testing in certain patients. The EAS was linked to the hospital’s prescription software and requested HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HCV results when specific haematological drugs were prescribed. The physician was informed about the potential risk of HBV reactivation and the need to refer the patient to a hepatologist according to the scheme summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. In patients testing HBsAg or antiHBc positive and those with unknown status, the system automatically sends an e-mail to the Hepatology Department with the patient’s coded data. Furthermore, to facilitate the physicians’ work and achieve relevant data, 3 preconfigured blood tests were created: one to complete the study of HBsAg-positive individuals (
 <italic>Code 520</italic>, which included a haemogram, biochemistry, clotting, quantitative HBsAg, HBV DNA, HBeAg, anti-HBe, anti-hepatitis D virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serology, and anti-HCV), another for anti-HBc positive or unknown serological status (
 <italic>Code 527</italic>, including HBsAg, anti-HBc, HBV DNA, and anti-HBs titers), and a third for those with detectable HCV RNA (
 <italic>Code 528</italic>, haemogram, biochemistry, clotting, HIV serology, and HCV genotype). Whenever a new treatment schedule was prescribed, the computerized system requested the patient’s viral hepatitis status if it had not been previously introduced. If data were lacking and viral hepatitis screening had not been performed within the first 3 months after the therapy prescription, the viral hepatitis panel was added to the patient’s next scheduled blood test.
