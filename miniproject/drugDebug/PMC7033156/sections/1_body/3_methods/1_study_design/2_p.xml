<p id="Par23">Prior to implementation of the EAS, Haematology Department physicians underwent training sessions to highlight the importance of hepatitis B and C screening, the rationale to set up this system and to inform about the functioning of the EAS. During the first year of the system, this prospective, observational study was carried out to evaluate the performance of the EAS according to the following items:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par24">Number of patients whose viral hepatitis status was checked after the EAS warning. All patients lacking data at the first prescription were checked for later viral hepatitis screening requests from the Haematology Department.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par25">Number of patients with newly diagnosed viral hepatitis markers.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par26">Number of HBV prophylaxis therapies initiated as a result of the EAS (newly diagnosed HBsAg- or anti-HBc-positive patients) and estimation of the number of HBV reactivations avoided because of the EAS.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par27">Number of HBV reactivations within the first year of the EAS.</p>
