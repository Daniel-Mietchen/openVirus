<p id="Par32">Serological markers for HBV (HBsAg, anti-HBc, and anti-HBs) and HCV (anti-HCV) were analysed by commercial enzyme immunoassays. The lower limit of quantification of anti-HBs was 10 mIU/mL and the upper limit, 500 mIU/mL. Serum HBV DNA was quantified by PCR with a COBAS 6800 HBV test (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany): lower limit of quantification, 20 IU/mL and lower limit of detection, 10 IU/mL.</p>
