    "Plant lectins are a unique group of proteins and glycoproteins with potent biological activity and have received widespread attention for many years. They can be found in wheat, corn, tomatoes, peanuts, kidney beans, bananas, peas, lentils, soybeans, mushrooms, tubers, seeds, mistletoe and potatoes among many others. Due to their ability to bind reversibly with specific carbohydrate structures and their abundant availability, plant lectins have commonly been used as a molecular tool in various disciplines of biology and medicine. Whilst once thought of being a dietary toxin, the focus on plant lectins has since shifted to understanding the useful properties of these lectins and utilizing them in medicinal applications to advance human health. This chapter reviews the current and potential applications of plant lectins in various areas of medically related research."
