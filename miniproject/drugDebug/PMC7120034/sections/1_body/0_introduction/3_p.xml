<p>Despite a lack of complete understanding of their biological roles, lectins have been exploited for several years in many applications. The use of lectins has facilitated advancements in many areas of medical research. Lectins are promising candidates as useful therapeutic agents because they can recognize specific carbohydrate structures such as proteoglycans, glycoproteins, and glycolipids, resulting in the regulation of various cells via glycoconjugates and their physiological and pathological phenomena through host-pathogen interactions and cellâ€“cell communications [
