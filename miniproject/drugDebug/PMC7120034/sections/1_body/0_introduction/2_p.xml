<p>Lectins were first discovered more than 100Â years ago in plants, when in 1888, Stillmark found that extracts of castor bean (
 <italic>Ricinus communis</italic>) seeds contained a protein that could agglutinate animal red blood cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Following the discovery of Stillmark, a number of other plant seed extracts demonstrated the same ability to agglutinate red blood cells, but escalating interest in lectins was sparked during the Second World War as a result of the awareness of using lectins for blood typing. Because some lectins were found to be specific for various blood types (A, B or O), and others were found to have specificities for different glycans, lectins were used for blood typing before blood transfusions were performed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Lectins have since been found in almost every plant species studied and are particularly abundant in the seeds of leguminous plants. They have also been found in various tissues and organs of many vertebrates and invertebrates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Due to their biochemical properties, lectins have become a beneficial tool in several fields of biological research including immunology [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], cancer research [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and clinical microbiology [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. 10.1007/978-94-007-6214-5_2 in this book provides more interesting stories regarding the history of lectinology.
