<p>Plant lectins can also be grouped into different families according to some common features (legume lectins, type II ribosome-inactivating proteins, monocot mannose-binding lectins, and other lectins) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Legume lectins are the best known lectin family. Lectin content in seeds is higher compared to the content in the bark, leaves, roots and stems of leguminous plants. Other smaller families of plants whose lectins have been characterized are Gramineae (cereals, such as wheat germ) and Solanaceae (potatoes and tomatoes). Monocot-binding lectins exhibit an exclusive specificity towards mannose and are built up of 1, 2, 3, or 4 subunits of about 12Â kDa while chitin-binding lectins are composed of hevein domains [
