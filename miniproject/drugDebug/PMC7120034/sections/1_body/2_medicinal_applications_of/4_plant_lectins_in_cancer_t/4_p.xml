<p>Mistletoe lectin (ML) is one of the most studied lectins in clinical trials and has demonstrated beneficial effects against cancer development. Additionally their mechanisms of action towards cancer treatment have been extensively studied. For example, in a study using European mistletoe lectin which demonstrated antiproliferative activity towards human melanoma cells, a significant number of melanoma cells started rounding up and exhibited cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation typical for apoptotic body formation indicating apoptotic cell death [

Mistletoe lectin-I, which belongs to the type II ribosome-inactivating protein (RIP II) family and is composed of a catalytically active A-chain with rRNA N-glycosidase activity and a B-chain with carbohydrate binding properties, exerted potent cytotoxic effects on tumor cells. It also induced apoptosis through both caspase-8/FLICE independent of a death receptor pathway and via a p53-independent pathway following ionizing radiation. Meanwhile, mistletoe lectin-II induced apoptotic death in cancer cells involving the generation of intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and activation of a caspase- 9-caspase-3 cascade [
