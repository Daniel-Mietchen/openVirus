<p>As many plant lectins have demonstrated anticancer properties in vitro, and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, there clearly is a huge potential for their use as therapeutic agents in cancer treatment. Mechanisms of plant lectin action elucidated thus far include preferential binding to cancer cell membranes or their receptors, causing cytotoxicity, apoptosis, and inhibition of tumor growth. Plant lectins can be internalized into cells, causing cancer cell agglutination and/or aggregation [

The immune system is also affected by alterations in the production of various interleukins, or by activation of certain protein kinases. Additionally, lectins can bind to ribosomes and inhibit protein synthesis. They also alter the cell cycle by inducing non-apoptotic G1-phase accumulation mechanisms, G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and can trigger the caspase cascade. Lectins can also down-regulate telomerase activity and inhibit angiogenesis [
