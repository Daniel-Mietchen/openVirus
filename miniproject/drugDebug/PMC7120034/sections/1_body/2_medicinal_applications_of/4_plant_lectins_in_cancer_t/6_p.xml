<p>Lectins from several types of mushroom have demonstrated anti-proliferative activity including those from 
 <italic>Flammulina velutipes</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], 
 <italic>Ganoderma capense</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], 
 <italic>Pholiota adipose</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and 
 <italic>Clitocybe nebularis</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A homodimeric 32.4-kDa lectin was isolated from fresh fruiting bodies of the mushroom 
 <italic>Pleurotus citrinopileatus</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. The lectin exerted strong anti-tumor activity in mice bearing sarcoma 180, and caused approximately 80 % inhibition of tumor growth when administered intraperitoneally at 5 mg/kg daily for a period of 20 days.
