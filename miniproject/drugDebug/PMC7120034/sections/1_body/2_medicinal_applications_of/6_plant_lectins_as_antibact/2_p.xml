<p>The cell wall of bacteria not only precludes any interaction between the glycoconjugates on their membrane and carbohydrate-binding proteins but also prevents these proteins from penetrating the cytoplasm. Therefore, plant lectins cannot alter the structure and/or permeability of the membrane or disturb the normal intracellular processes of invading microbes. Therefore, if lectins play a role in the plantâ€™s defense against bacteria, it must be through an indirect mechanism that is based on interactions with cell wall carbohydrates or extracellular glycans [
