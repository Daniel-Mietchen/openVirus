<p>The growing resistance of microorganisms to convectional antimicrobial agents is a source of concern to clinical microbiologists all over the world. As a result, efforts are being made to develop antimicrobial agents from local sources for better chemotherapeutic effects. Lectins from plants could satisfy the demand for more natural antimicrobials as several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of lectins as inhibitory compounds towards bacterial and fungal growth such as the examples listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">5.4</xref>. Plant lectins have demonstrated antibacterial activity against many pathogens including 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Shigella dysenteriae</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, 
 <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella sp</italic>. Lectins have also demonstrated antifungal activity towards 
 <italic>Aspergillus flavus,</italic>
 <italic>Trichoderma viride, Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium moniliforme, Coprinus comatus, Rhizoctonia olani, Penicillium digitatum, Alternaria</italic>
 <italic>alternata</italic>, and 
 <italic>Valsa mali.</italic> The use of lectins in clinical microbiology in a review by Slifkin and Doyle (1990) [
