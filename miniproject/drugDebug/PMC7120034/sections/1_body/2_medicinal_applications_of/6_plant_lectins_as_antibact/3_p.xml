<p>Similarly, plant lectins are not capable of binding to glycoconjugates on the fungal membranes or penetrating the cytoplasm due to the barrier formed by the cell wall. Thus, it is not likely that lectins directly inhibit fungal growth by changing the structure and/or permeability of the fungal membrane. However, there may be indirect effects produced by the binding of lectins to carbohydrates on the surface of the fungal cell wall [
