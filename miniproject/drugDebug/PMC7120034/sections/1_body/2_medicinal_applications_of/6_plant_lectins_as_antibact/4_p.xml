<p>This activity was concluded to be related to the lectin carbohydrate binding property, that might endow lectin molecules with binding activity towards certain carbohydrate components in the fungal cell wall affecting its activity and viability as most lectins recognize either 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine, galactose, mannose, or fucose [

Alternatively, it was stated that antifungal activity of some proteins or peptides is associated with chitin binding property and the active proteins should have a specific amino acid sequence and a cysteine/glycine rich chitin binding domain. This chitin binding property might simulate the carbohydrate binding property as chitin is composed of modified glucose subunits (
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucose amine) which can be equally recognized by lectin as glucose [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Chitin binding might lead to the disruption of the fungal cell wall that increases toxicity, since chitin, which is a major component of the fungal wall, is a polymer of 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine.
