<p>A limited number of lectins from plants possess the unique ability to induce quiescent lymphocytes to grow and divide, a phenomenon known as mitogenic stimulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Mitogenic lectins mimic the action of antigens on lymphocytes, except that they activate a large proportion (as much as 70–80 %) of the cells, whereas antigens stimulate only specific clones, each of which compromise a tiny proportion, 0.1 % or less, of the total number of lymphocytes. Because of their ability to stimulate multiple lymphocyte clones, lectins are classified as polyclonal mitogens. One of the most valuable outcomes of this proliferative ability of lectins has been an increased understanding of the relationship between chromosomal abnormality and human diseases, which has tremendously helped in diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Besides other cells, lymphocytes have been the usual target cells for mitogenic assays, and the study of lectin-lymphocyte interaction has made a significant contribution to elucidating the mechanism of lymphocyte activation and its control, further contributing to the understanding of cell growth and development.
