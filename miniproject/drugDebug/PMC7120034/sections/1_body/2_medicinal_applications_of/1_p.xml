<p>Due to their versatility, lectins are frequently used in biological and medical research. The overwhelming success of plant lectins is based firstly on their highly specific carbohydrate-binding activity, and the biological effects they provoke in various organisms. Being able to procure reasonable amounts of pure lectin preparations also contributes to their success [
