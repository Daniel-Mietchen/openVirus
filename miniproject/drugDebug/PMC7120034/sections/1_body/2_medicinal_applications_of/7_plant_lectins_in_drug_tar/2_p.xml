<p>Attempts to evaluate the binding of lectin candidates to non-histologically processed cell surfaces, must be done in order to systematically identify the appropriate receptors and lectin types for further studies. Further work will more precisely locate the lectin binding site on the tissue surface and will quantify the binding. Lectin toxicity and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> binding will then be considered prior to selecting the most promising candidates for formulation studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Lectins such as WGA could be useful as specific bioadhesive ligands for lipid nanoparticles intended for oral administration [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] once the bioadhesive properties and oral bioavailability efficiency are determined.
