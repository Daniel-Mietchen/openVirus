<p>The idea to use lectins for drug delivery began when the use of tomato lectin (TL) to target the luminal surface of the small intestine was proposed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. The underlying principle behind lectin-mediated drug targeting is that most cell surface proteins and many lipids in cell membranes are glycosylated and these glycans can be the binding sites for lectins. The combination of a small number of sugars can produce a vast range of different chemical structures. Different cell types express different glycan arrays and diseased cells, such as transformed or cancerous cells, often express different glycans compared with their normal counterparts. Therefore, lectins could be used as carrier molecules to target drugs specifically to different cells and tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. By targeting cell types exclusively, the side effects of drugs could be minimized. Besides targeting specific cells, the lectin–sugar interaction can also been used to trigger vesicular transport into or across epithelial cells. The concept of bio-adhesion via lectins may be applied not only for the gastrointestinal tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>] but also for other biological barriers like the nasal mucosa, the lungs, the buccal cavity, the eye [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>] and the blood–brain barrier [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>] and peanut [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] which have been studied to investigate their potential of use as drug targeting agents.
