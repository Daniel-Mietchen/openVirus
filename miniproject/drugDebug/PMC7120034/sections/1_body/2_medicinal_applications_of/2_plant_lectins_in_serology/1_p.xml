<p>Because of their ability to distinguish carbohydrate determinants in human blood cells, lectins have historically been used for blood typing. Serology was the first discipline of medicine that relies on the specific biological activity of lectins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Lectins agglutinate erythrocytes by binding to a carbohydrate-containing moiety on the surface of the cells and forming cross-bridges between them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This useful property of lectins endows them the ability to discriminate between red blood cells that have different terminal, non-reducing sugars in the major glycoprotein that carries the blood group antigens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. For example, blood group A is determined by the presence of N-acetyl-galactosamine in the terminal, non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide portion of the receptor protein while group B is determined by galactose in this position. If both of these sugars are lacking, fucose is the terminal sugar and this determines blood group O. In this way, lectins with different specificities can be used in blood typing to differentiate between blood types. For readers seeking a comprehensive compilation of lectins that have been studied for blood group serology, the review by Judd (1980) is recommended [
