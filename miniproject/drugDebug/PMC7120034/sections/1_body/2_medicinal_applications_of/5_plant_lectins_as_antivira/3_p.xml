<p>Studies on plant lectins such as those from leek (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">5.3</xref>) have shown that they can be potent inhibitors of coronaviruses by interfering with two targets in the viral replication cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. The first target was located early in the replication cycle, most probably viral attachment, and the second target was located at the end of the infectious virus cycle. The antiviral activity spectrum of plant lectins varies considerably, depending on the nature of their sugar specificity. In general, the mannose-specific plant lectins were found to be highly effective against coronaviruses [
