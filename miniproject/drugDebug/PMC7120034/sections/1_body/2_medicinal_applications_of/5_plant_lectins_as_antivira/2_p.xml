<p>HIV RT is a key enzyme of the HIV life cycle. Screening of HIV RT inhibitors is currently a strategy to search for anti-HIV drugs. Strikingly, the vast majority of plant lectins that are active against HIV possess carbohydrate specificity directed against mannose oligomers. Most HIV-inhibitory plant lectins are derived from the monocot families 
 <italic>Amaryllidaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Orchidaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Alliaceae</italic> or the dicot families 
 <italic>Fabaceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Moraceae</italic>, 
 <italic>Urticaceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Cecropiaceae</italic> [

 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">5.3</xref> lists several plant lectins such as 
 <italic>Phaseolus vulgaris</italic> cv. Extralong autumn purple bean lectin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>], Del Monte banana lectin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], black soybean lectin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and 
 <italic>Pholiota adipose</italic> mushroom lectin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] which all possessed anti-HIV RT activity.
