<p>More research is still needed and a genomic and proteomic approach to elucidate and support the potential shown by lectins as anticancer, antimicrobial and drug delivery agents is warranted. The mechanistic details of how lectins operate at a molecular level need to be further explored to know the basis of their biological activity. Although there is still much to be learned about the effects of lectins, the area of research concerning plant lectins is constantly evolving and being updated. Thus the medicinal applications of plant lectins hold considerable potential and exciting discoveries lie ahead.</p>
