 <caption>
  <p>Classifications of plant lectins and the crystal structures of representative plant lectins under the classification standard of mature structure. Crystal data were from RCSB protein data bank and visualized by the UCSF chimera software as used previously [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Protein crystal structures were from PROTEIN DATA BANK: Hevein (PDB ID: 1Q9B); Concanavalin A (PDB ID: 5CNA) [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; Ricin (PDB ID: 2AAI) [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; Peanut agglutinin (PDB ID: 1CR7); BC2L-C (N-terminal domain: 2WQ4; C-terminal domain: 2XR4) [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Please note that BC2L-C is a bacterial lectin since currently no crystal structure of plant superlectin has been released. The coil, helix and strand are shown in 
   <italic>dark grey, red and green</italic>, respectively
