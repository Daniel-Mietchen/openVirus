    <title>Clara Bah</title>
    <p>completed her Bachelor’s Degree in Chemical-Bioprocess Engineering at the University of Technology, Malaysia (UTM). After working as a research and development engineer, she completed a Postgraduate Diploma and Master’s of Science (Food Science) at the University of Otago, New Zealand. Her research topic explored the availability of bioactive compounds from fish eggs, with a particular focus on lectins. This work led to collaboration with Dr Evandro Fang and Prof. T.B. Ng of the School of Biomedical Sciences in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Currently Clara is working towards completing her PhD at the University of Otago</p>

    <title>Dr. Evandro Fei Fang</title>
    <p>Dr. Evandro Fei Fang received his Ph.D. degree from The Chinese University of Hong Kong and currently works with Prof. Vilhelm A. Bohr on DNA repair and genome stability in human aging diseases. His research encompasses: (a) bioassay-guided isolation of antitumor constituents from medicinal plants and the molecular mechanisms involving apoptosis and autophagy pathways, and (b) the functions of mitochondria and mitophagy in sustaining human health and the molecular basis of their defects in the etiology of aging diseases. He has published over 30 papers in International Journals and 9 Book Chapters, and serves on the editorial board of Medicinal and Aromatic Plants. He was a finalist in the Young Investigator Award 2011 conducted by the Hong Kong Institute of Science.</p>
