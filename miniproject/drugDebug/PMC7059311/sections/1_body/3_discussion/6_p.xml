<p id="Par80">Overall, DAA-based treatment was safe. Almost half of patients (41.6%) experienced at least one mild-to-moderate adverse event. In general, no significant difference was observed in the occurrence and number of AEs between the two groups. As expected, RBV (used in comparable proportion between the two groups) was associated with more AEs in the course of treatment in comparison with patients treated with RBV-sparing regimens. Severe AEs occurred in only 10 patients (6.9%). However, SAEs were less frequent than expected, probably due to the fact that the vast majority of patients had a compensated liver disease. Among 4 individuals who did not achieve EOT, 3/4 reported a treatment discontinuation due to SAEs, including seizure, intense headache, angina pectoris. Nevertheless, the few patients who experienced psychiatric symptoms such as depressive disorder and/or isolated generalized anxiety episode during DAA-treatment were exclusively among subjects in group A whereas none of the patients receiving antipsychotics showed the same disorders. Probably this interesting evidence might be explained by a major aptitude of these patients to perceive the initiation of a new treatment course as a stressing factor [
