<p id="Par78">Our study confirms findings showing that HCV-patients with psychiatric co-morbidity can be treated with DAAs with high efficacy. The rate of SVR-12 obtained in our study (88.2% in ITT-analysis) was consistent with the recent results highlighted from Sundberg et al [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] in whose study 17 patients, despite severe psychiatric morbidity, successfully completed DAA-treatment with a comparable SVR (88%), without worsening psychiatric symptoms. Only few data are available on SVR rates in patients with psychiatric comorbidites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. These SVR rates appear only slightly lower compared to those currently reported in the general HCV-infected population, also in our real life experience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while it seems to be lower in intravenous drug addicted [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; We tried to further investigate reasons underlying this gap and for these purposes the population was divided into two groups, based on clinical and therapeutic resemblance, including patients treated with anxiolytics and/or antidepressant in group A, and patients treated with antipsychotics in group B and we find that psychotic patients presented lower SVR rates. It should be beforehand underlined that the two groups were not homogeneous. A first imbalance pertains to the different number of patients in the two groups, with more than twice subjects in group A. A higher percentage of former IDUs was observed in the group of psychotic patients and the population of HCV/HIV-coinfected patients was more represented. As a consequence, differences in the genotype distribution were evidenced: in fact, as expected, genotype 1a and 3 were found widely in group B patients. In contrast, patients in treatment with anxiolytics/antidepressants were significantly older than those in group B, and consequently presented a higher FIB-4 score at baseline, a higher prevalence of cirrhosis, and a higher number of subjects previously treated with unsuccessful IFN-based regimens, probably due to a high rate of IFN-discontinuations. Moreover, a higher number of concomitant comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, thyreopathies) was reported in patients with anxiety/depression, even if differences between the two groups were not statistically significant. Considered all these differences, it is interesting to highlight that, although group A patients had more hepatic and non-hepatic disabilities and a greater fragility, a lower SVR rate (79%) was observed in psychotic patients compared to others (92%) which was mostly due to a higher proportion of patients lost to follow-up. This could be expected considering some particular aspects characterizing psychotic disorders, probably not completely compensated by the antipsychotic treatment (disorganized behavior, impaired ability of sustained attention). In fact, when considering PP-analysis, a higher SVR-12 rate was observed (97.9% in group A and 94.4% in group B), and our results were in line with recent studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Morevoer, in a sub-analysis of study population the lack of achievement of SVR-12 was especially reported in former/active intravenous drug use. Finally, we cannot ruled out the possibility that, although patients received an appropriate treatment regimen, the highest proportion of HCV genotype 3 contributed to the lower response in group B, in which was also described the unique relapse (Y93H, NS5A at treatment failure within 12â€‰weeks after EOT).
