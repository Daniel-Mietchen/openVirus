<p id="Par84">Our study points out the complexity of the anti-HCV treatment of HCV-infected patients with psychiatric comorbidity and suggests that slightly lower SVR rates can be expected in psychotic patients while adverse events were more frequently reported among anxious/depressive patients. The study underlines as a careful evaluation of history and all possible drug-drug interactions before starting therapy can have a remarkable impact on the patient outcome, which was overall successful in our experience, thus encouraging a widespread use of DAAs also in such a “special population”.</p>
