 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Specifically, HCV-infection has been associated with several extrahepatic manifestations among which neuropsychiatric disorders are described in up to half 50% of chronic HCV-infected patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Psychiatric symptoms such as cognitive impairment, asthenia, weakness, anxiety and depression have been reported with high frequency in patients with chronic HCV-infection, causing interference with patient ability to perform daily activities and worsening quality of life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. This evidence of neurocognitive impairment in some patients with HCV-infection, is not fully attributable to liver dysfunction. Although many researches have suggested a pivotal pathogenetic role of HCV in the Central Nervous System (CNS) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] to explain the high rate of psychiatric comorbidity among these patients, probably the adoption of risk behaviors is the main cause of HCV-infection [
