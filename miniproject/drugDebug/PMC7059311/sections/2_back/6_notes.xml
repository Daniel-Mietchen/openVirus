 <title>Ethics approval and consent to participate</title>
 <p id="Par85">The study did not require approval from the ethics committee, according to the Italian law, since it was performed in the context of normal clinical routines (art.1, leg. Decree 211/2003). However, all patients referring to our institute provided a written consent at the time of first visit for the use of their data for research purposes. Patients were recruited retrospectively according to General Authorization to process personal data for research purposes (leg. Decree 9/2016). Data were previously anonymized, according to the requirements set by Italian Data protection Code (leg. Decree 196/2003).</p>
