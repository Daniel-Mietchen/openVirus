<p>To address this gap, we modified the objective function to maximize access specifically in small ZIP code areas. Although these modifications improved coverage in these hard-to-reach populations, the solutions were suboptimal overall. Thus, we developed a hybrid optimization procedure that sequentially ensures high access statewide and in small ZIP code areas. With 723 dispensing points, the hybrid method with 
 <italic>P</italic> = 75% of dispensing points allocated to small ZIP code areas produced networks that are expected to achieve 60.5% access in small ZIP code areas and 90.5% overall. For comparison, the highest possible access (when all pharmacies in the state dispense antiviral drugs) was estimated to reach 63.8% and 95.2% in the 2 populations, respectively ( 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref> ). For populations living in ZIP code areas without pharmacies dispensing antiviral drugs, optimization reduced the average travel distance to the nearest dispensing pharmacy from 4.5 miles to 3.8 miles.
