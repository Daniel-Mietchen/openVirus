<p>During the 2009 influenza pandemic, the Texas DSHS recruited 1,393 pharmacies from 6 major chains and 71 independent pharmacies to dispense antiviral drugs from the SNS and state cache to underinsured populations. These pharmacies were located in 723 of the 1,023 ZIP code areas in Texas that had ≥1 pharmacy. We estimated that this network provided antiviral drug access for 88% of the state’s underinsured population (

In comparison, we also estimated that optimization over all possible pharmacy chains produced a network expected to achieve comparable access by using only 526 ZIP code areas, increased access to 92.5% with 723 ZIP code areas, and reached a maximum access of 95.2% with all 1,023 ZIP code areas.
