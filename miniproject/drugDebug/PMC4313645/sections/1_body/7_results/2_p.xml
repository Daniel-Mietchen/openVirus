<p>However, optimizing for statewide access can lead to critical gaps in coverage. We categorized all Texas ZIP code areas on the basis of underinsured population sizes into small (&lt;1,000 persons), medium (1,001â€“7,000 persons), and large (&gt;7,000 persons). These areas contained 7%, 51%, and 42% of the statewide underinsured population, respectively. The actual Texas 2009 distribution network and the corresponding optimized network (with 723 ZIP code areas) were estimated to achieve only 34.5% and 38.3% access in small ZIP code areas, respectively, but reached 88.0% and 92.5% access overall. By definition, the small ZIP code areas do not carry much weight in a statewide optimization model. They also tend to be more remote than larger ZIP code areas, and thus have lower access to selected pharmacies.</p>
