<p>Our optimization model uses a geographic resolution of ZIP code areas based on ZIP code tabulation areas (ZCTAs) ( 
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>30</italic>
 </xref> ). ZCTAs differ slightly from US Postal Service ZIP code areas and may include â‰¥1 US Postal Service ZIP code area. We mapped each pharmacy and residential ZIP code area to its corresponding ZCTA ( 
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>31</italic>
 </xref> ), and, for simplicity, we refer to these as ZIP code areas.
