<p>Statistical heterogeneity will be assessed by 
 <italic>Q</italic>-statistic and 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> statistic. If there is no significant heterogeneity (
 <italic>P</italic> &gt; .10, 
 <italic>I</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> &lt; 50%), the data will be assessed by fixed-effects model. Otherwise, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis will be performed to identify the potential source of heterogeneity, and the data will be assessed by random effects model.
