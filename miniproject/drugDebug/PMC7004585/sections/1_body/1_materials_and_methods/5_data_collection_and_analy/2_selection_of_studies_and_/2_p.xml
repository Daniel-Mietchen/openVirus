<p>Literature screening and data extraction will be carried out independently by 2 researchers (YW, JZ) using the unified scale, and cross-checking will be conducted. The inclusion of controversial literature will be determined by a third researcher (QZ). If the required information is incomplete, we will contact the author to obtain the necessary data. The entire process is performed in the flow diagram (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).
