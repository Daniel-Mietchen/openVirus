<p>The cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias will be applied to evaluate the risk of bias of the RCTs included. The scale contains 7 parts, including random sequence generation (selection bias), allocation concealment (selection bias), blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias), blinding of outcome assessment (detection bias), incomplete outcome data (attrition bias), and selective outcome reporting (reporting bias). The judgment is categorized as “Low risk” of bias, “High risk” of bias, or “Unclear risk” of bias.</p>
