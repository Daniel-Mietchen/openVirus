<p>To date, influenza is the only common respiratory virus for which a vaccine is available. Immunisation remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. The immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine is lower in patients with HM compared with immunocompetent controls [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167_21">167</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172_21">172</xref>]. A second dose of influenza vaccine has been proposed to enhance immunogenicity, but this strategy was not beneficial in an open-label randomised study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169_21">169</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170_21">170</xref>]. The timing of influenza immunisation may be important. Immunogenicity may be improved by giving the vaccine at least 6 months after HSCT or at least 7 days after intensive chemotherapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168_21">168</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171_21">171</xref>]. The efficacy of influenza immunisation has not been evaluated in randomised control trials. However, a retrospective cohort study suggested benefits from influenza immunisation in HSCT recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173_21">173</xref>]. Influenza immunisation appears safe in patients with HM, and lifelong seasonal administration of the influenza vaccine is therefore recommended in these high-risk patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174_21">174</xref>]. Importantly, family contacts should be immunised also to prevent transmission within the household. Of critical importance is the issue of health-care worker immunisation, which is known to prevent nosocomial acquisition of the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175_21">175</xref>].
