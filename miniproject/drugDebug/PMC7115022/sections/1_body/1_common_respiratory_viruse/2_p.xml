<p>Human influenza viruses are enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses. They are classified into three antigenic types, A, B, and C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. The envelope of influenza A and B viruses carries two major antigenic proteins, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). HA allows the virus to bind to sialic acid-conjugated glycoproteins at the surface of respiratory epithelium cells. NA plays a crucial role in viral dissemination by releasing newly formed virions from host cells. The influenza C envelope supports a unique protein sharing the properties of both HA and NA and known as haemagglutinin-esterase-fusion factor [
