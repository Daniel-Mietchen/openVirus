<p>There is no clear definition of common respiratory virus. Viruses that consistently produce respiratory manifestations are considered respiratory viruses. These include members of the following families of RNA viruses: Orthomyxoviridae (human influenza viruses), Paramyxoviridae (respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], parainfluenza viruses [PIV], and human metapneumoviruses [MPV]), Coronaviridae (human respiratory coronaviruses), and Picornaviridae (human rhinoviruses). Other viruses that cause respiratory manifestations in many, but not all, patients are considered respiratory viruses because they are often associated with seasonal respiratory events. Examples include Adenoviridae (adenoviruses) and some Picornaviridae (non-poliomyelitic enteroviruses). A separate chapter of this book focuses on newly discovered and emerging respiratory viruses (avian influenza viruses, newly discovered coronaviruses, polyomaviruses KI and WU, human bocavirus, and mimivirus). CMV and Herpes pneumonia will also be addressed by Dr. Chemaly and colleagues in two different chapters in this book.</p>
