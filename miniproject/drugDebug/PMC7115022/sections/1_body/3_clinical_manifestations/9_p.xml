<p>Although it is now clear that most of the common respiratory viruses are responsible for an increased rate of pneumonia in patients with HM (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1_21" ref-type="table">21.1</xref> and Fig. 
 <xref rid="Tab1_21" ref-type="table">21.1</xref>–
 <xref rid="Tab3_21" ref-type="table">21.3</xref>), the exact nature and causative mechanisms of pneumonia in this situation remain unknown. The only risk factor for virus-related pneumonia found consistently in studies is lymphocytopenia, defined using a variety of cutoffs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>]. One study found that lymphocytopenia (absolute lymphocyte count less than 200 cells/mL) was independently associated with mortality in patients with influenza-related pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>]. A higher incidence and greater severity of virus-related pneumonia have been noted in HSCT recipients compared with other patients with HM. This finding may reflect deeper lymphocyte depletion. However, in a study by Martino et al., pneumonia rates were comparable in patients with and without lymphocytopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>]. The possible higher incidence and greater severity of virus-related pneumonia within the first few days after HSCT, compared with infections occurring later on, may reflect deeper lymphocyte depletion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53_21">53</xref>]. A similar mechanism may underlie the surprising protective effect of corticosteroid therapy in the study by Nichols et al., since this treatment is often given to treat graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after lymphoid engraftment [
