<p>PIV infections have also been studied in patients with HM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57_21">57</xref>]. PIV type 3 was the cause in 90% of reported cases. In these studies, PIV-related pneumonia was comparable to influenza-related pneumonia, with about one third of patients being affected, a high rate of concomitant URTI, and a 15–30% mortality rate. Co-infections were found in as many as 53% of the patients studied by Nichols et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57_21">57</xref>]. However, in a recent study using rt-PCR for routine respiratory virus detection in HSCT recipients, PIV was found in respiratory samples of asymptomatic patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30_21">30</xref>], whereas influenza, RSV, and human MPV were not detected. This finding suggests that studies using conventional diagnostic methods may have overestimated the true severity of PIV in patients with HM. Some reports suggested a role for PIV3 in the occurrence of neurologic manifestations (such as meningitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome) and myocarditis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58_21">58</xref>]. Such manifestations have not been reported in immunocompromised patients.
