<p>Case reports suggest that the recently discovered human MPV may induce severe pneumonia in patients with HM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59_21">59</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61_21">61</xref>]. To our knowledge, two retrospective cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62_21">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63_21">63</xref>] and three prospective cohorts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30_21">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36_21">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64_21">64</xref>] describing human MPV infections in patients with HM have been published. The small number of patients and highly variable results (pneumonia in 0–43% of patients with a 0–40% mortality rate) preclude definitive conclusions about human MPV-related pneumonia in patients with HM. Although debated, the occurrence of asymptomatic viral shedding may suggest lesser severity of human MPV-related pneumonia compared to influenza and RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30_21">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65_21">65</xref>]. Two cases of encephalitis with human MPV detected in cerebrospinal fluid in immunocompetent paediatric patients have been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66_21">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67_21">67</xref>]. No extra-respiratory manifestations have been reported in patients with HM.
