<p>Few data are available on the specific epidemiological characteristics of common respiratory viruses in patients with HMs. Reported incidence rates vary widely, from 1.8% to 30% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29_21">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30_21">30</xref>]. This variability may be explained by disparities in the type of patients enrolled, reasons for screening patients for respiratory viruses and, most importantly, diagnostic methods used. Whatever the exact incidence, one can reasonably assume that attack rates of common respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients are closely related to the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the community, which serves as the viral reservoir for immunocompromised patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31_21">31</xref>]. This has been confirmed in recent studies showing that the occurrence of viral respiratory diseases in the enrolled immunocompromised patients paralleled the concomitant viral activity in the community [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_21">32</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33_21">33</xref>]. Accordingly, influenza viruses and RSV are the viruses most commonly identified in the largest cohorts of HM patients, each accounting for about one-third of viral respiratory events [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36_21">36</xref>]. PIV, Picornaviridae, and adenoviruses come next. It must be pointed out that influenza viruses accounted for a much higher proportion (up to 75%) of viral respiratory events in the study by Martino et al. conducted in the setting of a major influenza outbreak in the community [
