<p>The epidemiologic characteristics of influenza, RSV, and PIV are particularly well known, perhaps in part because infections with these viruses are considerably more common compared to those due to other viruses. However, the availability of simple and rapid diagnostic tools for these three viruses probably played a great role. Since Picornaviridae, Coronaviridae, and the newly discovered human MPV are mainly diagnosed using reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction technology (rt-PCR), data on their epidemiology are still limited. Recent studies using rt-PCR detection of respiratory viruses in patients with HM revealed a high incidence of human MPV infections, similar to that of RSV infections [
