<p>Common respiratory viruses typically cause infections in early childhood. Influenza C usually causes mild infections that lead to the acquisition of protective antibodies capable of preventing recurrences [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24_21">24</xref>]. Influenza A and B are considerably more common and can cause disease of greater severity, most notably in high-risk groups, such as elderly people and patients with chronic respiratory or cardiovascular conditions, chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, or immune deficiencies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. It is estimated that about 5% of adults and 20% of children experience an influenza episode every year throughout the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25_21">25</xref>]. Although most influenza episodes are mild, the high occurrence rate results in a huge burden of disease that has a severe socioeconomic impact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. Influenza viruses are believed to be the seventh cause of death in the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26_21">26</xref>]. Influenza A and B infections start in childhood and continue to occur throughout the life span, because antigenic variations affecting HA and, to a lesser extent NA, hamper the acquisition of protective immunity. Two mechanisms of antigenic variations have been described, antigenic drift and antigenic shift [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. Antigenic drift probably results from the accumulation of point mutations that occur continuously in influenza viruses, with new variants appearing annually or every few years. These new variants replace pre-existing ones by immunological selection and are only incompletely recognised by immunity resulting from exposure to earlier strains. Antigenic shift is a considerably rarer event that occurs only in influenza A and results in a virus with a completely new HA or NA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. The result is an influenza pandemic due to the absence of protective immunity against the new virus. Progressive acquisition of immunity against this new strain attenuates the intensity of the epidemic over the following years. The exact genetic mechanisms of antigenic shift are incompletely known, and the emergence of pandemic strains is not predictable. Pandemic strains originate from the recombination of influenza strains circulating in different animal species, including birds, pigs, and humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6_21">6</xref>]. Five pandemics occurred in the twentieth century, and the 2009 “Mexican flu” pandemic due to the new H1N1 influenza virus is the first pandemic in the twenty-first century [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27_21">27</xref>]. RSV and PIV are typically infections of early childhood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7_21">7</xref>]. RSV and, to a lesser extent, PIV also undergo antigenic changes that lead to recurrences throughout the life span. These recurrences may be severe, especially in patients with chronic respiratory conditions and in the elderly. The burden of RSV-related diseases may be comparable to that of influenza [
