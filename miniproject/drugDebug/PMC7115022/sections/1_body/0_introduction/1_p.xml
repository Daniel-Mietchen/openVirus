<p>Common respiratory viruses are probably among the leading causes of community-acquired pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1_21">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2_21">2</xref>] but, oddly enough, have long been underrecognised in patients with haematologic malignancies (HMs), perhaps in part due to the lack of rapid and sensitive diagnostic methods and of effective treatments. Over the last 2 decades, the expanding use of high-dose chemotherapy and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) in various malignancies has improved the prognosis of patients with HMs at the cost of increased opportunities for severe infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3_21">3</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5_21">5</xref>]. Combined with the development of new diagnostic methods and introduction of antiviral drugs, this increased infection rate has rekindled interest in the effects of common respiratory viruses in patients with HMs. These viruses are now recognised as true opportunistic respiratory pathogens in immunocompromised hosts.
