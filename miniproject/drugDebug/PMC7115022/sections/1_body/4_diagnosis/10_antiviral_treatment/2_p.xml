<p>Ribavirin is the only available antiviral drug for Paramyxoviridae infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3_21" ref-type="table">21.3</xref>). The efficacy of aerosolized ribavirin was variable in uncontrolled cohorts of patients with RSV-related pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34_21">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46_21">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132_21">132</xref>]. Again, the results must be interpreted with caution. Early ribavirin therapy, introduced before the onset of respiratory failure, seemed associated with lower mortality in the study by Whimbey et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132_21">132</xref>]. This observation led some authors to evaluate pre-emptive ribavirin therapy, characterised by ribavirin treatment of RSV URTI to prevent progression to pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133_21">133</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134_21">134</xref>]. The study by Boeckh et al. is the only randomised controlled trial evaluating pre-emptive ribavirin therapy in patients with RSV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133_21">133</xref>]. Unfortunately, the trial did not enrol a sufficient number of patients to produce conclusions. Intravenous ribavirin has also been evaluated and found unhelpful [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29_21">29</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135_21">135</xref>]. Combining ribavirin with intravenous immunoglobulins or RSV-specific immunoglobulins produced variable levels of efficacy in cohort studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35_21">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132_21">132</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136_21">136</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137_21">137</xref>]. Palivizumab, an RSV-specific monoclonal antibody, was evaluated only in a small cohort [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138_21">138</xref>].
