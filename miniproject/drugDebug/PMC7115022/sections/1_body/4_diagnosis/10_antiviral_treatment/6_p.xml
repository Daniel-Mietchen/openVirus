<p>No controlled randomised study has evaluated the treatment of adenoviral disease in patients with HM. Ribavirin and cidofovir have been suggested for the treatment of adenoviral infections, but only uncontrolled cohort studies are available to support their use. Intravenous ribavirin therapy failed to demonstrate benefits in available studies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142_21">142</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147_21">147</xref>]. Cidofovir therapy (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3_21" ref-type="table">21.3</xref>) seemed to result in better outcomes in small, uncontrolled series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148_21">148</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153_21">153</xref>]. Ganciclovir and antiretroviral drugs, such as zalcitabine, alovudine, and stavudine, exhibit in vitro activity against adenoviruses, but have not been specifically evaluated in clinical settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95_21">95</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154_21">154</xref>]. Considering the lack of specific antiviral drugs, decreasing the level of immunosuppression seems to be a rational treatment approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155_21">155</xref>]. T-cell therapy has also been reported in some small series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155_21">155</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156_21">156</xref>]. Early cidofovir treatment seems associated with a better outcome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151_21">151</xref>]. Weekly PCR screening for adenovirus viraemia has been suggested to guide pre-emptive cidofovir therapy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91_21">91</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94_21">94</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153_21">153</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157_21">157</xref>]. The exact threshold above which pre-emptive cidofovir therapy should be initiated is unknown. Randomised controlled trials are needed to better define the optimal viraemia threshold for antiviral therapy and to evaluate the benefits from this treatment.
