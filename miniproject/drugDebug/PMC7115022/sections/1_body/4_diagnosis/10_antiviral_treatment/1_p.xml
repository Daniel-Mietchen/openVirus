<p>A chapter from Dr. Sandherr is dedicated to antiviral therapy in this book. Regarding common viruses, we will briefly describe available treatments on influenza and RSV. Two classes of antiviral drugs are available for the treatment of influenza: M2 ion channel inhibitors and neuraminidase inhibitors. The M2 ion channel inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine, act by inhibiting the M2 protein needed for viral RNA release within the host cells. They are active only against influenza A strains. Their clinical effect is limited, being not significantly different from that of a placebo [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121_21">121</xref>], and is further hampered by the worldwide emergence of resistant influenza A strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122_21">122</xref>]. The neuraminidase inhibitors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3_21" ref-type="table">21.3</xref>), oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir, are sialic acid analogues that competitively inhibit the influenza neuraminidase. Randomised controlled trials showed moderate decreases in symptom intensity and duration with both drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123_21">123</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125_21">125</xref>]. Neuraminidase inhibitors may also limit bacterial super-infection of the lungs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125_21">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126_21">126</xref>]. Early administration of these drugs seems mandatory to obtain a clinical benefit [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127_21">127</xref>]. A more recent cohort study suggested a diminution of 15-day mortality with neuraminidase inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128_21">128</xref>]. This result must be interpreted with caution, especially given the study design. There is growing concern about the emergence of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129_21">129</xref>]. This phenomenon is not surprising given the high mutation rate in the influenza genome. It should lead clinicians to reconsider the indications of neuraminidase inhibitors and their use as monotherapy to treat influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130_21">130</xref>]. No randomised controlled trials have evaluated the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in patients with HM. The apparently lower mortality in descriptive cohort studies compared with historical studies must be interpreted with caution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33_21">33</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35_21">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131_21">131</xref>]. Many of the patients in these cohorts had bacterial and fungal co-infections, whose specific treatment probably contributed to decreasing mortality. Furthermore, the decision to treat patients was left to clinician discretion, which may have introduced a bias toward selection of patients with greater disease severity. Given both the absence of strong evidence supporting beneficial effects of neuraminidase inhibitor therapy and the rapid emergence of resistant strains, we believe that neuraminidase inhibitor therapy cannot be recommended for HM patients with influenza. Randomised controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy, safety, and ecological impact of neuraminidase inhibitors in these patients.
