<p>Few data are available on the exhaustive and sensitive detection of respiratory viruses in HM patients. Recent data show that using molecular assays increases the virus detection rate twofold compared to cultures and fourfold compared to immunofluorescence staining [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30_21">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65_21">65</xref>]. These data emphasise the need for prospective studies of the molecular detection of respiratory viruses to elucidate factors associated with symptomatic or asymptomatic respiratory viral infection and to help in the interpretation of positive assays in HM patients.
