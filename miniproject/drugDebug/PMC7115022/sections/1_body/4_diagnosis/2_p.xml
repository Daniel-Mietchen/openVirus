<p>High-quality clinical specimens are needed to ensure the accurate detection of respiratory viruses. Indeed, respiratory virus detection requires a large number of epithelial cells, since viruses are intracellular pathogens. Nasopharyngeal aspirates and nasopharyngeal washes are recognised to be superior to other sample types for detecting respiratory viruses [

Because the collection process is unpleasant and time-consuming, causes patient discomfort, and requires a suction device, flocked swabs were recently introduced for respiratory sample collection. Flocked swabs were found to improve the collection and release of epithelial cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106_21">106</xref>], and were recently recommended for the diagnosis of the new pandemic H1N1 influenza strain. The number of cells collected is lower with flocked swabs than with nasopharyngeal aspirates, but seems sufficient for respiratory virus detection by immunofluorescence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105_21">105</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106_21">106</xref>]. Flocked swab collection is sensitive, specific, easy to use, and better tolerated by patients, and may therefore constitute a good alternative to nasopharyngeal aspiration. Because most respiratory viruses have high replication rates in the upper respiratory tract, nasopharyngeal secretions are usually sufficient to diagnose respiratory viral infections. However, asymptomatic respiratory virus shedding in the upper respiratory tract may occur even in immunocompromised patients, and URTI may be followed by LRTI, particularly during influenza infections. Thus, virus detection in lungs via bronchoalveolar lavage may be useful to assess the causative role for the virus.
