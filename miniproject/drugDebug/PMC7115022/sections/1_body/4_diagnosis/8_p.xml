<p>Although molecular assays, particularly RT-PCR, provide same-day results, they require a nucleic acid extraction step. This step increases the time to results compared to antigen detection by fluorescent staining. Molecular assays should be performed as often as possible to improve patient care by shortening the hospital stay, curtailing or preventing antibiotic therapy, preventing nosocomial spread, and allowing specific antiviral therapy. Therefore, and given the cost of the equipment needed (RT-PCR machine, sequencer, luminex, nucleic acid extractor, DNA chip reader, mass spectrometer), molecular assays will probably be chiefly performed in laboratories receiving large numbers of samples per day.</p>
