<p>More recently introduced techniques can detect up to 20 targets in one or two tubes. These include the four techniques detailed below. 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Low-density micro-array</italic> based on cDNA spots that are immobilised on a polymer-coated slide and that hybridise with specific DNA sequences previously amplified from the sample using PCR. Hybridisation is detected based on the production of an insoluble product on the microarray at the sites where amplified DNA products are captured by the probes [

  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Multiplex detection based on Luminex</italic> technology. The PCR products are coupled with spectrally distinct fluorescence-labelled micro-beads, which are detected by flow cytometry [

   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)</italic> involves specific viral amplification followed by amplification after hybridisation and binding of virus-specific probes to the PCR product. Identification is accomplished by PCR fragment size analysis using gel electrophoresis methods [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117_21">117</xref>, 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118_21">118</xref>].
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Mass spectrometry</italic> assays for respiratory virus detection are based on the analysis of base compositions in RT-PCR amplicons [
