<p>Nucleic acid amplification tests have been proven to be rapid, very sensitive, and specific. The early tests, including PCR, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), and real-time PCR assays, were developed in monoplex format. Despite the gain in sensitivity and the ability to test for most respiratory viruses, the need to carry out as many PCR tests as targets has limited the use of this method. None of the current PCR assays has sufficiently high throughput to handle large numbers of samples containing multiple targets. Over the last few years, assays have been introduced in multiplex format. Different technologies have been used. In addition, sensitivities may be lower compared to monoplex real-time RT-PCR. Multiplex PCR procedures are difficult to optimise, because each amplification target corresponds to a set of primers characterized by a unique combination of optimal annealing conditions. Multiple primers included in a single tube may also result in primer-primer interference and in nonspecific nucleic acid amplification.</p>
