<p>The field of immune-mediated cancer treatment has been greatly expanded by the development and use of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) as antitumor therapy. Importantly, the spectrum of malignant diseases that has demonstrated response to anti-PD-1 directed agents and to the combination of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 directed agents, as well as combinations of anti-PD-1 agents and antiangiogenesis directed agents continues to broaden the potential use of these approaches. Some of these tumors are associated with viral-mediated oncogenesis, which may enhance susceptibility to viral-mediated or immune-mediated injury. Numerous trials are ongoing globally to further develop this area of clinical and translational research.</p>
