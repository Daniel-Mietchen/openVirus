<p>Now, in this issue, Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic> report a large retrospective safety evaluation of cancer patients (multiple tumor types) with HBV surface antigen expression, undergoing PD-1 inhibition therapy, to assess the rate of HBV reactivation.
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Their study involved 114 patients with known HBV infection and with serial measurements of HBV serological and viremic status. Diagnoses included 24% hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 8% lymphoma, and 68% others (including many tumor types known responsive to CPIs). One-third of patients had detectable HBV DNA and all such patients received antiviral prophylaxis during CPI treatment. None developed HBV reactivation. Importantly, of HBV surface antigen positive patients with undetectable HBV DNA, only 70% received prophylactic antiviral therapy, and among those without antiviral prophylaxis, six developed HBV reactivation during CPI treatment. All six subsequently achieved undetectable HBV DNA levels after a median of 3.5 weeks of antiviral therapy. There was no significant correlation with tumor type and HBV reactivation. The primary risk factor for reactivation was lack of antiviral prophylaxis.
