<p>Bearing in mind that monocytes and macrophages can act as Trojan Horses for all members of the lentivus family (thus inducing the entry of HIV into its sanctuaries), using the migratory ability of these cells has been proposed in order to carry the antiretroviral drugs to the central nervous system [
 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In particular, the idea of formulating nanoparticles loaded with an antiretroviral drug has been developed in order to obtain their efficient takeup by macrophages, that following intravenous administration, should migrate to the HIV-infected tissues and release the antiretroviral drug. In this regard, it has been reported that indinavir (IDV)-loaded nanoparticles, obtained by coating an IDV suspension, prepared by high-pressure homogenization, with Lipoid E80, were efficiently uptaken by virus infected macrophages. The loaded nanoparticles were able to suppress virus replication for a long period of time in the macrophages [
