<p>It is known that exposure to xenobiotic drug substrates can enhance the expression of active efflux transporters on brain microvascular endothelial cells. As an example, it has recently been reported that the concomitant exposition of primary human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVEC) to HIV-1 and saquinavir induces an increased MDR-1-mediated drug efflux [
