 <xref rid="pharmaceutics-10-00039-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> reports the AET subtypes currently known to interact with antiviral drugs. It is evidenced that the clinically approved PIs, saquinavir, ritonavir, and lopinavir, are substrates of both P-gp and MRP-1 [

 <xref rid="B42-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. The antiviral drugs amprenavir, nelfinavir, indinavir (PIs), and abacavir (NRTI) are known as P-gp substrates [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], whereas zidovudine and didanosine appear to be transported by MRP-4 and MRP-5 [

 <xref rid="B38-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Finally, zidovudine, lamivudine, abacavir, zalcitabine, stavudine, and efavirenz appear as BCRP substrates [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], whereas ritonavir, saquinavir, and nelfinavir are known as inhibitors of this transporter [
 <xref rid="B34-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Maraviroc, a CCR5 inhibitor, is suggested to be a P-gp substrate [

 <xref rid="B47-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], whereas the IN dolutegravir appears as a P-gp and BRCP substrate [
 <xref rid="B20-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Cyclosporine-A, verapamil, and mefloquine are P-gp inhibitors; some of them have been used to define an MDR-1-specific efflux of antiviral drugs [
