<p>The substrates of P-gp are amphipatic cations and organic compounds whose molecular weights range from 200 to almost 1900 Da [
 <xref rid="B24-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], so P-gp shows a broad substrate spectrum. MRPs transport hydrophilic anion compounds or large molecules (MRP-1) [
 <xref rid="B39-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] or small polar compounds (for example, nucleosides), cyclic nucleotides, and nucleoside analogues (MRP-4, MRP-5) [
 <xref rid="B40-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The substrate specificity of BCRP appears similar to that of P-gp [
 <xref rid="B27-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
