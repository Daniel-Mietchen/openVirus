<p>Many devices for nasal administration are known, even if not all appear to be suitable for specific deposition of drug amounts in the olfactory region of the nasal cavity. As an example, spray pumps, drops and syringes with tubes, or a vortical flow atomizer are not recommended for nose-to-brain delivery of drugs, whereas appropriate pressurized metered dose inhalers are designed for this purpose. Recently, a bidirectional breath-powered nasal delivery platform was proposed in order to optimize the deposition of drugs in the nasal cavity and nose-to-brain delivery while overcoming unwanted pulmonary distribution [

Concerning innovative devices for the nasal administration of antiviral drugs, a pressurized olfactory delivery (POD) aerosol was developed in order to induce the deposition of a greater amount of drugs into the olfactory region of the nasal cavity in rats [
 <xref rid="B88-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Two model drugs, mannitol and relfinavir, were chosen in order to compare their brain and blood levels after nasal administration of nose drops in rats, which deposited primarily on the respiratory region, or after deposition primarily on their olfactory region with a POD. The cortex-to-blood ratio increased about 4- and 16-fold for mannitol and relfinavir, respectively, with POD administrations compared to those with nose drops. This result confirms that an efficient and selective deposition of drugs on the olfactory region of the nasal cavity induces efficacious direct nose-to-brain transport [
