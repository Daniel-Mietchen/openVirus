<p>Polymeric mucoadhesive hydrogels based on PVP or chitosan have been studied as nasal delivery formulations for acyclovir. In particular, the muco-adhesivity was studied in the nasal mucosal tissue of sheep by evaluating the force required to detach the formulations from the mucosa. The most mucoadhesive formulations were shown to be chitosan gel and PVP in the presence of PRG 600. Higher release rates were evidenced by PVP compared to chitosan gels [
