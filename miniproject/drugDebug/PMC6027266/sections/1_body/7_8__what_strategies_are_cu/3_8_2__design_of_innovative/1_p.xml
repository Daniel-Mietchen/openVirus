<p>Currently, the clinical nasal formulations involving antiviral effects appear to be focused on vaccines [

 <xref rid="B92-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Innovative formulations able to target antiviral drugs in the CNS are therefore needed. Regarding studies on innovative nasal formulations, the development of antiretroviral efavirenz (EFV)-loaded nanoparticles based on poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL), Eudragit

 <xref rid="B93-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. The nanoparticles were obtained by nanoprecipitation or emulsion/solvent diffusion/evaporation, and nanoprecipitation was shown to result in smaller particles and narrower size distribution patterns, even if all of the systems displayed a remarkably high encapsulation efficiency and drug payload regardless of the polymer composition and the production technique. The poly(methacrylate)’s presence in formulation procedures allowed for a fine tuning of the particle size and the release kinetics; moreover, the incorporation of poly(methacrylate) induced strongly positive Z-potential values of the nanoparticles [
 <xref rid="B93-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. This property should induce mucoadesive properties in the nanoparticles with a likely improvement in their residence time in contact with the nasal mucosa. It is indeed well-known that the presence of positive charges induces mucoadhesive properties in polymers, since the mucosal membranes are characterized by the presence of negatively charged species [
