<p>New nasal formulations of antiviral drugs have been administered in vivo in order to evaluate drug absorption in the central nervous system. Among these, an intranasal nano-emulsion based on the hydrophobic oil Capmul MCM, in the presence of Tween 80 and PEG 400 as surfactant and co-surfactant, respectively, was developed for brain targeting of saquinavir mesylate. This type of formulation was able to induce a higher concentration of the drug in the brain after intranasal administration compared to saquinavir amounts obtained after intravenous administration of plain drug suspension. In particular, the drug targeting efficacy (DTE) and nose-to-brain drug direct transport percentage (DTP) values obtained by nasal administration of the nano-emulsion were 2919 and 97, respectively, indicating the efficacy of this formulation in promoting the nose-to-brain delivery of saquinavir mesylate [
