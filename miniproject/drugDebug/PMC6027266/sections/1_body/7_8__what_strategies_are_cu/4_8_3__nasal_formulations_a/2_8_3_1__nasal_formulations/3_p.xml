<p>A thermoreversible gel, based on Poloxamer 407 (thermoreversible gelling agent) and n-tridecyl-
 <italic>Î²</italic>-
 <sc>d</sc>-maltoside (permeation enhancer), was prepared as a nasal formulation of AZT. Doses of 1 mg/kg AZT nasally administered to rabbits led to sensibly higher CSF concentrations of AZT than those obtained by intravenous administration. In particular, the drug targeting efficacy (DTE) and nose-to-brain drug direct transport percentage (DTP) values were 11.51 and 99.27, respectively. Moreover, following the nasal administration of the thermoreversible gel, the CSF/plasma ratio values of AZT were &gt;1 and showed DTE and DTP values of 139.15 and 99.48, respectively [
