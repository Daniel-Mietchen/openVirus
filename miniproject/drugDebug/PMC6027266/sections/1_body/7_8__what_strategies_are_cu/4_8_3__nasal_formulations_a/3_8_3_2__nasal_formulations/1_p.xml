<p>Recently, the prodrug UDCA-AZT, obtained by means of ester conjugation of zidovudine with ursodeoxycholic acid [
 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], was loaded in micro-particulate nasal formulations. This prodrug is characterized by its ability to elude the AET systems [
 <xref rid="B71-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>], so it appears to be promising in order to prolong its permanence upon targeting in the central nervous system and to permeate in its macrophages where the AZT activity is required against HIV. We have indeed demonstrated that UDCA-AZT is able to permeate and remain in murine macrophages with an efficiency twenty times higher than that of AZT [
