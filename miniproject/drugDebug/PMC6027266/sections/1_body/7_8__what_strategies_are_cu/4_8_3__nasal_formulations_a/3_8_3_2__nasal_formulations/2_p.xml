<p>Microparticles based on stearic acid were loaded with UDCA-AZT and nasally administered to rats in doses of 800 µg/Kg. The microparticles induced a significant increase of the dissolution rate of the free prodrug, allowing for an efficient uptake in the CSF of rats, but not in the bloodstream, demonstrating the existence of a direct nose—CNS pathway for UDCA-AZT. In the presence of chitosan, the CSF prodrug uptake induced by the stearic acid microparticles increased six times, up to 1.5 µg/mL within 150 min after nasal administration [

Taking into account chitosan’s ability to promote UDCA-AZT uptake in the CNS after nasal administration, a new nasal formulation was prepared where the prodrug was encapsulated in chitosan chloride microparticles. In this case too, a selective uptake of UDCA-AZT was obtained, showing concentrations of up to 3 µg/mL in the CSF, where the prodrug can act as an AZT carrier in macrophages [
