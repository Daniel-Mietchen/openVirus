<p>Very recently, it has been demonstrated that insulin treatment of HIV-infected microglia cultures induces a reduction in viral replication as evidenced by the suppression of supernatant HIV-1 p24 levels and by the reduction of CXCL10 and IL-6 transcript levels. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that primary human neurons treated with insulin prevent HIV-1 Vpr-mediated cell process retraction and death. Bearing these aspects in mind, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected animals were treated by intranasal insulin and showed reduced CXCL10, IL-6, and FIV RNA levels in brain in comparison with control infected animals. Moreover, nasal administration of insulin allowed for the improvement of neurobehavioral performance in FIV-infected animals, such as motor and memory performances [
