<p>In order to obtain the uptake of antiviral drugs in the central nervous system, the nasal approach would appear to be a promising strategy, as it is potentially able to deliver drugs directly into the CNS from the nasal cavity [
 <xref rid="B77-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Intranasal delivery was indeed discovered about 30 years ago as a new method for delivery of drugs to the CNS [
 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Currently, it is well-known that after nasal application, a drug-escaping mucociliary clearance and enzymatic degradation can permeate not only into the bloodstream, but also into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or the brain tissue across the olfactory region or via the trigeminal pathway of the nasal cavity [
 <xref rid="B79-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="B80-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. There are three known pathways allowing the drug access to the brain or CSF from the nasal cavity: (i) the olfactory pathway (direct paracellular or transcellular transport via the olfactory neurones or olfactory epithelial cells); (ii) the trigeminal pathway (transport via trigeminal nerves); and (iii) the systemic pathway (the drug is absorbed into the bloodstream, then it has the ability to cross the BBB) [
 <xref rid="B81-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The last of these pathways appears to have the poorest chances of allowing antiviral drugs access to the central nervous system, since most of them are substrates of the AET systems expressed in the BBB. In contrast, the olfactory and trigeminal pathways seem to offer better chances of the antiviral drugs being targeted in the brain. It is indeed known that drug delivery from the nose to the CNS along these pathways can occur within a few minutes by an extracellular route without binding to any receptor or undergoing axonal transport [
 <xref rid="B82-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Some drugs can be axonally transported into the brain after endocytosis, but this process generally requires a few days [
 <xref rid="B74-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The olfactory neural pathway allows for distribution of the drugs in the olfactory bulb, anterior olfactory nucleus, frontal cortex, and hippocampus (rostral brain structures); the trigeminal pathway allows for drug distribution in the upper cervical spinal cord, midbrain, pons, and hypothalamus (caudal brain structures) [
