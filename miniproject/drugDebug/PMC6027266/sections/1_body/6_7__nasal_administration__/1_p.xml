<p>Receptor-mediated transportation, transporter-mediated transport, adsorptive-mediated transportation, or temporarily increased BBB permeability represent several important strategies currently studied in order to obtain the uptake of drugs in the CNS. Receptor-mediated transportation is based on the binding of specific receptors of BBB by ligands able to mediate their internalization into cells. This strategy is often related to high costs of formulation [
