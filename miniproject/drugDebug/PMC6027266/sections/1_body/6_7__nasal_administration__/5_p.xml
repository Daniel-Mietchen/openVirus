<p>The nasal administration of a water solution of ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue able to inhibit the canine distemper virus (CDV) and also indicated for treatment of hepatitis C [
 <xref rid="B84-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>], allowed investigators to obtain drug concentrations in the olfactory bulb of rats similar to those obtained after intravenous administration, whereas the nasal administration of the raw solid drug, using a specific Dry-Powder Insufflator designed to produce a puff of fine powder, led to significantly higher levels [
 <xref rid="B85-pharmaceutics-10-00039" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This result allows us to hypothesize that formulations able to increase the contact between the drug and olfactory nasal mucosa may induce an enhancement of drug bioavailability in the brain. Very recently, a powder formulation of agglomerates constituted by micronized ribavirin and α-cyclodextrin spray-dried microparticles was nasally administered to rats. Ribavirin accumulation in the brain obtained by this formulation was higher than that obtained by nasal administration of ribavirin-micronized powder in the absence of α-cyclodextrin microparticles able to induce penetration-enhancing properties [
