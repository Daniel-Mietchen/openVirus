<p>It is currently well-known that several viruses can have important neurotropic effects in infected bodies: as an example, Canine Distemper Virus (CDV) and Measles Virus (MV) are known to cause demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in dogs and humans, respectively; and Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus (EEEV) is able to induce death or long-lasting and severe neurological sequelae in humans [
