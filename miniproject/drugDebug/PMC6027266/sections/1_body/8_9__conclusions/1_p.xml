<p>We have evidenced that several viruses can easily infect the central nervous system, but even if numerous antiviral therapies can be efficacious at peripheral levels, they appear to be inefficacious at the central level, since the antiviral drug substrates of the active efflux transporters (AET) are expressed by the BBB and macrophages. Exposure of the body to antiviral drugs can further increase the expression of these transporters with a consequent further reduction in the antiviral efficacy in the central nervous system. In order to counteract this phenomenon, the use of AET inhibitors is not allowed in clinical trials, because these inhibitors induce severe unwanted effects when not selectively targeted in specific action sites of drugs. As a consequence, innovative devices and formulations are required in order to selectively target the antiviral drugs and, possibly, the AET inhibitors in the CNS. Several prodrugs of antiviral drugs appear able to inhibit or elude the AET systems, so they would appear to be interesting substrates for innovative formulations. The nasal approach seems to offer a direct nose-to-brain pathway for antiviral drugs. Appropriate devices and formulations, implemented with absorption enhancers, have been designed and administered in order to target the antiviral drugs or their prodrugs in the central nervous system. The results obtained from these studies indicate that the “nasal” strategy is a promising means to promote the efficacy of antiviral therapies against the neurotoxicity of viruses.</p>
