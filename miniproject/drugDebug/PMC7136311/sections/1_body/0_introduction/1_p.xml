<p id="Par5">Perinatal or intrauterine transmission is the major risk of transmission of HBV in its area of high endemicity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since the last decades, hepatitis B vaccination and immunoglobulin administration provided at birth have been implemented to prevent vertical transmission of HBV [
