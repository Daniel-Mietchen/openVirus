<p id="Par6">Lamivudine (LAM), telbivudine (LDT), and tenofovir (TDF) are the oral anti-HBV drugs approved by FDA. All agents have been well investigated and show effective and safe in reducing the risk of HBV MTCT if pregnant female were carrying high viral load of HBV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Emerging data suggest the application of antiviral therapy in the third trimester is able to prevent immunoprophylaxis failure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] to a great extent. Currently, only scarce studies showed the rates of MTCT appeared similar under the utilization of agents during second and third trimester [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], but the events of HBV transmission were still reported even if their mothers obtained a treatment in late pregnancy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The well efficacy and safety in preventing MTCT have been clearly investigated among highly viremic HBV of mothers that started antiviral therapy in the first or second trimesters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Therefore, it’s necessary to identify a more effective and safe period for initiating antiviral treatment (AVT) in pregnancy to completely prevent HBV transmission.
