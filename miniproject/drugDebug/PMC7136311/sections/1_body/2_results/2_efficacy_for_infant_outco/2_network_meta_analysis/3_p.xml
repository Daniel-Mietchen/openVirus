<p id="Par17">To reveal whether giving agents in early or middle pregnancy produce a potential impact on the bias of meta-analysis, subgroup analysis demonstrated that timing of treatment in early pregnancy (32 non-RCTs: RR 0.0076; 95% CI 2.1E−04 to 0.055), middle pregnancy (32 non-RCTs: RR 0.0015; 95% CI 3.7E−05 to − 0.03) and late pregnancy (32 non-RCTs: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.034 to 0.20) all had statistically significant reduction in MTCT at 6–12 months after delivery than untreated mothers. The network and forest plots were provided in FigS. S7 and

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) on decreasing HBV MTCT. However, AVT starting during the second trimester attached much more effect on preventing HBV vertical transmission than that in the third trimester (32 non-RCTs: 0.015; 95% CI 4.1E−04 to − 0.13, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>). Treatments ranking probabilities, from largest to smallest, were as follows: second trimester, first trimester, third trimester, control (Fig. S8).
