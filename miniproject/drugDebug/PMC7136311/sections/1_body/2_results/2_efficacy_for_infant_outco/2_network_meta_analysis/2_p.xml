<p id="Par16">Therefore, we continued to conduct the Bayesian network meta-analysis specially non-RCTs to obtain available GRAD evidence. The network and forest plots were provided in Figs. S6 and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>. As compared with the control group, pregnant female that received AVT either prior third trimester (32 non-RCTs: RR 0.0034; 95% CI 3.1E−04 to − 0.014) or in the third trimester (32 non-RCTs: RR 0.10; 95% CI 0.035 to 0.21) got an improvement in preventing MTCT (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). The treatment applied in early-middle pregnancy obtained superior efficacy to that intervention starting in late pregnancy (32 non-RCTs: RR 0.033; 95% CI 0.0033 to 0.16, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). We further synthesized multiple RCTs and non-RCTs for pooled analysis to evaluate the potential impact of RCTs on the results. The pooled analysis showed similar RR and 95% CI based on the network meta-analysis of pure non-RCTs (Fig.
