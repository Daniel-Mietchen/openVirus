<p id="Par13">Comparing with control group, conducting any antiviral drugs in early-middle pregnancy (21 non-RCTs; RR 0.06; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.10, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a) and late pregnancy (21 non-RCTs: RR 0.19; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.32, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b) were both associated with reduced the likelihood of MTCT, based on calculated ratio of HBsAg serum positivity or/and HBV DNA seropositivity for infants at 6–12 months after delivery. AVT used prior late pregnancy although didn’t have significant difference but tended to have in decreasing the rate of HBV vertical transmission, as compared with the treatment administrated in late pregnancy (RR, 0.25; 95% CI 0.03 to 2.32, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>c). Utilization of any antiviral agents prior gestation 28 week and during 28–32 week reduced the ratio of infected infants by 10.8% and 7.3%, respectively, compared to control. AVT during earlier trimester appeared to reduce the risk by 3.5% over the administration in late pregnancy. This means that the probability of AVT before the third trimester may be more effective in preventing MTCT. The quality of evidence was low and rated down due to the risk of bias in non-RCTs. When studies were pooled, there was no evidence of publication bias or other small-study effects (Fig. S1a, b), with Egger’s test
