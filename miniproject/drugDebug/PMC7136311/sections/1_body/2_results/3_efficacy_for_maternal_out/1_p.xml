<p id="Par19">We focused on the rate of HBV DNA suppression, HBeAg seroconvension and ALT normalization as the maternal efficacy outcomes. The forest plot for the Bayesian network meta-analysis was provided in Fig. S10. Comparing with the untreated group, intervening in earlier and late pregnancy both showed the significance of HBV DNA suppression, HBeAg seroconvension and ALT normalization. Comparing with the AVT initiated in late pregnancy, starting treatment in early-middle pregnancy had similar significant efficacy in HBV DNA suppressions (16 non-RCTs: RR 1.3; 95% CI 0.36 to 4.4), and HBeAg seroconversion (6 non-RCTs: RR 0.81; 95% CI 0.12 to 6.4). However, applying AVT in early-middle pregnancy suggested a better improvement in ALT normalization (11 non-RCTs: RR, 1.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3) than in late pregnancy.</p>
