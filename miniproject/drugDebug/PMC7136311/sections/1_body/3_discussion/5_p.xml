<p id="Par27">Several systematic reviews and meta-analysis have been performed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of all the FDA-recommended antiviral agents including LAM, LDT and TDF in interrupting MTCT of HBV. Brown et al. recommended the use of these agents in female who are HBeAg positive and high level of HBV DNA in the third trimester to prevent MTCT [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Major of them were based on the pair-wised meta-analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Therefore, different from existing studies, our network analysis has some following remarkable characteristics. Firstly, conventional meta-analysis usually focused on pair-wised comparisons of two therapeutic measures, most of which contained controlled and untreated groups. The network meta-analysis was able to construct two or more interventions into a network structure, enabling overall computation of relative effectiveness from both direct one-to-one and indirect comparison with multiple interventions. Second, previous meta-analyses used the frequency method, which might reduce the accuracy of RR, to estimate relative risk for the rare events of HBV MTCT. Bayesian method and ranked probabilities were suitable to provide more precise RR for the rare event of MTCT. However, our analysis has some limitations. First, all the three RCTs were designed for pregnant patients during the third trimester, and none of RCTs were conducted for patients before the third trimester. No head-to-head RCTs identified the efficacy of antiviral drugs started among different trimesters that our analysis mainly coming from non-RCTs cannot comprehensively reflect antiviral efficacy and lower down the grade evidence of observation in the real-world. As most of the guidelines recommend starting AVT in the third trimester, so it is unethical to perform RCTs to compare early treatment during pregnancy with no treatment group in future. In addition, due to the rare event of HBV MTCT after antiviral therapy during pregnancy, conducting a randomized trial comparing antiviral therapy initiated in the second vs. third trimester will be logistically difficult (huge sample size required). Network meta-analysis could collect direct and indirect evidence of non-RCTs to reduce statistical power and uncertainty on ranking results, and be effectively closed to the facts in the real world. Second, because most of non-RCTs provided different intervals of timing for treatments, the quality of data on this crucial question was low because exact initial timing of antiviral therapy was not specified or the timing was provided as a wide range in many studies. Third, the distributions of patients and disease background exist with selective bias based on non-randomized studies. In addition, some studies were conducted many years ago that the definition of MTCT of HBV was mainly based on HBsAg seropositivity at 6Â months after delivery and subdata (e.g. maternal and infant outcomes) were not completely collected. We cannot draw a statistically meaningful conclusion when we analyze those safety data due to the limitation of information.
