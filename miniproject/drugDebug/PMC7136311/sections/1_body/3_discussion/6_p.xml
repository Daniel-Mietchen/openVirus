<p id="Par28">In summary, this network meta-analysis suggests AVT administered in each trimester from first to the second trimester appeared superior to prevent MTCT of HBV than the third trimester, for HBeAg positive pregnant mothers with high viral loads (&gt; 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> IU/mL). The limited safety data regarded to maternal and infant outcomes demonstrated no significant increased risk of issues. Large comparative RCTs, particularly of the utilization of AVT in early pregnancy or/and the head-to-head trials are warranted to further establish optimum initial timing to completely block HBV MTCT.
