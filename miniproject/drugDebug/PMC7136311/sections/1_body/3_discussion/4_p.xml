<p id="Par26">High viral load is independently associated with the high risk of HBV MTCT. For mothers at high risk, initiating MTCT in middle pregnancy, at least, can obtain adequate time to suppress the level of HBV DNA. In addition, the earlier administration is capable to control mothers’ liver function and decrease the risk of viral breakthrough during pregnancy. Current clinical guidelines reveal a range of HBV cutoff to prevent HBV transmission from 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> IU/mL [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Amongst major studies, pregnant mothers were enrolled due to the high level of HBV DNA level (HBV DNA &gt; 6 log IU/mL). The average HBV DNA level was 7.074 (6.986, 7.161) log
 <sub>10</sub> IU/mL calculated by a random effect model (base characteristics of HBV DNA found in the Supplementary Material). However, we were unable to evaluate the effect on decreasing MTCT among the maternal HBV DNA level below 2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> IU/mL due to the lack of researches. In addition, among the HBeAg positive pregnant female received AVT treatment, initiation in middle pregnancy indicated an improved effect on reducing MTCT than initiation in late pregnancy. Accordingly, antiviral therapy should be at least provided to HBeAg positive pregnant mothers with high viral loads (&gt; 2 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> IU/mL).
