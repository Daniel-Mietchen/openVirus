<p id="Par25">This network meta-analysis confirmed that administration of antiviral agents in early-middle pregnancy was associated with lower MTCT of HBV than the use in late pregnancy. LDT and TDF had a trend of prior use on reducing MTCT of HBV. Furthermore, starting treatment prior gestation 28Â weeks was associated with enhancement of maternal ALT normalization at delivery. No significant differences in safety outcomes for both mothers and infants were found according to comparison with the treatment provided in the third trimester and control group.</p>
