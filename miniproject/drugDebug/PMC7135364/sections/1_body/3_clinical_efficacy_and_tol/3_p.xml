<p id="para0010">According to the previous rhesus monkey model of Ebola virus infection, an intravenous (i.v.) 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir could lead to a lasting level of active triphosphate form in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), &gt;10 Î¼M, for at least 24 h 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and such data may be valuable in the same animal species with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although in the animal study the plasma half-life of remdesivir was short (0.39 h), remdesivir was rapidly distributed into PBMCs, converted into its active form within 2 h post-infusion, and had an intracellular half-life of 14 h. In the absence of any human pharmacokinetic information, such data from rhesus monkeys indicate that parenteral daily dosing of remdesivir may achieve sustained intracellular concentrations of nucleotide triphosphate, which are above its EC
 <sub>90</sub> for SARS-CoV-2. These in vitro and animal data provide preliminary evidence supporting the clinical potential of remdesivir for human infections caused by contemporary and emerging coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2.
