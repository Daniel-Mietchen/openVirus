<p id="para0005">The chemical formula of remdesivir, with a molecular mass of 602.6, is C
 <sub>27</sub>H
 <sub>35</sub>N
 <sub>6</sub>O
 <sub>8</sub>P. Remdesivir can be effectively metabolised to active nucleoside triphosphate in several human cell lines 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. An in vitro study has demonstrated that nucleoside triphosphate works as an incorporation competitor with adenosine triphosphate, confuses viral RdRp, acts as a delayed RNA chain terminator against Ebola virus

 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recently, the antiviral activity of remdesivir was demonstrated at the stage after virus entry into Vero E6 cells, supporting its antiviral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue
