<p id="para0004">Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share only 82% RNA sequence identity, their RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) shares 96% sequence identity 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, drugs targeting viral RdRp proteins of SARS-CoV are likely to be effective for SARS-CoV-2. For the RdRp target in the genus 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, there are several potential drugs or compounds, including favipiravir, ribavirin, penciclovir, galidesivir, remdesivir, 6′-fluorinated aristeromycin analogues and acyclovir fleximer analogues

 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, has a similar structure to tenofovir alafenamide, which is a nucleotide analogue of adenosine 5-monophosphate with antiviral activity against hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It was developed by Gilead Science Inc. and has not been licensed or approved anywhere so far. Moreover, GS-441524 has been recommended for the treatment of cats with feline infectious peritonitis, which is uncommon but fatal and is caused by a feline coronavirus
