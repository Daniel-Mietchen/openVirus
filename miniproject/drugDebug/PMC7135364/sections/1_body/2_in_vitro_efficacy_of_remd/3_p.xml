<p id="para0007">In primary human airway epithelial cell culture, a biologically relevant in vitro model of pulmonary infection, remdesivir was shown to inhibit SARS-CoV [half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) = 0.069 μM] and MERS-CoV (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.074 μM) replication 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. In addition, remdesivir was effective against many human and zoonotic coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (

 <sub>50</sub> of remdesivir in Vero E6 cells was 0.77 μM and the EC
 <sub>90</sub> was 1.76 μM
