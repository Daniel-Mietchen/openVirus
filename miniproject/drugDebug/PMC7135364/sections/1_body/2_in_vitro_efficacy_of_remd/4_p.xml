<p id="para0008">Even before approval and clinical use, the concern of antiviral resistance against remdesivir has been studied. Using MHV as the tested coronavirus, two of three lineages of wild-type MHV in the presence of increased concentrations of GS-441524 were lost after 17 and 20 repeated passages, and only one lineage after 23 passages selected a low-level resistant mutant, conferring a 5.6-fold increase in the EC
 <sub>50</sub>
 <xref rid="bib0017" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Two amino acid substitutions (F467L and V553L) were noted in non-structural protein (nsp) 12, the RdRp of MHV, and also resulted in a 6-fold increase in the EC
 <sub>50</sub> in SARS-CoV. However, the remdesivir-resistant MHV with F476L and V553L mutations was outcompeted by wild-type MHV in the absence of GS-5734, suggestive of the effect of remdesivir resistance on decreased viral fitness. Of note, in the mouse model of SARS-CoV infection, the remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV-infected mice lost less weight and had a more evident decline in pulmonary viral loads by 4 days after infection than wild-type SARS-CoV-infected mice, indicative of attenuated pathogenicity of remdesivir-resistant SARS-CoV. The above findings indicate a high genetic barrier for remdesivir to develop resistance a well as decreased fitness and pathogenicity in remdesivir-resistant mutants, and further encourage the therapeutic potential of remdesivir in the treatment of newly emerging COVID-19.
