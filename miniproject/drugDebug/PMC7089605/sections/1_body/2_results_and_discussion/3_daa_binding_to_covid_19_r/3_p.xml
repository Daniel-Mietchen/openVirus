<p id="p0085">In order to check the possible reason for the differences in the binding energies, we examined the interaction complexes formed after docking by the aid of the PLIP web server. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows the formed interactions between the DAA drugs and COVID-19 RdRp after docking. The docking scores are listed under each complex to reflect the binding potency. Ligands are shown in orange sticks, while protein residues are in cyan stick representations labeled with its one-letter code. H-bonds are solid blue lines, while the dashed lines represent the hydrophobic interactions. Only one salt bridge (yellow spheres connected by a dashed line) is formed in the case of IDX-184 with D514, which is responsible for the increased stabilization of the formed complex, reflected on the docking score. The number of H-bonds for IDX-184, Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin are 11, 7, and 13, respectively. On the other hand, IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir both form metal interaction through the Mg
 <sup>+2</sup> with D652 (two interactions) and E702, respectively. This is another reason for the increased stabilization of the formed complexes for IDX-184 and Sofosbuvir. Additionally, Sofosbuvir formed two hydrophobic interactions with Y510 and D651 of the COVID-19 RdRp.
