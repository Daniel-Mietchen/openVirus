<p id="p0070">For COVID-19 RdRp the percent sequence identity against SARS, MERS, OC43, NL63, 229E, and HKU1 HCoV strains are 90.18%, 56.76%, 55.07%, 48.79%, 48.55%, and 48.16%, respectively. Therefore, the SARS HCoV RdRp is the closest strain to the COVID-19. The complete genome for Wuhan SARS-like HCoV has a sequence identity of 89.12% and 82.34% with Bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate 
 <italic>bat-SL-CoVZC45</italic> and SARS coronavirus 
 <italic>ZS-C</italic>, respectively. This information is important for drug designers to find a quick and potent solution against the newly emerged COVID-19 strain.
