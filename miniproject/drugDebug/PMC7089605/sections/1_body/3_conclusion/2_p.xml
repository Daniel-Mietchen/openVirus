<p id="p0095">The newly emerged coronavirus in Wuhan city in China has a health concern since the last outbreak of these types of viruses (SARS) in the year 2002â€“2003 in the same country leaving &gt;700 deaths and 8000 cases in hospitals. Besides, another outbreak in the Middle East region has an entirely different infection pattern (MERS) leaving &gt;800 deaths and 2500 hospitalizations. The present study aimed to test and suggest possible inhibitors, DAA drugs, currently in the market stop the infection immediately. Sofosbuvir, Ribavirin, and Remdisivir can be used against the new strain of coronavirus that emerged with promising results. GTP derivatives may be used as specific inhibitors against COVID-19.</p>
