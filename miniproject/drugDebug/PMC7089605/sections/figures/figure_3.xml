  <p>(A) The interactions that established after docking the DAA drugs IDX-184, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin against COVID-19 RdRp are presented. DAAs are in orange while the protein active site pocket in cyan sticks. H-bonds in solid blue lines while hydrophobic interactions are in dashed lines. Salt bridges are in yellow spheres connected by dashed lines. Its one-letter code labels RdRp residues, and the docking scores are listed under each complex. (B) The overall 3D structure complexes arranged as (A). Protein is represented in ribbon, and ligands are in sticks while the interacting residues of the RdRp are represented in colored lines. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
