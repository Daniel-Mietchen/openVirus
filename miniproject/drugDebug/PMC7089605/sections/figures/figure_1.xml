  <p>(A) Multiple sequence alignment of all the HCoV strains (229E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, MERS, SARS, and COVID-19) RdRp sequences. Red highlights indicate identical residues while yellow highlighted residues are less conserved. Secondary structures are represented at the top of the MSA for SARS RdRp (PDB ID: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0005" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>, chain A), while the surface accessibility is shown at the bottom (blue: highly accessible while white is buried). The black dashed rectangles mark active site aspartates while blue rectangles mark the residues lying in the 5 Å region surrounding the active aspartates. The alignment is made using the Clustal omega web server and represented by ESpript 3. (B) The newly emerged COVID-19 RdRp model built by Swiss Model in the green cartoon (right) and surface (left) representations. Two views of the polymerase at 180
   <sup>o</sup> rotation on the horizontal plane are shown (top and bottom). The active site aspartates are represented in red sticks for clarification (see the enlarged panel). (C) Ramachandran plot for the COVID-19 RdRp model. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
