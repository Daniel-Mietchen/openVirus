  <p>MPP and MP inhibition of HCV genotypes 1A, 1B, 2A and 3A NS3-4A proteases. NS3-4A protease activities were determined with FRET analyses using recombinant enzymes as described in methods. Each point is the mean Â± SEM of three to five determinations per point, normalized to percentages. Error bars were omitted from this figure to improve the clarity of the individual curves. Data were analyzed as shown in
