 <caption> Inhibition of mutant NS3-4A proteases by MPP. Mutant [V36M, T54A, or A156T] or wild-type (WT) NS3-4A recombinant proteases were assayed fluorometrically in the presence of various concentrations of ( A) ZnPP, ( B) CuPP, and ( C) MnPP as described in the methods. Each point is the mean Â± SEM of three to five determinations per point and normalized to percentages. Between-group comparisons were tested with a randomized block design for analysis of variance and F-test. </caption>
