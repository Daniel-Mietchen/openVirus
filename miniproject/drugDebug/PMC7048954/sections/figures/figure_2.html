 <caption> Porphyrin inhibition of HCV protease and HCV replication. ( A). NS3-4A protease activity was determined fluorometrically using genotype 1B recombinant NS3/4A enzyme throughout. Appropriate wavelengths for measurement of fluorescence emission were determined empirically for each porphyrin to avoid quenching and/or background interference fluorescence (see Table 1). Each point value is the mean ±SEM with 3–5 determinations per point. Statistically significant differences between IC 50 were ranked using Fischer’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test for multiple comparisons ( Table 1). For α = 0.01, LSD = 1.57. ( B). Log-phase Huh 5.15 NS replicons were treated for 48 hrs with various concentrations of porphyrin and HCV RNA then quantified using Real-Time comparative threshold (ΔC T) assay. Each point value is the mean ±SEM with 3–5 determinations per point. Statistical significant differences between EC 50 values were determined using Fischer’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) test for multiple comparisons ( Table 1). For α = 0.01; LSD = 1.83. ( C). Western Blots for HCV proteins after HCV infection of Huh 7.5 or Huh 5.15NS replicon cells. Log-phase, J6/JFH infected, Huh 7.5 cells (left panel) were treated with MPP (10 µM) for 48 hrs. Cells were then lysed and viral protein expression evaluated on WB as described in methods. Log-phase Huh 5.15NS replicons (right panel) were treated with indicated MPP (10 μM) for 24 hrs and WB analyses performed similarly. </caption>
