 <caption> MPP and MP inhibition of HCV genotypes 1A, 1B, 2A and 3A NS3-4A proteases. NS3-4A protease activities were determined with FRET analyses using recombinant enzymes as described in methods. Each point is the mean Â± SEM of three to five determinations per point, normalized to percentages. Error bars were omitted from this figure to improve the clarity of the individual curves. Data were analyzed as shown in Table 3A. ( A) CoPP inhibition of various genotypes. ( B) ZnPP and meso ZnP inhibition of HCV genotypes. ( C) SnPP and meso SnP inhibition of HCV genotypes. Between-group comparisons were tested with a randomized block design for analysis of variance and F-test ( Table 2). </caption>
