  <p>Inhibition of mutant NS3-4A proteases by MPP. Mutant [V36M, T54A, or A156T] or wild-type (WT) NS3-4A recombinant proteases were assayed fluorometrically in the presence of various concentrations of (
   <bold>A</bold>) ZnPP, (
   <bold>B</bold>) CuPP, and (
   <bold>C</bold>) MnPP as described in the methods. Each point is the mean Â± SEM of three to five determinations per point and normalized to percentages. Between-group comparisons were tested with a randomized block design for analysis of variance and 
   <italic>F</italic>-test.
