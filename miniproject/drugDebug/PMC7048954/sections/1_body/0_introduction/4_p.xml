<p>The MPPs share many of the chemical properties of heme and interactions with cellular components. Recently, MPPs such as ZnPP have shown promise for use as antineoplastic or antiviral agents.

 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Although the antiviral behaviors of some common MPPs have been described in infected cells, relatively little is known about specificity, potency, and structure–function relationships. The goal of the present work was to evaluate anti-NS3-4A protease activities of a variety of common MPPs and protoporphyrin derivatives to further characterize structure–activity relationships. Our results identify the structural requirements for protoporphyrins that enhance anti-NS3 activity. These studies identify a class of antiviral agents with a broad range of HCV genotype activities and overall effectiveness against resistant protease mutations and suggest a new structural platform for further development.
