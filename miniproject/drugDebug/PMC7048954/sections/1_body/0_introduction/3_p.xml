<p>Iron protoporphyrin (heme) and structurally related metalloprotoporphyrins (MPP) have been shown to have antiviral activity for a wide range of viruses including HCV, HBV, and HIV
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> as well as related 
 <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> such as Dengue.
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Heme is a vital oxidative cofactor for mammalian cells and is tightly regulated through the induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). Enzymatically, HO performs the rate-limiting reaction for heme catalysis by oxidizing heme to biliverdin (BV) with the release of free iron and carbon monoxide. BV is then rapidly reduced to bilirubin (BR) through the coupled reactions of biliverdin reductase and NADPH oxidase.
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Commercial preparations of heme (
 <italic>Hemin and Panhematin</italic>) are approved by the FDA for use in patients during attacks of acute porphyria.
