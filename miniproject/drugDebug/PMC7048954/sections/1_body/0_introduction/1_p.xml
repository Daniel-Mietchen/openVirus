<p>Chronic hepatitis C virus, (HCV, 
 <italic>Hepacivirus</italic>) infection is a serious health issue worldwide. In spite of potent antiviral agents, chronic infection can still lead to decompensated cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Recent development of multiple antiviral drugs that offer a cure for most HCV infected patients has been a dramatic medical achievement of this decade.
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> While the design of new antivirals for HCV is not a pressing concern per se, further study of HCV drug targets such as the NS3-4A protease is still useful for understanding related 
 <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> such as Dengue, Yellow fever, West Nile and Zika.
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> These pathogens still present formidable treatment challenges.
