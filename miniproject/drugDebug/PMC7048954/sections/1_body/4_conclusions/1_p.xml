<p>In summary, we have shown that porphyrins can be useful inhibitors of the HCV NS3-4A protease. The optimal activity appears to depend on the planarity of the R side chains while the identity of the coordination metal has only minimal impact. As a group, the metalloporphyrins show strong inhibitory activities across genotypes 1â€“3 and full inhibition of three common NS3 mutations. Our findings suggest that MPPs as a class should be investigated further for use as antiprotease and antiviral agents in HCV and potentially other
