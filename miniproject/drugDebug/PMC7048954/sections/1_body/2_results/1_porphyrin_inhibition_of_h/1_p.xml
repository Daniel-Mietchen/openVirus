<p>Structurally, all porphyrin compounds have a macrocyclic ring composed of 4 pyrroles joined by conjugated methine bridges (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Substitutions at the R positions form deuteroporphyrin (H), mesoporphyrin (C-C), protoporphyrin (C=C) and isohematoporphyrin (C-C-OH). While heme (FePP) is by far the most common MPP, a variety of synthetic MPPs with different coordination metals was available for evaluation. We tested each compound for both enzymatic inhibition of the NS34A protease and attenuation of viral replication in cell-free and whole-cell assays, respectively. Background fluorescence of the porphyrins was reduced by the choice of optimal excitation and absorption wavelengths (
