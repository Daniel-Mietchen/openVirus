<p>In the first experiments, plots of NS3-4A enzymatic activity (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2A</xref>) and HCV RNA (
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2B</xref>) in the presence of various MPs were determined using recombinant genotype 1B NS3-4A protease or HCV replicon cells, respectively. All MPPs significantly inhibited recombinant NS3-4A and showed greater activity than biliverdin, the heme oxidation product.
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> As summarized in 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>, the MPPs exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> in low micromolar range: CoPP (1.4 µM) &lt; ZnPP = MnPP = SnPP &lt; CuPP &lt; FePP (6.5 µM). While the coordination metal did significantly impact IC
 <sub>50</sub> of the protoporphyrins, all values were within a 5-fold micromolar range suggesting that the metal has only mild effects on enzyme inhibition (
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1A</xref>). Moreover, FePP (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 6.5 µM) was only slightly better than that of the free-base protoporphyrin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 7.5 µM) in support of this notion. It should be noted that IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 
 <xref rid="T0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F0002" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> plots may differ slightly because the tabular values are the cumulation of multiple experiments.
