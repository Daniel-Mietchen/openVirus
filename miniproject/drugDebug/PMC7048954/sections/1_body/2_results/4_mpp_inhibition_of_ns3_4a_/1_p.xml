<p>Mutant enzymes appear in response to nearly all HCV anti-proteases and potentially can limit the scope and efficacy of antiviral therapies. We tested the activities of three MPPs, Zn, Cu and Mn for three major NS3 mutations, V36M, A156T, and T54A (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A</xref>–
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">C</xref>, respectively). V36M is a common mutation that emerges in nearly all genotypes. Protease positions 54, 155, and 156 are “hot spots” for linear antivirals, such as first-generation telaprevir and boceprevir. Additionally, mutations at position 156 also arise after treatment with next-generation anti-proteases such as simeprevir and grazoprevir.
