<p>In general, first and second-generation HCV anti-proteases tend to show selectivity for genotypes 1 and 2.

 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref> and 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">B</xref>, respectively). Both MPPs showed protease inhibition plots and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values that were statistically indistinguishable across the four tested genotypes. These findings suggest that the antiviral activities of MPPs are versatile across HCV genotypes and that the MPPs may also be useful for related viruses.
