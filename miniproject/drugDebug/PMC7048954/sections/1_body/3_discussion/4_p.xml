<p>Related pathogenic 
 <italic>Flaviviruses</italic> such as Dengue (DENV), West Nile, and Yellow Fever share important structural and enzymatic properties with HCV. For DENV, there has been no approval of a specific anti-dengue drug although antiviral therapy in acute infection may reduce the risk for severe DENV.
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> However, Tseng et al
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> recently demonstrated that MPPs such as ZnPP and CoPP inhibited NS2-NS3 DENV protease with a mechanism remarkably similar to what our group reported for HCV NS3-4A.
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Furthermore, biliverdin or CoPP treatment of infected DENV cells restored innate type I interferon signaling similar to our results with HCV.
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Taken together, the findings of Tseng et al
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and our report are useful for further development of MPPs or related tetrapyrroles as anti-DENV agents.
