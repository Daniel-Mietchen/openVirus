<p>Metalloporphyrins (MP) have been widely investigated for use as antiviral agents for a number of human and animal pathogens. They were proposed as general virucidal agents as well as highly specific compounds capable of targeting viral enzymes.
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> While a wide variety of synthetic MP and MPP have been described, mammalian cells chiefly synthesize heme or Fe protoporphyrin IX, which is used ubiquitously for many oxidative and metabolic reactions. Heme inhibits HIV and HBV reverse transcriptases

 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> as well as HCV replication in vitro.
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Biliverdin, the linear tetrapyrrole product of heme oxidation, was shown to inhibit HCV as well as HIV proteases.

Heme and ZnPP were shown to rescue innate immune signaling in infected hepatocytes by inhibition of NS3-4A cleavage of mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS), thus enhancing innate immune type I interferon response.
