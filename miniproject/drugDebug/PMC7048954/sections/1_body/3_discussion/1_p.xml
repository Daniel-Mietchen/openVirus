<p>Rapid advances have been achieved in HCV antiviral research; however, structureâ€“function studies of new agents against HCV targets remain useful. First, there is still a need for new HCV protease inhibitors with a wider range of genotype and performance capabilities. Second, other 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> pathogens share structural and functional features with HCV and knowledge gained from HCV can be compared and occasionally extrapolated to other viruses. Third, studies with HCV enzymes such as the NS3-4A protease enhance enzymatic research and benefit drug modeling for other serine-activated proteases.
