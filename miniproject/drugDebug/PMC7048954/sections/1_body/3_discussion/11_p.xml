<p>Of all the MPPs evaluated here, ZnPP and CoPP were found to be the most effective MPPs in enzymatic assays. Thus, it is important to note that the lower levels of ZnPP found to be effective in vitro can be achieved in cells during some disease states. Normally ZnPP is present at about 0.5 µM in reticulocytes; however, during pathologic states such as iron deficiency, it can increase tenfold to 5 µM.
