<p>HCV has high viral sequence variability, multiple genotypes, and an error-prone RNA polymerase that facilitates resistance-associated substitutions (RAS).
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> These issues have presented challenges for the development of HCV anti-protease agents.
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> First-generation protease inhibitors were designed using a substrate-based approach that modeled peptide analogs, “peptidomimetics”.
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> These efforts were followed by the development of first and then second-generation macrocyclic drugs which yielded considerable improvement in dosing and performance. Although active against HCV genotypes 1, 2, and 4, most early macrocyclics were ineffective against genotype 3. Three third-generation macrocyclics, glecaprevir, voxilaprevir and grazoprevir were developed not only to target genotype 3 but to expand drug coverage to genotypes 1–6.
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> All of these drugs showed pan-genotypic inhibition of NS3 protease in vitro,
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>–
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> however, grazoprevir was a significantly less effective inhibitor for genotype 3 as compared to genotype 1 (90-fold difference in Ki).
 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Glecaprevir
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and grazoprevir
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> are now approved for use in combination with NS5A inhibitors (as 
 <italic>Mavyret</italic> and 
 <italic>Zepatier, respectively</italic>), while Voxilaprevir
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> is approved for use with NS5A and NS5B inhibitors (as 
 <italic>Vosevi</italic>). Overall these drugs have greatly expanded patient coverage, especially for those treatment-experienced individuals and for some resistant infections with RAS mutations; however, issues such as availability, tolerability, and suitable target populations remain.
