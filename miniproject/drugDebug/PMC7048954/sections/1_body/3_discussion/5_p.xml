<p>Herein, we investigated the basic structural requirements for MPs, as a class, to optimally target the NS3-4A protease. MPPs were the most effective inhibitors of all the porphyrins and MPs tested. MPPs contain two vinyl groups (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>) which extend the resonance stabilized planarity of the porphyrin ring. Porphyrins with other substitutions such as meso (ethyl), isohemato (ethanolic), and deutero (hydrogen) were clearly less effective NS3-4A protease inhibitors. These results suggest that R-groups extend the planarity of the ring and act to enhance or stabilize active site binding. Planar compounds such as the macrocyclics

These observations also support our past work which showed a marked difference between the tetrapyrroles biliverdin (BV) and bilirubin (BR) for NS3-4A inhibition. BV, a flat compound with vinyl R groups, has an IC
