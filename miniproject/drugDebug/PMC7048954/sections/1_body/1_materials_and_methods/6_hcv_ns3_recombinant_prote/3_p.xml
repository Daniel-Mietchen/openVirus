<p>The effects of various tetrapyrroles on HCV replication in replicon cells were determined in a semiquantitative fashion, measuring HCV RNA in cells treated with inhibitor as compared to vehicle only controls. Replicon cells were seeded into culture dishes and allowed to attach overnight then incubated with various quantities of porphyrin or control vehicle only. Forty-eight hr later, total RNA was extracted using 
 <italic>Trizol</italic> reagent and the amount of HCV RNA determined by real-time RT-PCR as described above. EC
 <sub>50</sub> was defined as the concentration of antagonist necessary to achieve 50% reduction of HCV RNA synthesis in cells in vitro as compared to controls. EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were derived by regression analyses using activity vs inhibitor concentration sigmoidal plots. For all replicon assays danoprevir,
 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> a known NS3-4A antagonist was used as a positive control to ensure replicon and assay performance. Concentrations used were 5-10x Ki (about 10 nM) and showed 80â€“90% inhibition.
