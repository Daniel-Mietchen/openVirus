<p>Influenza vaccines and antivirals are available in Africa although population coverage is estimated to be very low. Vaccines and antivirals are available in the private sector alone or both private and public sectors. The Southern Hemisphere formulation is most widely used in Africa despite lower production worldwide [

Over the last few years, the Northern and Southern hemisphere influenza vaccine formulations have been identical albeit the time in which these vaccines are distributed is different. Several countries that do not currently have influenza vaccine available are likely to consider doing so in the next few years and would use national burden estimates to inform policy. However, funding is a concern. As has been seen globally with other underutilized vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], many of the countries in Africa without influenza vaccine are low income. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) is a public-private partnership that aids low income countries in procuring vaccines. Currently, there are 56 countries eligible to receive GAVI support and 35 of these countries are in Africa [
