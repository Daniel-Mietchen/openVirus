<p>The main limitation of this study is that these findings, albeit reported by credible sources, may not accurately reflect the true vaccine and antiviral use in Africa, especially since we were unable contact representatives in 14 countries and did not get a response from 9 countries, many of which are lower income. It is very difficult in many of these countries, for example, to ascertain vaccine coverage rates and to understand vaccine supply. While vaccines may be available, distribution and use by high risk groups remains unknown. Given that such a small proportion (1%-4%) of the global seasonal vaccine supply is distributed in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and since most of the worldâ€™s population lives in these areas, vaccination rates must be low. As additional data emerge on the burden of influenza disease in Africa, the identification of groups at risk of serious complications must be met with increasing availability of vaccines, policies targeting identified risk groups, and funding to support larger scale procurement and distribution efforts in resource-poor countries.
