<p>Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza illness and antiviral drugs help treat viral infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Vaccines and antiviral drugs are important particularly among high risk groups such as young children, pregnant women, the elderly and persons with underlying medical conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO), however, reports that none of the countries in the African Region have capacity to produce seasonal influenza vaccines [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A separate report from the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers states that countries in Africa, the Eastern Mediterranean and South-East Asia combined receive only 1% to 4% of the global seasonal influenza vaccine supply each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. With growing data on the burden of influenza across the African continent, many countries are considering introducing or expanding strategies to prevent and manage influenza infection. We conducted this study to gather more data on the availability of influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs in Africa as well as related national policies and guidelines.
