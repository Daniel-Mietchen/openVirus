<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the main protease protein sequences of SARS-CoVs and Bat-CoVs is shown in Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>. The results are in agreement with recent reports of an independent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from a Bat-CoV, different from the spillover which led to the introduction of SARS-CoV, being the Bat-CoV of 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> the probable ancestor of this new virus (Wong et al., 2020[
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]). The sequences of the whole main protease of this Bat-CoV and of SARS-CoV-2 share 99.3 % identity, while the MERS-CoV protease was only 50.6% identical (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). The main protease sequence is highly conserved among all the SARS-like coronaviruses from human and related CoVs from other animals (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>).
