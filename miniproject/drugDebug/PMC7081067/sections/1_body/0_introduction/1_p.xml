<p>At present there is not specific treatment for coronavirus infection. However, prior outbreaks have helped to decipher the main pharmacological targets in these viruses. The therapies have been focused on targeting protease, helicase, polymerase, and using immunomodulators such as interferons and corticosteroids (Zumla et al., 2016[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). Ribavirin alone or combined with IFN has been the most common therapeutic intervention in patients with SARS and MERS (Khalid et al., 2015[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Also, protease inhibitors have been used

 <italic>in vivo</italic> to block coronavirus replication. Lopinavir (LPV) and ritonavir (RTV) are protease inhibitors currently used in HIV therapy that could block SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV main proteases (Savarino 2005[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). The combination of lopinavir or ritonavir with ribavirin was associated with improvement in clinical outcome, compared with ribavirin alone, in SARS-CoV-infected patients (Lai, 2005[
 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]). During the MERS-CoV outbreak, the Food and Drugs Administration approved the use of ritonavir/lopinavir, based mainly on data obtained from 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (Sheahan et al 2020[
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]). Altogether, these data support the assumption that some protease inhibitors may have an antiviral effect by blocking coronavirus main protease. However, like other RNA viruses, the main challenge associated with antiviral therapy is the selection of resistant variants. Mechanisms of generation of diversity in coronavirus are related to a moderate error rate of the polymerase (with proof-reading capacity) and homologous or heterologous recombination, factors that lead to antigenic drift and shift, similar to those described for Influenza viruses (Menachery et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). Thus, viral replication will produce a diverse population of genome variants having different fitness profiles. These variants could be associated with the development of drug resistance (Yin and Wunderink, 2018[
 <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; Pruijssers and Denison, 2019[
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]). The ongoing efforts toward discovering efficient drugs to prevent and treat SARS-CoV-2 infection should include the prior structural and pharmacological knowledge gained with the other coronavirus outbreaks. Based on that, in this work was established a comparative theoretical study to rationalize the potential use of protease inhibitors as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2 infections.
