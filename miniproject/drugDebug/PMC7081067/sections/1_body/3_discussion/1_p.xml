<p>Due to the rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2, affecting more than 70 countries, therapeutic alternatives are urgently required. Viral main protease plays a pivotal role in coronavirus replication. This enzyme is responsible for the cleavage of the polyprotein, producing functional proteins that will be packed into the virion. The molecular study of SARS-CoV-2 protease showed that this virus has high homology with SARS-CoV protease. Previous data suggest the use of protease inhibitors as potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV protease, in special some of those used for HIV-1 therapy. HIV-1 protease is an aspartyl protease, while in coronavirus it is a cysteine protease. However, the inhibition by protease inhibitors could be driven by a similar mechanism. HIV-1 is one of the best-studied models in antiviral research, their targets are well characterized and its inhibition by drugs has been broadly studied. Protease inhibitors play a main role in HIV-1 therapy. Furthermore, these compounds have shown inhibitory effects over proteases from pathogens such as Leishmania and malaria (Valdivieso et al., 2010[

 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]; de Wilde et al., 2014[
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Thus, the use of protease inhibitors in other viral species could be supported by these non-specific protease inhibitions. Previous reports showed the inhibition of SARS-CoV protease by protease inhibitors used in HIV-1 therapy, being an interesting pharmacological target to treat SARS-CoV-2. Previously, scientific reports showed that some HIV-1 protease inhibitors could decrease SARS-CoV replication (Savarino, 2005[
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]). Nevertheless, not all of the protease inhibitors showed the same efficacy against this virus (Jenwitheesuk and Samudrala, 2003[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Based on that, in this work, we established an 
 <italic>in silico</italic> approach to validate the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 protease by HIV-1 protease inhibitor. The results showed that the main protease inhibitors used in HIV-1 therapy could produce a decrease in the protease activity in coronavirus enzyme. The compound with the highest binding affinity was saquinavir. Preliminary reports are showing that patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 and treated with lopinavir could achieve viral clearance (Lim et al., 2020[
 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]). Our study suggests that drugs such as SQV and LPV have shown slightly higher, but comparative binding energies against the SARS-CoV-2, than HIV-1 protease. Thus, based on their safety profiles, SQV and LPV could be used as therapy and/or pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce new infections by SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, the data obtained from prior outbreaks, the clinical results obtained by using protease inhibitors in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results shown here, support the use of protease inhibitors to treat SARS-CoV-2.
