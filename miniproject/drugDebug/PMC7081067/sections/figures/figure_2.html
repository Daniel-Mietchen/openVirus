 <caption> Coronavirus main proteases. Graphical representation for each protease was achieved in Biovia Discovery Studio Visualizer by using the coordinates obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Structure for A) Bat-CoV (2YNB), B) SARS-CoV (2GX4), C) SARS-CoV-2 (6LU7) are shown. Also, a comparison by molecular overlapping between these structures is shown in D. The main residues and changes in SARS-CoV-2 compared to SARS-CoV are shown in E. The HIV-1 protease (1MIU) is shown in F. </caption>
