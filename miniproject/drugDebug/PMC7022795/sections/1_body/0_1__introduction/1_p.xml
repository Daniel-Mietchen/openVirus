<p>Antimalarial drugs used for the treatment and prevention of malaria are classified in a heterogenic group [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. They are usually divided based on the chemical structure or the source of the drugs. Most of them derive from traditional medicine and plants. After identification of the active principles, chemical modifications are introduced to increase the activity and ameliorate the selectivity index. They present different modes and various mechanisms of action, which are often still not elucidated, against malaria parasites. Furthermore, due to the complexity of these molecules, additional side activities have been reported. For these reasons, antimalarial drugs have been studied, proposed, and sometimes used for the treatment of other pathologies, such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and nonmalaria infectious diseases [
 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Moreover, the geographical overlaps between malaria and viral-related diseases [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have led to the consideration of possible use of antimalarial drugs as new antiviral drugs. Finally, the lack of new effective antiviral drugs and vaccines against many viral infections has strengthened interest in the potential antiviral activity of antimalarial drugs.
