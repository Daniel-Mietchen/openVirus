<p>The anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 activities of CQ and its analogs were tested in vitro and in vivo. The first report about the in vitro use of CQ as an anti-HIV-1 agent was published in 1990 by Tsai et al., which showed the suppressive effects of CQ on the replication of HIV-1 in a T cell line [

 <xref rid="B153-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. Subsequently, the same group demonstrated the CQ and hydroxyCQ anti-HIV-1 and anti-HIV-2 in vitro effects at concentrations that are clinically achievable [
 <xref rid="B154-microorganisms-08-00085" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. CQ had an additive effect against HIV-1 when used in combination with other antiretroviral agents [
