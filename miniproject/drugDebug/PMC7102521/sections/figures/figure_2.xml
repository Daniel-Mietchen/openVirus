  <p>Docking between selected natural compounds and their reported targets. A. PLpro and natural compound M2; B. 3CL and M1; C. Spike and M6. Docking is performed with AutoDock 4 which is detailed in Materials and Methods. The protein structure files are listed in 
   <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Protein domains are shown in different colors, while natural compounds are shown in dark yellow. The amino acids labeled were those interacting with compound. 3CLpro: 3C-like protease; PLpro: papain-like protease.
