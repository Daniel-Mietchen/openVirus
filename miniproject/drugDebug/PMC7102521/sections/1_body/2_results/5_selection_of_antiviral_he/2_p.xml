<p id="p0075">The 13 molecules passing the three-round selection process were then compared to the three Chinese herbal databases, and we found 230 herbs containing these molecules (
 <xref rid="s0100" ref-type="sec">online supplementary file Table S1</xref>). We then evaluated these herbs for those containing 2 or more of the 13 natural compounds, leaving 125 results. We cross-referenced the 125 results with the classic categorizations for herbal usage in the TCMSP database, finally choosing 11 types that are traditionally used to treat viral respiratory infections. There are 26 herbal plants within the 11 types. The timeframe during the course of a viral infection that each of these 26 herbal plants (

For example, plants catalogued as antipyretic detoxifying drugs, qi-reinforcing drugs, antitussive antiasthmatics, pungent cool diaphoretics and phlegm-resolving medicines may all be used throughout the course of infection, whereas drugs belonging to the interior warming group may be best utilized in prevention.
