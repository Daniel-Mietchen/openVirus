Among these proteins, the most well-studied are papain-like protease (PLpro), 3C-like protease (3CLpro) and spike protein. Coronavirus PLpro not only processes the viral polypeptide onto functional proteins but is also a deubiquitinating enzyme that can dampen host anti-viral response by hijacking the ubiquitin (Ub) system. For example, SARS PLpro cleaves ISG15, a two-domain Ub-like protein, and Lys48-linked polyUb chains, releasing diUbLys48 products
