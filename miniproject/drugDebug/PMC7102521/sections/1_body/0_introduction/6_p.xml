<p id="p0025">It is a challenge to screen out the herbs containing anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) compounds from the large number of those possibly being used for patients infected with this pathogen, especially in very short time. Here, we propose two principles to guide such work: oral effectiveness and traditional usage compatibility. The first principle refers to the fact that most Chinese herbal plants are orally ingested after boiling with water, meaning that the anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ingredients in selected plants should be absorbable via oral preparation. The second principle recognizes that candidate plants should be consistent with the type classifications for traditional herbal usage, since type-guided applications are integral to herbal use, as mentioned above. Following these two principles, we used a 6-step selection process (3 for each principle), including drug-likeness, evaluation of oral bioavailability, molecular docking, network pharmacology analysis and other methods to identify herbs that have both a high possibility of containing effective anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) compounds and are classified as treating virus-caused respiratory infection.</p>
