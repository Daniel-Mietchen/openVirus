<p id="p0095">Two principles guided our screening work. The first is that the anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) components contained in the source plants should be absorbable via oral prescription. This principle requires that the herbs selected should contain biologically proven anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) ingredients, and that these natural compounds should pass the drug-likeness and oral bioavailability evaluations. Therefore, we conducted a three-step screening process. First, we extracted natural compounds verified in PubMed as being effective in treating SARS or MERS coronavirus and then cross-checked these compounds in the Chinese herbal databases. There were 115 overlapping compounds. This method was an expeditious way to identify natural components both pre-existing in Chinese herbal treatment and having a high possibility of anti-coronavirus (2019-nCoV) activity. This is important, as the anti-coronavirus effects of the selected compounds have been biologically confirmed, and the genetic similarities between coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and SARS or MERS coronavirus are high
