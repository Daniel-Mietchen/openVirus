<p id="p0100">The anti-coronavirus effects of the natural compounds screened by the above method have been mainly confirmed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by direct loading onto cultured cells, thus it does not guarantee their effectiveness 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, especially with oral preparationâ€”the principal way in which Chinese herbals are administered. Therefore, to meet the first principle, we ran ADME filters on the natural compounds selected by 4 indices, as used by Hu et al. 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Among the 115 compounds highlighted by our first step, only 13 passed this screening, showing the necessity of such a test.
