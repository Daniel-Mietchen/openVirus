<p>Regarding Sickle Cell Anemia, about 10â€“20% of patients have chronic HCV infection. Moreover, due to the need of blood transfusions to manage the sickling crisis and anemia, patients affected by HCV infection frequently are exposed to higher risk of iron overload and hemosiderosis, leading to liver-related morbidity and mortality (Moon et al.,

The hepatic involvement ranges in severity from liver dysfunction to liver failure, and occurs as the result of many factors: (a) sickling process (with acute hepatic vaso occlusion, hepatic sickle cell cholestasis, liver ischemia, and reperfusion injury, hemolysis, and cholelithiasis); (b) chronic viral hepatitis; (c) transfusion related hemosiderosis; and (d) autoimmune liver disease (Porter and Garbowski,
