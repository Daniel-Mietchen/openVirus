<p>The evaluation of some parameters before and after treatment (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) suggested a significant reduction (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.018) in alanine aminotransferase levels from 44.0 ± 30.1 IU/L at baseline to 24.1 ± 21.8 IU/L at the SVR evaluation. On the other hand, the liver iron concentration (LIC) resulted decreased after treatment from 1.85 ± 1.22 to 1.66 ± 0.72 mgFe/g liver, but the difference was not significant. Serum ferritin values did not show differences before and after DAAs therapy.
