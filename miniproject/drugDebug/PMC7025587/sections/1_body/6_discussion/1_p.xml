<p>The data currently available in the literature suggest that the eradication of HVC infection using the new DAAs is very close. In addition, the results obtained on the patients with thalassemia and sickle cell disease have given high values of SVR, always higher than 90%. There are still a small percentage of non-responder subjects to DAAs therapy and one of the causes could be that some of them were already very compromised with serious comorbidities when were treated, as in our non-responder subjects with infection relapse after 1 month. Moreover, at first the treatment of patients did not include new types of DAAs currently available. Therefore, now those not responding to the therapy could be treated with other DAAs of more recent generation or with different modalities.</p>
