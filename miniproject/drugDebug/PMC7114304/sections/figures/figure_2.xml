   <italic>Canonical RNA capping mechanisms.</italic> The cap-0 structure is formed on nascent RNA chains by the sequential action of three enzymes. (1) The RNA triphosphatase (RTPase, pink) hydrolyses the γ phosphate of the nascent RNA (pppN-RNA, where N denotes the first transcribed nucleotide) to yield a diphosphate RNA (ppN-RNA) and inorganic phosphate (P
   <sub>i</sub>). (2) RNA guanylyltransferase (GTase, light blue) reacts with the α phosphate of GTP releasing pyrophosphate (PP
   <sub>i</sub>) and forms a covalent enzyme–guanylate intermediate (Gp-GTase). The GTase then transfers the GMP molecule (Gp) to the 5′ diphosphate RNA to create GpppN-RNA. (3) RNA (guanine-N-7)-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase, green), recruited by the GTase, transfers the methyl group from 
   <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-
   <sc>l</sc>-methionine (AdoMet) to the cap guanine to form the cap-0 structure (
   <sup>m7</sup>GpppN) and releases 
   <italic>S</italic>-adenosyl-
   <sc>l</sc>-homocysteine (AdoHcy) as a by-product. The capping reaction is then completed by the methylation of the ribose-2′-O position of the first nucleotide by the AdoMet-dependant (nucleoside-2′-O)-methyltransferase (2′-O MTase, orange), generating cap-1 structure (
   <sup>m7</sup>GpppN
   <sub>m2′O</sub>). Below the schematic are listed examples of viruses that acquire their cap structures using the cellular capping machinery (first four examples) or encode their own viral capping machinery that adopt the canonic pathway. Question marks indicate viruses likely to follow this conventional pathway.
