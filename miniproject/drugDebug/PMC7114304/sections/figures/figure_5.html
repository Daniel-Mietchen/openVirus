 <caption> Structural models of viral enzymes involved in RNA capping. RTPase folds: (I) the triphosphate tunnel metalloenzyme (TTM) fold is examplified by the structure of the RTPase (PDB code 2QZE) from the genus Mimivirus, which consists of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses; (II) the helicase fold of the RTPase from the single-stranded positive-sense RNA (ss(+)RNA) dengue virus (PDB code 2BHR); (III) the histidine triad (HIT)-like fold of the RTPase from dsRNA rotaviruses (PDB code 1L9V). GTase folds: (I) Structure of the dsDNA virus Paramecium bursaria chlorella virus 1 GTase, showing the loading reaction: GTP onto the active site, with the GTase in an open conformation (PDB code 1CKO); (II) GTase domain of the Cypovirus (PDB code 3IZ3, residues 1–366). MTases folds: (I) N-7-MTase: the (guanine-N-7)-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase) domain of protein D1 from the dsDNA virus vaccinia virus (PDB accession code 2VDW) in complex with a molecule of S-adenosyl- l-homocysteine (AdoHcy). II) 2′-O MTase: VP39, the 2′-O MTase of the dsDNA virus vaccinia virus, in complex with a capped RNA and AdoHcy (PDB code 1AV6). III) N-7/2′-O methyltransferase: the N-7 MTase-(nucleoside-2′-O)-methyltransferase (2 ’-O MTase) domain of NS5 from dengue virus (ss(+)RNA) in complex with the cap analogue 7-methyl-G (m7G)-pppGm2′-O and AdoHCY (PDB code 2P41). Endonuclease fold: (I) endonuclease (N-terminal) domain of L protein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (PDB code 3JSB). Structures are colored cyan for α-helices and red for β-strands. All figures were prepared using PyMOL. </caption>
