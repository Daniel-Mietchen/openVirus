   <italic>The RNA cap structure:</italic> the cap consists of a 7-methylguanosine (blue box) linked to the 5′ nucleoside of the messenger RNA chain through a 5′–5′ triphosphate bridge (pink box). The methyl group of the guanosine at its N-7 position is surrounded in green, and the 2′-O methyl group of the first and second nucleotide residue forming the cap-1 and the cap2 structures, respectively, are surrounded in light orange.
