 <italic>Specificity:</italic> a most often put forward requirement is the uniqueness of the viral target, i.e., the non-existence of a similar cellular target that could also be hit by any antiviral drug and cause serious side-effects. Interestingly, even when viral enzymes remain close in structure and mechanism to their cellular counterpart, there remain structural and functional differences potentially useful to achieve differential inhibition, i.e., selectivity for the viral target. In most cases, viral enzymes are profoundly original in folding, organization, and mechanisms, providing a large chemical space for drug design and drug selectivity.
