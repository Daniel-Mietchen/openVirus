 <italic>Potency:</italic> another important parameter is the expected outcome of viral target inhibition. The question of whether the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> inhibition effectively leads to a significant block of viral growth must be answered. One has to consider the two major mechanisms of action of the viral target. It can be an enzyme, and inhibition of its enzyme activity may have exponential consequences. On the other hand, the virus may develop alternative pathways in order to resist antiviral molecules. For example, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> capping inhibitors had to be validated since dengue virus was also shown to perform cap-independent translation of its RNA genome (
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">Edgil et al., 2006</xref>). Another possibility is that the target protein can be a binding partner devoid of catalytic activity and part of a proteinâ€“protein binding equilibrium. Its inhibition would shift the equilibrium according to the law of mass action. The protein dosage must be fine tuned to exert a powerful antiviral effect. In both cases, a significant effect on viral growth must be observed to validate the target as appropriate.
