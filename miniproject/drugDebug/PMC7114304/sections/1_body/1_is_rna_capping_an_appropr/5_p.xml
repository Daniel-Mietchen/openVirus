 <italic>Amplifying mechanism:</italic> lastly, one has to consider the number of events that the protein or target is involved in during the virus life-cycle. For example, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) incorporate several thousand nucleotides to produce a single RNA genome. Inhibition of the viral RdRp at each nucleotide incorporation should exhibit a powerful antiviral effect. In contrast, RNA capping events can vary from a single capping event (e.g., the genome of ss(+)RNA viruses), to many RNA capping events (e.g., 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>, 
 <italic>Mononegavirales</italic>, etc.). Nevertheless, the connection between RNA capping and antiviral innate immunity pathways is expected to amplify any drug action on RNA capping. Immature or incomplete RNA caps may not only exhibit an altered expression profile, but may also be detected by a variety of innate immunity sensors that add another direct negative effect on viral growth. In this context, it is noteworthy that the efficacy of RNA capping inhibition has been demonstrated. The inhibition of 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> MTase, which catalyzes two methylations per synthesis of an entire RNA genome, has been reported to be able to completely suppress viral replication (
