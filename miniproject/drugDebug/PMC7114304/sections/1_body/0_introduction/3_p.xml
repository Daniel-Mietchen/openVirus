<p id="p0010">In the conventional pathway, a cap structure is added to the nascent 5′-triphosphate mRNA in a series of reactions (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). The 5′-triphosphate is first hydrolysed by an RNA 5′-triphosphatase (RTPase). A guanylyltransferase (GTase), also called “capping enzyme”, adds the cap structure under the form of a guanosine 5′-monophosphate in a 5′–5′ orientation. The cap is then methylated onto the N-7 position of its guanine by an RNA cap guanine N-7-methyltransferase (N-7 MTase). This generates the minimal cap-0 (m7GpppN…), found in metazoan and lower eukaryotes. In higher eukaryotes, further methylation by ribose 2′-O-methyltransferases (2′-O MTases) occurs at the 2′-position of the riboses of the original transcript to yield mainly cap-1 (m7GpppNmN…) but also cap-2 (m7GpppNmNmN…) structures.
