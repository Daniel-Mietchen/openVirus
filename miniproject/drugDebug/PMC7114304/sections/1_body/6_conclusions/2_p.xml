<p id="p0215">The viral RNA capping machinery is remarkably diverse in organization, structure, and mechanisms used by its enzymes. All RNA viruses capping their own viral RNAs have evolved enzymes profoundly different from those of their host cell. As the power of antiviral compound screening and design increases, there are no doubts that viral RNA capping enzymes will be the target of novel highly efficient and selective drugs. Despite few exceptions, the identification and atomic resolution structure of target enzymes from major families has made significant progress in the last ten years. The recent connection of viral RNA capping to the host cell innate immunity mechanisms is more than ever a promising antiviral research field.</p>
