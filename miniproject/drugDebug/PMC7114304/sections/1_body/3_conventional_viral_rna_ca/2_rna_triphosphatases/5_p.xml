 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, RTPase III) found in 
 <italic>Rotavirus</italic> NSP2 protein has a magnesium dependent NTPase/RTPase hydrolysis activity capable of removing the γ-phosphate of either NTP or RNA (
 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Jayaram et al., 2002</xref>). Both activities share the same catalytic site and mechanism. Also, the switch from one activity to the other is substrate dependent (NTP or pppRNA). NSP2 is a protein that self-assembles into a doughnut-shape octamer, which binds to single-stranded RNA after destabilizing RNA–RNA duplexes. Each NSP2 monomer has two subdomains separated by a deep electropositive cleft containing histidine residues involved in the binding and the hydrolysis of NTP as well as RNA (
 <xref rid="b0485" ref-type="bibr">Vasquez-Del Carpio et al., 2006</xref>). The cleft is oriented on the surface of the doughnut. The N-terminal subdomain is mostly α-helical while the C-terminal domain adopts an α/β fold with a central twisted and anti-parallel β-sheet made of 5 β-strands, which is flanked by 5 α-helices. The protein is both a structural component of the RNA packaging and part of the capping machinery. Due to its unique structural features, it should be considered as a target of choice for the development of antiviral compounds.
