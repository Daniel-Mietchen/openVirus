<p id="p0075">Enzymes from the TTM superfamily hydrolyze NTPs to NDP + Pi in the presence of manganese or cobalt and are found in fungi, protozoa, and most of DNA viruses that encode a RTPase (

 <italic>Baculoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Mimivirus</italic>). The RTPase of 
 <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Cet1 serves as a model (

 <xref rid="b0290" ref-type="bibr">Lima et al., 1999</xref>). The tunnel harbors several charged and hydrophilic side chains coordinating manganese and sulfate ions. The sulfate is thought to indicate the position of the γ-phosphate of the newly synthesized mRNA. In a docking/modeling-based study, a series of nucleoside analogues (6-chloropurine-riboside-5′-triphosphate, 6-methylthioguanosine-5′-triphosphate, or 8-iodo-guanosine-5′-triphosphate) was identified with high affinity for binding and resistant to hydrolysis (
