<p id="p0080">The last identified superfamily is the viral RNA helicase-like fold (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, RTPase II), which carries NTPase-helicase activity. These RTPases are found in the RNA virus genera or families 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> (NS3), 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Orthoreovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Alphaviru</italic>s and 
 <italic>Potexvirus.</italic> Structurally, they can belong to either SF1 or SF2 helicase superfamily. No viral helicase crystal structure belonging to the SF1 superfamily has been determined to date, yet the fold is thought to be divergent from the canonical SF1 (
 <xref rid="b0100" ref-type="bibr">Cordin et al., 2006</xref>). On the other hand, the SF2 fold is formed by two RecA-like sub-domains, separated by a cleft that can accommodate either a nucleotide or 5â€²-triphosphate RNA substrate. The two sub-domains carry the Walker motifs: the A motif forms the P-loop stabilizing the terminal phosphate moiety of the substrate, and the B motif is composed of acidic residues (D-E-x-D) coordinating the divalent ion needed for substrate hydrolysis.
