<p id="p0235">RTPases (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, RTPase) are the enzymes responsible for the first step of cap formation, hydrolyzing the γ–β phosphodiester bond of 5′-triphosphorylated mRNA. There is no enzyme conservation amongst different kingdoms of life, meaning that the activity can be found within a domain or a single protein presenting structural and mechanistic diversities (for detailed review 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Decroly et al. (2012)</xref>). Theses diversities make the RTPase an attractive target for the development of specific and selective inhibitors. RTPases can indeed be separated into two classes sorted by mechanistic criteria, i.e., either with a metal-independent and -dependent mechanism (
