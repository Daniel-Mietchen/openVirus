<p id="p0095">GTases (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, GTase) are responsible for attaching a GMP molecule onto the pre-mRNA. Contrary to RTPases, fold and mechanism seem to be very well conserved amongst all kingdoms of life, making 
 <italic>de facto</italic> the GTase a difficult target for specific inhibitor development. Yet there is a possibility that in the viral kingdom, GTases exhibit other mechanisms and new folds that would make GTases good candidates for drug development. This assumption comes from both the difficulty in identifying GTases in the viral world and the presence of GTase domains embedded within larger proteins such as protein L in Mononegavirales or the variant GTase domain found in cypovirus (

 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, GTase II). Known GTase proteins so far adopt a modular organization containing an N-terminal nucleotide transferase domain with an ATP-grasp fold and a C-terminal domain with an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold (OB-fold) that is positioned as a lid over the base subdomain of the N-terminal domain (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>, GTase I). The GTP-binding site is located between the base and the hinge, and is highly conserved in GTases from dsDNA viruses to humans. The catalytic site can be defined by the presence of six conserved motifs, for which Motif I contains a lysine that covalently links GMP by hydrolysis of ppi from GTP, before its transfer onto RNA. Other conserved motifs form the binding pocket for the nucleotide. GTases from the ds RNA viruses of the 
 <italic>Orthoreovirus</italic> genus form part of a multidomain protein (or assembly line) carrying all RNA capping functions. The GTase domain probably exists transiently and no fold can be clearly defined, whereas the methyltransferase domains are identifiable. Nevertheless, the catalytic residue is also a conserved lysine (
