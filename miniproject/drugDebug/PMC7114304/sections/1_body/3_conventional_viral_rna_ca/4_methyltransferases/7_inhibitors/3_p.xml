<p id="p0135">The discovery of inhibitors of viral MTases started and the elucidation of RNA capping started in the dsDNA 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic> field. A SAM analogue, sinefungin (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, MTase inhibitor I), was reported as the first potent inhibitor of the VV N-7 MTase activity (
 <xref rid="b0370" ref-type="bibr">Pugh et al., 1978</xref>) with a potent antiviral effect shown in a plaque formation assay. Another early study described inhibition of N-7 MTase and 2′-O MTase activities of VV by 2′,5′-linked oligo(adenylic acid) triphosphates (
 <xref rid="b0420" ref-type="bibr">Sharma and Goswami, 1981</xref>). Interestingly, these molecules are “natural” metabolites produced by the host cell as part of the innate immune response against viral infection (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Decroly et al. (2012)</xref>). Later, multi substrate adducts with inhibitory activity against VV N-7 MTase were reported (

 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">Benghiat et al., 1986</xref>). SAH analogues were shown to inhibit VV and herpes simplex virus (HSV) and their respective MTases were proposed as potential molecular targets (
