<p id="p0140">Concerning RNA virus MTases being part of the conventional capping machinery, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> MTases have been particularly explored. The dengue virus 2′-O MTase activity was shown to be inhibited by the GTP-analogue ribavirin triphosphate (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Benarroch et al., 2004a</xref>), sinefungin, and SAH (
 <xref rid="b0405" ref-type="bibr">Selisko et al., 2010</xref>). Based on known complex structures of the dengue virus NS5 MTase domain (
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">Benarroch et al., 2004a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">Egloff et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Egloff et al., 2002</xref>) which define the RNA cap binding sites during 2′-O-methylation and N-7-methylation (the latter being the actual active site) as well as the SAM-binding site, several groups have employed virtual screening and docking procedures to identify potential ligands and thus inhibitors (
 <xref rid="b0285" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Luzhkov et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Milani et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Podvinec et al., 2010</xref>). Some molecules were found to present inhibitory activity in the micromolar range in 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> enzymatic assays (
 <xref rid="b0315" ref-type="bibr">Luzhkov et al., 2007</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0335" ref-type="bibr">Milani et al., 2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0365" ref-type="bibr">Podvinec et al., 2010</xref>), see example in 
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, MTase inhibitor IV). A new conserved hydrophobic binding pocket next to the SAM-binding site was identified on 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> MTases, which is critical for viral replication and cap methylations (
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2010</xref>). This invites to the design of SAM analogues that also interact with this adjacent hydrophobic site and should be thus more potent and specific in comparison to SAM analogues as sinefungin. High-throughput screens using MTase activity assays and GTP-binding assays were set up and used to identify inhibitor molecules (
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">Geiss et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0280" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2008</xref>). Concerning 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> MTases the search for antivirals has been less active. Some SAM analogues have been tested and found to inhibit the N-7 MTase activity of nsp14 and the 2′-O MTase activity of nsp16 in the low micromolar range (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Bouvet et al., 2010</xref>). One of the identified molecules, aurintricarboxylic acid (ATA, (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, MTase inhibitor III)), also inhibits SARS-CoV replication in infected cells (
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2004</xref>). An indirect approach to inhibit viral MTases is being considered for 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> 2′-O MTase nsp16, the activity of which depends on its interaction with the nsp10 protein (
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">Bouvet et al., 2010</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0120" ref-type="bibr">Decroly et al., 2011</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0310" ref-type="bibr">Lugari et al., 2010</xref>). Molecules that disrupt the interaction are expected to inhibit the MTase activity of nsp16 and thus viral replication. This approach can also be considered for the N-7 MTase activity of protein D1 of VV, which depends on the activation by the stimulatory protein D12 (
