<p id="p0130">The exploration of MTases constitutes the most actively growing field amongst viral RNA capping targets. The last 10 years have seen viral RNA cap MTases coming increasingly into focus as targets for the discovery and development of antivirals (

 <xref rid="b0295" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2010</xref>). The inhibition of N-7 MTase activity is expected to exert a deleterious effect on viral replication because it blocks viral RNA translation. The essentiality of the N-7-methylation for viral replication has clearly been demonstrated for several viral families (

 <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, mutational analysis indicates that 2′-O MTase inhibition has weak effects on virus replication in cell culture (

 <xref rid="b0505" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). Nevertheless, 2′-O MTases are now also considered as potential targets due to the demonstration that RNA, lacking 2′-O-methylation on their cap structure, induces antiviral response through the MDA5 sensor (
 <xref rid="b0510" ref-type="bibr">Züst et al., 2011</xref>). Viruses mutated in their 2′-O MTase gene accordingly show strongly reduced replication capacity in animal models (
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>). This has led to a re-evaluation of the importance of 2′-O-methylation (reviewed in (
