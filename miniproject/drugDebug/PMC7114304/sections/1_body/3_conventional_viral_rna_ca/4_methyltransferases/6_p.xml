<p id="p0125">Single domain MTases are exemplified by the 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> MTase domain of protein NS5. The NS5 protein of flaviviruses is divided into two domains, an MTase residing in the N-terminal (one-third of NS5) and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase domain in the C-terminal (two-thirds of NS5). The NS5 MTase domain was first unambiguously characterized as a 2′-O MTase (
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">Egloff et al., 2002</xref>) and later it was shown that the same SAM-binding site is used for N-7 MTase activity (
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2006</xref>). The core structure of the domain consists of the 7-stranded β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices (

 <italic>’</italic>-O MTase III). The core of the structure is not supposed to rearrange, yet optimal N-7 and 2′-O methylations of the flavivirus cap require distinct biochemical conditions, suggesting that the two methylations occur through different mechanisms. Mutagenesis of the tetrad has shown that only the D of the K-D-K-E catalytic tetrad is essential for the N-7 methylation, and structural studies are still investigating the determination of the complete catalytic site for the N-7 MTase. Ray and colleagues (
 <xref rid="b0375" ref-type="bibr">Ray et al., 2006</xref>) have shown that the two cap methylation events are sequential and that the reaction is controlled by a steric constraint for the substrates. Indeed the N-7 methylation requires wild-type nucleotides at the 2nd (G) and 3rd (U) positions, with a 5′-stem–loop structure, whilst the subsequent 2′-O methylation requires wild-type nucleotides at the 1st (A) and 2nd (G) positions and a minimum of 20 nucleotides of viral RNA.
