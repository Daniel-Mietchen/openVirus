<p id="p0110">The canonical SAM-dependent MTase fold presents alternating β strands and α helices, that form a seven-stranded β sheet with at least three parallel α helices on each side (α/β fold). The structure is reminiscent of the Rossmann fold also found in the dinucleotide-binding domains of dinucleotide-binding proteins. The SAM-binding region is located at the N-terminal part of the β sheet and is formed in part by residues from loops following the central strands of the sheet. The substrate-binding region that is responsible for selectively binding nucleic acids is located in the C-terminal part of the β sheet. Depending on nature of the methylation (N-7 or 2′-O or both) additional structural features can be found to help accommodate or stabilize the substrate.</p>
