<p id="p0145">Cap-assembly lines are proteins found in several dsRNA viruses (
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>). They are multi-domain and function proteins that are packaged with the genome in the viral particle and are able to perform the four reactions needed to synthesize a cap-1 structure. Domains of the cap assembly line must be tightly regulated and coordinated to accomplish the sequential steps of the cap synthesis pathway as they can exhibit activity independent from or in synergy with the capping process. The individual domains corresponding to GTase and MTase have been characterized and have similar folds to those previously described, although it is unclear how and when RTPase activity occurs. A complete pathway has been proposed in which guanylyl transfer is followed by N-7-methylation and 2â€²-O-methylation of the mRNA.
