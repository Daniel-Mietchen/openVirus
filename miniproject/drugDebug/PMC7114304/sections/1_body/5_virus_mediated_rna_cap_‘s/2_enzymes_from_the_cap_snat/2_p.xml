<p id="p0190">The cap snatching mechanism is a common and alternative viral strategy for cap formation. Instead of making its own RNA cap, the virus has a machinery to remove and transfer (snatch) the cap from host mRNA onto its own pre-mRNA (

 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), all of them ss(−)RNA viruses, have developed this strategy (

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> serves as a paradigm for both mechanistic and structural studies. In the case of the influenza virus, the replication complex is made of three proteins forming the polymerase complex (PA, PB1, PB2). Host cell mRNAs present in the cytoplasm are targeted and recruited by PB2 that presents the cap from the mRNA to the endonuclease domain (PA) to snip the cap off. Then the short capped RNA is used as primer to polymerize the viral RNA. The first structural endonuclease domain potentially involved in cap snatching was recently identified in both

 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The endonuclease fold features four mixed β-strands forming a twisted sheet surrounded by seven α-helices (
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). The β sheet forms the bottom of a negatively charged cavity creating a binding site for divalent cations. Above it, a C-terminal helix with a positive patch creates another pocket to accommodate the RNA where the typical conserved PD...(D/E)XK nuclease motif defines the catalytic site.
