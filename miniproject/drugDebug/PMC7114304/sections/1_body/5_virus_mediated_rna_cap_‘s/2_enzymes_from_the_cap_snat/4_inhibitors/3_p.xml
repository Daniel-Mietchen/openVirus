<p id="p0205">The first discovery of inhibitors of the cap snatching pathway was made in 1994, when Tomassini et al. reported that 2,4-dioxobutanoic acid compounds were able to inhibit Influenza A and B viruses in infected cell cultures (
 <xref rid="b0470" ref-type="bibr">Tomassini et al., 1994</xref>). Remarkably, the compounds exhibited IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the micromolar range, comparable to IC
 <sub>50</sub> values observed when purified polymerase cores were used in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> endonuclease assay. The following chemical diversification of the parent compound could achieve a high specificity for influenza. Indeed, the L-735,882 compound reached an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 1.1 μM for influenza in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> endonuclease assay and an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 2 μM in a viral titer assay using influenza virus infected cells. The La Crosse virus, a 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> for which RNA capping and RNA polymerase priming rely also on cap snatching, remained unaffected both at the enzyme and virus level. Interestingly, the La Crosse virus replicates in the cytoplasm exclusively, unlike the influenza virus. Therefore, RNA caps are likely snatched in different cellular compartments or environments by these two viruses and this should be considerated at early steps of drug design for large spectrum inhibitors.
