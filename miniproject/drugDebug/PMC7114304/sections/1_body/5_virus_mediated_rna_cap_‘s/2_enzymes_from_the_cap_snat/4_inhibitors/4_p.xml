<p id="p0210">In 2009 and 2010, a structural basis for the inhibition mechanisms was provided by the crystal structure of the La Crosse virus endonuclease domains in complex with DPBA (

 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>, ENDOase inhibitor I)). The structural homology between the three available crystal structures indicates that a common pharmacophore including Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> chelating functional groups might be active against all three viral families. Based on these crystal structures, several compound families have been described and their antiviral activities characterized using enzyme-based assays, viral growth assays and protein structure data. The first compounds benefiting from structure-based activity analysis are catechins isolated from green tea. Although they seem to target both neuraminidase (
 <xref rid="b0435" ref-type="bibr">Song et al., 2005</xref>) and endonuclease, one active pharmacophore was identified as 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl. The same group extended the family of interesting compounds with thalidomide derivatives, active through their 3,4-dihydroxyphenethyl moieties, and later with marchantin-like phytochemicals produced in very high yield in liverworts (
