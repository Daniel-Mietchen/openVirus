<p id="p0055">Alongside the discovery of conventional cellular and viral RNA capping (
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), few viruses provided remarkable exceptions to the seemingly ubiquitous presence of capped mRNAs in Eukarya (as mentioned above for picorna-
 <italic>,</italic> hepaci- and pestiviruses). It was soon discovered that other viruses also used ‘unconventional’ RNA capping reactions deviating from the conventional RNA capping scheme (example in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> and for complete review (
 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">Decroly et al., 2012</xref>)). Nevertheless, it is truly remarkable that several of these widely different RNA capping reactions and pathways converge to the same RNA cap structure (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> ). This observation indicates that the evolutionary pressure to keep this structure protecting RNA must be significant. Viral RNA capping is thus an interesting target for drug design. In the following sections we summarize our current knowledge on viral enzymes involved in conventional and unconventional RNA capping (main reference structures in 
 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> ) and reported inhibitors (
 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> ).
