<p id="Par39">Based on the results of this study, it was concluded that RDN could be used as anti-dengue in vivo, to reduce the susceptibility and severity of dengue virus. This study also warrants the future in vivo anti-viral as part of the developmental process for development RDN as potential anti-dengue therapeutic. We therefore, need more investigations and specific diagnostic criteria. However, this study with a few number of sample size, gives a promising opportunity in the treatment of DENV using RDN in combination with LRD.</p>
