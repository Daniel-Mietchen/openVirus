<p id="Par31">LRD and RDN inhibited DV-induced proinflammatory cytokines response parameters like TNF-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17 in a dose-dependent manner. That is the target of antiviral inhibition therapy to depress virus levels following treatment, toward relief symptoms of viral infection, like inflammation and haven, reducing the morbidity and the death-rate caused by the disease. Similar results were obtained in lung injuries using RDN drugs to inhibit the levels of IFN-γ and IL-6 [

Further, we examined whether the compound shown to reduce dengue immune parameters in blood were able to lower the inflammatory immune response in the patients. Cytokines parameters of all patients treated with Acetaminophen were inhibited after the treatment. Concomitant RDN with LRD, compared with Acetaminophen demonstrated greater inhibition in cytokines parameters (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). However, cytokine concentration studies showed that concentrations of TNF-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17 were decreased in patients treated with RDN and LRD than in that treated with Acetaminophen (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). These results indicate that the lowering of immune parameters in blood of patients by antiviral inhibition therapy may be decrease the intense inflammatory response caused by DENV and inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the patients’ blood. Induction levels of several cytokines, such as IFN-β, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1, and IL-1β in T-REx-293 cells were reported to be higher upon DENV-2 infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Whereas levels of IL-6, IL-10 and IFN-γ in mice treated with ribavirin or the combination therapy of ribavirin and RDN were all significantly decreased than the untreated group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our previous study confirmed an extremely decreased level of IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6 parameters in RAW 264.7 cells treated with RDN and found that RDN may systematically disturb the NFL-κB and MAPK pathways. Therefore, RDN may block specific genes transcription partially through reducing the phosphorylation of IκB-α and the activation of NF-κB p65 [
