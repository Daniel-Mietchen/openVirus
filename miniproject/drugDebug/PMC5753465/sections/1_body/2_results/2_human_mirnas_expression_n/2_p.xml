<p id="Par22">DDX3X plays an important role in the regulation of the cell proliferation, which indicated that it is involved in antiviral response against DENV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], moreover DDX3X is able to stimulate the IFN promoter branches in DENV-infected cells and can be used as human immunodeficiency virus to control dengue infection. It has been suggested that the up-regulation of DDX3X may lead to treat dengue infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It was previously proved that RORA played a critical role in the cellular response, such as inhibitor of NF-κB signaling in cell to achieve inhibitory effects on immune response programs [

PPP3R1 was reported to participate in several biological processes such as improve therapeutic strategy to treat autoimmune disorders and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer disease either responses of skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle [
