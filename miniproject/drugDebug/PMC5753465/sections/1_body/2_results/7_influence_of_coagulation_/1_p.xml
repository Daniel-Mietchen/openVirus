<p id="Par32">This demonstrated that not only cytokines inhibited DF, but also human coagulants factor was used as a goal to minimize viremia through dengue infection. On behalf of the above feedback, we went ahead to study the impact of Acetaminophen given orally at a dose of 1.3 g three time daily for 3 days. Additionally, there was another treatment group with 20 ml RDN daily intravenous injections dose plus LRD 10 mg tablet each day. The present study showed significant lowering of viremia whereas increasing in the all coagulants factors Coa II, Coa V, Coa VII, Coa VIII, Coa IX, Coa X and Coa XI, respectively (Fig.

Some experimental tests have recommended that DENV and immunoglobulins from patients infected with the virus can directly impact the haemostatic regularity [
