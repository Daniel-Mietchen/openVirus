<p id="Par28">Qi, et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] Reported that cytokines and epigenetic regulators may be putative target genes of these miRNAs, and the pathway of biological regulation may be modulated by these miRNAs, miRNAs were classified as important ingredients of immune regulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Distinct miRNAs are capable of targeting genes that inhibit epigenetic pathways, while several miRNAs were confirmed to control down-regulation inflammatory responses by directly targeting genes encoding molecules [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Additionally, during DENV2 infection miRNAs were differentially expressed, among these upregulated are (R-4290, −4279, −625*, −let-7e, −1290, −33a, −378, −1246, −767-5p, −320c, −720, −491-3p, −3647, −451 and −4286) but downregulated miRNA were (miR-106b,-20a, −30b and −3653) [
