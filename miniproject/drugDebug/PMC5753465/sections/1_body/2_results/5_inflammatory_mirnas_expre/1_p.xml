<p id="Par29">miRNAs expression induced dengue symptoms post treatment by RDN with LRD and (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>) shows the interactions generated between 23 miRNAs and 39 predicted targets. The following action mode prediction showed that 15 of these miRNAs-target-pathway displayed up-regulation patterns, while the rest of them exhibited down-regulation patterns, and few of the targets are verified in previous research, such as VEGFA (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factors A) [

Through evaluate the molecular mechanism of RDN on MAPKs modulation, results in an activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathways, which in turn stimulates a variety of transcription factors such as NF-κB and AP-1, formerly definitely manages the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, while downstream signaling effects that influence to inflammation [

Herbal medicine probably controls the infectious disease mainly based on immunomodulatory agents stimulation (such as GSK3B, MAPK14, PPARγ) will probably help innate and adaptive immune, and regulation the inflammatory cytokines and proinflammatory mediators (like IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α, COX2) [
