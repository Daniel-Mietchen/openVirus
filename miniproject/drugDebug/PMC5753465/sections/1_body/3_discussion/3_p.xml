<p id="Par35">Microarray analysis in the present study displayed that hsa-miR-320a; hsa-miR-107 and hsa-miR-361-5p were extremely preserved in human. In addition, analyses predicted that miR-320a; one of the miRNAs highly preserved could target the Mitogen-Activated Phosphatase and Tensin Homolog (PTE), and DEAD-Box Helicase 3, X-Linked (DDX3X). Recent studies revealed that PTEN and DDX3X were activated by invading DENV, suggesting that host might inhibit virus infection by targeting viral transcripts with host miRNAs [

To reduce the dengue fever impact using a potential anti-dengue medicine, we administered several known antiviral drugs (Acetaminophen, LRD and RDN), oral treatment or injection targeting DENV were found to significantly reduce viremia. Additionally, LRD combination with RDN showed a significant reduction of viremia and indicated that RDN inhibitors may be interesting drug candidates for DENV. They also have a potential for antiviral efficacy in vivo, similar to their proposed used in antiâ€“hepatitis C [
