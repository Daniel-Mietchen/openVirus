<p id="Par34">In the present study, results showed that about 89 human miRNAs are important in the DENV interactions before medication, which are of interest in human immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, our study provides the most human miRNAs and their predicted functions pathways mediated by them in response to virus infection. In contrast, similar studies in mammals, revealed that the miRNAs profiles were reshaped by hepatitis C virus and miRNAs of human might have been correlated with the regulation of human immune systems [

Further experiments concluded that the regulation of Ad6 by miR-122 could significantly improve the safety profile of the entire body rearward systemic administration. Consequently, also recognizing disease-related miRNAs could adequately improve disease biomarker detection for the medication, it is necessary to develop robust computational models to predict innovative human disease-miRNA associations [
