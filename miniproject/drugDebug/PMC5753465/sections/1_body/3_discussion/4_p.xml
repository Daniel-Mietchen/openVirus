<p id="Par36">Furthermore the potential of RDN and LRD against DENV in patient are bitten by carrier mosquitoes. The results showed that RDN could reduce the immune parameters in blood of patients if mixed with LRD tablet. The suggested mechanism was that RDN down-regulated NF-B activation reducing the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing IFITM3 expression via MAVS, giving a sign that the anti-virus effects of RDN were related to adjusting the unbalanced homeostasis of the body caused by stress response, but unrelated with direct anti-virus activity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] Reported that RDN could inhibit the susceptibility of influenza in restraint-stressed mice, through RDN down-regulating NF-kB activation to constrict the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and enhance IFITM3 mRNA expression via MAVS. This outline suggested that the anti-influenza effects of RDN were regarding homeostasis of the body caused by stress response, however not concerning with direct anti-virus activity. RDN injection has various functions; such as absolution heat, eliminate flatus, and detoxification, clinically used in the curative of hyperpyrexia, influenza and body pain, cough, yellow sputum, and other symptoms raised by respiratory tract infection. RDN injection has been openly applied with good clinical performance [
