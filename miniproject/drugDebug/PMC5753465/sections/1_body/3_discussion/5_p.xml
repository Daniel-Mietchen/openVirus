<p id="Par37">Until now, it has been cloudy how dengue viremia levels contribute to the severity of the disease, after that reducing viremia by antiviral drugs to reduce the symptoms of DF [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Found that higher level of viremia was linked with increased DENV intensity and proposed that lowering viremia may reduce morbidity and the risk of dengue hemorrhagic fever or dengue shock syndrome. Infected mice by dengue showing increased TNF-a, IFN-g and IL-6 levels, which were recognized as triggers for DENV were also reported. We have found that reducing blood some immune parameters through the use of antiviral treatment significantly decreases proinflammatory cytokine levels and increases the concentrations of coagulants factors in the blood of treated patients. These results indicated that lowering proinflammatory cytokine parameters through timely antiviral drug treatment may improve the severity of DF symptoms and perhaps decrease the risk of progression.
