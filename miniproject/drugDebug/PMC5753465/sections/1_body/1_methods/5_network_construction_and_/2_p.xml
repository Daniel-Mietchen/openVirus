To explore comprehensively the interrelationship between potential targets and miRNAs expressions which will help us to select out those specific targets genes correlated with DENV disease. In the resultant networks, miRNAs predicted targets genes and enrichment functions diseases were illustrated via nodes; while edges indicated the interactions between them.
