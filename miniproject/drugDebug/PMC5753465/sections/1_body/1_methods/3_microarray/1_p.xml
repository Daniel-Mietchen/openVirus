<p id="Par11">Three days post Acetaminophen or RDN contaminated LRD or non-treated infection patients group. Plasma samples were drawn in PAXgene tubes to maintain miRNAs integrity and provide a snapshot of in vivo blood expression while minimizing time and manipulation variations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Total RNA was extracted by mirVana miRNAs isolation kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and was amplified and assorted according to the Affymetrix GeneChip Total Transcript Sense Target Labeling protocol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Replicate miRNAs in duplicate samples were averaged and miRNAs with intensities of ≥50 in all samples from each group (DF-infected or treated groups) were selected for calculation of the normalization factor. Expressed data were median-normalized. Following normalization, significantly differentially expressed miRNAs were identified through Volcano Plot filtering as described by Cui and Churchill [
