 <caption> Acetaminophen, LRD and RDN induces proinflammatory cytokines production. Human supernatants infected with DENV in the presence or absence of Acetaminophen, LRD and RDN at infection and persisted in the medium. The clinical scores of patients treated with various doses, 1.3 g tablet orally three times daily of Acetaminophen or 10 mg of LRD tablet and 20 ml of RDN injection one time daily.
