  <p>Network diagram of miRNAs-inflammatory target-function pathway relationship response to dengue virus (
   <bold>a</bold>) post treaded by RDN and LRD drugs. 
   <bold>b</bold> miRNAs- inflammatory target-function pathway, response to dengue virus post treated by Acetaminophen drug. A miRNA and a target are linked if the target protein is hit by the corresponding miRNAs. Similarly, a target and a functional module are linked if the target is involved in this biological process. Node size is proportional to its degree and the letters are node labels
