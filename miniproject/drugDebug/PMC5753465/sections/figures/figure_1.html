 <caption> Network diagram of miRNAs expression and predicted target genes response to dengue virus infection without treatment ( a) miRNAs-gene target relationship. A miRNA and a target are linked if the target protein is hit by the corresponding miRNA. b miRNAs-target-function pathway network. A miRNA and a target are linked if the target protein is hit by the corresponding miRNAs. Similarly, a target and a functional module are linked if the target is involved in this biological process. Node size is proportional to its degree and the letters are node labels </caption>
