 <caption> Network diagram of miRNAs-immune target-function pathway response to dengue virus ( a) post treated by RDN and LRD drugs. b miRNAs-immune target-function pathway, response to dengue virus post treated by Acetaminophen drug. A miRNA and a target are linked if the target protein is hit by the corresponding miRNAs. Similarly, a target and a functional module are linked if the target is involved in this biological process. Node size is proportional to its degree and the letters are node labels </caption>
