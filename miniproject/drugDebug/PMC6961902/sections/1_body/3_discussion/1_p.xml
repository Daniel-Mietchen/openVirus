<p>Our meta-analysis showed that most patients with HBV-GN were successfully treated with antiviral therapy, and the summary estimate for the OR of proteinuria decrease at the end of therapy was 11.64 (95% CI: 5.17−26.21). Similar results were reported in previous meta analyses[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,

 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Compared with CR, the quantity of PR could not reflect the treatment effects, so our study focused on total remission (CR+PR) and CR. From the numerical results, we found that the included patients all experienced benefits in total remission and CR. However, the CR statistics showed larger heterogeneity than did total remission. This finding indicated that the clinical efficacy of these trials differed. To make accurate decisions regarding treatment for different groups of patients and explore the sources of heterogeneity, we carried out subgroup and sensitivity analyses to identify the influencing factors. In the prespecified subgroup analysis, the test for differences among age subgroups showed a moderate difference with 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.06, and the OR for pediatric patients was 57.71, which was much larger than that of adult patients (OR = 6.38). Heterogeneity decreased to I
 <sup>2</sup> = 0% in both pediatric and adult patients. The results showed that pediatric patients were more sensitive to antiviral therapy than adults, which illustrated that children recovered more easily. Subgroup differences in drug type (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.10) were not very significant. IFNs were more effective than NAs. This result was not inconsistent with Yang’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which proved IFNs and NAs were equally effective at causing proteinuria remission. However, Yang’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] only focused on MN (membranous nephropathy) patients, we considered different research subjects might lead to conflicting conclusions. Furthermore, the study type and follow-up duration subgroups did not differ in terms of results. The sensitivity analysis showed that Sun’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Panomsak’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were the main source of influence on CR. Renal pathological examination in these studies revealed that the pathologic types were various, IgA nephropathy had a lager proportion. While, almost all of the HBV-GN patients presented MN in other studies, except 2 patients in Bhimma’s study[
 <xref rid="pone.0227532.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were MPGN (Mesangial Proliferative Glomerular Nephritis), which may be the reason for influencing heterogeneity.
