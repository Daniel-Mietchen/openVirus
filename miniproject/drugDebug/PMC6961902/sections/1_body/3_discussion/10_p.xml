<p>In summary, pediatric patients were sensitive to antiviral drugs, which could be used fairly easily to mitigate proteinuria, and they required a shorter duration of treatment than did adults. Therefore, we think that further implementation of randomized controlled trials on pediatric patients would be straightforward. A comparison between IFNs and NAs demonstrated that IFNs were more effective, but the incidence of side effects was higher for IFNs than for NAs. We conclude that an individualized therapy program considering treatment efficacy and side effects is the best option for patients.</p>
