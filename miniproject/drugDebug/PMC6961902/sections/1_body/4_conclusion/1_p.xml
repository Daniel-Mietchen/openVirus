<p>In summary, some broad conclusions can be drawn. Our results strengthen the evidence that antiviral therapy is effective in antiviral treatment groups compared to control groups. It was particularly effective in attaining remission of proteinuria and improving HBeAg clearance but failed to improve the eGFR. Antiviral treatment has a definite therapeutic effect on children, and IFNs seem more effective than NAs. However, NAs showed fewer adverse reactions than IFNs, so we tend to choose drugs based on a patient's specific condition. Follow-up duration and study type did not have major impacts on the results. Our study highlights the need for randomized controlled trials in the area of HBV-GN, so we can evaluate the best antiviral approach.</p>
