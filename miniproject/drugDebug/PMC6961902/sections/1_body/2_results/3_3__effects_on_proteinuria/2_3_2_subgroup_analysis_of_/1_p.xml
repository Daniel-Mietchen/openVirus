<p>To compare the effects of IFNs and NAs, we analyzed two subgroups. NA treatment for HBV-GN was assessed in 4 studies, and IFN treatment was assessed in 3 studies. Panomsak’s[

Proteinuria was significantly decreased in the NA group (OR = 6.67, 95% CI: 2.50−17.80) and the IFN group (OR = 38.76, 95% CI: 7.03−213.71,
