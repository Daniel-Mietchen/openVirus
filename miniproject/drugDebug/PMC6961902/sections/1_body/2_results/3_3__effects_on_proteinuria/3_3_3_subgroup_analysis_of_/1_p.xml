<p>Six studies included adult patients, and the other two studies included pediatric patients. The adult group had 103 patients, composing 56.6% of the total 182 patients, and the pediatric group had 79 patients, accounting for 43.4%. A fixed-effect model was used. The proteinuria evaluation in both the pediatric patients (OR = 57.71, 95% CI: 7.21−461.82) and the adult patients (OR = 6.38, 95% CI: 2.51−16.24) emphasized the good effect of antiviral therapy on adult patients and pediatric patients (
