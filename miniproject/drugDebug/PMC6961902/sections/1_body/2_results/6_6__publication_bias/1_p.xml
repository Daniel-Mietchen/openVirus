<p>Publication bias may exist when no significant findings remain unpublished thus artificially inflating the apparent magnitude of an effect. Begg’s test and Egger’s test were performed to assess the publication bias for total remission of proteinuria and suggested the absence of publication bias (Begg’s test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.230; Egger’s test: 
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.191).
