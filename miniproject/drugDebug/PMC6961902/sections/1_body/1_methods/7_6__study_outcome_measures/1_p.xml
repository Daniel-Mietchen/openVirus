<p>The primary outcomes that this systematic review focused on were renal remission rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the secondary outcome measure was HBeAg clearance. Complete remission (CR) of proteinuria was defined as urinary protein excretion less 0.3 g in 24 hours. Partial remission (PR) represented a decline in urinary protein excretion by 50% or a decline below the baseline value with an absolute amount greater than 0.3 g in 24 hours. Virologic response was defined as clearance of HBeAg from serum. These definitions are the standard definitions used in the current scientific literature.</p>
