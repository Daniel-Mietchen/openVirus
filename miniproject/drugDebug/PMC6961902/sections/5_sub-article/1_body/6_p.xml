<p>After initial evaluation of revised manuscript, I decided to send the manuscript for peer-review again to improve its scientific presentation to reach a level aligned for publication in PLOS ONE. One of the main points is proofing the English expression of manuscript before acceptance. Authors can ask a colleague expert in English writing or a professional English editing service to improve their manuscript English expression.</p>
