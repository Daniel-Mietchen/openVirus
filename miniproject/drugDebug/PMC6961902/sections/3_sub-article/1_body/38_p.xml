<p>14. My main concern is the discussion. It is currently concentrated on the results and less discuss the findings. There are much talked about heterogeneity while it is a technical issue while they should concentrate on overall effect of the pooled analysis. They added some information on the mechanism of HBV-GN, I am not against presentation of such information however much is not needed and there is lack of information on how significant is the treatment of HBV-GN and what is the recommendation of authors for treatment of HBV-GN based on the results of meta-analysis. Moreover, in a paragraph, the limitations have been included however, I would like to ask authors to highlight what are the strengths of their study and how it is changing the current knowledge while few meta-analysis have been published even recently (2016).</p>
