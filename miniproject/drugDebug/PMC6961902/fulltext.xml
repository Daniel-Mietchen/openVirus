Method: We searched for controlled clinical trials on anti-viral therapy for HBV-GN in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed from inception to March 11<sup>th</sup> 2019. Seven trials, including 182 patients met the criteria for evaluating. The primary outcome measures were proteinuria and changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the secondary outcome measure was hepatitis B e-antigen clearance.

The global prevalence of chronic HBV in 2016 was close to 3.9%, which equates to approximately 292 million HBsAg-positive individuals, making it one of the most common human pathogens, and there is large regional variation[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. In addition to its effects on the liver, patients with HBV have extrahepatic manifestations of renal disease. In a single-center retrospective trial, Zhang et al[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that 3% (n = 352) of a total of 11,618 kidney biopsies performed from 1987 to 2012 in Beijing, China, were HBV-GN positive.</p><p>Treatment of HBV-GN remains a challenge for clinicians, the use of steroids or immunity inhibitors is still controversial because of the risk of activating viral infections, so the mainstay of treatment continues to be antiviral therapy. Several drugs are now available for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and are mainly one of two types: nucleos (t) ide analogs (NAs), such as lamivudine, adefovir, entecavir, telbivudine, and tenofovir, and interferons (IFNs)[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. However, their efficacy and safety remain poorly established and uncertain.</p><p>Several meta-analyses[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have been published regarding the effects of different therapies in HBV-GN patients; three studies[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] focused on the effects of antiviral treatment on HBV-GN but were completed before 2011. However, previous investigators did not provide details regarding to therapies, such as treatment for patients of different ages, antiviral drug selection or treatment duration. Standardized treatment guidelines that are personalized and appropriate for the current therapeutic regimen are lacking. Therefore, we performed an updated systematic review of clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of antiviral therapy for HBV-GN.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><p>We performed our meta-analysis as suggested by the Cochrane guidelines[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

All statistical analyses were performed using RevMan 5.3 (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, England). The sensitivity analyses and publication bias assessment were performed using STATA 13.1 (Stata Corp., College Station, Texas, USA). When original data were not mentioned in the article but were found presented in reports and references as functional X-Y type scatter or line plots, Plot Digitizer 2.6.8.0 was used to digitize scanned plots of the functional data. Subgroup analyses were planned to explore potential sources of variability in the observed treatment effects.

Study outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcomes that this systematic review focused on were renal remission rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and the secondary outcome measure was HBeAg clearance. Complete remission (CR) of proteinuria was defined as urinary protein excretion less 0.3 g in 24 hours. Partial remission (PR) represented a decline in urinary protein excretion by 50% or a decline below the baseline value with an absolute amount greater than 0.3 g in 24 hours.

Similar results were reported in previous meta analyses[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Compared with CR, the quantity of PR could not reflect the treatment effects, so our study focused on total remission (CR+PR) and CR. From the numerical results, we found that the included patients all experienced benefits in total remission and CR. However, the CR statistics showed larger heterogeneity than did total remission. This finding indicated that the clinical efficacy of these trials differed. To make accurate decisions regarding treatment for different groups of patients and explore the sources of heterogeneity, we carried out subgroup and sensitivity analyses to identify the influencing factors. In the prespecified subgroup analysis, the test for differences among age subgroups showed a moderate difference with <italic>P</italic> = 0.06, and the OR for pediatric patients was 57.71, which was much larger than that of adult patients (OR = 6.38). Heterogeneity decreased to I<sup>2</sup> = 0% in both pediatric and adult patients. The results showed that pediatric patients were more sensitive to antiviral therapy than adults, which illustrated that children recovered more easily. Subgroup differences in drug type (<italic>P</italic> = 0.10) were not very significant. IFNs were more effective than NAs. This result was not inconsistent with Yang&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which proved IFNs and NAs were equally effective at causing proteinuria remission. However, Yang&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] only focused on MN (membranous nephropathy) patients, we considered different research subjects might lead to conflicting conclusions. Furthermore, the study type and follow-up duration subgroups did not differ in terms of results. The sensitivity analysis showed that Sun&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and Panomsak&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were the main source of influence on CR. Renal pathological examination in these studies revealed that the pathologic types were various, IgA nephropathy had a lager proportion. While, almost all of the HBV-GN patients presented MN in other studies, except 2 patients in Bhimma&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] were MPGN (Mesangial Proliferative Glomerular Nephritis), which may be the reason for influencing heterogeneity.</p><p>The effect of antiviral therapy on eGFR was not obvious. The first reason for poor efficacy was age because the standards for eGFR for adult patients and pediatric patients are not the same, so they are not suitable for combining together for analysis. Second, body weight and sex could affect eGFR, and the patients that were included may have been heterogeneous with respect to these indicators. In addition, antiviral drugs associated with nephrotoxicity, such as adefovir dipivoxil, tenofovir and IFNs, should also be taken into consideration. These are excreted through the kidney, and high concentrations of both the drugs and their metabolites can cause renal injury. Izzedine&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] demonstrated that adefovir dipivoxil (120 mg/d) could increase the serum creatinine level by 44 &#x003bc;mol/L in HIV-infected patients. Kara AV&#x02018;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] found that tenofovir could decrease the eGFR and that the change in eGFR was not statistically significant. The after sensitivity analysis also confirmed that Sun&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], which chose lamivudine as an intervention, has a great influence on the heterogeneity. In addition, inconsistency of renal pathologic types may also be a factor. Wang et al[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] performed a meta-analysis and decleared that NA monotherapy could protect renal function and preventing Scr (Serum creatinine) elevation. However, our results didn&#x02019;t show significant improvement in renal function, especially under treatment of NAs.</p><p>Our results showed that antiviral therapy could increase HBeAg seroconversion. Other meta analyses also showed the same results[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HBeAg seroconversion marks the immune-active phase of disease transition to the inactive carrier state[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Among the included trials, Tang&#x02019;s study[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] made the results heterogeneous. The sample size of their trial was smaller, and we considered that the results were more likely to be biased. Serum HBV DNA is a sensitive quantitative index that could facilitate the monitoring of response to treatment. The National Institutes of Health Workshop proposed an arbitrary serum HBV DNA level of 10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL to differentiate chronic hepatitis B from an inactive carrier state. Another study claimed that 33% of patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis had HBV DNA levels that were persistently above 10<sup>5</sup> copies/mL[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to these data, we considered that in terms of reflecting the disease condition, HBeAg clearance could replace serum HBV DNA to some extent. Two trials[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] included in our study mentioned serum HBV DNA as an outcome indicator, but they did not provide concrete values; they only described the numbers of patients that had a decrease in serum HBV DNA. For the above reasons, we did not evaluate the effect of drugs based on this indicator.</p><p>The incidence of adverse reactions for IFNs was greater than for NAs. The side effects of the groups were different from each other, but most of them were within the tolerable range. Reducing the dose could result in the relief of symptoms.</p><p>Antiviral drugs were initially intended to treat HBV infection, but the present findings proved these have a curative four major mechanisms: (1) HB immune complexes of macromolecules were deposited in the mesangial area and sub-endodermis, leading to different pathological types. One is circulating immune complexes of viral antigen and host antibody, and the other is in situ immune complexes involving viral antigens bound to glomerular structures[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Previous studies have reported that HBeAg is the primary antigen related to subepithelial deposits in patients with HBV-MN[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Takekoshi et al[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] supported the view that immune complexes, especially those containing HBeAg, were essential in the pathogenesis of HBV-GN.</p><p>(2) HBV infection of nephrocytes induces a cytopathic effect[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Thus, the hypothesis does not have a definite answer and needs further evidence.</p><p>(3) Virus-induced specific immunological effector mechanisms (specific T lymphocyte or antibody) that damage the kidney, which induces pathologic damage (such as cell apoptosis and proliferation) and HBV replication in renal tissue. Host immunodeficiency and virus variation are thought to be the most subtle contributions to persistent HBV infection.</p><p>(4) HBV in tissue could express viral proteins or pro-inflammatory cytokines, resulting in renal injury[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>Human HBV is a small, enveloped, primarily hepatotropic DNA virus[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. NAs can suppress viral replication by inhibiting the activity of HBV polymerase in the infected liver, but they cannot eliminate existing viruses or eradicate HBV cccDNA[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. IFNs bind to cellular receptors and induce large numbers of genes termed IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). ISGs are multifunctional and can inhibit HBV replication at different stages: they can suppress cccDNA transcription and accelerate cccDNA decay, inhibit the activity of HBV enhancers, influence posttranscriptional control of HBV replication, and inhibit HBV nucleocapsid formation. Furthermore, IFNs can also activate antiviral enzymes and stimulate an immunomodulatory effect[<xref rid="pone.0227532.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In summary, pediatric patients were sensitive to antiviral drugs, which could be used fairly easily to mitigate proteinuria, and they required a shorter duration of treatment than did adults. Therefore, we think that further implementation of randomized controlled trials on pediatric patients would be straightforward. A comparison between IFNs and NAs demonstrated that IFNs were more effective, but the incidence of side effects was higher for IFNs than for NAs. We conclude that an individualized therapy program considering treatment efficacy and side effects is the best option for patients.</p><p>Several limitations in our meta-analysis should be considered. First, the quality of our analysis could be improved by a larger sample size and longer follow-up. Observational studies are not the best study design to answer intervention questions because of bias and confounding, the effects of which are unpredictable and may result in an overestimate, an underestimate, or true estimate of the effect. The limited number of studies available and patients enrolled in each study reduced the strength of our final conclusions. Second, dosage and treatment duration for drug administration and the follow-up duration might have influenced the clinical trial data. Third, patients enrolled in our study had a variety of renal lesion types. Because the clinical results of patients with renal puncture pathology are unavailable, no further subgroup analysis could be performed. Finally, trials in our meta-analysis were all in English and conducted in Asian countries and mostly limited to China. This geographic concentration is probably the reason for the high prevalence of HBV infection in these countries. As a result, our conclusions concerning the efficacy and safety of antiviral treatments may not apply to European or American patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec025"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, some broad conclusions can be drawn. Our results strengthen the evidence that antiviral therapy is effective in antiviral treatment groups compared to control groups. It was particularly effective in attaining remission of proteinuria and improving HBeAg clearance but failed to improve the eGFR. Antiviral treatment has a definite therapeutic effect on children, and IFNs seem more effective than NAs. However, NAs showed fewer adverse reactions than IFNs, so we tend to choose drugs based on a patient's specific condition. Follow-up duration and study type did not have major impacts on the results. Our study highlights the need for randomized controlled trials in the area of HBV-GN, so we can evaluate the best antiviral approach.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec026"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227532.s001"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Search strategy for the PubMed database.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227532.s001.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227532.s002"><label>S2 Fig</label><caption><title>The Cochrane Collaboration&#x02019;s tool for randomized controlled trials.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227532.s002.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227532.s003"><label>S3 Fig</label><caption><title>Sensitivity analysis of CR in all trials.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227532.s003.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227532.s004"><label>S4 Fig</label><caption><title>Sensitivity analysis of the eGFR in all trials.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227532.s004.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227532.s005"><label>S5 Fig</label><caption><title>Sensitivity analysis of HBeAg clearance in all trials.</title><p>(TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227532.s005.tif"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0227532.s006"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>PRISMA 2009 checklist.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0227532.s006.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0227532.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><collab>Collaborators TPO</collab>. <article-title>Global prevalence, treatment, and prevention of hepatitis B virus infection in 2016: a modelling study</article-title>. <source>Lancet Gastroenterol Hepatol</source>. <year>2018</year>;<volume>3</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>383</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>403</lpage>. <pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1016/S2468-1253(18)30056-6</pub-id>

Therefore, we invite you to submit a revised version of the manuscript that addresses the points raised during the review process.</p><p>This interesting meta-analysis was evaluated by the reviewers and the feedback was positive regarding the acceptance of their manuscript in PLOS ONE. Reviewers asked for minor comments which should be considered by the authors in the revised manuscript. One of the reviewers raised a major concern regarding the "additional outcome measure of suppression or clearance&#x000a0;of hepatitis B DNA" which should be carefully take into consideration by the authors.&#x000a0;</p><p>We would appreciate receiving your revised manuscript by Oct 11 2019 11:59PM.

Please find them:</p><p>1. Authors used # to show the authors with equal contribution however, only one author's name tagged with #.</p><p>2. In the first line of abstract it has been pointed to "corticosteroid" while there is nothing on&#x000a0;corticosteroids in the study design and results.</p><p>3. In abstract, "proteinuria 18 (OR=10.48, 95% CI: 4.60&#x0fffd;23.89, I2=0%, P=0.80)". Is the P for heterogeneity or overall effect? It should be clarified.</p><p>4. I guess the results for&#x000a0;eGFR should be the mean difference of eGFR instead of OR.</p><p>5. In introduction, "where four studies[4,6,7]" while 3 study have been cited.</p><p>6.&#x000a0; In Methods, "In the absence of statistically significant heterogeneity I2&#x0003e;50%" I2 &#x0003e;50% means significant heterogeneity.</p><p>7. Page 11, Line 14, "Eight studies were conducted evaluating" 7 or 8?</p><p>8.&#x000a0;Page 12, Line 1, "fixed model" or fixed-effect model?</p><p>9.&#x000a0;Page 12, Line 4,&#x000a0;heterogeneity was highly significant (I2=0%, P=0.80). I2=0% and significant&#x000a0;heterogeneity?</p><p>10.&#x000a0;Page 12, Line 10, "We conducted a sensitivity analysis of all studies (Fig 5)." but 6 studies entered in&#x000a0;sensitivity analysis.</p><p>11.&#x000a0;Page 12, Lines 12-15 and in Figure 4, these overall effects caused by repeated inclusion of studies in the meta-analysis. I recommend to exclude it from manuscript and from the Total OR (95% CI) in the bottom part of forest plot in Figure 4. The same can be true for Figure 8 and Figure 9 with inclusion of studies multiple times make a false total overall effect.</p><p>12. Page 14, "Meanwhile, in trials with IFNs, the treatment group was not obviously affected (P&#x0003c;0.00001, I2=100%). Are they talking about heterogeneity? The heterogeneity is high with I2=100.</p><p>13. For pooled effect of clearance of HBeAg in antiviral therapy, the I2=63% and yet using fixed effect model.</p><p>14. My main concern is the discussion. It is currently concentrated on the results and less discuss the findings. There are much talked about heterogeneity while it is a technical issue while they should concentrate on overall effect of the pooled analysis. They added some information on the mechanism of HBV-GN, I am not against presentation of such information however much is not needed and there is lack of information on how significant is the treatment of HBV-GN and what is the recommendation of authors for treatment of HBV-GN based on the results of meta-analysis. Moreover, in a paragraph, the limitations have been included however, I would like to ask authors to highlight what are the strengths of their study and how it is changing the current knowledge while few meta-analysis have been published even recently (2016).</p><p>15.

Conclusion of abstract should be concise.</p><p>2. Page 3, Line 18, use "nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs)" instead of "nucleoside analogs (NAs)".</p><p>3. I didn't find S1 Table.</p><p>4. It was stated "Heterogeneity between data sources was noted in the CR rate of all trials (I2=23%, P=0.26) and CCTs (I2=9%, P=0.36)." while based on I2 there is no significant heterogeneity between studies. Page 12, Lines 9-11</p><p>5. What is "(I2=0%&#x0003c;50%, P=0.77)"? Page 12, Line 14</p><p>6. Page 12, Lines 11-12,&#x000a0;"Our analysis determined that the study by Lin et al[17] was the source of heterogeneity.", based on Figure 4, I expect the study by Fang et al to cause heterogeneity.</p><p>7. Figure 3, the scale of first plot and the two next plots should be the same. all 0.001-1000 or 0.01-100.</p><p>8. Regarding the sensitivity analysis plots, why the scales are not aligned with the results of meta-analysis? For example, in figure 4, the OR is 2.58 while I expect an OR 11.64 based on the meta-analysis. This is true for other sensitivity analysis plots as well.</p><p>9. Figure 7, in caption of plot, the OR&#x0003e;1 should favours experimental and OR&#x0003c;1 should favours control.</p><p>[Note: HTML markup is below.

Almost all of my comments are addresses, but a minor issue is still remained in the manuscript. Eleven figures are not recommended in a paper. You can move 4 other figures (2, 4, 9, 11) to the supplementary materials (supporting information).</p><p>Regards</p><p>Reviewer</p><p>Reviewer #4: Dear Associated Editor</p><p>I am very thankful for giving me the opportunity to review the manuscript entitled &#x0201c;Efficacy and safety of anti-viral therapy for Hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis: a meta-analysis&#x0201d; and evaluate it for publishing in PLOS ONE. This manuscript has been revised once. I appreciate the efforts authors put into this work. However, I would like to mention some major point for authors:</p><p>1. The manuscript needs writing edit for English language:</p><p>a) Improve overall readability</p><p>b) Use shorter sentences</p><p>c) Pay attention to punctuation (for instance in the third line of introduction dot and comma used together.)</p><p>d) There are several grammatical errors in the manuscript (As an example the first sentence of the second paragraph of introduction has totally wrong structure)</p><p>2. Authors declared that there were several meta-analysis in this field and there were published before 2011 and that is the reason they performed this study. Only two included studies published after 2011, do they have great impact on the results and evidences?! What is the benefit of your study?</p><p>3. Mention the exact PICOS of the study at the end of the introduction section.</p><p>4. Mention the exact time you performed your search, in the methods section.</p><p>5. Provide search strategy for at least one database.</p><p>6. Why did you searched PUBMED and MEDLINE?? When you are searching PUBMED you are searching MEDLINE, too.</p><p>7. Provide more information about covering grey literature. How did you cover this and which conferences did you check.</p><p>8. Did you consider any specific language in the search? Four of seven included studies are from China.</p><p>9. Write &#x0201c;Eligibility criteria&#x0201d; section in an organized way. It is really confusing.</p><p>10. Mention the outcome you expected to find in the included articles, in the &#x0201c;Eligibility criteria&#x0201d; section.</p><p>11. In &#x0201c;Data extraction&#x0201d; section, mention the exact variables you extracted from the studies. Do not use &#x0201c;So on&#x0201d;.</p><p>12. Did you pay attention to funding source of the studies? You did not mention this.</p><p>13. Third line of &#x0201c;Statistical analysis&#x0201d; section, the sentence &#x0201c;In the absence of...&#x0201d; can be deleted. You have discussed this further.</p><p>14. You included seven studies. Four from China, two from other parts of Asia and one from Africa. How do you discuss this distribution?</p><p>15. &#x0201c;Subgroup analysis of association between efficacy and study types&#x0201d; part should be totally revised. First, discuss the heterogeneity results and then report the analysis results.</p><p>16. In &#x0201c;Subgroup analysis of association between efficacy and study types&#x0201d; section, heterogeneity of CCTs was reported twice in the 8th and 11th line with different statistics. Please rewrite this part and make it clear if they are different variables.</p><p>17. In the second line of &#x0201c;Effects on eGFR&#x0201d; section, replace &#x0201c;anti-virus therapy&#x0201d; with &#x0201c;anti-viral therapy&#x0201d;.</p><p>18. In the fifth line of &#x0201c;Effects on eGFR&#x0201d; section, authors declared &#x0201c;it seems that NAs has therapeutic effect on eGFR&#x0201d;. However, the reported confidence interval includes zero. Please clarify this part.</p><p>19. The discussion part is written like introduction section. Study results should be discussed and compared with other studies. Discussion section needs an overall revision.</p><p>**********</p><p>7.
