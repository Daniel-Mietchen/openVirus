    "OBJECTIVES:To assess the potency of anti-viral treatment for hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN). Method: We searched for controlled clinical trials on anti-viral therapy for HBV-GN in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed from inception to March 11th 2019. Seven trials, including 182 patients met the criteria for evaluating. The primary outcome measures were proteinuria and changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the secondary outcome measure was hepatitis B e-antigen clearance. A fixed or random effect model was established to analyze the data. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the effects of clinical trial type, anti-viral drug type, age, and follow-up duration. RESULTS:The total remission rate of proteinuria (OR = 10.48, 95% CI: 4.60-23.89, I2 = 0%), complete remission rate of proteinuria (OR = 11.64, 95% CI: 5.17-26.21, I2 = 23%) and clearance rate of Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg) were significantly higher in the anti-viral treatment group than in the control group (OR = 27.08, 95% CI: 3.71-197.88, I2 = 63%). However, antiviral therapy was not as effective regarding the eGFR (MD = 5.74, 95% CI: -4.24-15.73). In the subgroup analysis, age and drug type had significant impacts on proteinuria remission, and study type and follow-up duration only slightly affected the heterogeneity. CONCLUSION:Antiviral therapy induced remission of proteinuria and increased HBeAg clearance but failed to improve the eGFR. Pediatric patients were more sensitive to antiviral therapy than adults. IFNs seem more effective but are accompanied by more adverse reactions than NAs."
