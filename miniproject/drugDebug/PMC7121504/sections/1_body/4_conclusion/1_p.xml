<p>Spontaneous human behavioral changes triggered by the perceived risk of infection can remarkably alter the spread of an epidemic, leading to different epidemic dynamics. In particular, if changes in behavioral patterns are fast enough, they can have a remarkable effect in reducing the daily prevalence of infection and the final epidemic size. In addition, human response may also lead to quite rich epidemic dynamics including, for example, the occurrence of multiple epidemic waves. OurÂ performed investigation singles out the main determinants of human behavior and risk perception leading to remarkable alterations of the dynamics of an epidemic outbreak. First, if the perceived risk associated to an epidemic is sufficiently large, even a small decrease in the number of potentially infectious contacts can remarkably reduce the impact of an epidemic. Second, the disease spread is highly sensitive to how rapidly people adopt self-protecting behavioral patterns. Third, when the population becomes aware only late of a new epidemic outbreak, the effectiveness of human response reduces. However, when the mechanism regulating the spread of information about the disease is sufficiently fast, spontaneous social distancing is always effective.</p>
