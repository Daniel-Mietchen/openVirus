<p>As mentioned above, a major responsiveness of the population to an infection corresponds to a small prevalence threshold (large values of 
 <italic>m</italic>) and to large values of ρ. The responsiveness of the population is related to time at which the behavioral response starts to affect the population behavior. As the population responsiveness increases, a larger reduction in the final epidemic size and in the daily peak prevalence is observed (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a and b). However, if the prevalence threshold 1 ∕ 
 <italic>m</italic> is larger than the maximum prevalence of infections, or the imitation process is too slow (i.e., for small values of ρ), the human response never takes place and the epidemic spreads following the dynamics of an SIR model driven by

 <italic>m</italic> is larger than
