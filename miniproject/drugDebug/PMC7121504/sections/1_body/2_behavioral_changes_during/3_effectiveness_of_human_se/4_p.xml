<p>At this point three interesting aspects are worth highlighting: 
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Even a small reduction in the number of contagious contacts enacted by the population can remarkably alter the spread of the epidemic.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>A threshold exists for 
    <italic>q</italic> such that for smaller values of 
    <italic>q</italic> a larger impact of behavioral changes on the final epidemic size, the daily peak prevalence, and the peak day does not occur. Indeed, in terms of the final epidemic size and the peak day, a reduction of 100 
    <italic>%</italic> in the number of potentially infectious contacts (corresponding to 
    <italic>q</italic> = 0, i.e., total isolation) produces the same effects obtained by considering a reduction of 25 
    <italic>%</italic> (
    <italic>q</italic> = 0. 75).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>For small values of 
    <italic>q</italic>, the model accounts for multiple epidemic waves. A detailed discussion on the conditions for observing such a pattern can be found in  [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].
