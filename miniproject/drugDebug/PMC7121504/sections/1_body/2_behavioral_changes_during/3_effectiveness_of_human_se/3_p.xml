<p>The size of reduction in contagious contacts associated to the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior has a strong impact on the epidemic dynamics. A larger reduction of the risk of infection is enacted by individuals adopting the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior when smaller values of 
 <italic>q</italic> are considered. As 
 <italic>q</italic> decreases, the final epidemic size and the daily peak prevalence reduce as well (see Fig.â€‰
