<p>A misperception of risk may occur when the population becomes aware of a new epidemic outbreak after a period of time since the emergence of the epidemic. This situation can be investigated by assuming that the perceived prevalence is initially equal to zero for a certain period of time, 
 <italic>T</italic>. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b shows that the effectiveness of human response diminishes when a larger delay is considered. In particular, daily peak prevalence and final epidemic size increase as 
 <italic>T</italic> increases and, no relevant effects on the outbreak can be detected when the “alert” takes place too late.
