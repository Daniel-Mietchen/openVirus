<p>The resulting dynamics of System (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>) is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. After an initial growth of the epidemic, the perceived prevalence reaches the prevalence threshold 1 ∕ 
 <italic>m</italic> and the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior becomes more convenient. As a consequence when the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior became widely adopted in the population, which occurs after few days, the epidemic growth rate reduces remarkably. As the prevalence decreases below the threshold, the 
 <italic>normal</italic> behavior becomes more convenient and its diffusion produces a fat tail in the infection dynamics.
