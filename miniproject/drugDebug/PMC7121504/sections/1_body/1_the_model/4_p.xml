 </inline-formula>), but the extra cost associated to it (
 <italic>k</italic>) implies that the 
 <italic>normal</italic> behavior is the most convenient one when the perceived prevalence 
 <italic>M</italic> is small (or in absence of disease). Which behavior is more convenient to adopt clearly depends on the status of the epidemic. The balance of the payoff between the two possible behaviors is determined by the cost associated to the risk of infection and on the perceived prevalence of infections in the population (M(t)). The latter is modeled by assuming a fading memory mechanism (such in Â [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]) altering the perception of the risk of infection on the basis of the number of cases occurred over a certain (past) period of time.
