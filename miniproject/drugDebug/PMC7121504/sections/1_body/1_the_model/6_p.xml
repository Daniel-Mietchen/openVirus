<p>Basically, the last equation of the system accounts for the diffusion of the two different behaviors in the population. The first term of the equation accounts for a natural selection embedded into the transmission process that favors individuals reducing the risk of infection (

 </inline-formula>); the second term represents the imitation process and accounts for spontaneous changes in individual behaviors, based on the balance between the payoffs associated to the two different behaviors (i.e., 1 − 
 <italic>mM</italic>). Behavioral change driven by the imitation dynamics occurs depending on the difference between the payoffs of the two possible behaviors, the perceived prevalence, the level of the risk threshold, and the speed of the imitation process. The latter is in general different from the speed of the disease transmission process as imitation is based on the diffusion of information. Details on the derivation of the last equation in System
