<p>The disease transmission process is based on an SIR scheme, where susceptible individuals may adopt two mutually exclusive behaviors, 
 <italic>“normal”b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>“altered”b</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>
 </sub>, on the basis of the perceived risk of infection. We assume that individuals adopting the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior are able to reduce the risk of getting infected by reducing the number of potentially infectious contacts and, in turn, the force of infection to which they are exposed. This defensive response accounts for both reduction in physical contacts and, more in general, all self-prophylaxis measures which can reduce the transmission probability during these contacts. For instance, a reduction in the number of contacts can be achieved by avoiding crowded environments or by limiting travels, whereas a reduction in transmission probability can occur as a consequence of an increased wariness in common activities (e.g., the behavioral goals recommended by the WHO for reducing influenza transmission, such as washing hands frequently or respecting cough/respiratory etiquette).
