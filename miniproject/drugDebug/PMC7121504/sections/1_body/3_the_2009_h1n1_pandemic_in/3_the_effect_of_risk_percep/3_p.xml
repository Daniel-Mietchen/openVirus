<p>On the contrary, the model introduced in this chapter perfectly fits the observed ILI incidence (see red lines in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a and its subpanel) and provides a plausible explanation of the mechanisms responsible for the observed evolution of the ILI incidence. Indeed, the estimated parameter configuration obtained by fitting ILI incidence entails an initial overestimation of the perceived risk (which decreases over time), along with an initial diffusion of the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior in the population, which in turn is replaced by the 
 <italic>normal</italic> behavior during the course of the epidemic. In fact, at the beginning of the pandemic, the simulated population is led to adopt the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior by a high level of perceived risk of infection (as in the presence of a well-sustained circulation of the virus) and, as a consequence, the growth rate of the epidemic results lower than what would have been observed in a population adopting the 
 <italic>normal</italic> behavior. On the other hand, a decrease in the perceived risk of infection is observed, despite the (slow) increase in the actual number of cases. In fact, the latter depends on the combination of two opposite phenomena: the increase of new infections and the decline (slowed by the memory mechanism) of the perceived prevalence, which was overestimated in the early phases of the epidemic. As the perceived prevalence goes below the risk threshold 1 ∕ 
 <italic>m</italic>, the 
 <italic>normal</italic> behavior starts to spread quickly in the population as the most convenient strategy to be adopted through the subsequent course of the epidemic. This leads to a sudden change in the growth rate of the epidemic which is triggered by an increase of
