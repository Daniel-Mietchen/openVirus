<p>The model explains the observed ILI incidence only if an initial (persistent) diffusion of the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior in the population is considered. Specifically, an initial perceived risk of infection above the risk threshold, a long-lasting memory (able to keep the 
 <italic>altered</italic> behavior as apparently more convenient over a relevant period of time), and a fast imitation process (enough to produce a sudden change in the force of infection) are required.
