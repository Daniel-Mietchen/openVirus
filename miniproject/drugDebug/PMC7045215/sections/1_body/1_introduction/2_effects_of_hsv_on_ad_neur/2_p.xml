<p>Reactivation of the latent HSV1 virus in the trigeminal ganglion, which is the primary reservoir for HSV1 during latency, can occur decades after the original infection with retrograde axonal transport of HSV1 particles infiltrating the locus coeruleus and then progressing to the temporal lobe.
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Stress, decline in immune function and increased bloodâ€“brain barrier breakdown with age may predispose individuals to HSV reactivation.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In patients with HSV seropositive, viral DNA was detected from nearly all combined postmortem tissue samples of trigeminal and olfactory ganglia.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Dendritic nerve terminals of olfactory receptor neurons are directly exposed, and viruses can enter the brain via olfactory neurons.
