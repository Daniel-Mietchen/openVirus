<p>In experimental studies, HSV1 infection of neuronal and glial cells triggers a decrease in amyloid precursor protein, an increase in intracellular levels of amyloid beta-protein (Aβ), and phosphorylation of tau protein.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> HSV1 DNA is common in amyloid plaques in AD and HSV1 binding proteins are increased by 11-fold to 15-fold in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles.
 <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In an AD autopsy study, 90% of amyloid plaques contained HSV1 DNA and 72% of HSV1 DNA was plaque associated. In contrast, aged normal brains contained less plaques and only 24% of HSV1 DNA was plaque associated.
 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> HSV2 has effects similar to HSV1 on amyloid and tau protein.
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> HSV1 proteins are present in hippocampal neurons of mice infected intraperitoneally with HSV1, indicating that blood-borne transmission may occur with HSV1 and HSV2 and account for the 10% of cases of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) found to be caused by HSV2.
 <xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In a cell-culture model, the antiviral medications acyclovir, penciclovir and foscarnet reduced HSV1 particles and Aβ and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) accumulation.
 <xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These findings support an association between HSV and AD and suggest that antiviral medications may be therapeutic.
