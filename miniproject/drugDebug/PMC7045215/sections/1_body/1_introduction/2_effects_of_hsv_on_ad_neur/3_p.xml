<p>HSE (causative agent HSV1 in 90% of cases; HSV2 in 10% of cases) occurs in 2–4 per 500 000 people.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> In HSE, the virus infiltrates limbic structures, particularly the hippocampus and frontal lobes, and the consequent memory loss, cognitive deficits, mood and personality changes are similar to those in AD, including the long-term sequelae of anterograde memory loss, deficits in working memory and visual object recognition, anosmia and dysphasia.
 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The majority of HSE cases occur in people over 50 years old, possibly because blood–brain barrier disruption with ageing supports viral entry. Clinically, antiviral treatment with acyclovir or valacyclovir is effective in reducing mortality and severity of cognitive deficits in HSE.
