<p>Acting as an oral pro-drug, valacyclovir is converted in vivo to acyclovir, which is then converted by viral thymidine kinase into its acyclovir monophosphate (acyclo-GMP) and acyclovir triphosphate (acyclo-GTP) forms. Acyclo-GTP is a potent inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase with 100 times higher affinity for viral than cellular polymerase.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Viral enzymes cannot remove acyclo-GTP from the chain, which results in inhibition of further DNA polymerase activity and consequent chain termination. Its monophosphate form, acyclo-GMP, also incorporates into viral DNA, leading to chain termination. Therefore, valacyclovir leads to the death of infected cells without affecting the DNA of non-infected cells; hence, its side effect profile is benign.
