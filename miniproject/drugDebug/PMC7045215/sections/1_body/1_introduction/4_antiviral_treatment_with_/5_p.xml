<p>The recommended oral dose of valacyclovir for peripheral acute HSV infections is 1–3 g daily, and bioavailability is 54%.
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> For long-term HSV suppression, the recommended dose is 1 g daily. In the schizophrenia pilot trial that showed superiority for valacyclovir compared with placebo, the efficacious dose was 3 g daily.
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The difficulty in obtaining efficacy in AD in nearly all trials to date led to the choice of a flexible dose range of 2–4 g daily for Valacyclovir Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease (VALAD). The dose range of 2–4 g daily is safe, increases the chances of finding efficacy, and is well below the dose of 8 g daily reported to be toxic in patients with HIV infection.
 <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> In patients with MS, HSE and healthy controls, there is high brain penetration with a largely linear relationship between oral dose of valacyclovir and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) acyclovir levels. In MS, sustained CSF acyclovir levels persist for at least 6 months with continuing valacyclovir treatment.
 <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Based on the literature, CSF acyclovir levels are likely to be in the 3–6 µM range with oral valacyclovir doses of 2–4 g daily.
