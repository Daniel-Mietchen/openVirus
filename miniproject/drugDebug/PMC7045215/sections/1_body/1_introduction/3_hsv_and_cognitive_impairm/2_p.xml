<p>Apolipoprotein E (apoE) ε4 genotype is a well-established risk factor for AD. In animal models, during acute infection with HSV1, apoE ε4 seems to facilitate HSV1 latency in the brain much more than apoE ε3 and is more efficient than apoE ε3 in promoting viral colonisation of the brain.
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In the brains of patients who had AD, apoE ε4 was shown to be more common in HSV1-positive than HSV1-negative individuals, and apoE ε4 was more common in people with recurrent cold sores than people without cold sores.
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> These findings suggest that individuals with the apoE ε4 allele may be more susceptible to the effects of HSV in the brain.
