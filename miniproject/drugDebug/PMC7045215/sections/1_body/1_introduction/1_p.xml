<p>Some viruses can cause neurodegenerative disorders, for example, measles virus infection can lead, years later, to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) may be transmissible in mice and primates, possibly by a virus.
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2 3</xref> The long-standing viral aetiology hypothesis of AD posits that viruses in the brain, primarily herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) (causes oral herpes) and possibly HSV2 (causes genital herpes), may be aetiological or contribute to the pathology of AD.
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 5</xref> There is growing scientific recognition that microbes, particularly viruses like HSV1, may be a cause of AD or contribute to its pathology, and that an antiviral treatment trial is needed.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 6</xref> An emerging view is that amyloid may be a consequence of infection, and may have protective effects.
