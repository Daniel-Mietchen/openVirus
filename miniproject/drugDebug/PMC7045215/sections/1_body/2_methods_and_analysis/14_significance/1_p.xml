<p>In an editorial review, 31 senior scientists and clinicians pointed out that the scientific evidence strongly suggests that microbes may be a major cause of dementia, including AD.
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The review identified HSV1 as the most likely culprit and suggested an antiviral treatment trial to potentially slow or arrest disease progression in AD. VALAD is the first randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled antiviral drug treatment trial in AD or any type of dementia. If results are positive and confirmed in a larger phase III trial, it will provide a novel treatment approach for this devastating disease.
