<p>Valacyclovir or placebo will be started at 2 g daily (1 g twice daily) and then increased by 1 g daily every 2 weeks until 4 g daily or the maximum tolerated dose is reached, which will be maintained for the rest of the trial. Pills will be 500 mg each to reduce difficulties in swallowing the large 1 g pill. Patients who cannot tolerate valacyclovir 2 g per day (or matching placebo) will discontinue treatment but will be followed at all time-points under the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle. Pill counts will determine adherence. Non-adherence will lead to counselling of patients/caregivers and will not lead to study termination.</p>
