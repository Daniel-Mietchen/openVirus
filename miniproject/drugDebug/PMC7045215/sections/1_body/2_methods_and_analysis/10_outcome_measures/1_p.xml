<p>1. Primary: Change in ADAS-Cog11 scores from baseline to 78 weeks (Hypothesis 1). 2. Primary: Change in ADCS-ADL scores from baseline to 78 weeks (Hypothesis 2). 3. Secondary: Change in 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir brain uptake in sum of six ROIs from baseline to 78 weeks (Hypothesis 3). 4. Secondary: Change in 
 <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240 brain uptake in sum of two ROIs from baseline to 78 weeks (Hypothesis 4). 5. Exploratory: change in CIBIC-plus (global impression of change), CDR sum of boxes (cognition +function). 6. Exploratory: change in MRI AD ‘signature’ for cortical thinning and whole brain cortical thinning, and serum antiviral antibody levels, and evaluation of apoE ε4 genotype as a moderating factor for the two efficacy outcomes. In the subsample (estimated 40%) that gets CSF studies, we will obtain plasma and CSF acyclovir levels and examine plasma/CSF ratios; we will also obtain CSF Aβ
 <sub>42</sub>, tau, p-tau for subset exploratory analyses with changes in outcome measures. 7. AEs and serious AEs (SEs).
