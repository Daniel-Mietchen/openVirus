<p>ITT/dropouts and missing data: The primary analyses will be in the ITT sample, that is, all randomised subjects according to treatment assignment. If a subject stops treatment during the trial, we will continue to collect all measures for that subject and use the data in the final analyses. Missing data will be dealt with by using generalised linear mixed effects models under the ‘missing at random’ assumption. For MRI, PET (
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir and 
 <sup>18</sup>F-MK-6240), antiviral antibodies, CSF Aβ and tau/phospho tau outcomes with one pre-measure and post-measure, inverse probability weighting of cases with complete data will be used where weights are based on the probability of a subject being a completer versus a dropout. Sensitivity analysis will provide a range of plausible effect estimates that could arise due to non-ignorable missing data.
