<p>Hypotheses 1 and 2. We will use generalised linear mixed effects models of cognitive and functional measures collected repeatedly at specific time-points (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). Age and gender will be included as control variables if there is any evidence of randomisation imbalance. Cholinesterase inhibitors and/or memantine that are permitted during the trial may be related to cognitive outcomes; we will additionally control for their presence or absence. Hypothesis 3. Patients on valacyclovir will demonstrate less increase (less accumulation) in 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir uptake (sum of 6 ROIs; SUVR) than patients on placebo. We will use analysis of covariance with the preâ€“post change in 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir uptake as an outcome, baseline 
 <sup>18</sup>F-Florbetapir uptake as a covariate, treatment condition as a predictor, and baseline age and gender as additional control variables if warranted. Hypothesis 4. Analyses similar to Hypothesis three will be conducted with the data from the sum of two ROIs (SUVR) obtained using MK-6240 PET.
