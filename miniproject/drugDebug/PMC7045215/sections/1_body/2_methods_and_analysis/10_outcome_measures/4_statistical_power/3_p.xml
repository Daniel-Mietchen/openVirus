<p>Plans for phase III development. In this phase II study, if there is a significant effect favouring valacyclovir over placebo on one or both of the efficacy outcomes, we will proceed to a larger phase III trial. If the effect size is small to medium (0.30–0.45) for one or more efficacy outcomes, even if non-significant we will still proceed to a phase III trial because of the compelling need for new treatments in AD. If there is a lack of efficacy but a significant effect on either of the two PET biomarker targets, we will proceed to a phase III trial with protocol changes, if needed. Positive results may also lead to future evaluation of valacyclovir’s disease-modifying effects in MCI/pre-MCI.</p>
