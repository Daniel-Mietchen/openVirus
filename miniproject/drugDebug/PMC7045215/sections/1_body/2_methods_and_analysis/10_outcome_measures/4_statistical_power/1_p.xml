<p>Power analyses for Hypothesis 1 (ADAS-Cog11). The sample size is 130 (65 in each arm); up to five measurements (0, 12, 26, 52 and 78 weeks) are obtained for each participant. We assume that 2.5% dropout between baseline and 12 weeks, 2.5% of the remaining drop out between 12 and 26 weeks, 5.5% of the remaining drop out between 26 and 52 weeks, and 5.5% of the remaining drop out between 52 and 78 weeks, that is, total 15% dropout by 78 weeks. We conducted power analysis using the Repeated Measures and Sample Size (RMASS) program for longitudinal studies and derived the smallest effect size that can be detected at 78 weeks with 80% power. Assuming the correlation between repeated measures is r=0.3 (moderate correlation), and the variance of random intercept and random slope is set to be 1 and 0.2, respectively, the smallest detectable effect size is d=0.50 with 80% power. In mild AD, ADAS-Cog11 decline is estimated at 10% annually and at 15% over 18 months.
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> We hypothesise that the valacyclovir-treated group will show no decline (0%) and the placebo-treated group will show 15% decline over 18 months. Assuming a baseline mean ADAS-Cog11 score of 20 in subjects with mild AD, a 15% decline corresponds to a 3-point difference on ADAS-Cog11 scores between the valacyclovir and placebo groups by week 78. Assuming a SD in ADAS-Cog11 scores of 6.0, this yields a hypothesised effect size of 0.50, which corresponds to 80% power.
