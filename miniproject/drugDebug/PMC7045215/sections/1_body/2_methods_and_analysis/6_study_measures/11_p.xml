<p>We conduct LP with the 22-gauge Sprotte needle, as specified on the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) two website

At 12 and 78 weeks, the reference laboratory at the University of Alabama will examine CSF for acyclovir levels and plasma acyclovir levels. We also obtain CSF Aβ
 <sub>42</sub> and tau/phospho-tau protein levels, and neurofilament light levels (assay in development), at baseline, 12 and 78 weeks. Samples are sent to the reference laboratory at University of Pennsylvania that conducts these assays for ADNI-related studies. Extra aliquots of CSF and serum samples are stored for possible future research analyses. At baseline, clinical CSF assessment for protein, glucose and cell counts is also obtained.
