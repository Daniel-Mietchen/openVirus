Using each individual’s T1-weighted image, global and regional measures are derived using the FreeSurfer software package (

A set of volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) is defined, and the calculated volume within each region is adjusted for variations in the individual’s intracranial brain volume measured by BrainWash (automatic multi-atlas skull-stripping software package).
