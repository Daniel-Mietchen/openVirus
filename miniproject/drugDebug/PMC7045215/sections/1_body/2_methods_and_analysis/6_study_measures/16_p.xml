<p>PET methods for acquisition, quality control, pre-processing and data analysis have been adopted from ADNI. PET scans are conducted on a Biograph mCT scanner (Siemens Healthcare) at the CUMC Kreitchman PET Centre. De-identified data are evaluated for adequacy; quality control checks include visual inspection, assessment for excessive motion between frames, evaluation of header information for scan protocol adherence, determination of image quality metrics (global correlation, mean square error and absolute error) and comparison with PET imaging data forms. The participantâ€™s MRI will be utilised for localisation and to conduct ROI analyses of PET data. FreeSurfer will be used to define ROIs from the structural T1 image.</p>
