<p>The NYSPI pharmacy will make up valacyclovir 500 mg tablets and placebo into identical-looking capsules. The randomisation sequences will be balanced in blocks of random size (2, 4) to reduce the likelihood of clinicians guessing the next patient’s treatment. Separate randomisation tables are created for patients from Columbia and NYU.</p>
