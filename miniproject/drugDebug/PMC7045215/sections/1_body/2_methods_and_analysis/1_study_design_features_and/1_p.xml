<p>VALAD is a phase II, POC, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 18-month treatment trial of 130 patients (65 valacyclovir and 65 placebo) with mild AD and antibodies to HSV1 or HSV2. Capsules filled with lactose are used in the placebo condition of the trial. The goal is to evaluate valacyclovir, a repurposed generic antiviral drug, as a treatment for AD and to evaluate its effects on biomarkers of AD in relation to treatment effects.</p>
