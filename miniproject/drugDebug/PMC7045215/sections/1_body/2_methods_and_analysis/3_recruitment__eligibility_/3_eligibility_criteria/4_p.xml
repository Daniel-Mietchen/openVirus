Valacyclovir is excreted through the kidneys. A study of over 76 000 patients taking acyclovir or valacyclovir showed no increase in kidney disease.

 <sup>2</sup>. We will use the cut-point of 44 rather than the typical cut-point of 60 because the age and gender correction for estimated GFR leads to the majority of women above 85 years having a GFR &lt;60.
