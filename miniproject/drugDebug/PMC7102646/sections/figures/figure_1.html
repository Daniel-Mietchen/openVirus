 <caption> (A) Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRps of 7 HCoVs (229E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, MERS, SARS, and Wuhan SARS-CoV-2) (cladogram); (B) Multiple sequence alignment of the HCoV RdRp sequences utilizing the Clustal Omega web server and represented by ESpript. Red highlights indicate identical residues while yellow-highlighted residues are less conserved. Secondary structures are described at the top of the MSA for SARS RdRp (PDB ID: 6NUR, chain A), while the surface accessibility is shown at the bottom (blue: highly accessible; white: buried). Active site aspartates (D255 and D256) are marked on the MSA.
