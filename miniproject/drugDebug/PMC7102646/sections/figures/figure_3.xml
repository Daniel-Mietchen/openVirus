  <p>Interactions established after docking the (A) GTP, Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, and Tenofovir and (B) IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Drugs are in orange, while cyan lines represent the active protein site pockets. Solid blue lines depict H-bonds, while hydrophobic interactions are gray dashed lines. Additionally, salt bridges, Ï€-cation stacking, and halogen contacts are represented by yellow spheres connected by black dashed lines, orange dashed lines, and cyan lines, respectively. RdRp residues are labeled, and the docking scores are listed under each complex. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
