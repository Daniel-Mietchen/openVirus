  <p>(A) Phylogenetic analysis of the RdRps of 7 HCoVs (229E, NL63, HKU1, OC43, MERS, SARS, and Wuhan SARS-CoV-2) (cladogram); (B) Multiple sequence alignment of the HCoV RdRp sequences utilizing the Clustal Omega web server and represented by ESpript. Red highlights indicate identical residues while yellow-highlighted residues are less conserved. Secondary structures are described at the top of the MSA for SARS RdRp (PDB ID: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6NUR" id="ir0005" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6NUR</ext-link>, chain A), while the surface accessibility is shown at the bottom (blue: highly accessible; white: buried). Active site aspartates (D255 and D256) are marked on the MSA. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
