<p id="p0040">In this study, the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp model was built using the SARS RdRp solved structures from the NCBI protein data bank [
 <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. After model validation, molecular docking was performed to test several direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, including 5 FDA-approved medications used to treat HCV, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and the Ebola virus; 13 compounds in clinical trials against HCV; and two negative control compounds, in addition to the physiological nucleotides GTP, CTP, UTP, and ATP. The results were promising and suggest possible inhibition from the currently available therapeutics against the newly emerged coronavirus [
