<p id="p0105">On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 pandemic as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The newly emerged coronavirus in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is a health concern given that the last outbreaks of this type of virus (SARS and MERS) in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively, each left approximately 800 dead and thousands hospitalized. The present study attempted to test and suggest possible inhibitor drugs, either currently on the market or in clinical trials, to stop the infection immediately. Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir showed promising results for use against the newly emerged strain of coronavirus. Besides, the IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK compounds exhibited excellent results for binding SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. We suggest utilizing GTP as a seed to obtain specific inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp using its high-quality model.</p>
