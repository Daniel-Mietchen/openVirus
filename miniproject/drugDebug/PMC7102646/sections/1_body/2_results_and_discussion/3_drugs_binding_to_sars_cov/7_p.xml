<p id="p0100">In summary, the five approved drugs (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin) can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with binding energies comparable to those of native nucleotides (see the graphical abstract). Moreover, the compounds IDX-184, Setrobuvir, and YAK can tightly bind to the newly-emerged coronavirus RdRp, hence contradicting the function of the proteins leading to viral eradication. Additionally, IDX-184 can be used as a seed for new compounds specific against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp active site. Further optimization of the compounds using the high-quality model of the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp may result in a perfect compound able to stop the newly-emerged infection.</p>
