<p id="p0095">Based on the binding energy, the best compounds were discovered to be Setrobuvir (−9.3 kcal/mol), IDX-184 (−9.0 kcal/mol), and YAK (−8.4 kcal/mol). As previously mentioned, IDX-184 exhibited the same interaction pattern as its parent nucleotide (GTP) in binding the RdRp. On the other hand, both Setrobuvir and YAK formed H-bonds, hydrophobic contacts, π-cation contacts, and halogen interactions. Setrobuvir formed 3H-bonds (R444 (2) and K689), three hydrophobic contacts (D509, K689, and E702), a π-cation interaction with R444, and a halogen interaction with A653. YAK had 4H-bonds (R444, K512 (2), and K689), two hydrophobic contacts (K689 and E702), a π-cation interaction, and a halogen interaction with the same residues of Setrobuvir, as seen in
