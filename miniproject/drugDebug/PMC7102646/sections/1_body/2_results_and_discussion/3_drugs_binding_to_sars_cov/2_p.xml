<p id="p0075">Prior to testing the ligands against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, the structures of the small molecules were ensured to be in the optimized active (triphosphate) form. Optimization was performed using the classical MM3 force field, followed by the semi-empirical PM6 force field. After transition state checks, further optimization was performed using the B3LYP functional of density functional theory (DFT) quantum mechanics [
