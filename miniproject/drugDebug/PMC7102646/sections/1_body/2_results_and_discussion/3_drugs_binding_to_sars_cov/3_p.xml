<p id="p0080">During all of the docking experiments, the active site aspartates (D255 and D256 in the SARS-CoV-2 and SARS RdRp, and D318 and D319 in the HCV NS5B RdRp) were treated as flexible, and the ligands were also flexible. A grid box (30 Å × 30 Å × 30 Å) centered at (142, 139, 150) Å, (141, 139, 149) Å, and (11, 6, 13) Å, for the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, SARS RdRp, and HCV NS5B RdRp, respectively, was used in the docking experiments by utilizing the AutoDock tools [

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the docking score values for the SARS-CoV-2 (blue columns), SARS HCoVs (orange columns), and HCV NS5B RdRps (gray columns). The physiological compounds (GTP, UTP, CTP, and ATP) exhibited binding energies for SARS-CoV-2 between −7 (ATP) and −8.7 (GTP) kcal/mol. The two negative control compounds (Cinnamaldehyde and Thymoquinone) displayed low binding energies to all RdRps (−4.4 to −5.6 kcal/mol). The five approved drugs (Galidesivir, Remdesivir, Tenofovir, Sofosbuvir, and Ribavirin) surrounded by the dashed-green box in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> were also able to bind the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with binding energies of −7.0, −7.6, −6.9, −7.5, and −7.8 kcal/mol, respectively. These drugs were able to bind to the new coronavirus strain RdRp tightly and hence may contradict the polymerase function. In addition, these drugs are potential candidates for inhibiting the RdRps of HCV NS5B (−8.0 to −9.5 kcal/mol) and SARS (−6.2 to −7.1 kcal/mol). Other compounds that are currently in clinical trials can bind to SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, with some showing promising results. Setrobuvir, IDX-184, and YAK (surrounded by red-dashed rectangles in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>) exhibit firm binding to all of the RdRps (−9.3, −9.0, and −8.4 kcal/mol, respectively for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp). The binding energy values against RdRp for these compounds are better than the native nucleotides. IDX-184 is a guanosine derivative, and it competes for GTP binding with slightly better binding (−9.0 kcal/mol) than GTP (−8.7 kcal/mol). Further analysis of the docking complexes is required to unravel their binding modes with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
