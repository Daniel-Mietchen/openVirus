<p id="p0085">To investigate the possible reasons for the differences in the binding energies, we examined the formed complexes with help from the PLIP web server. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(A) shows the formed interactions between the ligands GTP, Ribavirin, Sofosbuvir, and Tenofovir against SARS-CoV-2 RdRp after docking. GTP was found to form 8H-bonds with RdRp residues D343, K442, T447, K512 (2), C513, D514, and S573. Additionally, GTP built six salt bridges with R444 (2), D509, and R515 (3) and two π-cation interaction with K689 from the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. This vast number of interactions gives the complex its stability with the −8.7 kcal/mol binding energy. This is comparable to the GTP-derivative IDX-184, shown in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(B), in which 10H-bonds were formed with the SARS-CoV-2 RdRp residues R444, K512 (2), D651, D652, A653 (3), W691, and E702. On the other hand, two metal interactions were formed between IDX-184 and the active site residue D652 of the RdRp, while only one salt bridge built with D514.
