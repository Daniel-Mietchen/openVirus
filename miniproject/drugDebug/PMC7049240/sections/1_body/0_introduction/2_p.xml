<p>The clear benefit of antiviral therapy after the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) [

 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], along with the ambitious goal of the World Health Organization (WHO) for HCV elimination [

 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], could not allay the concerns regarding adherence, reinfection and overall outcome of anti-HCV treatment in PWID. Several reports from different countries have shown that treatment uptake still remains low [
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and many clinicians are reluctant to treat active PWID [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], while in many parts of the United States of America active substance use remains an important barrier to treatment uptake [
 <xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. On the other hand, PWID are facing many other barriers, particularly to accessing medical care, with the majority of these patients never having been examined by an expert hepatologist, while DAAs can be prescribed only by expert physicians in large liver centers.
