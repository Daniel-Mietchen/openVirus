<p>However, there is a large body of evidence that DAA therapy in PWID offers sustained virological response rates 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12) similar to those in non-PWID populations [

 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A reasonable concern in a marginalized population is compliance with treatment; indeed, although the proportion of patients lost to follow up (LTFU) is small in randomized clinical trials [
 <xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], data from real-world settings are scanty and conflicting [

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The rate of LTFU and the factors that may affect engagement with treatment and follow up will add crucial information to improve HCV service delivery and treatment.
