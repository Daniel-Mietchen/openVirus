<p>In conclusion, our results confirm the excellent efficacy of DAAs in PWID with HCV infection; therefore, PWID should no longer face barriers to HCV treatment access. However, in a real-world setting 1 of 10 PWID is LTFU after DAA therapy completion. As a lack of follow up in this vulnerable population could have unfavorable consequences, we need more real-world data in order to develop strategies to reduce LTFU, improve care and testing and get closer to HCV elimination.</p>
