Eight of the 174 patients (4.6%) did not complete therapy: poor compliance was the main reason for early cessation (4/8 patients); one patient died early after treatment initiation; one patient discontinued treatment because of pregnancy; and 2 patients were diagnosed with malignancies (acute leukemia and rectal cancer) and discontinued DAA treatment on their own decision. Two of them, who had HCV testing approximately 1 year after treatment discontinuation, showed a sustained virological response.</p>
