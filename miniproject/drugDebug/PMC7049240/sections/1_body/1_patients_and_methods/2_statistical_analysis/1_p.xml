Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analysis were applied for prediction of SVR12 or LTFU and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for the odds ratios (OR) were calculated. Significant variables in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate model. Statistical tests were performed using SPSS (version 25). A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p>
