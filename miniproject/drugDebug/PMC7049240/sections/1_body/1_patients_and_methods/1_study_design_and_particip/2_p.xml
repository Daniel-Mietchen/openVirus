<p>The decision for antiviral treatment initiation was made by an expert physician, and in case of patients attending OST programs by the interdisciplinary HCV group. We operate a specific outpatient clinic, once weekly, where PWID are examined by a group of addiction experts and hepatologists [

Apart from the stability of appointment attendance, mental or medical comorbidities and liver disease stages were also taken into consideration for treatment initiation. In Greece, reimbursement for DAAs was based on liver disease stages until September 2018, so until June 2017 only patients with fibrosis stage ≥F3 could receive DAA therapy. Between July 2017 and September 2018, public funding and DAA reimbursement was limited to patients with liver stiffness ≥F2, whereas patients with concomitant extrahepatic HCV manifestations and individuals with other comorbidities, such as hemoglobinopathies, end-stage renal disease, organ transplantation or HIV/HCV coinfection, were treated irrespectively of the liver stiffness score. The chosen elastography cutoff values for liver fibrosis stages were: stiffness &lt;9 kPa, 9-12 kPa and &gt;12kPa for no/mild/moderate fibrosis (Metavir Score F0-F1-F2), severe fibrosis (Metavir score F3), and cirrhosis (Metavir Score F4), respectively. The diagnosis of cirrhosis was based on the transient elastography score (&gt;12 kPa), liver biopsy findings and clinical or imaging data.
