<p id="Par35">During viral infection, IL-17A was also enhanced in PCLS isolated from non-sensitized mice, however, it remained at a baseline in lung tissue derived from HDM-sensitized mice. Rupintrivir treatment did not inhibit IL-17A secretion triggered by RV in tissue of non-sensitized animals, although there was a trend. UV-inactivated RV infection did not trigger IL-17 cytokine secretion compared to uninfected medium control (Fig.
