<p id="Par29">Our first aim was to characterize the ex vivo cytokine profile of PCLS prepared from HDM-sensitized mice. Without any restimulation, PCLS from HDM-sensitized mice showed increased cytokine secretion ex vivo after 48â€‰h compared to PCLS from non-sensitized mice. Cytokines IL-4 (35-fold) and IL-10 (8.3-fold) were increased, whereas IL-5 (5.2-fold), IL-17A (2.6-fold), IL-17E (3.2-fold), IL-17F (2.1-fold), and IL-33 (5.4-fold) were only slightly increased and IL-13 remained unaltered (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a). To verify that the cytokine profile measured ex vivo was comparable to the in vivo phenotype, the data were compared to BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) cytokine profiles of different animals of the same group that were equally exposed to HDM or saline. In BAL fluid, elevated cytokine levels were observed for IL-4 (20-fold), IL-5 (8.9-fold), IL-10 (18-fold), IL-13 (19-fold), IL-17A (303-fold), and IL-33 (4-fold), whereas IL-17E and IL-17F levels remained unchanged (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b). Furthermore, BAL differential cell counts of HDM-sensitized mice confirmed airway inflammation indicated by increased infiltration of eosinophils, macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes compared to non-sensitized mice (Fig.
