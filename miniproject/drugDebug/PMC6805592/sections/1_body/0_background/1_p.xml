<p id="Par13">Upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold, are usually caused by viruses and are self-limiting in healthy individuals. In patients with chronic pulmonary diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), human rhinovirus (RV) infections can be more severe and associated with a decline in lung function. Several studies have demonstrated dysregulated host antiviral immune responses in asthmatic patients, leading to viral transmission from the upper to the lower respiratory tract. A disrupted epithelial barrier and attenuated elimination of viruses by ciliary dysfunction results in stronger viral propagation [
