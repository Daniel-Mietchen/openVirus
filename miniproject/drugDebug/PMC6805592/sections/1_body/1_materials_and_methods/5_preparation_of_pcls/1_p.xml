<p id="Par20">Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from HDM-sensitized (abbreviated as “sensitized”) or saline-treated mice (abbreviated as “non-sensitized”) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Briefly, lungs were inflated using agarose/medium solution. After polymerization, slices of 350 μm were cut in 4 °C cold EBSS, using an automatic oscillating tissue slicer (OTS 5000, Warner Instruments, CT, USA). Tissue slices were transferred into a medium-filled petri dish and incubated under cell culture conditions (37 °C, and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>). The medium was exchanged at least four times every 30 min for 2–3 h to remove cell debris. Only PCLS containing an airway with an intact smooth muscle layer and active beating of the cilia were selected for the study.
