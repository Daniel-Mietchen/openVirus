<p id="Par37">Limitations of our study are mainly due to the ex vivo infection of lung slices. Precision-cut lung slices enable evaluation of the natural tissue response to RV infection. They contain most cell types of lung tissue, including e.g. airway epithelial cells and macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Lung slices of diseased donors show altered histology and often contain inflammatory cells such as eosinophils, neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the connection to blood and lymphoid circulation is missing in PCLS. Cells are unable to migrate from the blood stream into lung tissue and from lung tissue into the lymphoid fluid. As cytokines and chemokines coordinate the migration of cells, these proteins can be used to predict cellular responses in lung slices [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. A second limitation is that we infected lung slices permanently, without removing the virus inoculum. We were unable to detect any increase of virus based on TCID
 <sub>50</sub> or PCR. An explanation could be that the total number of airway epithelial cells is very low in PCLS. The number of virus produced by these few epithelial cells was presumably too low to further increase the initial virus titer. We used interferon-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) as a marker for successful infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Actively replicating virus induces IP-10 in lung slices whereas UV-inactivated virus is unable to increase IP-10.
