<p id="Par39">Patients with asthma have an unmet need for effective treatment of virus-induced exacerbations. Our research is related to the open question whether antiviral drugs such as rupintrivir exert beneficial effects in asthma patients during exacerbation. Previous studies showed a strong antiviral effect of rupintrivir in vitro against a broad range of clinical RV isolates [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Rupintrivir was not toxic in cell culture experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and did not cause adverse events in healthy volunteers or patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Nevertheless, it failed to improve symptoms in patients with naturally acquired colds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The efficacy of rupintrivir in asthmatic patients is unknown. In this study, Rupintrivir showed only a minor effect on RV infection in lung slices of healthy animals whereas it inhibited RV-induced exaggerated cytokines IP-10, IL-4, and IL-6 in lung slices of asthmatic animals. IFNs were more or less unchanged.
