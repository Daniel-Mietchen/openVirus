 <caption> Cytokine profile of PCLS (precision-cut lung slices) from HDM (house-dust mite)-sensitized mice in comparison to cytokine profile of BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) from HDM-sensitized mice. Balb/c mice were treated with saline (white bars) or HDM (grey bars) for four weeks. ( a) Cytokine profile of PCLS isolated from HDM- and non-sensitized mice after 48 h ex vivo culture without any further stimulation. Data are shown as box whisker plots (mean to max), n = 5 mice with two technical replicates (duplicate wells with 2 PCLS each), * p ≤ 0.05, and ** p ≤ 0.01 according to Mann–Whitney U test. ( b) BAL cytokine profile 24 h after the last HDM/saline challenge. ( c) BAL differential cell counts for eosinophils (Eos), macrophages (Mac), neutrophils (Neut), and lymphocytes (Lym). Graphs (b)-(c) are shown as box whisker plots (mean to max), n = 10 animals per group, * p ≤ 0.05, ** p ≤ 0.01, *** p ≤ 0.001, and **** p ≤ 0.0001 according to the Mann–Whitney U test </caption>
