  <p>Antiviral cytokine response to RV (rhinovirus) infection is impaired in PCLS of HDM-sensitized mice and shows limited response to rupintrivir treatment. PCLS from non-sensitized and HDM-sensitized mice were infected with 10
   <sup>5</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/mL of UV-inactivated RV (UV) or RV, or RV in combination with 100 nM rupintrivir (Rup) for 48 h. Uninfected slices were used as a control (Ctrl). All data are shown as box whisker plots (mean to max), 
   <italic>n</italic> = 5 mice with two technical replicates (duplicate wells with 2 PCLS each), statistical analysis performed for non-sensitized or HDM-sensitized group with *

   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.01; *** 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.001; **** 
   <italic>p</italic> ≤ 0.0001; according to Friedman with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. Means of RV infected PCLS from non-sensitized and HDM-sensitized animals were considered statistically significant with #
