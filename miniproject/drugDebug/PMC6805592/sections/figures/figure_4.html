 <caption> RV-induced secretion of IL-17A is attenuated in PCLS of HDM-sensitized mice. PCLS from non-sensitized and HDM-sensitized mice were infected with 10 5 TCID 50/mL of UV-inactivated RV (UV) or RV, or RV in combination with 100 nM rupintrivir (Rup) for 48 h. Uninfected slices were used as a control (Ctrl). All data are shown as box whisker plots (mean to max), n = 5 mice with two technical replicates (duplicate wells with 2 PCLS each), statistical analysis performed for non- sensitized or HDM-sensitized group with ** p ≤ 0.01 according to Friedman with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. Means of RV infected PCLS from non-sensitized and HDM-sensitized animals were considered statistically significant with # p ≤ 0.05 according to the Mann–Whitney U test. n.s. = not significant </caption>
