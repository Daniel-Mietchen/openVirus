 <caption> Rupintrivir treatment reduces the exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and T H-2 cytokine IL-4 induced by RV (rhinovirus) in lung tissues of HDM-sensitized mice. PCLS from non-sensitized and HDM-sensitized mice were infected with 10 5 TCID 50/mL of UV-inactivated RV (UV) or RV, or RV in combination with 100 nM rupintrivir (Rup) for 48 h. Uninfected slices were used as a control (Ctrl). All data are shown as box whisker plots (mean to max), n = 5 mice with two technical replicates (duplicate wells with 2 PCLS each), statistical analysis performed for non-sensitized or HDM-sensitized group with ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001; **** p ≤ 0.0001; according to Friedman with Dunn’s multiple comparison post-hoc test. Means of RV infected PCLS from non-sensitized and HDM-sensitized animals were considered statistically significant with # p ≤ 0.05 and ## p ≤ 0.01 according to the Mann–Whitney U test. n.s. = not significant </caption>
