 <caption> Schematics of host cell elevated cytosolic calcium concentration induced by a virus. Calcium channels (voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs), receptor-operated channels (ROC), store-operated Ca 2+ (SOC), channels and transient receptor potential (TRP) channels) mediate the entry of Ca 2+ from extracellular medium (black arrows). The IP 3 receptor (IP 3R) and the ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) mediate the release of Ca 2+ from internal stores (black arrows). Calcium pumps (the plasma membrane Ca 2+-ATPase (PMCA), sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+-ATPase (SERCA)) and the Na +/Ca 2+ exchanger (NCX) are responsible for transporting Ca 2+ from the cytosol to external medium or into cellular calcium stores (red arrows). Viruses utilize these calcium components to elevate cytosolic calcium concentration to activate Ca 2+-dependent/sensitive enzymes and transcriptional factors to promote virus replication (right panel). </caption>
