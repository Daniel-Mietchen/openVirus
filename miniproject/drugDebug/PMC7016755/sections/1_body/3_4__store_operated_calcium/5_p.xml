<p>It is possible that the viral proteins trigger the Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> depletion in ER or prevent ER refilled with Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> to maintain resting ER Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> levels [

 <xref rid="B42-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Alternately, these viral proteins may directly modify STIM1 and uncouple the activation of STIM1 from Ca

Thus, STIM1/ORAI might represent a conserved target to regulating the budding of enveloped RNA viruses and possibly DNA viruses that rely on similar host cellular proteins for budding. The example is that the hepatitis B virus X (HBx) protein upregulates the activity of the STIM1â€“ORAI1 channel complex [
