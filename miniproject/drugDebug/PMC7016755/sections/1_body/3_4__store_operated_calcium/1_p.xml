<p>SOC channels are the major Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> entry pathways in non-excitable cells. The protein Orai1 on the plasma membrane and STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule) on ER are the molecular identities that are responsible for SOC channels activation. The depletion of ER Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> stores promotes STIM1 proteins aggregation and interaction with Orai1 to open the channel, mediating Ca
