<p>This review concentrates on host cell membranes’ calcium channels and pumps in viral infection. Blockers for these membrane proteins or preventing viruses from grabbing these host calcium-signaling components may lower the probability of virus stability, replication, and release, as well as infection-related host–cell apoptosis and reactive oxygen species production, neurotoxicity, and enterotoxin, making these membrane proteins potential targets for antiviral drugs.</p>
