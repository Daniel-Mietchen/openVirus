<p>Maturation is the last assembly step of a virus particle. In this step, the virus acquires the infectivity, which is essential for its lifecycle. The results obtained from a genome-wide knockout screen indicated that SPCA1 in the Golgi network is critical for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection [

 <xref rid="B71-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Further study demonstrated that similar to RSV, other viruses from the Paramyxoviridae, Flaviviridae, and Togaviridae families also failed to spread in SPCA1-deficient cells. Studies on this mechanism revealed that Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> pumped into Golgi by SPCA1 is the trigger to produce normal functional viral glycoproteins that are essential for virus spread. Therefore, SPCA1 may be a promising target for therapeutic intervention against a diverse set of viruses (

However, in this study, herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), vesicular stomatitis (VSV), bunyamwera (BUNV), and LCMV were unaffected by the loss of SPCA1. That is probably because the maturation of these viral glycoproteins requires different triggers.
