<p>Cui et al. [
 <xref rid="B72-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>] screened the natural product library and found that cyclopiazonic acid, an inhibitor of SERCA, was shown to have activity in the low micromolar range against RSV strains at the step of virus genome replication. Further study found that another SERCA inhibitor BHQ had a similar effect [
 <xref rid="B72-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. It is probable that SERCA inhibitors prevent cytosolic calcium returning to the ER from the cytosol via SERCA, resulting in an increase in intracellular calcium concentration. A continuous higher concentration of intracellular calcium may impair viral genome replication and/or transcription, thereby reducing virus yield.
