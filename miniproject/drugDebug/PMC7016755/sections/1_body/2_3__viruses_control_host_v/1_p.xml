<p>VGCCs are widely found in the membrane of excitable cells [
 <xref rid="B6-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and one of the most well studied viral targets because of the availability of specific channel blockers. There are several different types of VGCCs: L-type (Long-conducting) channels are mostly found in skeletal and smooth myocytes, bone (osteoblasts), and ventricular myocytes; N-type (Non-L or Neuronal), P/Q-type (Purkinje and Granular), and R-type (dihydropyridine- Resistant) channels display longer-lasting conductance and are expressed throughout the nervous system; T-type (Transient) channels produce short-term conductance and are found in neurons and cells that have pacemaker activity [
 <xref rid="B6-cells-09-00094" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The activation of the channels results in a Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> cascade, which is associated with numerous host physiological functions including excitation–contraction–relaxation coupling of muscles, synaptic transmission, immunoprotection, etc.
