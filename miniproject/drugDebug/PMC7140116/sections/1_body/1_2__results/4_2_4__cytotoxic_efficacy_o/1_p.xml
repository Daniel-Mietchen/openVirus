<p>Anticancer drugs are specifically designed to inhibit cell growth, thus we evaluated cytotoxic efficacy of the antimetabolites pemetrexed and fluorouracil in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociblib in the TZM-bl cell line and in two distinct breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-468 and T47D (

 <sub>50</sub>) showed significant differences between them (
