<p>Thus, antifolates such as pemetrexed inhibit the dNTP pool by a mechanism not directly affecting SAMHD1 phosphorylation and effectively synergize with palbociclib, which actually induces SAMHD1 activation. On the other hand, when two compounds directly affecting SAMHD1 phosphorylation (i.e., fluorouracil and palbociclib) are combined, the synergic effect is less potent.</p>
