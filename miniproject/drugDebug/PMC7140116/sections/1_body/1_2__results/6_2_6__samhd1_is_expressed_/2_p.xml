<p>In addition, IHC data of 17 different types of human tumors including 202 different samples from human protein atlas were also analyzed (

 <xref rid="B33-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Although SAMHD1 was expressed in all types of tumors, the degree of expression was significantly variable, ranging from undetectable levels to high protein expression levels. Overall, 70% of all tumors expressed SAMHD1 to a certain extent, whereas its expression could not be detected in 30% of cases (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f007">Figure 7</xref>C). These results demonstrate that SAMHD1 is expressed in patient tumor samples but also suggest that modulation of SAMHD1 function might be feasible at least in a subgroup of cancer types.
