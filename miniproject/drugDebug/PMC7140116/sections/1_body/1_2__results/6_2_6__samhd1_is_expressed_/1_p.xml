<p>To further explore the potential value of modulating SAMHD1 function in cancer patients, we evaluated SAMHD1 expression in different tumor tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded tissues. SAMHD1 was clearly detected in at least two cancer tissue types susceptible to being treated with antimetabolitesâ€”pancreatic adenocarcinoma and lung large cell carcinoma (
