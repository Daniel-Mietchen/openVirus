<p>Anti-HIV-1 activity of a panel of antimetabolite drugs used in cancer treatment was evaluated in MDMs in the presence or absence of SAMHD1, after transducing cells with HIV-2 Vpx (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cancers-12-00713-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). As previously observed, Vpx-mediated degradation of SAMHD1 reduced the antiviral potency of the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) AZT compared to untreated macrophages, but did not change the activity of NVP, a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) (
