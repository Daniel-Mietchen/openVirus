<p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were obtained from the blood of healthy donors using a Ficoll–Paque density gradient centrifugation and monocytes were purified using negative selection antibody cocktails (StemCell Technologies, Vancouver, BC, Canada) as described before [
 <xref rid="B43-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Monocytes were cultured in complete culture medium: RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), penicillin and streptomycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and differentiated to monocyte derived macrophages (MDM) for 4 days in the presence of monocyte-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF, Peprotech) at 100 ng/mL. The protocol was approved by the Scientific Committee of Institut de Recerca de la Sida – IrsiCaixa and the Ethics Review Board of Hospital Germans Trias i Pujol. Buffy coats were purchased from the Catalan Banc de Sang i Teixits (

All donors provided informed consent at the time of blood extraction.
