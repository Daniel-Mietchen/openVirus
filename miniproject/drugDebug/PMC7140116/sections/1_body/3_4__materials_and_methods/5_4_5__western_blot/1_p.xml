<p>Cell extracts were prepared for Western blot protein analysis as described before [
 <xref rid="B22-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Briefly, cells were rinsed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and extracts prepared in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM Na3VO4, 10 mM Na Î²-glycerophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM Na Pyrophosphate, 270 mM sucrose and 1% Triton X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane (ImmunolonP, Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA). The following antibodies were used for immunoblotting: anti-rabbit and anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Pierce, Waltham, MA, USA; anti-human Hsp90 (BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA; 610418), anti-SAMHD1 (1:2500; ab67820, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and anti-RRM2 (1:1000; ab115701, Abcam) and anti-phospho-CDK2 (Thr160; 2561), anti-CDK2 (2546), anti-CDK1 (77055) anti-Rb (9309) anti-phospho-Rb (Ser807/811, 9308) anti-E2F1 (3742), anti-phospho-SAMHD1 Thr592 (15038) (all 1:1000; Cell Signaling Technologies, Danvers, MA, USA).
