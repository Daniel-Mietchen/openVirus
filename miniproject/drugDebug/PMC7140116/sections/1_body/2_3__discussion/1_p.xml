 <xref rid="B34-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. By degrading cellular dNTPs, SAMHD1 plays an important role in the homeostatic balance of cellular dNTPs and, thus, it may be a modulator of clinical efficacy of nucleotide-based treatments. SAMHD1 has been shown to act as a resistance factor to nucleoside-based chemotherapies by hydrolyzing their active triphosphate metabolite, thereby reducing the response to the anticancer drugs [
