<p>Here, we show that SAMHD1 can either enhance or limit efficacy of a wide range of antimetabolites, including nucleoside analogues but also anti-folate drugs. Interestingly, antifolate drugs such as pemetrexed or methotrexate showed increased potency in SAMHD1-expressing cells, whereas nucleoside analogues efficacy was either limited or enhanced by SAMHD1. Attempts to predict the effect of SAMHD1 on drug efficacy based on the specific base targeted or chemical structure did not show any clear correlation, although purine nucleoside analogues may be more prone to gain activity in SAMHD1-depleted cells. Based on previous data showing that beyond endogenous dNTPs, triphosphorylated nucleoside analogues can be hydrolyzed by SAMHD1 [

 <xref rid="B29-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], we hypothesized that compounds whose activity is enhanced in the absence of SAMHD1 are enzyme substrates. On the contrary, and as previously demonstrated for NRTI [

 <xref rid="B25-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], compounds that lose activity in the absence of SAMHD1 would be competing with the intracellular dNTP pool, which is lower when SAMHD1 is active. Accordingly, anti-folates showed higher activity when SAMHD1 effectively limits the dNTP pool.
