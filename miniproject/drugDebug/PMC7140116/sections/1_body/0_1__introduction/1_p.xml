<p>Sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a deoxynucleotide triphosphate hydrolase [
 <xref rid="B1-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Through its dNTPase activity, SAMHD1 maintains the intracellular dNTP pool at levels adequate for DNA replication and repair but below a potentially mutagenic threshold [
 <xref rid="B2-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Mutations in SAMHD1 were first identified as being causative of Aicardiâ€“Goutieres syndrome (AGS), a severe autoimmune disease [
 <xref rid="B3-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], but later it was proposed as a tumor suppressor gene, since mutations in SAMHD1 are associated with different types of cancer [
 <xref rid="B4-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and its expression has been found to be inhibited in several types of tumors [
 <xref rid="B6-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. More recently, SAMHD1 has been implicated in the protection against cancer and chronic inflammation by limiting the release of single-stranded DNA [
