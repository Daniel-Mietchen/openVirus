<p>SAMHD1 also acts as a viral restriction factor, limiting the permissiveness of cells to diverse viruses (reviewed in [

 <xref rid="B11-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SAMHD1 inhibits retroviral replication at the reverse transcription (RT) step by maintaining the intracellular concentration of dNTP below the threshold required for reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into DNA [

 <xref rid="B11-cancers-12-00713" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. SAMHD1 activity is counteracted by the HIV-2 accessory protein Vpx, a tool that has been extensively used to study SAMHD1 function [
