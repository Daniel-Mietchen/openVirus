 <caption> Expression of SAMHD1 protein in tumor samples from cancer patients. ( A, B) IHC staining of SAMHD1 in pancreas ( A) and lung ( B) tumor samples. Morphology of tumor cells is shown by routine hematoxylin stain of paraffin embedded tumor sections. SAMHD1 is stained in brown. Original magnification ×200. Scale bar, 20 µm. ( C) Percentage of tumors expressing SAMHD1, depending on its relative expression in IHC as classified in Human Proteome Atlas ( www.proteinatlas.org, IHC data of SAMHD1 expression from 17 different tumor types were retrieved and classified according to protein expression levels. ND, not detected. </caption>
