 <caption> Pharmacological activation of SAMHD1 enhances antiviral activity of antimetabolites. ( A) Relative effect of the combination of palbociclib-pemetrexed measured as antiviral activity. Inhibition of HIV infection with increasing doses of palbociclib and pemetrexed was measured. Percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition is shown in presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. ( B) As in ( A), relative effect of pemetrexed alone (white bars) or in combination with a fixed dose of palbociclib 0.04 µM (black bars), in the presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. ( C) Relative effect of the combination of midostaurin-pemetrexed measured as antiviral activity. Inhibition of HIV infection with increasing doses of midostaurin and pemetrexed was measured. Percentage of GFP+ cells relative to the no drug condition is shown in presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. ( D) As in ( C), relative effect of pemetrexed (PTX) alone (white bars) or in combination with a fixed dose of midostaurin 0.2 µM (black bars), in the presence (left panel) or absence (right panel) of SAMHD1. Mean ±SD of at least three independent donors performed in duplicate is shown. PD, palbociclib; PTX, pemetrexed; MID, midostaurin. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.005; *** p &lt; 0.0005. </caption>
