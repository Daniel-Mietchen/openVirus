<p>Thirteen H3N2 viruses were characterized by standard hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay and of these, 12 (92%) met conventional thresholds for titre reduction that define antigenic drift. An additional 58 viruses could not be characterized by HI and were instead assessed by sequencing of the H3 gene. Of these, 57 of 58 (98%) clustered within a genetic group that has been found by HI assay to be antigenically distinct from the A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2) vaccine strain and, thus, also consistent with antigenic drift in these viruses (
