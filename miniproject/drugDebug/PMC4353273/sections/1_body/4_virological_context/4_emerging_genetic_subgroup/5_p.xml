<p>Differences between these emerging H3N2 viruses and the 2014–2015 vaccine strain are found in key antigenic sites of the H3 protein known to influence antigenicity, immunogenicity and vaccine effectiveness (
 <xref rid="b7-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
 <xref rid="b12-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In previous seasons, H3N2 viruses with comparable or fewer AA substitutions at H3 antigenic sites relative to vaccine have been associated with VE of approximately 40% or less in Canada and elsewhere (
 <xref rid="b13-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="b17-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). One of the particular combinations of H3N2 mutations in subgroup 3C.3x viruses (an asparagine to aspartic acid substitution at position 122 and a leucine to serine substitution at position 157) was associated with VE of 30% or less in Spain with use of the same A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2) vaccine component in 2013–2014 that has been retained for 2014–2015 (
