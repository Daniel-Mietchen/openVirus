<p>During the early fall (September to October), subgroup 3C.2a viruses have become more predominant among GISAID sequences collected from the northern hemisphere, and this has been accompanied by lesser contribution from subgroup 3C.3x. This subgroup distribution has also been observed among H3N2 viruses collected and sequenced by investigators during the fall 2014 in British Columbia, Canada (verbal communication, D. Skowronski, BC Centre for Disease Control). The emerging subgroups 3C.2a and 3C.3x H3N2 variants each bear multiple amino acid (AA) differences from the A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2) vaccine strain and from the egg-adapted high-growth reassortant (HGR) provided to manufacturers for vaccine production this season (called X-223A) (
