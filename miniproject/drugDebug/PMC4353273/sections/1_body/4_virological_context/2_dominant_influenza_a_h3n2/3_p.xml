<p>Of the 2011 influenza A viruses detected in Canada thus far with subtype information available to December 13, 2014, 2005 (99.7%) are A(H3N2) and just six (0.3%) are A(H1N1)pdm09 (
 <xref rid="b4-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). This profile is very different from the prior 2013â€“14 season when H3N2 viruses were sparse and A(H1N1)pdm09, descended from the 2009 pandemic virus, was instead the dominant influenza A epidemic strain (
