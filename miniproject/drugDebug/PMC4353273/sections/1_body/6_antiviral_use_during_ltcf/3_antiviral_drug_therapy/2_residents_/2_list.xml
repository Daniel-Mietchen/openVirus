  <p>Oseltamivir or zanamivir treatment should be administered as soon as the clinical diagnosis of influenza has been made because residents of LTCF are, by definition, at increased risk of complications (

  <p>Nasal/nasopharyngeal secretions should be tested to confirm the diagnosis but treatment initiation should not wait for the test result.</p>

  <p>Antiviral therapy works best when initiated within the first 48 h after symptom onset. However, these medications can still help even if begun more than 48 h after illness onset.</p>

  <p>The dosage regimens for adults are oseltamivir 75 mg PO BID or zanamivir two inhalations BID. The treatment dose for oral oseltamivir for infants (younger than one year) is 3 mg/kg twice a day. Given that in Canada, oseltamivir is currently not approved for use in infants younger than one year of age, the use of the drug for this age group should be done on case-by-case scenario basis. The treatment dosages for children one year and older vary by the weight of the child: 30 mg twice a day for children who weigh 15 kg or less, 45 mg twice a day for children who weigh more than 15 kg and up to 23 kg, 60 mg twice a day for those who weigh more than 23 kg and up to 40 kg, and 75 mg twice a day for those who weigh more than 40 kg. Clinicians are advised to consult an infectious diseases clinician or pharmacist for dosing of premature infants in the extremely unlikely that they are residents of a LCTF. Zanamivir is approved for children seven years of age and older (two inhalations BID).</p>

  <p>There is no need to reduce doses in patients with mild to moderate reduced renal function and drug-drug interactions are also not generally a concern (
