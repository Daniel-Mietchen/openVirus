<p>The current guidance document supplements recommendations in the AMMI Canada Guideline ‘The use of antiviral drugs for influenza: A foundation document for practitioners’ (

 <list list-type="alpha-lower">
  <list-item>
   <p>Influenza A(H3N2) viruses are dominating (&gt;90%) among influenza detections so far in 2014–2015, and have been associated with earlier and more LTCF outbreaks this season compared with usual in several parts of Canada (
    <xref rid="b4-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). These viruses remain susceptible to the neuraminidase inhibitor (NI) drugs.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The majority of influenza A(H3N2) viruses (&gt;95%) characterized thus far in Canada this season show genetic and antigenic evidence of mismatch to the vaccine strain (A/Texas/50/2012[H3N2]-like) that had been chosen in February 2014 by the WHO for inclusion in the 2014–2015 trivalent and quadrivalent vaccines for the northern hemisphere (
    <xref rid="b4-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
    <xref rid="b5-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>A substantial number of amino acid (AA) differences between circulating H3N2 viruses and the vaccine component are found at key antigenic sites of the hemagglutinin (H) protein of the influenza virus, and number and location of genetic differences are anticipated to substantially affect vaccine effectiveness (VE) this season (
    <xref rid="b7-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–
    <xref rid="b12-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>VE estimates against H3N2 for the 2014–2015 season will likely not be available until later in the season (expected in February 2015), but in previous seasons of H3N2 vaccine mismatch, VE estimates of 40% or lower have been found in association with a comparable or fewer number of antigenic site AA differences between vaccine and H3N2 circulating viruses, even in young adults (
    <xref rid="b13-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
    <xref rid="b17-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).
   </p>

   <p>In the context of this significant vaccine mismatch, enhanced emphasis and expanded recommendations for antiviral use during LTCF outbreak control are needed while influenza A(H3N2) activity shows signs of spiking in several parts of Canada.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>NI drugs, oseltamivir (Tamiflu
    <sup>®</sup>, Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Canada) and zanamivir (Relenza
    <sup>®</sup>, GlaxoSmithKline Inc, Canada), are the antiviral medications to be prescribed for both treatment and prevention of influenza, including H3N2 viruses. Amantadine is not to be prescribed due to resistance of the H3N2 virus to its inhibitory action.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>In view of vaccine mismatch for H3N2 viruses in 2014–2015 and anticipated reduced VE for that component, it is recommended that antiviral chemoprophylaxis be considered for all staff working at the site of a declared influenza A(H3N2) LTCF outbreak regardless of whether they have received this year’s 2014–2015 influenza vaccine.</p>
