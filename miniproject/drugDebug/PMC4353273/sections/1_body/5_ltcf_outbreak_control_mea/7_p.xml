<p>For surveillance purposes, FluWatch defines an influenza outbreak on the basis of two or more cases of ILI within a seven-day period, including at least one laboratory-confirmed case of influenza (
 <xref rid="b4-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). However, this is for surveillance purposes and the declaration of an influenza outbreak and the enactment of control measures is at the discretion of the local health authority/Medical Officer of Health in accordance with provincial guidance. When an influenza outbreak is suspected in a LTCF, this should be reported within 24 h to the local health authority/Medical Officer of Health to enable timely interventions. It is at the discretion of the local health authority/Medical Officer of Health, in consultation with health care and infection control practitioners, to declare an influenza outbreak in a LTCF and to recommend specific interventions for its control according to provincial guidelines. It is similarly at the discretion of the local health authority/Medical Officer of Health to declare an outbreak over and to recommend when specific interventions may be halted. The end of a LTCF outbreak is generally considered when no new cases of ILI have appeared for â‰¥7 days (
 <xref rid="b22-idmm-26-e1" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) after the onset of the last case (an interval equal to an average incubation period [three days] following the average period of communicability [three to five days]) or roughly two incubation periods.
