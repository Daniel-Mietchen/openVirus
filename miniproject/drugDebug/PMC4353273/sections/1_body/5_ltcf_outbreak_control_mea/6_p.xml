<p>For control of an outbreak of influenza among residents of a LTCF, surveillance for ILI is critical for early identification and response. FluWatch defines ILI as acute onset of respiratory illness with fever and cough and with one or more of sore throat, arthralgia, myalgia or prostration but further underscores that in patients 65 years and older, fever may not be prominent (

The preferred sample for individual influenza diagnosis is a nasopharyngeal specimen obtained using a flocked swab. For surveillance purposes and outbreak diagnosis, nasal specimens collected from several patients within a cluster affected by ILI may also be sufficient to determine the cause of the outbreak. However, oropharyngeal secretions obtained with a throat swab are suboptimal for influenza diagnosis. The preferred testing methods are, in order of declining preference: RT-PCR, rapid influenza diagnostic tests and viral culture.
