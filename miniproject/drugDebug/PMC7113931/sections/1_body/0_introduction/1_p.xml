<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a single-stranded RNA virus belonging to Hepacivirus genus of the Flaviviridae family. It causes hepatitis C which is a major chronic liver disease. Hepatitis C is transmitted by injection drug use, blood transfusion, hemodialysis, organ transplantation and, less frequently, sexual intercourse. It has been recognized as a global health problem because of the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, about 170 million people are infected with HCV. Since the discovery of this virus in 1989, the clinical management of chronic hepatitis C infection has undergone a paradigm shift from alpha interferon to directly acting antiviral (DAA) therapy.[
