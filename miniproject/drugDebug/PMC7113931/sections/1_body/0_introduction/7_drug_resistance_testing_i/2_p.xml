<p>Presently, the most clinically significant RASs are in the NS5A position for genotypes 1a and 3.[
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] NS5A and NS3 RASs are frequently selected in patients with failure of NS5A or NS3 inhibitor-containing regimens, respectively. NS5B nucleotide RASs are rarely detected (1% of failures) even after exposure to a failing DAA regimen containing a nucleotide inhibitor.[

 <xref rid="ref63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>] In addition, any such substitution would likely render the virus replication incompetent. The clinical impact of NS5A RASs is further compounded by their ability to maintain high replication competence in the absence of continued drug pressure. This allows these viral variants to remain as the dominant viral quasispecies for prolonged periods relative to NS3 protease or NS5B nucleotide polymerase inhibitor RASs.[
