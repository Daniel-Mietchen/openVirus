<p>The replication cycle of HCV is error prone and many of these errors either do not have any effect on the progeny viruses or result in progeny viruses that are incompetent to replicate. However, for some newly produced viruses, the transcription errors result in changes in critical coding regions that may change the susceptibility of the virus to one or more anti-viral agents. Subtherapeutic levels of antiviral agents often lead to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses by creating selective pressure for the resistant viruses to emerge as the dominant species. However, viral variants harbouring substitutions associated with resistance to directing-acting antivirals (DAAs) are detectable prior to antiviral therapy in few chronic HCV infected patients and are referred to as baseline resistance-associated substitutions (RASs). These viruses contain substitutions that are designated as treatment-emergent (or treatment-selected) RASs.[
