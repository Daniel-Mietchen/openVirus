<p>Deep Sequencing Analysis/Next Generation Sequencing (NGS): NGS can increase the sensitivity of detection for minor variants. After sequencing HCV coding regions using PCR, a software algorithm is used to process and align sequencing data via a multistep method to identify the substitutions present at a predetermined level. Although this level, or threshold, can vary, it is often set as low as &gt; 1% for research purposes. To approximate results obtained by population sequencing, NGS thresholds are often set to â‰¥10%.</p>
