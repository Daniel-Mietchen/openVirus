<p>Population-Based Sequencing (Sanger): Population sequencing of the HCV coding region of interest may be performed using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and standard Sanger sequencing of the bulk PCR product. Although the sensitivity for detection of resistance substitutions is subject to variation, in generally it is 15â€“25%. As a standard, substitutions are reported as differences compared with a genotype-specific, wild-type strain.</p>
