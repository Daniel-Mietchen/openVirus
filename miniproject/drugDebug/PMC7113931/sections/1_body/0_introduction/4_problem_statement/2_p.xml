<p>The genetic diversity of the virus further complicates the epidemiology of HCV infection. HCV is classified into 7 genotypes (1â€“7) which differ by more than 30% sequence diversity and at least 67 subtypes, characterized by about 20% sequence divergence.[

 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] Identification of HCV genotypes and subtypes plays a crucial role in defining the epidemiological patterns and effective treatment. Genotype 1 is distributed worldwide and is responsible for majority of the cases reported in the Americas, Europe, Australia, and Japan. Genotype 1a is distributed widely in Northern Europe and United States. Genotype 1b is commonly found in Europe and Asia. Although, genotype 2 is more prevalent in industrialized countries, it is also found in South America and Asia. Genotype 2a has commonly been isolated from Japan and China. Genotype 2b is widespread in Northern Europe and United States. Genotype 2c is the most common subtype found in Western and Southern Europe, Pakistan, and India. Genotype 3a is prevalent in Europe, United States, Australia, and Southern Asia.[

 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] Genotypes 4 and 5 are mainly found in Africa and the Middle East. While genotype 4a is prevalent in Egypt, genotype 4c is highly prevalent in Central Africa. Genotype 5 has mainly been reported from South Africa. Genotype 6 and its numerous subtypes are found mainly in Southeast Asian countries like Thailand, Vietnam, and Myanmar. Genotype 7 has minor clinical relevance and has been recently found in patients from Central Africa and Thailand.[
