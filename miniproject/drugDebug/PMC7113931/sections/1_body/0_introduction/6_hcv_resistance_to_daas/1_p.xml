<p>HCV can develop resistance to DAAs due to the lack of proof-reading activity by RNA dependent RNA polymerase coupled with the high replication capacity of the virus. This leads to the generation of large number of genetically distinct viral variants called “quasispecies”.[
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>
 <xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] Some quasispecies bear polymorphisms in drug-targeted genes resulting in reduced susceptibility to DAAs.[
 <xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] The prevalence of intrinsically resistant variants within a patient's quasispecies is determined by their replicative fitness. Typically, a dominant variant is detectable within the viral quasispecies along with less-fit variants that are present at lower frequencies. The presence of minor populations of resistance-associated variants (RAVs) at the start of treatment may affect the outcomes of the antiviral therapy. Such variants can become dominant as a result of selective pressure exerted by antiviral drugs, subsequently leading to virological breakthrough during treatment or relapse after treatment cessation.[
 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] Some RAVs such as those conferring resistance to NS5A inhibitors are very fit and persist as the dominant species for months to years after treatment cessation. Understanding drug resistance is important in clinical settings to optimize treatment regimens, increase success rates, and minimize the impact of treatment failure.
