<p>The treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus infection has been rapidly evolving since early 1990s with interferon-alfa. This injectable drug worked by boosting the immune system instead of specifically attacking the virus. However, the response rates of this drug were low, ranging from 10 to 20%. In 1998, the oral drug 
 <italic>ribavirin</italic> was added to interferon. The therapeutic response rates increased dramatically, averaging 37 to 43%. In 2002, pegylated interferon-alfa was approved for treatment of chronic hepatitis C. Combined with ribavirin, permanent response rates of 52% were obtained with this drug. In 2011, two protease inhibitors were introduced namely boceprevir and telaprevir.[

However, favorable clinical outcomes could not be achieved in majority of the patients.[

 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] Apart from the several side effects which are associated with interferon therapy, there are various contraindications like pregnancy, breast feeding, and allergic reactions. The recent development of a series of new direct antiviral agents (DAAs) that are directed against HCV target proteins used by the virus for its replication and assembly has ushered a new era in the treatment of hepatitis C.[
 <xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] The DAAs are molecules that target specific nonstructural proteins of HCV thereby interfering with viral replication and infection. There are four classes of DAAs, which are defined by their mechanism of action and therapeutic targets [
