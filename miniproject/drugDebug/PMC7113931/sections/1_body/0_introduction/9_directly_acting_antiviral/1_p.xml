<p>The treatment and monitoring requirements of regimens containing Direct Acting Antivirals (DAAs) are much lower than those containing interferon and ribavirin. Also, DAAs have a much higher efficacy in treating HCV infections. These characteristics mean that initiating treatment and obtaining SVR on completion of treatment in non-specialist environments should be feasible.[

Hence, DAA treatment can be provided in primary healthcare services in order to improve accessibility and retention in care.[

However, stronger study designs are needed to confirm the precision of effect size seen in most of these studies.[
