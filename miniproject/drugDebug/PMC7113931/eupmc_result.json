    "Hepatitis caused by Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of chronic liver disease. HCV is transmitted by injection drug use, blood transfusion, hemodialysis, organ transplantation and less frequently sexual intercourse. It has been recognized as a global health problem because of the progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Globally, about 170 million people are infected with HCV. Since the discovery of this virus in 1989, the clinical management of chronic hepatitis C infection has undergone a paradigm shift from alpha interferon to direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. However, resistance to many of these antiviral agents has been reported increasingly from all over the globe. This review article focuses on the emerging HCV resistance to DAAs and the relevance of in vitro DAA resistance testing in clinical practice."
