<p id="Par4">Remdesivir has been recently recognized as a promising antiviral drug against a wide array of RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV

 </sup>) infection in cultured cells, mice and nonhuman primate (NHP) models. It is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.

 </sup> Remdesivir is an adenosine analogue, which incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination.

 </sup> Our time-of-addition assay showed remdesivir functioned at a stage post virus entry (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c, d</xref>), which is in agreement with its putative anti-viral mechanism as a nucleotide analogue. Warren et al. showed that in NHP model, intravenous administration of 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir resulted in concomitant persistent levels of its active form in the blood (10 μM) and conferred 100% protection against Ebola virus infection.

 </sup> Our data showed that EC
 <sub>90</sub> value of remdesivir against 2019-nCoV in Vero E6 cells was 1.76 μM, suggesting its working concentration is likely to be achieved in NHP. Our preliminary data (Supplementary information, Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>) showed that remdesivir also inhibited virus infection efficiently in a human cell line (human liver cancer Huh-7 cells), which is sensitive to 2019-nCoV.
