 </sup> There is substantial geographical variance in the rates of chronic HBV infection, which is highly endemic in the Western Pacific (6.2%) and African (6.1%) areas, but less common in Europe (1.6%) and America (0.7%).

 </sup> However, the streams of immigration and influx of refugees to Western Europe and North America is likely to be changing the prevalence and endemicity in these latter regions, which underlines the need for physicians to be familiar with the disease.
