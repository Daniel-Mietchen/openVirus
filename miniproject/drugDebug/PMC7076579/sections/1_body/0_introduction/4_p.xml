<p>HBV is unique in its ability to integrate its viral genome in its hostâ€™s DNA by forming covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), which is responsible for its persistent presence in hepatocyte nuclei.

 </sup> The virus itself does not have a direct cytopathic effect. On the contrary, hepatocellular injury is mediated by innate and adaptive immunity. A strong immune response is associated with viral clearance in acute HBV infection, but is also responsible for hepatocyte damage and fibrosis in the immune active phases of chronic HBV infection.
