<p>In recent years, there has been an effort to stratify HBVr risk according to the patient’s serological status and the type and duration of the immunosuppressive treatment used. The American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) classified HBVr risk as low (&lt;1%), moderate (1–10%), and high (&gt;10%) based on the above factors.

 </sup> However, the emergence of new agents and the long duration of biologic treatments, especially in rheumatic diseases where there usually are no set stopping rules for treatment, pose further controversy on HBVr management and monitoring guidance.
