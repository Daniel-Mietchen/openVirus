<p>Cyclophosphamide (CYC)-containing regimens have been recognized among those carrying the highest risk for HBVr in patients with hematological malignancies. In this particular context, however, CYC is administered in combination with other cytotoxic drugs implicated in HBVr (i.e. doxorubicin), and the resulting state of immunosuppression cannot be compared with that of rheumatic patients treated with CYC. For the majority of circumstances in rheumatology, CYC is prescribed alongside GCs for induction of remission in patients with severe manifestations of SLE and systemic vasculitides, such as AAV, polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), and CNS vasculitis. Whereas things are more-or-less clear-cut with patients with chronic HBV infection being candidates for prophylactic antiviral treatment, data on the management of rheumatic patients with resolved HBV infection planned to be treated with CYC-containing regimens remain scarce. In a large cohort of 2054 rheumatic patients,
