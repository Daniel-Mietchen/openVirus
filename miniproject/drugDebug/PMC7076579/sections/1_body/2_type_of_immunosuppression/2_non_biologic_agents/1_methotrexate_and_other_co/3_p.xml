<p>With regards to other non-biologic agents such as leflunomide (LEF), sulfasalazine (SSZ), hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), and azathioprine (AZA), cases of HBVr are extremely rare, and these drugs should be generally considered safe.

 </sup> In a recent prospective study of chronically HBV-infected RA patients treated with MTX, LEF, SSZ, or HCQ without antiviral prophylaxis, only 4/211 (1.8%) developed HBVr; all 4 patients were also receiving GCs, and, thus, the exact contribution of these agents to HBVr is unclear.

 </sup> Similarly, among patients with rheumatic disease and resolved HBV infection taking part in a large prospective multicenter study, use of MTX was not associated with increased risk for HBVr (RR = 0.4).
