<p>Methotrexate (MTX) is an inhibitor of folate metabolism, and has served as the anchor drug for RA for several decades, while it is also frequently used in the management of other rheumatic diseases [spondyloarthropathies, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), vasculitis, myositis, scleroderma, etc.]. MTX is associated with direct acute (hepatitis) and more rarely with chronic (fibrosis) hepatotoxicity. With appropriate pre-treatment screening and regular monitoring, these events are rarely seen today.</p>
