<p>With regards to IV GC pulse therapy in HBsAg positive patients, data are limited and confounded by the concomitant use of other immunosuppressives and the continued use of oral GCs after the IV pulses. A small retrospective study showed no increased HBVr risk for low dose GC pulses (12.5–100 mg/day) given for up to 1 week,

 </sup> whereas, on the contrary, a retrospective Taiwanese study revealed a HBVr rate of 15% (11/72) in patients treated with IV GC pulses (625–750 mg/day) for 3 days.

 </sup> These data should be interpreted with caution, since most of these patients continued therapy with oral GCs (mean daily dose = 23 mg) and other immunosuppressives (biologics or non-biologics).

 </sup> Recent AGA guidelines do not offer any specific recommendations regarding patients treated with IV GC pulses due to the absence of data, but note that any GC dose given for &lt;1 week is considered low risk (&lt;1%), and, thus, no antiviral prophylaxis is recommended.
