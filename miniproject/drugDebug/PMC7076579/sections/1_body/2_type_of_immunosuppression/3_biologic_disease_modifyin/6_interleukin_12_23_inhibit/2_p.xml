 </sup> 11 chronic HBV and 3 resolved HBV infection patients with psoriasis received ustekinumab. HBVr was observed in two of the seven chronic HBV infection patients who did not receive antiviral prophylaxis; in both cases the HBVr was mild and only virological, without biochemical hepatitis. In a similar Asian study by Ting and colleagues of 54 psoriasis patients treated with ustekinumab,
