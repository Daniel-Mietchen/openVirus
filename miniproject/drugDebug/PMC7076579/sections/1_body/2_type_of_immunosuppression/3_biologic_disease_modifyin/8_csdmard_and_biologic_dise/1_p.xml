<p>The question of whether csDMARD and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (bDMARD) combination treatment in rheumatic patients carries higher risk for HBVr compared with bDMARD monotherapy has not been specifically addressed in the published literature. In a retrospective study by Chen and colleagues looking into HBsAg positive patients treated without antiviral prophylaxis, there was no significant difference in HBVr risk when comparing csDMARD monotherapy to csDMARD and bDMARD combination treatment.
