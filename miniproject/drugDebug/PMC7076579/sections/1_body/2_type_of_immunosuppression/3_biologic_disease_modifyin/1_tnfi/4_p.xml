<p>On the basis of these data, TNF inhibition in patients with chronic HBV infection (HBsAg+) carries a significant HBVr risk and it is recommended that all patients receive appropriate oral antiviral prophylaxis with the newer antiviral agents (entecavir, tenofovir). However, in patients with resolved HBV infection, the HBVr risk is rather low, and careful monitoring of aminotransferases (AST, ALT) with prompt HBV-DNA measurement in the case of their elevation should be sufficient in managing these patients.</p>
