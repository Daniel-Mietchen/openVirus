<p>The risk of HBVr in chronic HBV infection patients receiving TNFi has been identified and is well described in several publications. Incidence rates of HBVr in chronically HBV infected patients who did not receive antiviral prophylaxis range between 7.1% and 75% in the setting of rheumatic diseases.

 </sup> Most HBVr cases were associated with a hepatitis flare and in their majority they appeared within the first year of TNFi treatment. Nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment at the time of HBVr usually results in prompt control of the HBV replication and improvement of the hepatic function, although there have been cases of severe liver injury and hepatic failure despite antiviral treatment at the time of HBVr. It has been also shown that antiviral treatment is efficacious in preventing HBVr as supported by the negligible rates of HBVr in this setting.
