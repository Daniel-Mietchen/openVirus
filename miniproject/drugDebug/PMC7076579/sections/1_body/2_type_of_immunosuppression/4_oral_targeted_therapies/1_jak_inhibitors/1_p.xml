<p>JAK inhibitors belong to a novel class of targeted synthetic agents that were recently introduced into daily clinical practice for treatment of RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. JAK inhibitors have a unique mode of action, inhibiting production of various pro-inflammatory cytokines from T-lymphocytes and dendritic cells.

 </sup> To date, three agents of this family have been approved for use in RA (tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib), with another currently under investigation (filgotinib). As for psoriatic arthritis, tofacitinib is the only JAK inhibitor currently approved for use after methotrexate or other csDMARD failure. Data for their HBVr potential are rare, given that these agentsâ€™ pivotal clinical trials excluded patients with evidence of chronic or resolved HBV infection.
