 </sup> They included 269 patients, 255 of whom were anti-HBc positive/antibody against hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) positive and 14 anti-HBc positive/anti-HBs negative. Among the former group, seven (3%) patients had detectable baseline HBV DNA (median viral load 256 IU/mL), while among the latter group, one (7%) had marginally detectable HBV viral load (36 IU/mL). From the total of eight patients with detectable baseline HBV DNA, half discontinued baricitinib, and three out of four were treated with antivirals. The remaining four patients continued baricitinib without antivirals. None of those patients experienced clinical or biochemical hepatitis.
