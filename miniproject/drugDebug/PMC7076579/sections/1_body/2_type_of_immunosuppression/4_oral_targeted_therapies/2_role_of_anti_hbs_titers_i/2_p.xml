<p>Similar data have been reported in rheumatic patients with resolved HBV infection treated with different immunosuppressives and prospective studies support the predictive value of anti-HBs. Over a period of 4 years, 380 rheumatic patients on biologic therapy from a single Chinese center were identified as having resolved HBV infection, and were classified according to anti-HBs levels to ‘negative’ (&lt;10 IU/mL), ‘low’ (10–100 IU/mL), and ‘high’ (&gt;100 IU/mL) groups. There were no HBVr cases in the ‘high’ group, whereas cases of transient HBV viremia were seen in the both the ‘low’ (2.5/100 person-years) and ‘negative’ group (4.7/100 person-years).

 </sup> Among 1042 Japanese patients with rheumatic diseases and resolved HBV infection who received both conventional and biological treatments, HBVr incidence was overall low (1.93/100 person-years), but increased to 4.32/100 person-years in anti-HBc positive/anti-HBs negative patients. The risk ratios for HBVr were 2.8 and 3.1 for anti-HBs titres below the median (71.4 IU/mL) and the cut-off for detection (&lt;10 IU/mL), respectively.
