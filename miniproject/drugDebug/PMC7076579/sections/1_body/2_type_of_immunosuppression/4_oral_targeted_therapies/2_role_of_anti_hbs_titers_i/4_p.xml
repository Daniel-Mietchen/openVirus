<p>Overall, these (mainly retrospective) data suggest that the presence of anti-HBs antibodies in patients with resolved HBV infection, especially when present in high titers (&gt;100â€‰IU/mL), significantly decreases the risk for HBVr after immunosuppressive therapies. Physicians should be vigilant in the care of patients with isolated HBc positivity when high risk treatments are used. Nevertheless, in the absence of prospective data from randomized trials showing that patients with high anti-HBs titers do not need appropriate monitoring, or, in certain cases, antiviral prophylaxis for HBVr, we cannot currently recommend serial anti-HBs measurements replacing monitoring with serum HBV DNA.</p>
