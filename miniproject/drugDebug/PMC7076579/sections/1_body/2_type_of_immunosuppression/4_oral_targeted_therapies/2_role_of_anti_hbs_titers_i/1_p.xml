<p>In a significant proportion (73–84%) of patients with resolved HBV infection (HBsAg negative/anti-HBc positive), circulating anti-HBs antibodies can be detected in the serum.

 </sup> A number of retrospective studies in hematology and oncology patients have shown that the presence of anti-HBs antibodies reduces the risk for HBVr during chemotherapy (including RTX-containing regimens).

 </sup> The results of these studies were corroborated by a relevant meta-analysis of 20 studies looking into the role of anti-HBs levels in HBVr risk of patients with hematological malignancy, which found that the presence of detectable anti-HBs reduced HBVr [pooled odds ratio (OR) = 0.21], even in patients with lymphoma receiving RTX chemotherapy.
