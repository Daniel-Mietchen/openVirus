 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1759720X20912646">Figure 1</xref>) is capable of identifying rheumatic patients not exposed to HBV [HBsAg/anti-HBc/anti-HBs(−)], and a complete series of vaccination should be offered to those at risk of HBV exposure according to their occupation, medical status, or sexual behavior. The complete vaccination schedule with the recombinant HBsAg vaccine consists of three doses (20 μg per dose) administered at 0, 1, and 6 months. Patients on dialysis should be vaccinated with high-dose (40 μg) vaccines with the same time intervals.
