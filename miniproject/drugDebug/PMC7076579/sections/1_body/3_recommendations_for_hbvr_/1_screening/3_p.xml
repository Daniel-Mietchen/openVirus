<p>Given the increased risk of HBVr associated with the immunosuppressive potency of the treatment used, we recommend universal screening in patients scheduled to start biologic and targeted synthetic DMARD therapy, as well as moderate to high doses of glucocorticoids for prolonged periods (&gt;4â€‰weeks duration). For conventional DMARDs, the risk of drug-related hepatotoxicity should be also of concern (especially for methotrexate and leflunomide) and, thus, screening should be performed in all patients.
