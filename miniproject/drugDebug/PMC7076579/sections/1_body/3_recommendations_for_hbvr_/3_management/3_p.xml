<p>The ideal timing for commencing antiviral prophylaxis, especially in the setting of high baseline viral loads, is 1â€“2 weeks before starting immunosuppressive treatment.

 </sup> If delaying the start of immunosuppression is not feasible, antivirals should be started as soon as possible. From the available literature data on the timing for cessation of prophylaxis, the suggestion is to continue with prophylactic treatment for at least 6 months after the end of antirheumatic treatment (12 months if that treatment is RTX). Reaching the therapeutic endpoint as per hepatology guidelines should guide the decision for stopping NAs when they are used for treating chronic hepatitis B rather than for prophylaxis of reactivation.
