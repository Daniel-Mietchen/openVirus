<p>For patients that are identified as never been exposed to HBV (HBsAg/Anti-HBc/Anti-HBsâ€“), HBV vaccination should be considered and offered to the patient. This has greater value in patients in high risk groups, including patients with high-risk sexual activity, sexual partners and household contacts of HBV-infected individuals, injectable drug users, hemodialysis patients, health care workers, and patients from endemic areas. The vaccination should ideally take place before commencing immunosuppression, especially if this is B-cell depleting treatment.
