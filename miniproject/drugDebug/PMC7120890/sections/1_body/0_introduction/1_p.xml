<p>A virus is a small, infectious agent, which contains little more than bundles of gene strands of gene strands of either RNA or DNA, and may be surrounded bya shell of protein. Unlike bacterial cells, which are free-living entities, viruses utilize the host cell environment to propagate new viruses. The newly made viruses then leave the host cell, sometimes killing it in the process, and proceed to infect other cells within the host. Virus infection can cause a mild illness as a cold or a deadly illness as the bloody African fever. The viruses that cause Lassa fever and Ebola fever and the retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are examples spreading easily, threatening peopleâ€™s life and health sometimes swiftly, and for which there is no cure or vaccine (Jassim and Naji
