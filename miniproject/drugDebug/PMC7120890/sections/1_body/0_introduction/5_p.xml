<p>According to statistics, natural products have become one of the main resources for new drug research and development in the past two decades, especially for the treatment of infectious diseases. Approximately 44% of the antiviral drugs approved between 1981 and 2006 were natural products, semi-synthetic natural product analogues or synthetic compounds based on natural-product pharmacophores (Newman and Cragg
