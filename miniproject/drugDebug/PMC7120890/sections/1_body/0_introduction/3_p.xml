<p>With the advances in molecular biology and reverse genetics in the past two decades, many viruses have been known to have unique features in their structures or in their replication cycles, which are their potential targets. Since viral enzymes are crucial for disease progression and virus replication, inhibitors against viral enzymes have been the most desirable strategies. Most of the well-studied inhibitors against HIV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) or the influenza viruses target the host cell binding (T-20, betulinic acid, etc.), uncoating of capsid (amantadine derivatives, pleconaril), replication (reverse transcriptase inhibitors like zidovudine or abacavir, nevirapine, etc.), integrase inhibitors, DNA or RNA polymerase inhibitors (acyclovir, cidofovir, ribavirin, etc.), proteinase involved in viral polyprotein precursors and assembly/maturation inhibitors (indinavir, ritonavir and rimantadine, etc.). Based on this strategy, numerous compounds have been tested on different viruses in the past decades, but there are still less than 40 licensed anti-virals in the market (Chattopadhyay et al.
