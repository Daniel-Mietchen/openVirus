<p>Raoulic acid is a principal ingredient of the plant 
 <italic>Raoulia australis</italic> Hook. F (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2_3" ref-type="fig">3.2</xref>; Choi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32_3">2009a</xref>). Antiviral assay using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction method showed that raoulic acid possessed strong antiviral activity against human rhinovirus 2 (HRV2) with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of less than 0.1 μg/ml, human rhinovirus 3 (HRV3) with a IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.19 μg/ml, coxsackie B3 (CB3) virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.33 μg/ml, coxsackie B4 (CB4) virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.40 μg/ml, and enterovirus 71 (EV71) virus with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of less than 0.1 μg/ml. However, the compound did not possess antiviral activity against influenza A (Flu A/PR, Flu A/WS, H1N1) and B viruses.
