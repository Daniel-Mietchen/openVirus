<p>Moreover, the antiviral activity of aqueous extract and pure compounds of 
 <italic>Plantago major</italic> L., a popular traditional Chinese medicine, were studied on a series of viruses, namely herpesviruses (HSV-1, HSV-2) and adenoviruses (ADV-3, ADV-8, ADV-11). The results showed that aqueous extract of 
 <italic>P. major</italic> possessed only a slight anti-herpes virus activity (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180_3">2009</xref>). While certain pure compounds exhibited potent antiviral activity. Among them, caffeic acid exhibited the strongest activity against HSV-1 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>  =  15.3 μg/ml, SI  =  671), HSV-2 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>  =  87.3 μg/ml, SI  =  118) and ADV-3 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>  =  14.2 μg/ml, SI  =  727), whereas chlorogenic acid possessed the strongest anti-ADV-11 (EC
 <sub>50</sub>  =  13.3 μg/ml, SI  =  301) activity (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180_3">2009</xref>). The study concludes that pure compounds of 
 <italic>P. major</italic>, which possess antiviral activities are mainly derived from the phenolic compounds, especially caffeic acid. Its mode of action against HSV-2 and ADV-3 was found to be at multiplication stages (postinfection of HSV-1: 0–12 h; ADV-3: 0–2 h) (Chiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29_3">2002a</xref>). In addition, chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid also showed an inhibitory effect on HBV (hepatitis B virus) replication (Fig.
