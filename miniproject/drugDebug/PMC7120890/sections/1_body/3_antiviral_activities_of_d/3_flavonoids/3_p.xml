<p>The flavonoids apigenin and luteolin displayed significant 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-influenza viral activity, which were isolated from the traditional Chinese medicinal plant

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110_3">2008a</xref>). The structure-activity relationship (SAR) of flavonoids as influenza virus neuraminidase inhibitors revealed that for good inhibitory effect, the 4â€²-OH, 7-OH, C4=O, and C2=C3 functionalities were essential, and the presence of a glycosylation group greatly reduced NA inhibition (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111_3">2008b</xref>). The ability of flavonoids to inhibit the activity of NA is one of the pathways to inhibit the replication of influenza virus. These findings provide important information for the exploitation and utilization of flavonoids as NA inhibitors for influenza treatment.
