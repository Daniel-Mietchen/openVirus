<p>The antiviral activity of a triterpene saponin isolated from 
 <italic>angallis arvensis</italic>, was studied 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against several viruses including HSV-1, adenovirus type 6, vaccinia, vesicular stomatitis and poliovirus (Amoros et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3_3">1987</xref>). The drug was found to inhibit the replication of HSV-1 and poliovirus type 2 as shown by inhibition of cytopathic effect and reduction of virus production. The action was not due to a virucidal effect but might involve inhibition of virus-host cell attachment. Single cycle experiments indicated that saponins interfered with both early and late events of herpes virus replication (Amoros et al.
