<p>The proteoglycan seems to be a potential candidate for anti-HSV agents. A proteoglycan (GLPG), extracted and purified from the mycelia of 
 <italic>Ganoderma lucidum</italic> by ethanol (EtOH) precipitation and DEAE-cellulose column chromatography, displayed antiviral activities against HSV-1 and type 2 (HSV-2). The study on its action mechanism suggested that GLPG inhibits viral replication by interfering with the early events of viral adsorption and entry into target cells (Liu et al.
