<p>The antiviral activities of natural products, including ingredients, fractions and extracts, need to be evaluated by various anti-viral models, including 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> models. Besides, the analysis of assay results of natural products is also very important. In the present section, the models to evaluate the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-viral activities of potential natural products have been summarized, and the evaluation methods of several representative models have been introduced. The antiviral models include molecular level models and cellular level models (Table
