<p>MDCK cells are grown at about 90% confluence and infected with influenza virus at 0.1 MOI and cultured in the presence of compounds/extracts at various concentrations. At 16 h post-infection, cells are scraped off and collected by centrifugation (500 g for 5 min). Cell pellets are washed with PBS twice. Total cellular and viral RNAs are isolated from pellets using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacture’s protocol. First-strand cDNA is synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA with Omniscript RT kit (QIAGEN) using specific primers. PCR reactions are performed with 50 μl of reaction buffer [5 μl of cDNA template, 50 pmols of primers, 0.1 mM dNTPs, and 0.5U of EX-Taq polymerase (Takara)]. The amplification conditions are as follows: 94°C for 5 min (1 cycle), 94°C for 1 min, 55°C 40 s and 72°C 1 min 40 s (18 cycles, respectively). NP RNA is chosen for detection and the primer sequences used for the detection of viral RNA are 5′-TGC TGG ATT CTC GTT CGG TC (sense) and 5′-CCT TTA TGA CAA AGA AGA AATAAGGCG (antisense). The β-actin is used as internal control of cellular RNAs, with primer sequences of 5′-TCA CCC GAG TCC ATC ACG AT (sense) and 5′-GAA GTA CCC CAT TGA GCA CGG (antisense). The reverse transcription and PCR products are resolved on 1.0% agarose gels and stained with ethidium bromide (Song et al.
