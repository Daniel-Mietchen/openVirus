<p>Cellular level models usually exploit the virusâ€™s ability to infect and replicate in specific cell lines in cell culture systems. The cell culture system provides a rapid method to grow viruses at higher titres to test the antiviral activity of compounds/extracts. It is based on the observation that virus infection and multiplication results in cytopathic effect (CPE) due to either release of virus or induction of apoptosis as a result of host immune responses. Inhibition of CPE in presence of test compound could be due to inhibition of virus replication. The assay results combined with molecular level assay results will guide the later study in animal models.</p>
