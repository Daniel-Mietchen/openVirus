<p>ELISA assays allow the detection of viral antigen or antibody, using a solid-phase assay system. Although qualitative, it offers a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for detection and gross quantitation of virus. Absolute quanitation is possible if a series of pre-determined viral titres are used to get elisa readings and matched with that unknown samples can be calculated to estimate the quantity of the virus samples (untreated or drug-treated). The method cannot differentiate between infectious and non-infectious virus particles as a result of which the drug affecting at the earlier or latter stage of viral replication or maturation may not be understood (Chattopadhyay et al.
