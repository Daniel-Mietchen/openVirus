<p>Briefly, the untreated or drug-treated cells are infected with a known concentration of virus, adsorbed for 1 h, washed and incubated for 2–4 days depending on virus-induced CPE. Virus is harvested after freeze-thawing, centrifuged, and supernatant is diluted with the sample diluent and used for ELISA experiments. To each of the 96 well strip-plate coated with virus specific antibody 100 μl control or test sample is added followed by 1 h incubation at room temperature with 100 μl conjugate containing enzyme labeled virus-specific antibody. After washing five times 100 μl of substrate is added and incubated in dark for 10 min at room temperature. Most of the assays employ horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase, or β-D-galactosidase. Reaction is stopped with stop solution in kit (usually 5% H
 <sub>2</sub>SO
 <sub>4</sub>) and absorbance reading is taken photometrically at OD
 <sub>450</sub>. Alternatively, the drug treatment and virus infection can be performed in 96-well formats, instead of preparing virus supernatants. For this, quadruplicate monolayers in 96-well microtitre plates are overlaid with log10 dilution of test compounds followed by the infection with virus. After 16–20 h incubation at 37°C, monolayers are fixed with 0.05% glutaraldehyde in PBS and assayed for protein specific for the virus on the cell surface. ELISA is performed with monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to specific protein of the corresponding virus strains and protein A horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio Rad, Hercules, CA). The optical densities (OD
 <sub>450</sub>) are measured and expressed as a percentage of nondrug-treated virus-infected cells (virus control). The concentration causing 50% reduction in optical density values (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) was evaluated from graphic plots. The selectivity index (SI) was determined from the ratio of IC
 <sub>50</sub>:EC
 <sub>50</sub>.
