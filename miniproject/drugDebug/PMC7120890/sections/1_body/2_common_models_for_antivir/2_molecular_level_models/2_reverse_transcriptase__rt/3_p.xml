<p>Following a second wash, the AP substrate p-nitrophenyl phosphate is added and the resulting yellow color change is measured to quantify the amount of incorporated BrdUTP. Following addition of the AP substrate each plate is read at three time points: 10 min, 2–3 h, and 5–6 h or overnight at 15–24 h. The results are expressed in femtograms HIV-1 RT activity/ml plasma. The lower limit of detection is &lt;1 fg/ml. Results are calculated using ExaVir Load Analyzer software that automatically determines the amount of RT activity in samples using a standard curve generated from an 11-point dilution of a known amount of recombinant HIV-1 RT. The results are also given in units of HIV-1 RNA equivalent copies/ml using a conversion factor derived from a Swedish cohort comprised mainly of subtype B virus. Assay precision is determined on duplicates of five samples, and assay reproducibility is determined on seven samples run on different days.</p>
