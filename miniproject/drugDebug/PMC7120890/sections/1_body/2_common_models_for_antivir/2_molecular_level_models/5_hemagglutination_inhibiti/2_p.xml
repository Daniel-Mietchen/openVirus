<p>If the test compounds inhibit virus replication and thus viral titre, the HA value will be reduced. HA inhibition assay is employed to test the effect of the test compounds in virus adsorption to target cells. Compound solutions (25 μl) with twofold serial dilution with PBS are mixed with equal volume of influenza virus solution (200HAU/25 μl). After incubation for 30 min at room temperature, 50 μl of the solution is mixed with equal volume of 1% chicken erythrocyte suspension and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (Song et al.
