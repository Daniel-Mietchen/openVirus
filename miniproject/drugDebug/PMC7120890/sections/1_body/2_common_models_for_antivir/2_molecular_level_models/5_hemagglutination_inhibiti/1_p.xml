<p>The hemagglutination assay (HA) is a quantitation of hemagglutination protein of viruses. Some viral families have surface or envelope proteins, which are able to agglutinate (stick to) human or animal red blood cells (RBC) and bind to its N-acetylneuraminic acid. The RBC will form a type of lattice in this case. In contrast to plaque assay or LD
 <sub>50</sub>, HA does not give any measure of viral infectivity, because no virus replication is required in this assay. It is an easy, simple and rapid method and can be applied to large amounts of samples. The detailed conditions depend on the type of virus. Some viruses bind RBCs only at certain pH values, others at certain ionic strengths.
