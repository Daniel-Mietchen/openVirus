<p>A standard fluorimetric assay is used to measure influenza virus NA activity. The substrate MUNANA (2′-(methylumbelliferyl)-α-D-acetylneuraminic acid) is cleaved by NA to yield a fluorescent product, which can be quantified. The reaction mixture containing the test compounds/extracts and NA enzyme or a virus suspension in 32.5 mM MES buffer with 4 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub> (pH 6.5) is incubated for 40 min at 37°C. After incubation, the reaction is terminated by the addition of 34 mM NaOH. The fluorescence is quantified at an excitation wavelength of 360 nm and emission wavelength of 450 nm. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) is defined as the concentration of NA inhibitor necessary to reduce the NA activity by 50% relative to that in a reaction mixture containing virus but no inhibitor (Liu et al.
