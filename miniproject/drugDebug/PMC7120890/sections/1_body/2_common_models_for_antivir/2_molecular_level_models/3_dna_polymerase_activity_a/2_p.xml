<p>To explore the use of fluorescent primers in assaying DNA polymerase activity with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> primer extension, we can use the following 40 mer oligodeoxynucleotides as templates: an oligo dT (5′ TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT GTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC) and a (dC.dA)n template (5′ CACACACACACACACACACACACGTCGTGACTGGGAAAAC), where the underlined sequences are the 17-mer M13 (−40) universal primer sequence. Fluorescein-labeled M13 primer (0.5 μM; Alpha DNA, Montreal, Canada) is annealed to the two templates (0.8 μM each) in the presence of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 100 mM NaCl by heating to 90°C for 5 min, followed by cooling to 25°C over several hours, to obtain our substrate.
