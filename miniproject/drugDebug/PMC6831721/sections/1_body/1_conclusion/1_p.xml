<p>The advent of CRISPR-based gene editing has greatly expanded the realm of possibility for engineering of disease-refractory effector genes. Combined with monitoring and rapid management of pathogen resistance when it emerges, we believe that the odds are increasingly favoring the effector genes over the pathogens in this forthcoming evolutionary tug-of-war. In the coming years, we expect more anti-pathogen effectors to be developed, thereby increasing the array of tools available to combat these pathogens. Concomitantly, laboratory and modeling studies of how to best prevent the emergence of resistance in the field should be conducted to investigate ways to create “evolution-proof” strategies for the development and release of effector gene products. Semi-field studies and mathematical modeling will both have a role in highlighting challenges and opportunities for these systems, as they have for drug and insecticide resistance (

As these technologies are developed and improved and regulatory approvals are granted, we remain optimistic they will play a pivotal role in eliminating vector-borne disease transmission on a global scale, in concert with other strategies (
