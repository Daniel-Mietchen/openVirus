<p>Resistance to antimalarial drugs has been documented several times over the course of the last 60â€“70 years (

 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, and other species. Resistance of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> to the drug was first documented in nature in the 1950s, and the effectiveness of chloroquine quickly declined as resistant strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> spread and evolved. Several mechanisms of chloroquine resistance that emerged in nature have been documented in the laboratory, mostly revolving around transport of chloroquine in and out of the parasite. Notably, mutations in a 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> chloroquine resistance transporter gene (PfCRT) have been shown to permit the parasite to efflux chloroquine at a rate 40 times that of cells lacking the mutations (
