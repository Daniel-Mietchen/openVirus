<p>Artemisinin, a semisynthetic drug re-discovered from Chinese traditional medicine in the 1970s, has been used to treat malaria for decades. Use of the drug as a monotherapy has been discouraged since the early 2000s given evidence of emerging resistance in nature and availability of several partner drugs (e.g., piperaquine and amodiaquine) that are effective and well tolerated in patients. Resistance to artemisinin-based combination therapy drugs (ACTs) was first reported in Southeast Asia in 2008 and has subsequently spread throughout the region (

Several mechanisms of resistance are thought to be involved, and have been documented in laboratory studies, including mutations in transporter genes that result in an efflux of the drug away from its site of action in the cell, or a change in target recognized by the parasite (
