<p>Curiously, resistance to ACTs has only been observed to a limited extent in SSA, where the malaria burden is greatest. One possible explanation is that there are many untreated malaria infections in SSA—some symptomatic, but many asymptomatic. If drug resistance is associated with a fitness cost in 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, then that cost could outweigh the benefits in a scenario where many infections go untreated. Treatment with “weaker” drugs is common in Southeast Asia, providing a fitness advantage to drug resistance there and a smaller evolutionary barrier for this trait to evolve. In sum, these observations suggest that: i) the malaria parasite 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> has evolved resistance to a range of antimalarial drugs by multiple mechanisms; ii) combination therapies may help to slow the evolution of resistance (
