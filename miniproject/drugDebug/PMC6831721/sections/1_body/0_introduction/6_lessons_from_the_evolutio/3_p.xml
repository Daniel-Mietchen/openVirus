<p>Antifolate drugs, such as pyrimethamine and sulfadoxine, were developed and used for chloroquine-resistant parasites and in other settings from the 1950s onwards. However, resistance quickly emerged in nature from mutations to the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) and dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) genes, which allowed antifolates to act on and disrupt the folate biosynthetic pathway (

This combination is still used in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and other locales where resistance is not too severe, due to its availability and affordability.
