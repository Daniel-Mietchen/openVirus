<p>Strategies for delaying and managing resistance to disease-refractory effector genes in mosquitoes parallel those for antimalarial and antiviral drugs in humans (
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">White and Olliaro, 1996</xref>). Three key elements include: i) preventing emergence of resistance, ii) monitoring efficacy and confirming resistance when present, and iii) managing resistance through containing its spread and ensuring a pipeline of new effector genes.
