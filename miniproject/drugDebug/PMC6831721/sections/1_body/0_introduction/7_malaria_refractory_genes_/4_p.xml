<p>Melanization-based mechanisms that inactivate malaria parasites exist in nature, as do resistant mechanisms in the parasite, providing insight into parasite evolutionary responses. In nature, there is a melanization pathway by which pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) bind to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), activating a cascade of reactions culminating in large-scale melanin synthesis and encapsulation of the parasite in a melanin coat (
