<p>Care must be taken in the choice of disease-refractory genes to avoid a situation in which the effector gene selects for parasites displaying higher infectivity/pathogenicity in the population. Work on effector molecules based on single-chain antibodies suggests that these could prevent sporozoites from entering the salivary glands at infection levels encountered in natural conditions (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Isaacs et al., 2012</xref>). However, in the laboratory, higher-than-normal parasitemia resulted in some parasites reaching the salivary glands despite the effector gene being present. Such effector genes could, in principle, select for parasites strains that reproduce at higher rates and produce higher loads, with potentially detrimental consequences for human disease burden and transmission. Clearly, in the presence of anti-parasite effector genes, malaria parasites displaying resistant phenotypes will be selected for in the population. The relevant question is therefore how we can substantially delay the emergence and subsequent spread of these parasite varieties. Perhaps the best approach might be to attack the parasites at as many stages as possible with an array of effector mechanisms to prevent the evolution of resistance, or increased infectivity/pathogenicity. That said, these effectors must be challenged with a diversity of parasites, similar to what is found in the wild, as opposed to a singular lab strain that has been maintained for many years in the lab (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">Isaacs et al., 2012</xref>). This may be the best lab-based attempt at generating data that could be translatable to what could occur in nature, however even this may still not reflect what would happen in the wild.
