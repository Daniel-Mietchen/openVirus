<p>Any refractory gene aiming to interrupt the development of the malaria parasite places a strong selective pressure on parasites capable of circumventing this interruption, and resistance mechanisms can be imagined for any of the effector genes produced thus far. For an antimalarial gene that prevents the parasite from recognizing the mosquito midgut by saturating the midgut receptors in the mosquito (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2002</xref>), parasites could evolve to recognize other receptors on the midgut, enabling them to pass into the hemocoel. Similarly, for a refractory gene that saturates parasite recognition receptors in the salivary glands (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">Ito et al., 2002</xref>), parasites could evolve to recognize other receptors, enabling them to pass through and to be injected into susceptible humans upon the mosquito taking a blood meal.
