<p>Likely, there will be multiple TPPs for different stages of technology implementation. Leading up to the first phase of field trials, an entomological endpoint may be more feasible, and it may only be necessary to have a product capable of being prevalent and functional in a local vector population for a few years, i.e., over the duration and spatial extent of a field trial (

Leading up to an open release with the intent of wide-scale disease control, however, an epidemiological endpoint will be of most interest, and it will be necessary to have a product capable of spreading widely and retaining its effectiveness for a duration potentially required to achieve widespread pathogen elimination (
