<p>If the competition between effector gene design and pathogen evolution is a tug-of-war, then the TPP would determine the position of the line that one has to pull the other over. Where we draw that line is determined by what our goals and evaluation criteria are. Are they entomological or epidemiological? If entomological, what is the minimum proportion of the vector population we require to be disease-refractory, and for how long? If epidemiological, what is the desired reduction in clinical incidence of disease (or some other disease-related measure), and over what time period? And what vector species and pathogens are we focusing our attention on?</p>
