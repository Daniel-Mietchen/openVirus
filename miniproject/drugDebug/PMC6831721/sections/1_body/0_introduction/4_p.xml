<p>Gene drive strategies are immensely promising for the control of vector-borne diseases due to their ability to spread beyond their release site and to function independently of human compliance, which is a barrier for many interventions (

Nevertheless, the introduction of disease-refractory genes into a vector population sets up an understudied evolutionary tug-of-war between the anti-pathogen effector and pathogen evolution. Resistance can evolve against the gene drive technologies that support the introgression of these anti-pathogen effectors into the target population. For instance, CRISPR-based homing systems are particularly susceptible to the formation of homing-resistant alleles through inaccurate DNA repair events including non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and microhomology-mediated end-joining (MMEJ). These imprecise DNA repair pathways could also lead to loss of the disease-refractory gene by inaccurate DNA repair or mutational loss-of-function. In this review, we focus on pathogen resistance to effector genes, as other resistance mechanisms are well documented elsewhere (
