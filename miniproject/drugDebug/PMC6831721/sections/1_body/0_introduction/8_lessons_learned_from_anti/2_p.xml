<p>Most mosquito-borne viruses of human health concern are RNA viruses in the families 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>. The high genetic variability and mutability of RNA viruses, due to low fidelity RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Steinhauer et al., 1992</xref>), along with their high yield and fast replication times, drive the diverse host and environmental ranges of these viruses. This leads to a dynamic population of mutant viral genomes, referred to as a quasispecies, that can rapidly increase or decrease in population frequency according to their fitness (

 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">Lauring and Andino, 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Andino and Domingo, 2015</xref>). At any point in time, the viral population could comprise one or more variants that have a resistant mutant to an otherwise strong selection pressure, such as a drug or antiviral effector.
