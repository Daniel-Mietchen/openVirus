<p>The rapid mutation rates of arboviruses are key to their broad host tropism. Host-specific selection pressure can constrain viral diversity (

 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">Grubaugh et al., 2016</xref>), and could be advantageous in effector design. Effectors that act very early will have the advantage of targeting smaller, less diverse viral populations, and hence viral resistance will be slower to emerge. However, these viral populations rapidly diversify in the vector given their high mutation rates and large population sizes. Virus host adaptations are found frequently in nature (

 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2019</xref>), as seen in the 2005-2006 CHIKV outbreak in La RÃ©union (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Tsetsarkin et al., 2007</xref>). As the virus disseminates in the mosquito, viral diversity may be further bottlenecked (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">Patterson et al., 2018</xref>) and therefore additional tissue and timing-appropriate effector strategies may be able to take advantage of the lower viral diversity at these later bottlenecks in the transmission cycle.
