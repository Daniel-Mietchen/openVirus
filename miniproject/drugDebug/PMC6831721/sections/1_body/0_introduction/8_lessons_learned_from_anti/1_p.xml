<p>Besides malaria, the largest vector-borne disease burden is that due to the family of arboviruses transmitted by 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, including DENV and ZIKV. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-transmitted arboviruses are of particular concern at present, as the mosquito vector has rapidly expanded its range in recent years (

 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">Ryan et al., 2019</xref>). In response, a variety of approaches have recently been taken to engineer mosquitoes refractory to these diseases, including: i) transgene-based RNA interference (RNAi) in the midgut (

 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al., 2019b</xref>), iii) use of broadly neutralizing, single-chain variable fragments (scFv) (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al., 2019a</xref>), iv) use of antiviral hammerhead enzymes (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">Mishra et al., 2016</xref>), and v) transgenic activation of antiviral pathways (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">Jupatanakul et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, these arboviruses are prone to rapidly evolving resistance to antiviral strategies. Lessons may be learned from human antiviral drug development and vector-virus immune studies, highlighting potential pitfalls that may transpire during antiviral effector development.
