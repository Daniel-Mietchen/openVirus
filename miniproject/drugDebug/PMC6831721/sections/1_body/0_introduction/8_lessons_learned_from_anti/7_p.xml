<p>These examples indicate the immense potential to rapidly constrain the host range of these viruses, and effectors that disrupt areas of the viral genome required for host switching could further limit their epidemic potential. Many conserved, host-essential regions have been discovered in arboviruses, e.g., the 3â€™UTR of DENV (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Filomatori et al., 2017</xref>) and other arboviruses (

 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">Morley et al., 2018</xref>). While host-specific selection pressures restrict the evolution of arboviruses in the mosquito, the immunity and host-associated diversification of arboviruses in mosquitoes indicate strong potential to develop resistance to antiviral effectors. Studying these important vector-virus interactions and their role in viral evolution will support the design of new and more robust antiviral effectors. Furthermore, with continued advancements in genome engineering, effector design capabilities will also improve. In the next section, we discuss the current state of antiviral effector development and future directions for these effectors.
