<p>These attributes of RNA viruses have confounded the development of antiviral drugs for many important human viral infections. For example, due to the high mutation frequency of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a multi-target combinational drug approach is required to minimize HIV replication. This approach typically targets the viral reverse transcriptase (RT) gene, or other essential viral genes with reasonably high genetic or structural conservation (

Although not strictly comparable, this example demonstrates that targeting multiple essential viral genes and conserved sites in the viral genome, the common approach taken to mitigate antiviral effector resistance in mosquitoes, does not necessarily prevent resistance from emerging.
