<p>The majority of arbovirus-refractory effectors developed to date utilize RNAi-based approaches (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Blair and Olson, 2015</xref>). These have been used to target DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) for over a decade, with trailblazing studies demonstrating that transgenes encoding long double-stranded RNAs serve as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) capable of targeting the viral genome and consequently suppressing viral replication and transmission (

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Franz et al., 2014</xref>). Similar approaches have recently been implemented against DENV serotype 3 (DENV-3), CHIKV and ZIKV (

 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">Yen et al. (2018)</xref> developed transgenes encoding microRNAs (miRNAs)—a class of small noncoding RNAs involved in the regulation of gene expression—targeting DENV-3 and CHIKV, triggered either ubiquitously or in the midgut in response to a blood meal. These effectors still need to be optimized; however, reductions in DENV-3 and CHIKV transmission rates were significant—∼94 and ∼77–83%, respectively. 
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al. (2019b)</xref> developed transgenes encoding a cluster of synthetic small RNAs designed to target the ZIKV genome in the midgut (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Buchman et al., 2019b</xref>). Results for these effectors were impressive, with homozygotes being completely refractory to ZIKV infection, and heterozygotes having infection and transmission rates low enough to make them unlikely to transmit to a susceptible human host.
