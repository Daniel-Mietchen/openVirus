<p>An RNAi-mediated effector itself may also increase viral genetic diversity thereby potentiating viral escape. For example, the RNAi immune response drove the diversification of West Nile virus in mosquitoes (

It is unknown whether effectors that use a similar RNAi-mediated antiviral mechanism will drive diversification of arboviruses, and if so, what the impact of this diversification would be on viral resistance. It is also still an open question as to how many small RNAs are necessary to prevent viral escape mutants in a diverse wild population, and the potential effect of this RNAi-mediated approach on viral evolution.
