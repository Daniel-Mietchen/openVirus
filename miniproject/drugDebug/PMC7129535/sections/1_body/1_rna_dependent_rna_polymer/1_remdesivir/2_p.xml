<p id="p0020">Information regarding the pharmacokinetics of remdesivir in humans is not available. Nevertheless, valuable data from rhesus monkeys revealed an intravenous 10 mg/kg dose of remdesivir could lead to a remarkably high intracellular concentration (&gt;10 μM) of active triphosphate form in peripheral blood mononuclear cells for at least 24 h,
