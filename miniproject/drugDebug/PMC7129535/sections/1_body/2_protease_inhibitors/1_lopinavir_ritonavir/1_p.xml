<p id="p0045">Protease inhibitors (PIs) are important agents in the contemporary treatment of patients with chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. In the Orthocoronavirinae family, the targets of PIs are papain-like protease and 3C-like protease.

 </xref> The antiviral activity of lopinavir (LPV; Abbott Laboratories, Lake Bluff, Illinois, US) against MERS-CoV in a tissue culture model is controversial, despite a good effect in mitigating disease progression in MERS-CoV-infected marmosets.

 </xref> Of note, Sheahan et al. (2020) compared the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir (25 mg/kg twice a day, administered 1 day prior to infection) as well as therapeutic remdesivir with that of LPV/ritonavir (RTV, used to prolong the LPV's half-life)-IFNb combination therapy in a humanized transgenic mouse MERS-CoV infection model. They observed the efficacy of remdesivir was superior to that of LPV/RTV-IFNb against MERS-CoV in terms of viral load reduction and improvement in extent of pathologic change in lung tissue.

 </xref> In addition to gastrointestinal adverse effects (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) induced by LPV/RTV, it is noteworthy that LPV/RTV treatment alone (400/100 mg administered orally twice daily for 14 days; Chinese Clinical Trial Register number, ChiCTR2000029308) failed to provide benefits compared to standard care alone. Median time to clinical improvement in both cases was 16 days (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to 1.85;
