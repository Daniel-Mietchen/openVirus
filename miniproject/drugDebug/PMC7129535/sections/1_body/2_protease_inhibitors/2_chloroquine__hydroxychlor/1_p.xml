<p id="p0055">Chloroquine is active against malaria as well as autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis [RA], lupus erythematosus). It was recently reported as a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug for treatment of viruses such as influenza H

 <sub>90</sub> of 6.90 μM, using Vero E6 cells infected by SARS-CoV-2), an extensive prescription of chloroquine in clinical treatment of SARS-CoV-2 is a completely off-label use. It is not recommended in light of safety concerns (adverse effects on the hematologic, hepatic and renal systems, QTc prolongation with ventricular dysrhythmia) and will likely result in a major shortage of anti-malarial armamentaria.
