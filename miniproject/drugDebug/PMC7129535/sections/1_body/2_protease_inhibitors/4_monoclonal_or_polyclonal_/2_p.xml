<p id="p0085">Numerous 
 <italic>inÂ vitro</italic> studies have shown that the spike protein of SARS-CoV is important in mediating viral entry into target cells. Furthermore, the cleavage and subsequent activation of the SARS-CoV spike protein by a protease of the host cell is absolutely essential for infectious viral entry.

 </xref> Type II transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2 was suggested to be an important host protease that cleaves and activates the SARS-CoV spike protein in cell cultures, and was thus explored as a potential antiviral agent.
