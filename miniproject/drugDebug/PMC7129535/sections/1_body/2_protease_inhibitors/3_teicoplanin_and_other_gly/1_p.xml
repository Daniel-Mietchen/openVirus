<p id="p0070">The other antibiotics worth mentioning in this review are glycopeptides. Teicoplanin (Sanofi Pharmaceuticals, Paris, France) was demonstrated to potently prevent the entry of Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses into the cytoplasm, and also has an inhibitory effect on transcription-as well as replication-competent virus-like particles in the low micromolar range (IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 330Â nM).

 </xref> Mechanistic investigations revealed that teicoplanin specifically inhibits the activities of host cell's cathepsin L and cathepsin B, which are responsible for cleaving the viral glycoprotein allowing exposure of the receptor-binding domain of its core genome and subsequent release into the cytoplasm of host cells.

 </xref> Thus, teicoplanin blocks Ebola virus entry in the late endosomal pathway. These studies indicate the potential role of teicoplanin and its derivatives (dalbavancin, oritavancin, and telavancin) as novel inhibitors of cathepsin L-dependent viruses.
