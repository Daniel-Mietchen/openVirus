<p id="p0020">The antiviral effect of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been confirmed by clinical practice. It plays a vital role in the treatment of epidemic infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and influenza A virus H1N1 (
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Ge et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2005</xref>). The anti-HSV-1 and anti-HSV-2 effects of TCM have also been verified

 <italic>leukorrheagial</italic> diseases” and “erosion of vulva”, which was firstly recorded in “
 <italic>A Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergencies</italic>” written by Ge Hong in the Eastern Jin Dynasty (
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Ge, 2016</xref>). There are many different TCM names of GH in later books such as “
 <italic>Renzhai Zhizhi Fanglun</italic>” and “
 <italic>Medical Prescription</italic>”, but there is no uniform standard yet. “Pudendal heat sore” is oftenly cited by most doctors as the TCM diagnosis of GH (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feng and Zhu, 2015</xref>). Symptoms of GH include vulvar erosion, ulcers, and searing pain. Disease pathogenesis begins with exogenous wind-heat toxin caused by insanitary or excessive sexual intercourse and the downward flow of dampness-heat in the liver channel. The disease is long-lasting and lingering. General therapies involve internal therapy and external therapy, acupuncture therapy is also recorded (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Li, 2012</xref>). Internal therapy strategies involve coursing wind and dissipating heat, clearing away toxins and removing dampness, calming liver and strengthening spleen, tonifying yin and replenishing the kidney with the oral preparation such as Wu Lin Decoction, Gentianae Decoction for Purging Liver-Fire, Zhibai Dihuang pill and so on (
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Feng and Zhu, 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Zhang and Li, 2012</xref>). External therapy strategies involve clearing away heat and toxins, removing dampness and relieving itching, curing 
 <italic>leucorrhagia</italic> and ulcer with external application of Chinese herbs or Chinese medicine compounds. The treatment strategies was adjusted at different stages of the disease. The treatment at early stage of GH is to eliminate pathogenic factors. When healing is delayed, the treatment is to both strengthen body resistance and eliminate evil. During the incubation period or repeated attacks of GH, the main treatment is to strengthen healthy energy. On the basis of the ancient prescription Yihuang Decoction, a classic prescription of “
