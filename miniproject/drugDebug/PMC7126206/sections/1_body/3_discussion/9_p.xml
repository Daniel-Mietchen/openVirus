<p id="p0265">Based on the characteristics of HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of VK2/E6E7 using temperature control techniques, we selected the appropriate temperature control methods and intervention times to explore the inhibitory effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7. Cell survival rate in the JZ-1 group was significantly higher than the virus adhesion and penetration groups at 24Â h, suggesting that JZ-1 could efficiently inhibit the HSV-2 infection. Immunofluorescence expression of gD confirmed the anti-HSV-2 adhesion and penetration effect of JZ-1 based on the expression and location of viral proteins. The result of SEM demonstrated that the number of virions attached to the cell membrane in the JZ-1 group was significantly lower than the HSV-2 adhesion group. The morphologies of cells, including cell volume, shape, number of pseudopods, number of spinous processes, integrity of cell membrane, and smoothness was improved in the JZ-1 group compared with the virus adhesion group. We speculate that JZ-1 may play an anti-HSV-2 adhesion role by maintaining the normal morphological function of cells. The numbers of virions attached to the cell surface and cell morphologies in penciclovir group were closer to the virus adhesion group, suggesting that penciclovir had no effect on the adhesion stage of HSV-2.</p>
