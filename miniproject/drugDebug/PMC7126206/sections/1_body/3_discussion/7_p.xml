<p id="p0255">Using temperature control technology, VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then HSV-2 solution was applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow HSV-2 adhesion to host cells (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>)., The expression of gD was mostly observed on the host cell membrane, with only sparse gD intracellular expression under fluorescence microscope. This way, HSV-2 adhesion to VK2/E6E7 was successfully modeled. A large number of virions adhered to the cell membrane in the virus adhesion group were observed directly by SEM, confirming that temperature control technology can be used to restrict HSV-2 virions adhesion to cell membranes. The result of Western blot showed that expression of gD in the virus adhesion group was significantly higher than the control group using temperature control techniques, while there was no significant expression of the immediate early protein ICP4. Thus, we could exclude the possibility that virions had entered the nucleus to begin the replication cycle, ensuring that most of the virions remained at the stage of adhesion. Cell survival in the virus adhesion group was only about 50% of the control group at 24 h after temperature control treatment, indicating that even if the free virons are washed off, there were still enough virions attached to cell membrane to infect host cells and reduce their survival using temperature control technology. Technical support was provided for the study of the anti-HSV-2 adhesion effect of JZ-1 in the follow-up experiment.
