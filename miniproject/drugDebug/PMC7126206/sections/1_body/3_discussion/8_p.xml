<p id="p0260">We found that, unlike at room temperature, virions that had adhered to host cells could fully penetrate into host cells after rewarming at 37 °C for 1 h. It provides the possibility for the experimental operation to study the action of drugs. We precooled VK2/E6E7 at 4 °C for 1 h, then applied the HSV-2 solution at 4 °C for 3 h to allow the virions to adhere to host cells. The cells were rewarmed at 37 °C for 1 h to allow virions to penetrate into host cells (
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Mukherjee et al., 2013</xref>). Immunofluorescence expression of gD was mainly in the cytoplasm and rarely at cell membrane and nucleus. Thus, a model of HSV-2 penetration into VK2/E6E7 was successfully established. The result of western blot showed that the expression of gD in the virus penetration group was significantly higher than the control group, and there was no significant expression of immediate early protein ICP4 in the virus penetration group using temperature control techniques. Thus, the possibility that virions had entered the nucleus and began the replication cycle could be ruled out, with most virions remaining at the penetration stage. Cell survival at the HSV-2 penetration group was only about 50% of the control group at 24 h after temperature control treatment, indicating that there were enough virions penetrated into host cells using temperature control technology. It laid a foundation for exploring the mechanism of JZ-1's inhibitory effect on HSV-2 penetration of VK2/E6E7 in the following experiment.
