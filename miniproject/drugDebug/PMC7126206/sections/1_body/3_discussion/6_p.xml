<p id="p0250">Adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into host cells are sequential processes, HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into host cells rapidly at room temperature (
 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Tao, 2010</xref>), but the exact time required for these steps has not been reported yet. Firstly, we explored the time required for HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of VK2/E6E7 at room temperature in detail. Result showed that HSV-2 could completely adhere and penetrate into host cells within 5 mins at room temperature which was too short to distinguish, and drug treatments are difficult to complete within 5 mins. Since temperature can impact viral infection, we chose to use temperature control technology to delay the process of HSV-2 adhesion and penetration (
