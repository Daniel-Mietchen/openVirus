<p id="p0055">JZ-1 is decocted in water and deposited in alcohol in proportion. 
 <italic>P. chinense</italic> Schneid. was refluxed and extracted twice with 70% ethanol for 1 h each time. The extract was combined and filtered. Take 
 <italic>P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. and 
 <italic>M. haplocalyx</italic> Briq. for steam distillation respectively and collect the distillates, stored them at 4 °C before use. 
 <italic>S. nigrum</italic> L., 
 <italic>T. mongolicum</italic> Hand.-Mazz, 
 <italic>T. arvense</italic> Linn., 
 <italic>G. biloba</italic> L., 
 <italic>D. dasycarpus</italic> Turcz., 
 <italic>S. glabra</italic> Roxb., and the residues of 
 <italic>M. haplocalyx</italic> Briq., 
 <italic>P. chinense</italic> Schneid., and 
 <italic>P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. were fried twice in water for 1.5 h each time. The decoction was filtered and concentrated to a relative density of 1.08–1.14, adding ethanol to make the alcohol content 50%. After standing for 24 h, the supernatant was taken and ethanol was added to make the alcohol content 75%. Standing still for 24 h, the supernatant was taken and added with extract of 
 <italic>P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. before swing. After adding the distilled liquid of 
 <italic>P. suffruticosa</italic> Andr. and 
 <italic>M. haplocalyx</italic> Briq., the liquid was placed in the refrigerator for 24 h. The filtrate was heated in 100 °C water bath before adding Borneolum Syntheticum methanol solution (dripping and stirring). The pH was adjusted to 7.2 ± 0.2 with NaHCO
 <sub>3</sub> and the osmotic pressure was adjusted to 280–310mOsm/kgH
 <sub>2</sub>O by freezing point osmotic manometer. 0.5 g/ml crude drug solution was obtained.
