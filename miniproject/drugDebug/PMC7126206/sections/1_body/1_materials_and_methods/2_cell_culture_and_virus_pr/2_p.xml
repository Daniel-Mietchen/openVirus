<p id="p0030">Human immortalized vaginal epithelial cells (VK2/E6E7) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL2616) and cultured in CnT-PR medium (CELLnTEC, Swiss) at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The cells were grown in monolayers and changed fresh medium every 48 h. The cells were detached by trypsin-ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA) solution (Invitrogen Company, USA) and resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)/F-12 medium (Thermo Scientific, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Invitrogen Company, USA).
