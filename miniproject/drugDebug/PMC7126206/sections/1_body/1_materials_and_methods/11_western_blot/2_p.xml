<p id="p0115">VK2/E6E7 were grown in 6-well plates and treated as described above. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were washed twice with PBS. The cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (Servicebio Technology Co., China) containing inhibitors cocktails of proteases (Roche, Swiss). After denaturation, the cell lysates were electrophoresed in 8–12% SDS-PAGE gels (Servicebio Technology Co., China) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Merck Milipore, Ireland). The membranes were blocked in skim milk (Servicebio Technology Co., China) for 1 h at room temperature, then incubated with primary antibody and secondary antibody. The membranes were imaged on 700 or 800 nm channels using an odyssey instrument (Odyssey LICOR, USA).</p>
