<p id="p0100">VK2/E6E7 were seeded in 96-well plates. The cells were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then pre-cooled HSV-2 solution was applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. These steps were performed on ice. The cells were washed twice gently with Hank's buffered saline solution before applying a 1:1 vol mixture of HSV-2 solution and drug (or medium) at 37 °C for 1 h to allow virions to penetrate into host cells. Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated using PBS, pH 3.0, and neutralized using PBS, pH 11.0.</p>
