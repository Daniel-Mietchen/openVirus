<p id="p0095">VK2/E6E7 were seeded in 96-well plates. The cells were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then a 1:1 vol mixture of pre-cooled HSV-2 solution and pre-cooled drug (or medium) was applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. The cells were washed twice gently with cold D-Hank's buffered saline solution to remove the free virons. All steps were performed on ice.</p>
