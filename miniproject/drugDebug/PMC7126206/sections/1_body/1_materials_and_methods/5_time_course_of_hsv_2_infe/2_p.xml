<p id="p0085">VK2/E6E7 were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated with HSV-2 for 1 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 mins, 3 mins, 4 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins, 30 mins, or 24 h respectively, Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Meilunbio, China), pH 3.0, and neutralized with PBS, pH 11.0. After discarding the supernatant and adding culture medium, the cells incubated at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Cell survival was monitored by MTT assay.
