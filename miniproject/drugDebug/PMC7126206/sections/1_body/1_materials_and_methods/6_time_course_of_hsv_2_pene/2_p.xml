<p id="p0090">VK2/E6E7 were seeded in 96-well plates. The cells were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then incubated with pre-cooled HSV-2 solution at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions adhering to cells. The cells were washed twice gently with cold D-Hank's buffered saline solution to remove the free virons and then rewarmed at 37 °C for 1 s, 10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins, 40 mins, 50 mins, 1 h, or 24 h respectively at 37 °C. Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated with PBS, pH 3.0, and neutralized with PBS, pH 11.0. After discarding the supernatant and adding culture medium, the cells were incubated at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Cell survival was monitored by MTT assay.
