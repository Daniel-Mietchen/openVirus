<p id="p0105">VK2/E6E7 were seeded in 96-well plates. Once 90–95% confluent were obtained, the cells were treated as described above and incubated at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 24 h. Then, 100 μL of MTT solution (5 mg/mL) (Servicebio Technology Co., China) was added to each well, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C under a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 h. The supernatant was discarded and 100 μL of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (Servicebio Technology Co., China) was added to each well. Crystals were dissolved by shaking for 15 mins and absorbance was measured at 570 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, USA). Viability was calculated using the following formula: Cell survival rate = (model group OD value-blank pore OD value)/(normal control group OD value-blank pore OD value) × 100%.
