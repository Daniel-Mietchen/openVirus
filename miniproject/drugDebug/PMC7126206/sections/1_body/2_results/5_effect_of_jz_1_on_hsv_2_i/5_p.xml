 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E, the ultrastructure of cells were observed by TEM. VK2/E6E7 in control group showed a long fusiform shape, while cells in HSV-2-treated group became rounded, with condensed and deep-stained nuclei, concentrated chromatin, mitochondrial swelling, and endoplasmic reticulum expansion. A large number of vesicle-encapsulated mature and immature virions were observed in cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. The number of virions observed in cell membrane and intracellular regions in JZ-1 and penciclovir groups were significantly lower than HSV-2 alone group. The cell morphologies and number of virions in berberine group were not significantly different from those in the HSV-2 alone group.
