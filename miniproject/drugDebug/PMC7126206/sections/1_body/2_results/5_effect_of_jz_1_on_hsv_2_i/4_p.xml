 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D, Immunofluorescence expression of gD in HSV-2 alone group was minimal at 6 h after infection and gradually increased with time. Expression of gD in JZ-1 group was lower than HSV-2 alone group at 6 h, while there were no differences compare penciclovir and berberine groups with HSV-2 alone group. Compared with HSV-2 alone group, expression of gD in JZ-1 and penciclovir groups was significantly reduced at 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h. JZ-1 showed better antiviral effect than penciclovir. There was no significant difference in gD expression between berberine group and HSV-2 alone group at 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h.
