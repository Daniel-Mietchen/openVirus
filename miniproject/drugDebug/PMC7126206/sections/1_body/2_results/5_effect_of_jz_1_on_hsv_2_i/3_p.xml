 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C, a large number of HSV-2-infected cells changed from fusiform to spherical shape and showed alterations in refractive index. Moreover, the cell gap widened, intercellular connections disappeared, and the number of cells was significantly decreased compared with the control group. The morphologies and cell numbers in JZ-1 and penciclovir groups were significantly improved compare to HSV-2 alone group. The cell morphologies and cell numbers in berberine group were similar to HSV-2 alone group. Compared with control group, cell viability in HSV-2 alone group was significantly decreased. Compared with HSV-2 alone group, cell viability in JZ-1 groups (12.5, 6.25, and 3.125 mg/mL) and the penciclovir groups (0.3125, 0.15625, and 0.078125 mg/mL) was significantly increased. The other groups were not statistically different from the HSV-2 alone group.
