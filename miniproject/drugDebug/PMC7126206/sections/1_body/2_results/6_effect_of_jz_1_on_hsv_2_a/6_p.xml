<p id="p0225">The results of MTT assays and immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that JZ-1 could inhibit HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, while penciclovir and berberine had no such effects. Expression of the immediate early protein ICP4 indicated that virions remain at the adhesion and penetration stage and have not yet entered the nucleus using temperature control technology. Expression of the viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, and ICP5 indicated that JZ-1 has an inhibitory effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7. However, there was no significant differences in the expression of HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2 among the control group, the HSV-2 infection group and the treatment groups as showed by Western blot, suggesting that HSV-2 infection and drug treatment may not alter the expression level of host cell receptors. The ultrastructure of cells observed by SEM indicates that JZ-1 inhibited adhesion of HSV-2 to VK2/E6E7 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and improved health of the cells, while penciclovir and berberine showed no such effects.
