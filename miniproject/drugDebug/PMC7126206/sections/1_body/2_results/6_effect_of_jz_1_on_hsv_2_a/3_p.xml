 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C and D, significant immunofluorescence expression of gD was observed in HSV-2 adhesion and penetration groups. Expression of gD in JZ-1 group was decreased compared with HSV-2 adhesion and penetration groups. By contrast, there was no significant difference in expression of gD compare penciclovir and berberine groups with HSV-alone group, indicating that JZ-1 has a clear inhibitory effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration.
