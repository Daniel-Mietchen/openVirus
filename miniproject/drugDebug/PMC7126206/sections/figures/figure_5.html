 <caption> Effect of JZ-1 on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7. (A) (B) Effect of JZ-1 on cell viability of HSV-2 adhesion (A) and penetration (B) into VK2/E6E7. Data are expressed as mean±SEM for n = 6. (C) (D) Effect of JZ-1 on immunofluorescence expression of gD in HSV-2 adhesion (C) and penetration (D) into VK2/E6E7 ( × 400). (E) (F) Effect of JZ-1 on the expression of membrane fusion-associated protein in HSV-2 adhesion (E) and penetration (F) into VK2/E6E7. Each bar represents means ± SEM for 3 wells. (G) Ultrastructural observation on anti-HSV-2 adhesion effect of JZ-1. In HSV-2 adhesion group, VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then a 1:1 vol mixture of pre-cooled HSV-2 solution and pre-cooled drugs (or medium) were applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. In HSV-2 penetration group,VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then pre-cooled HSV-2 solution was applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. The cells were washed twice gently with Hank's buffered saline solution before applying a 1:1 vol mixture of HSV-2 solution and drugs (or medium) at 37 °C for 1 h to allow virions to penetrate into host cells. Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated using PBS, pH 3.0, and neutralized using PBS, pH 11.0. C stands for control group, V1 stands for HSV-2 adhesion group, V2 stands for HSV-2 penetration group, JV stands for JZ-1 treatment group, PV stands for penciclovir treatment group, BV stands for berberine treatment group.* P &lt;  0.05 versus V group,** P &lt;  0.01 versus V group, *** P &lt;  0.001 versus V group. </caption>
