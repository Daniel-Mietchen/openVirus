 <caption> Characteristics of HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7 under temperature control. (A) Effect of HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7 on cell viability under temperature control. Data are expressed as mean±SEM for n = 6. (B) Immunofluorescence expression of gD in HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7 under temperature control ( × 400). (C) Expression of membrane fusion-associated protein in HSV-2 adhesion and penetration into VK2/E6E7 under temperature control. Each bar represents means ± SEM from three wells. (D) Ultrastructural pathology of HSV-2 adherent VK2/E6E7 under temperature control. In HSV-2 adhesion group, VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then a 1:1 vol mixture of pre-cooled HSV-2 solution and pre-cooled medium were applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. In HSV-2 penetration group,VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then pre-cooled HSV-2 solution was applied at 4 °C for 3 h to allow virions to adhere to host cells. The cells were washed twice gently with Hank's buffered saline solution before applying a 1:1 vol mixture of HSV-2 solution and medium at 37 °C for 1 h to allow virions to penetrate into host cells. Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated using PBS, pH 3.0, and neutralized using PBS, pH 11.0. In HSV-2 infection 24 h group, VK2/E6E7 and HSV-2 solution were co-incubated at 37 °C for 24 h. C stands for control group, V1 stands for HSV-2 adhesion group, V2 stands for HSV-2 penetration group, V stands for HSV-2 infection 24 h group. ** P &lt;  0.01 versus control group, *** P &lt;  0.001 versus control group. </caption>
