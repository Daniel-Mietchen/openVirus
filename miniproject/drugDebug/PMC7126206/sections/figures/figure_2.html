 <caption> (A) Optimal virulence of HSV-2 on VK2/E6E7 in vitro. The original HSV-2 solution is diluted to 5, 10, 20, or 100 times respectively, and incubated with VK2/E6E7 for 24 h, the cell viability is detected by MTT assay. (B) Time for HSV-2 penetrating into VK2/E6E7 at room temperature. HSV-2 solution were incubated with VK2/E6E7 for 1 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 mins, 3 mins, 4 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins, 30 mins, or 24 h respectively. Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 3.0, and neutralized with PBS, pH 11.0. Cell viability is detected by MTT assay. (C) Time for HSV-2 penetrating into VK2/E6E7 under temperature control technology. VK2/E6E7 were precooled at 4 °C for 1 h, then incubated with pre-cooled HSV-2 solution at 4 °C for 3 h. Discard the HSV-2 solution and wash the cells twice with cold D-Hank's buffered saline solution. VK2/E6E7 were rewarming at 37 °C for 1 s, 10 mins, 20 mins, 30 mins, 40 mins, 50 mins, 1 h, or 24 h respectively. Virions that did not penetrate into cells were inactivated with PBS, pH 3.0, and neutralized with PBS, pH 11.0. Cell viability is detected by MTT assay. C stands for control group. Data are expressed as mean±SEM for n = 6. ### P &lt;  0.001 versus control group, ** P &lt;  0.01versus V-24 h group, *** P &lt;  0.001versus V-24 h group. </caption>
