<p id="par0025">Vaccines and therapeutics are the main weapons deployed to combat infectious diseases. Vaccines have been successful in dramatically lowering infection rates for diseases like measles, mumps, rubella, diphtheria, pertussis and many more, and have led to the complete eradication of smallpox and near-eradication of polio

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. However, safe and effective vaccines for some of the most prevalent and crippling diseases known to mankind remain elusive, despite decades of research

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, drug lead discovery and optimisation for infectious agents can be technically challenging for a variety of reasons: (i) no cell culture or adequate animal model exists

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>; (ii) little is known about the biological activity of the agentâ€™s targets; (iii) the agent requires category 3 or 4 containment facilities not available to most academic or industrial researchers and institutions. The 2018 WHO Blueprint List of Priority Diseases is exclusively populated by RNA viruses that fulfil one, two or all three of the criteria mentioned above 
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Therefore, the development of low containment systems for high-throughput hit discovery has become a necessity.
