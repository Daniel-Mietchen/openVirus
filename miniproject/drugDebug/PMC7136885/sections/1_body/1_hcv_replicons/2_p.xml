<p id="par0045">HCV is a hepacivirus within the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family and has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of ∼9.6 knt (kilo nucleotides). The HCV genome encodes a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved by the viral NS3/4A and cellular proteases into the three structural proteins: Core, Envelope protein 1 and Envelope protein 2, and the seven nonstructural proteins: p7, NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B. Most HCV strains will not establish productive infection in cell culture and it was not until 2005 that JFH-1 was shown to be the first strain that could be propagated in a cell culture system without adaptive mutations

 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. To overcome this limitation, in 1999 Lohmann 
 <italic>et al</italic>. defined NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A and NS5B as the minimal set of HCV proteins necessary to facilitate autonomous replication by replacement of the coding region for Core, Envelope protein 1 and 2, p7 and NS2 with a neomycin resistance cassette. Expression of NS3–NS5B was driven by the encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) internal ribosome entry site (IRES), establishing a bicistronic HCV replicon

 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> a). This development started DAA discovery which eventually led to the licensing in 2011 of first-generation DAAs boceprevir and telaprevir, both NS3/4A protease inhibitors. Replicons were used to assess efficacy and bioavailability of drug candidates, as well as analysis of escape mutants during discovery and optimisation of candidates, reviewed in Refs.

 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. However, boceprevir and telaprevir act on HCV genotype 1 only, making development of subgenomic replicons of other genotypes necessary to facilitate discovery of drugs acting on some or all genotypes. To date, subgenomic replicons have been developed for HCV strains 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5a and 6a to ensure testing of pan-genotype effectiveness of drug candidates

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. These replicon systems have aided in the development of second-generation DAAs such as ledipasvir, acting on the viral NS5A regulatory protein, and sofosbuvir, a nucleotide phosphoramidate prodrug inhibiting the NS5B polymerase

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Without the development of HCV replicons DAA development would have been severely delayed if not impossible and, for the first time in history, patients can now be cured of HCV by DAA combination therapy.
