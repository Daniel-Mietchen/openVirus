<p id="par0075">The first togavirus replicon was established in 1989 for SINV by replacing the region coding for the structural polyprotein with the chloramphenicol transferase (
 <italic>cat</italic>) gene 
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. However, replicons of the SINV and CHIKV old world togaviruses, using wildtype viral sequences, caused cytopathic effect in host cells, and could not be propagated in cell culture for a prolonged period of time. This was found to be caused by nuclear translocation of nsP2, resulting in cytotoxicity 
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. In the case of CHIKV and Semliki Forest virus replicons, mutations such as P718G in the nuclear localisation sequence of nsP2 are essential to achieve a noncytopathic replicon phenotype
