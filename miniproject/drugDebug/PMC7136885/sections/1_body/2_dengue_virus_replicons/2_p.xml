<p id="par0055">Dengue virus has a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome with a size of roughly 11 knt that is translated into a ∼3400 amino acid polyprotein. The polyprotein is then processed by the viral NS2b/3 and cellular proteases into the three structural proteins Capsid, pre-Membrane and Envelope, and the seven nonstructural (NS) proteins NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b and NS5, with NS5 harbouring N-terminal methyltransferase and C-terminal RdRp activity. In addition to the 5′ and 3′ UTRs, the first 65 nucleotides of the Capsid coding region contain a hairpin element and the 5′ cyclisation motif, which are essential for replication

These were constructed by replacement of Envelope or by excision of the coding region from the C-terminal portion of Capsid to the end of Envelope and replacement with a variety of reporter genes, including fluorescent proteins, luciferase and a combination of reporter genes and antibiotic resistance cassettes. In replicons with two foreign genes (e.g., reporter and resistance cassette) translation of nonstructural proteins was driven by an IRES sequence, and translation of the reporter was driven by the viral 5′ UTR. The reporter is separated from the antibiotic resistance by the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 2A autoprotease, enabling post-translational cleavage of the reporter from the resistance marker
