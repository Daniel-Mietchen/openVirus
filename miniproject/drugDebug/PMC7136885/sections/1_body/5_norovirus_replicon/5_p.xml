<p id="par0120">The Groutas lab at Witchita State University rationally designs protease inhibitors of norovirus and other viruses, and tests compounds using replicon systems (reviewed in Ref. 
 <xref rid="bib0465" ref-type="bibr">[93]</xref>). Four nucleoside analogues were tested on the norovirus replicon, with 2â€²-C-methylcytidine showing good antiviral activity 
 <xref rid="bib0470" ref-type="bibr">[94]</xref>. Rupintrivir, a protease inhibitor of rhinovirus 3C protease, was shown to clear cells of the norovirus replicon 
 <xref rid="bib0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>. However, owing to the fact that norovirus infections are short-lived and self-limiting, the interest of pharma companies to develop small-molecule inhibitors has been limited, and none of the mentioned candidates has been taken forward into clinical trials.
