 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>e). Transfection of BHK cells expressing T7 polymerase with the replicon-coding plasmid resulted in cell lines that maintained the replicon under G-418 selection. The replicon could then be transferred to Huh-7 cells by RNA extraction and transfection with the resulting RNA, and maintained for 100 passages under G-418 selection
