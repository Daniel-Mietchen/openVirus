  <p>Graphic representation of viral genomes and their derived replicons and minigenomes. Each region coding for a protein is shown as a box in red if the region codes for a structural protein, in yellow if it codes for a nonstructural (NS) protein or in purple if it codes for a nonviral protein. Internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) and the foot-and-mouth disease virus 2A autoprotease sequences (FMDV2A) are marked by lines or arrows, respectively. For minigenomes (d,f) plasmid-driven expression of viral genes is shown by circularized lines. 
   <bold>(a)</bold> Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome (ai) and its derived replicon (aii). The HCV replicon was established by replacement of C, E1, E2 and NS2 by the neomycin phosphotransferase (
   <italic>neo</italic>). Translation of NS3–NS5B was driven by an IRES sequence. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Dengue virus (DENV) genome (bi) and its derived replicons (bii and iii). Replicons for dengue virus have been produced by replacement of the C-terminal part of C, full length prM and the N-terminal part of E with either green fluorescent protein (GFP), which is cleaved by from NS1 by the FMDV2A sequence (bii), or with a polyprotein cleaved by the FMDV2A sequence producing puromycin-N-acetyl transferase (
   <italic>pac</italic>) and enhanced GFP (EGFP). Translation of NS1–NS5 is driven by an IRES sequence (biii). 
   <bold>(c)</bold>
   <italic>Togaviridae</italic> genome (ci) and derived replicons for Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) (cii and ciii) and Sindbis virus (SINV) (civ). Replicons have been established by replacement of the structural polyprotein (C-E3-E2-6K-E1) with the polyprotein cleaved by FMDV2A producing 
   <italic>pac</italic> and EGFP (cii) or an additional insertion of 
   <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RLuc) within nonstructural protein (nsp) 3 (ciii). The SINV replicon was established by replacement of the structural polyprotein with 
   <italic>pac</italic>. 
   <bold>(d)</bold> Respiratory syncytial virus genome (di) and its derived minigenome system (dii) or replicon (diii). The minigenome system was established by tagging the coding sequence of chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (
   <italic>cat</italic>) with the 5′ leader and the 3′ trailer sequences of the viral genome and plasmid-driven co-expression of the viral polymerase (L), nucleoprotein (N), phosphoprotein (P) and matrix protein 2 (M2). The replicon (diii) was established by deletion of the coding regions of the small hydrophobic protein (SH) and the two glycoproteins G and F, and insertion of GFP at the 5′ end of NS1. 
   <bold>(e)</bold> Human norovirus (NV) genome (ei) and its derived replicon (eii). The replicon was established by replacement of the majority of the viral protein (VP)1 coding region with 
   <italic>neo</italic>. 
   <bold>(f)</bold> Ebola virus (EBOV) genome shown in (+) sense (fi) and its derived minigenome system (fii). The minigenome was established by tagging GFP with the (+) sense 5′ leader and 3′ trailer sequences of the viral genome and plasmid-driven co-expression of the viral polymerase (L), VP30, VP35 and the nucleoprotein (NP).
