<p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is quite common in adults and neonates and is associated with oral mucocutaneous lesions and/or genital infections. HSV-1 is the primary cause of neonatal and sporadic encephalitis and, in absence of treatment, the mortality rate associated with central HSV infection is around 70% [
 <xref rid="B1-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the virus persists in the host body and periodically reactivates, especially under certain conditions such as stress and immunosuppression. Although HSV is incurable, acyclovir (ACV) and related nucleoside analogues such as valacyclovir (VCV), famciclovir, and ganciclovir, are widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of HSV infections [
 <xref rid="B2-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These drugs are considered first-line drug treatments for HSV infections and they have a similar anti-HSV mechanism. However, more than 40% of humans have recurrent infections, and repeated pharmacological treatment often results in the development of drug-resistant HSV strains [
 <xref rid="B3-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nucleoside analogues are monophosphorylated by the HSV-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) and subsequently converted by the host cell kinases in triphosphate form, which acts as competitive inhibitor of the deoxyguanosine triphosphate for the HSV-encoded DNA polymerase enzyme, thus blocking the viral replication. The mechanism of drug-resistance is due to several mutations occurring in HSV-DNA polymerase or thymidine kinase, and this has become a growing global health problem, especially for immunocompromised patients [

 <xref rid="B5-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the search for new antiviral agents is a main target for many researchers, and natural products have gained much interest because they represent a good source of novel anti-HSV molecules acting with different mechanisms other than nucleoside analogues. A large number of natural products derived from microorganisms, fungi, plants, and animals have already been reported as limiting HSV infections. Among them, crude extracts as well as bioactives isolated from plants, such as plant-derived phenolic compounds, are known for their broad spectrum of antiviral and antioxidant effects [
 <xref rid="B7-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To date, several studies reported the anti-HSV activity of phenolic and flavonoid compounds such as caffeic acid [
 <xref rid="B9-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], curcumin [
 <xref rid="B10-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], epigallocatechin [
 <xref rid="B12-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], kaempferol [
 <xref rid="B13-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], emodin [
 <xref rid="B14-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and glycerine [
 <xref rid="B16-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from pistachios (
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L.) were reported [
 <xref rid="B17-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], showing that polyphenols from pistachios have bactericidal activity against 
 <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) strains. The antiviral activity of lipophilic extracts obtained from different parts of 
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> has been screened against HSV and the results indicated that kernel and seed extracts showed significant antiviral activity compared to the rest of the extracts [
 <xref rid="B19-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The goal of the present work was to investigate the effect of polyphenol-rich extracts from natural shelled (NPRE) pistachios kernels (
 <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L.) on anti-HSV-1 activity. In addition, we assessed the anti-herpetic effect of a mix of the most abundant pure polyphenol compounds (NP MIX) present in NPRE. Thus, both NPRE and NP MIX were tested against HSV type I by binding assay. The data of the antiviral effect of a polyphenolic mixture obtained from pistachio kernels could be helpful for developing of new formulations for topical use.
