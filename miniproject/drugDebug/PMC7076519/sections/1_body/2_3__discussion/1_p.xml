<p>Because no prophylactic vaccine has been found against HSV, the spread of drug-resistant strains has become a major health problem. To note, new evidence indicates an ongoing recombination between HSV-1 and HSV-2 in humans, resulting in increasing genital herpes due to HSV-1 [

 <xref rid="B22-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, herpes viruses have become a potential risk factor for HIV infection in humans, and there is an increased need to find novel drugs to eradicate HSV infections. Over the past decade, crude extracts isolated from plants, as well as pure compounds, have been widely tested for their antiviral activity against HSV infections. Although nucleoside analogues are known to inhibit HSV-DNA replication enzymes, natural compounds can interfere with multiple stages of the virus life cycle, including latency and recurrence of the infections. In addition, besides the study of their bio activity proprieties, the analysis of the structure–activity relationships could provide additional information on their potential antiviral activity and could be useful to develop model of novel anti-herpetic agents. Natural extracts obtained from plants using various extraction approaches have shown a wide spectrum of antiviral activity, including anti-HSV-1 activity. Indeed, natural extract composition that possess phenolic, flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin, esteroide, glycoside, and tannin have been found to interfere with viral replication [

 <xref rid="B25-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In particular, extracts rich in polyphenols have been found to interfere with the viral particles directly through inhibition of virus attachment [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, we found that extracts rich in polyphenols from raw shelled pistachios (NPRE) have a significant antiviral effect against HSV-1. In particular, we demonstrated that the NPRE exhibited a concentration-dependent antiviral effect, and when the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (0.8 mg/mL) was used, plaque formation was totally reduced compared to 20 µM acyclovir. In addition, these results showed a significant inhibitory activity when NPRE was immediately added after the attachment step, suggesting that NPRE might interfere with the expression of viral proteins by preventing their transcription or translation, and this resulted in a final decrease of viral DNA as well. To note, the pre-treatment of the virus with the NPRE had no effect on the attachment step (data not shown), confirming a potential antiviral mechanism related to events that occurred immediately after the binding of the virus, such as gene expression and DNA synthesis. Because several unauthenticated crude extracts of plants were observed as exhibiting anti-HSV-1 activity, we tried to identify specific compounds that were responsible for this activity. Indeed, pre-treatment of the virus with a standard NP MIX (0.1 mg/mL), containing the most representative polyphenols in NPRE, led to a significant reduction of the expression of VP26 GFP viral protein, resulting in a decreased infectivity of the virus. These findings revealed a novel potential therapeutic effect of a polyphenols mix from NPRE. Given their lower cellular tolerability (data not shown), further investigation should be carried out to study the antiviral and cytotoxic effect and to define the mechanism of action of the polyphenol mixture as well as to establish their CC
 <sub>50</sub>, EC
 <sub>50</sub>, and SI. However, the antiviral activity of NPRE is likely due to the higher content of polyphenols and their possible synergistic interactions, especially hydroxybenzoic acids, catechin, and isoquercetin, which were the main abundant polyphenols in the pistachio extracts. Indeed, the bactericidal activity of NPRE was also previously assessed against
