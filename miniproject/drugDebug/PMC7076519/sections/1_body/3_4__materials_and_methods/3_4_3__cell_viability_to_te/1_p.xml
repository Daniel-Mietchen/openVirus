 <sup>4</sup> cells/well of Vero cells were cultured in a 96-well plate and incubated with NPRE (0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 1.2, 1.4 mg/mL) and NP MIX (0.1 mg/mL) separately for 72 h. A control of the solvent DMSO was included for each dilution. The cell viability was evaluated as production of cellular ATP by using the ViaLight plus kit (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. The cells were lysed with the cell lysis reagent for at least 10 min and then the ATP monitoring reagent plus (AMR plus) was added to each well for 2 min at room temperature (RT). The emitted light intensity related to ATP concentration was measured using a GloMax Multi Microplate Luminometer (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA) and the luminescence value was converted into the cell proliferation index (%) as described previously [
