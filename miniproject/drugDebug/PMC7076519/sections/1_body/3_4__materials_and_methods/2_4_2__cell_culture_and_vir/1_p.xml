<p>African green monkey kidney cell line (Vero) was cultured in Eagle’s minimum essential medium (MEM; Corning, Corning, NY, USA) supplemented with 6% foetal bovine serum (FBS; Euroclone), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL streptomycin. The cells were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. The HSV-1 laboratory strain (F strain), used for the in vitro experiments was kindly provided by Professor Bernard Roizman (University of Chicago, Chicago, IL, USA). For binding assay, a recombinant virus (HSV-1-VP26GFP) expressing a GFP-tagged VP26 protein was used as described previously [
 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. HSV-1 stocks were prepared from Vero cells infected with HSV-1 at low multiplicity of infection (MOI) and harvested at 24 h post infection (p.i.). The cell-free supernatant containing the viral suspension was stored at −80 °C and used for the experiments. Vero cell lines were originally obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
