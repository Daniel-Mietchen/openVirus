<p>The antiviral effect of NPRE was determined against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by using (i) plaque reduction assay, (ii) analysis of viral protein expression, and (iii) quantification of viral DNA. For plaque reduction assay, HSV-1 was serially diluted in medium to reach 50 PFU (plaque forming unit) in 100 µL, and the viral suspension was added on Vero cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Then, the cells were treated with various non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL) of the NPRE or solvent (DMSO) diluted in medium containing 0.8% methylcellulose. Acyclovir was used as a positive control at the concentration of 20 µM. The plaques were visualized after 3 days using crystal violet staining. The results showed that NPRE exhibited a concentration-dependent antiviral effect, and by using the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (0.8 mg/mL) plaque formation was totally reduced (100%) as obtained with 20 µM of acyclovir treatment (positive control) (

 <sub>50</sub> value was found at 0.4 mg/mL and the selectivity index (SI) was 3 (
