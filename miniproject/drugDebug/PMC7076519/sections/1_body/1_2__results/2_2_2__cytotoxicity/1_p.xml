<p>To study the cytotoxic effects of pistachio kernels, we performed a first step of experiments by testing polyphenol-rich fractions derived from natural raw shelled (NP). To examine the effect on the growth of cell monolayer, Vero cells were treated with different concentrations of NPRE for 24 h and the cell morphology was then observed. The preliminary screening indicated that treatment with NPRE did not affect the growth of cell culture. The NPRE was then diluted and added to cell culture medium, and Vero cells were incubated with various dilutions (0.4â€“1.4 mg/mL) for 72 h. DMSO was always maintained below 1% to limit the cytotoxic effect on cells. However, at each dilution, a control sample containing DMSO was included in the assay. The cell proliferation and viability were measured by means of the production of cellular ATP, as described in the Materials and Methods section. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated from concentration-effect curves by using non-linear regression analysis (

 <sub>50</sub> value was 1.2 mg/mL (
