<p>To confirm these data, further investigations were carried out to evaluate the mechanism of action of polyphenols in the process of inhibition of viral replication. The previous data showed that treatment with 0.8 mg/mL of NPRE extract resulted in a 100% reduction in the number of plaques and reduced viral DNA and protein accumulation, compared to the control. Furthermore, treatment with NPRE extracts at the same concentration showed good tolerability as there was no significant cytotoxicity following the treatment. The binding inhibition assay was chosen as it is a useful test to verify whether the binding phase of the infectious process is inhibited by the treatment. The assay was performed using a recombinant virus named as HSV-1-VP26 GFP expressing a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged viral protein 26 (VP26) and by measuring the auto-fluorescence of VP26-tagged protein. The viral suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with the NPRE (0.8 mg/mL). The infection was conducted at 4 °C, allowing the virus to bind to cellular receptors only, but not to enter the cell. The results from the assay showed that the treatment with NPRE had no effect on the initial attachment step (data not shown).</p>
