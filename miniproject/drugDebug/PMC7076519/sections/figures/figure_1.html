 <caption> Cell viability of Vero cells treated with increasing concentration of polyphenol-rich extracts from natural shelled pistachios kernels (NPRE). The cell proliferation index (%) was calculated by means of cellular ATP level measured after 72 h treatment. The values were expressed as percentages of treated vs. control cells (DMSO). Each value is the mean Â± standard deviation (SD) of three experiments. </caption>
