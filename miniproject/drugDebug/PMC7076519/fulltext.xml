Several reports have previously shown the antimicrobial activity of pistachio polyphenol extracts. Therefore, the aim of our research was to investigate the activity of polyphenol-rich extracts of natural shelled (NPRE) pistachios kernels (<italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L.) on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication. The Vero cell line was used to assess the cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. The cell viability was calculated by detection of cellular ATP after treatment with various concentrations of NPRE. For antiviral studies, five nontoxic-concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL) were tested. Our study demonstrated that treatment with NPRE (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL) reduced the expression of the viral proteins ICP8 (infected cell polypeptide 8), UL42 (unique long UL42 DNA polymerase processivity factor), and US11 (unique short US11 protein), and resulted in a decrease of viral DNA synthesis. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>), 50% inhibitory concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>), and the selectivity index (SI) values for NPRE were 1.2 mg/mL, 0.4mg/mL, and 3, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed the anti-herpetic effect of a mix of pure polyphenol compounds (NS MIX) present in NPRE. In conclusion, our findings indicate that natural shelled pistachio kernels have remarkable inhibitory activity against HSV-1.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>herpes simplex virus</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>pistachios</kwd><kwd>polyphenols</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-plants-09-00267"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is quite common in adults and neonates and is associated with oral mucocutaneous lesions and/or genital infections. HSV-1 is the primary cause of neonatal and sporadic encephalitis and, in absence of treatment, the mortality rate associated with central HSV infection is around 70% [<xref rid="B1-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, the virus persists in the host body and periodically reactivates, especially under certain conditions such as stress and immunosuppression. Although HSV is incurable, acyclovir (ACV) and related nucleoside analogues such as valacyclovir (VCV), famciclovir, and ganciclovir, are widely used for the prophylaxis and treatment of HSV infections [<xref rid="B2-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These drugs are considered first-line drug treatments for HSV infections and they have a similar anti-HSV mechanism. However, more than 40% of humans have recurrent infections, and repeated pharmacological treatment often results in the development of drug-resistant HSV strains [<xref rid="B3-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Nucleoside analogues are monophosphorylated by the HSV-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) and subsequently converted by the host cell kinases in triphosphate form, which acts as competitive inhibitor of the deoxyguanosine triphosphate for the HSV-encoded DNA polymerase enzyme, thus blocking the viral replication. The mechanism of drug-resistance is due to several mutations occurring in HSV-DNA polymerase or thymidine kinase, and this has become a growing global health problem, especially for immunocompromised patients [<xref rid="B4-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, the search for new antiviral agents is a main target for many researchers, and natural products have gained much interest because they represent a good source of novel anti-HSV molecules acting with different mechanisms other than nucleoside analogues. A large number of natural products derived from microorganisms, fungi, plants, and animals have already been reported as limiting HSV infections. Among them, crude extracts as well as bioactives isolated from plants, such as plant-derived phenolic compounds, are known for their broad spectrum of antiviral and antioxidant effects [<xref rid="B7-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To date, several studies reported the anti-HSV activity of phenolic and flavonoid compounds such as caffeic acid [<xref rid="B9-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], curcumin [<xref rid="B10-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], epigallocatechin [<xref rid="B12-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], kaempferol [<xref rid="B13-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], emodin [<xref rid="B14-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and glycerine [<xref rid="B16-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Recently, the antimicrobial properties of polyphenol-rich fractions derived from pistachios (<italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L.) were reported [<xref rid="B17-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], showing that polyphenols from pistachios have bactericidal activity against <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and MRSA (methicillin-resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>) strains. The antiviral activity of lipophilic extracts obtained from different parts of <italic>Pistacia vera</italic> has been screened against HSV and the results indicated that kernel and seed extracts showed significant antiviral activity compared to the rest of the extracts [<xref rid="B19-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The goal of the present work was to investigate the effect of polyphenol-rich extracts from natural shelled (NPRE) pistachios kernels (<italic>Pistacia vera</italic> L.) on anti-HSV-1 activity. In addition, we assessed the anti-herpetic effect of a mix of the most abundant pure polyphenol compounds (NP MIX) present in NPRE. Thus, both NPRE and NP MIX were tested against HSV type I by binding assay. The data of the antiviral effect of a polyphenolic mixture obtained from pistachio kernels could be helpful for developing of new formulations for topical use.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec2-plants-09-00267"><title>2.

The total amount of polyphenols was 8.1 mg/100 g fresh weight of NPRE.

Cytotoxicity</title><p>To study the cytotoxic effects of pistachio kernels, we performed a first step of experiments by testing polyphenol-rich fractions derived from natural raw shelled (NP). To examine the effect on the growth of cell monolayer, Vero cells were treated with different concentrations of NPRE for 24 h and the cell morphology was then observed. The preliminary screening indicated that treatment with NPRE did not affect the growth of cell culture. The NPRE was then diluted and added to cell culture medium, and Vero cells were incubated with various dilutions (0.4&#x02013;1.4 mg/mL) for 72 h. DMSO was always maintained below 1% to limit the cytotoxic effect on cells. However, at each dilution, a control sample containing DMSO was included in the assay. The cell proliferation and viability were measured by means of the production of cellular ATP, as described in the Materials and Methods section. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated from concentration-effect curves by using non-linear regression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f001">Figure 1</xref>), and the CC<sub>50</sub> value was 1.2 mg/mL (<xref rid="plants-09-00267-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-plants-09-00267"><title>2.3. Plaque Reduction Assay</title><p>The antiviral effect of NPRE was determined against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) by using (i) plaque reduction assay, (ii) analysis of viral protein expression, and (iii) quantification of viral DNA. For plaque reduction assay, HSV-1 was serially diluted in medium to reach 50 PFU (plaque forming unit) in 100 &#x000b5;L, and the viral suspension was added on Vero cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C. Then, the cells were treated with various non-cytotoxic concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL) of the NPRE or solvent (DMSO) diluted in medium containing 0.8% methylcellulose. Acyclovir was used as a positive control at the concentration of 20 &#x000b5;M. The plaques were visualized after 3 days using crystal violet staining. The results showed that NPRE exhibited a concentration-dependent antiviral effect, and by using the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (0.8 mg/mL) plaque formation was totally reduced (100%) as obtained with 20 &#x000b5;M of acyclovir treatment (positive control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The half-maximal effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>) was calculated from concentration-effect curves by using non-linear regression analysis. The EC<sub>50</sub> value was found at 0.4 mg/mL and the selectivity index (SI) was 3 (<xref rid="plants-09-00267-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). No antiviral activity was found when the individual polyphenol compounds were used (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot4-plants-09-00267"><title>2.4. Analysis of Viral Protein Expression</title><p>The results from the plaque reduction assay showed a significant inhibitory activity by adding the NPRE immediately after the attachment step. This suggests that the effect of NPRE might be related to biochemical events that occurred immediately after this time frame, such as gene expression and protein synthesis of the alpha (&#x003b1;), beta (&#x003b2;), and gamma (&#x003b3;) proteins, which are important for HSV-1 replication. Therefore, in order to investigate the effect of NPRE on the expression of HSV-1 proteins, Western blot analysis was performed. Vero cells were uninfected (mock) or infected with HSV-1 and then treated with non-cytotoxic concentrations of NPRE in the range of the EC<sub>50</sub> value (0.4, 0.6, and 0.8 mg/mL) for 24 h and DMSO was used in the control samples. The samples were lysed and the total cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. The optical densitometry analysis of immunoblot band intensity was quantified with TINA imaging analysis software (version 2.10, Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) as relative to the band intensity of housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The analysis revealed that NPRE reduced the accumulation of the tested proteins, particularly the infected cell polypeptide 8 (ICP8) and the unique long UL42 DNA polymerase processivity factor (UL42) &#x003b2; proteins, necessary for viral DNA replication, and the unique short US11 (US11) tegument &#x003b3; protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f003">Figure 3</xref>, although all of the three tested proteins were accumulated in HSV-1-infected and untreated Vero cells (lane 2), infected and treated cells accumulated a small amount of viral ICP8, UL42, and US11 proteins (lane 3, lane 4, lane 5, respectively), particularly the samples treated with the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (0.8 mg/mL; lane 5).</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot5-plants-09-00267"><title>2.5. Quantification of Viral DNA</title><p>In order to investigate whether the decrease on the aforementioned protein level resulted in a decrease of viral DNA synthesis, we performed a quantitative real-time PCR analysis by using specific TaqMan probe for HSV-1. Vero cells were uninfected (mock) or infected with HSV-1 at multiplicity of infection (MOI) 1 and treated or untreated with 0.6 and 0.8 mg/mL of the NPRE for 24 h. Then, the cellular DNA was extracted and precipitated from the interphase and organic phase and used for real-time PCR analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f004">Figure 4</xref>, the accumulation of viral DNA was significantly reduced in the infected and treated samples compared to the untreated infected samples, suggesting that the NPRE treatment might have interfered with the DNA synthesis process, and this resulted in a final decrease of viral DNA synthesis.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot6-plants-09-00267"><title>2.6. Binding Assay Using NPRE and NP MIX</title><p>To confirm these data, further investigations were carried out to evaluate the mechanism of action of polyphenols in the process of inhibition of viral replication. The previous data showed that treatment with 0.8 mg/mL of NPRE extract resulted in a 100% reduction in the number of plaques and reduced viral DNA and protein accumulation, compared to the control. Furthermore, treatment with NPRE extracts at the same concentration showed good tolerability as there was no significant cytotoxicity following the treatment. The binding inhibition assay was chosen as it is a useful test to verify whether the binding phase of the infectious process is inhibited by the treatment. The assay was performed using a recombinant virus named as HSV-1-VP26 GFP expressing a GFP (green fluorescent protein)-tagged viral protein 26 (VP26) and by measuring the auto-fluorescence of VP26-tagged protein. The viral suspension was incubated for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C with the NPRE (0.8 mg/mL). The infection was conducted at 4 &#x000b0;C, allowing the virus to bind to cellular receptors only, but not to enter the cell. The results from the assay showed that the treatment with NPRE had no effect on the initial attachment step (data not shown).</p><p>Consequently, we tried to understand if the antiviral activity was mainly exerted by the more representative polyphenol components present in the NPRE. Indeed recent data obtained in our lab demonstrated that a pure fraction containing the main polyphenol compounds identified in almond skin extracts had both antimicrobial and antiviral activity [<xref rid="B20-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. On the basis of this, we formulated an NP MIX (0.1 mg/mL) that could have a similar impact on antiviral activity when compared to the polyphenol-rich extracts of natural shelled pistachios. The inhibition of viral replication was evaluated by binding assay using VP26-HSV-1 virus. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f005">Figure 5</xref> shows that the treatment with NP MIX resulted in a 50% decrease of the auto-fluorescence of viral protein VP26 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f005">Figure 5</xref>a,b) as well as a decreased level of protein expression compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="plants-09-00267-f005">Figure 5</xref>c; lane 3 vs. lane 2). Because NP MIX did not show a good tolerability due to the significant cytotoxicity effect following the treatment, which resulted in 40% cell proliferation index reduction compared to untreated cells (data not shown), further investigations are needed in order to better understand the behaviour and the tolerability of the NP MIX as well as its antiviral activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec3-plants-09-00267"><title>3. Discussion</title><p>Because no prophylactic vaccine has been found against HSV, the spread of drug-resistant strains has become a major health problem. To note, new evidence indicates an ongoing recombination between HSV-1 and HSV-2 in humans, resulting in increasing genital herpes due to HSV-1 [<xref rid="B21-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Therefore, herpes viruses have become a potential risk factor for HIV infection in humans, and there is an increased need to find novel drugs to eradicate HSV infections. Over the past decade, crude extracts isolated from plants, as well as pure compounds, have been widely tested for their antiviral activity against HSV infections. Although nucleoside analogues are known to inhibit HSV-DNA replication enzymes, natural compounds can interfere with multiple stages of the virus life cycle, including latency and recurrence of the infections. In addition, besides the study of their bio activity proprieties, the analysis of the structure&#x02013;activity relationships could provide additional information on their potential antiviral activity and could be useful to develop model of novel anti-herpetic agents. Natural extracts obtained from plants using various extraction approaches have shown a wide spectrum of antiviral activity, including anti-HSV-1 activity. Indeed, natural extract composition that possess phenolic, flavonoid, alkaloid, saponin, esteroide, glycoside, and tannin have been found to interfere with viral replication [<xref rid="B8-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B23-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B24-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In particular, extracts rich in polyphenols have been found to interfere with the viral particles directly through inhibition of virus attachment [<xref rid="B26-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In the present study, we found that extracts rich in polyphenols from raw shelled pistachios (NPRE) have a significant antiviral effect against HSV-1. In particular, we demonstrated that the NPRE exhibited a concentration-dependent antiviral effect, and when the maximal non-cytotoxic concentration (0.8 mg/mL) was used, plaque formation was totally reduced compared to 20 &#x000b5;M acyclovir. In addition, these results showed a significant inhibitory activity when NPRE was immediately added after the attachment step, suggesting that NPRE might interfere with the expression of viral proteins by preventing their transcription or translation, and this resulted in a final decrease of viral DNA as well. To note, the pre-treatment of the virus with the NPRE had no effect on the attachment step (data not shown), confirming a potential antiviral mechanism related to events that occurred immediately after the binding of the virus, such as gene expression and DNA synthesis. Because several unauthenticated crude extracts of plants were observed as exhibiting anti-HSV-1 activity, we tried to identify specific compounds that were responsible for this activity. Indeed, pre-treatment of the virus with a standard NP MIX (0.1 mg/mL), containing the most representative polyphenols in NPRE, led to a significant reduction of the expression of VP26 GFP viral protein, resulting in a decreased infectivity of the virus. These findings revealed a novel potential therapeutic effect of a polyphenols mix from NPRE. Given their lower cellular tolerability (data not shown), further investigation should be carried out to study the antiviral and cytotoxic effect and to define the mechanism of action of the polyphenol mixture as well as to establish their CC<sub>50</sub>, EC<sub>50</sub>, and SI. However, the antiviral activity of NPRE is likely due to the higher content of polyphenols and their possible synergistic interactions, especially hydroxybenzoic acids, catechin, and isoquercetin, which were the main abundant polyphenols in the pistachio extracts. Indeed, the bactericidal activity of NPRE was also previously assessed against <italic>Listeriamonocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, and MRSA strains [<xref rid="B17-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and recently, simulated human digestion analyses showed that polyphenols from pistachios are bioaccessible in the upper gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="B27-plants-09-00267" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, it seems that compounds not considered in the preparation of NP MIX play a different yet specific role in the inhibition of HSV replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec4-plants-09-00267"><title>4.

Conclusions</title><p>Our current finding indicates that polyphenols from pistachios are effective against HSV-1. In conclusion, we can assume that the antiviral effects of NPRE are the result of a balance of the individual polyphenolic components that in combination exert the anti-viral activity. Therefore, pistachio polyphenols could become great candidates for the development of novel topical or oral drug formulations for the treatment of HSV-1 infections, either alone or in combination with standard antiviral therapies. However, further studies will be helpful in studying the mechanisms of antiviral activity as well as to identify bioactive compounds responsible for the anti-HSV activity. Thus, amongst other natural products, pistachio extracts could provide a novel treatment against HSV-1 infections, as well as a novel strategy to overcome problems related to drug-resistant strains. The results present here agree with a previous study, in which polyphenols were found to possess, beyond anti-inflammatory properties, antiviral activity also, thus suggesting possible further interest for the pistachio product waste as a source of a new pharmaceutical agent.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization G.M. and M.T.S.; methodology, A.S., M.M.-P., and I.B.-A.; software, R.P. and I.B.-A.; resources, G.M. and M.T.S.; data curation, M.M.-P. and R.P.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, M.M.-P.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, G.M., A.S., and M.T.S.; funding acquisition, G.M. and M.T.S.
