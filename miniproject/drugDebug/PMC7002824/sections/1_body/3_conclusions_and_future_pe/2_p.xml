<p id="p0110">Coumarin is a natural product that are derived from various parts (seeds, leaves and roots) of the plant families such as 
 <italic>Apiaceae, Rutaceae</italic> and many other sources in the form of fungi, bacteria etc. Due to its wide distribution and property of being stable, soluble, low molecular weight compound without any adverse side effects and toxicity and feasibility of chemical modification to generate new semisynthetic derivatives, coumarin is gaining attention in the field of medicinal chemistry. The purpose of this review was to provide a significant insight into the development of new coumarin-based antiviral compounds and their likely mechanism of action that will refine our knowledge of viral treatment.
