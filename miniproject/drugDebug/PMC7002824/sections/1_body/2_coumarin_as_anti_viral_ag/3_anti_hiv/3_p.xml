<p id="p0060">Anti-viral action and mechanism of 6-acetyl-coumarin analogues have been studied on human C8166 cells. It has been found that electronegative substituent at the phenyl ring connected with coumarin central motif plays a very important role in the anti-HIV activity of coumarin [
 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Further, QSAR and Docking approaches indicated that Coumarin negatively regulates 3’ processing and integrase enzyme of HIV. Two coumarin motif attached by an aryl linker were found to be very crucial for the anti-HIV-integrase activity. In this coumarin derivative, lipophilicity of aromatic ring of the linker was responsible for the inhibitory activity [
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Another research group studied the therapeutic potential of synthesized coumarin carbohydrazide derivatives. Cytotoxicity of coumarin hydrazide derivatives was found to be significantly improved in human cells when salicyl moiety was replaced with a coumaryl moiety. Anti-HIV-1 Integrase activity has been shown by hydrogen/chlorine on salicyl moiety and halogen/alkoxy added on coumarin. Molecular docking reveals fitting of the aromatic ring in the hydrophobic pocket and acyl hydrazide at the metal centers [
 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Further, Alimi Livani 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, designed synthetic new coumarin derivative that mimic the integrase strand transfer inhibitors by adding 1,3,4-oxidiazole ring as a chelating motif on its halobenzyl moiety. Coumarin derivatives having 4-chlorobenzyl ring showed very significant anti-HIV activity exhibiting inhibition rate almost near to AZT (Azidothymidine), an anti-HIV drug. Many physicochemical properties were found to match with that of FDA approved Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) except aqueous solubility that was low, this needs further structural modifications [
 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The study of Chiang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, suggested that spatial distance between coumarin unit and linker moiety was crucial for anti-HIV integrase activity [
