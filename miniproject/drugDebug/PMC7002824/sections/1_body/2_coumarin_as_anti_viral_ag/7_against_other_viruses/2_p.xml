<p id="p0105">Filoviruses family include Ebola virus, Marburg virus, Ceuvavirus which are responsible for many diseases in human beings like severe hemorrhagic fever. After screening of anti-histamine library in an attempt to search for the compound that has capacity to inhibit flaviviral entry, two potential Histamine receptor antagonist compounds were found. Interestingly both the compounds contain coumarin fused ring system that was crucial for their inhibitory activity. This study indicated the possibility that active compound containing hydrophobic moiety at position 3, 4 may act as an interacting part with the target molecule [

Similar reports were found in the viremia infection caused by spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), a rhabdovirus found in freshwater aquatic environment. The potency of imidazole-coumarin derivative 7-(4-(4-methyl-imidazole))-coumarin and another benzimidazole coumarin derivative, 7-(4-benzimidazole-butoxy)-coumarin (BBC) [

It also suppressed the virus-induced autophagy, by regulating Akt-mTOR pathway and in this way exhibiting anti-viral activity [
