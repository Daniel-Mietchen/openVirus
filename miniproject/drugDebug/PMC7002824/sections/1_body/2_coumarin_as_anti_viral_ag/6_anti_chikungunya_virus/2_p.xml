<p id="p0100">Synthetic coumarin conjugates have been used to see their inhibitory role against chikungunya viruses. Jih Ru Hwu 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, used the triply conjugated uracil-coumarin-arenes compound to see structure-activity relationship against chikungunya virus. In this research, coumarin central moiety was found to be essential for the anti-viral activity. There was a positive correlation between size of conjugated moiety (benzouracil &gt; thymine &gt; uracil) and chikungunya inhibitory action [

In this case also, they found that central moiety of guanosine-coumarin conjugates was an essential component for anti-viral activity. In addition, conjugates having –OMe moiety were found to be more potent than conjugates having other substitutes [
