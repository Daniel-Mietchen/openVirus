   <bold>Antiviral Mechanism of coumarin in Infected Host cells:</bold> Viral infection involves various stages (1) binding of virion with receptor present at the cell surface, followed by (2) fusion and entry, (3) viral genome replication and transcription, (4) translation and (5) virion assembly, and ultimately budding and release. Chemotherapeutics target these critical stages of viral life cycle. Likewise, coumarin inhibits many of the proteins involved in the transcription/translation machineries required in virus life cycle. Additionally, coumarin modulates the host cell signaling pathways, NF-κB, and inflammatory redox-sensitive pathways, which block the virus replication. Many facets of anti-viral effect of coumarin has been demonstrated in numerous viruses as indicated. (Figure was made using Biorender Online tool and Microsoft powerpoint).
