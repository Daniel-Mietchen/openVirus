<p>Viral infections were classified as episodic (diagnosed on the basis of clinical manifestation and supplemented with appropriate tests) or latent (requiring monitoring at the molecular level).

Detection of RV and NoV in the stool was performed using a serological method. For all other viruses polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based analysis was used for the diagnosis of viral infections of material derived from blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, respiratory swabs or bronchoalveolar lavage. According to recommendations of the European Conference on Infections in Leukaemia (ECIL), a pre-emptive quantitative approach was introduced for infections with CMV and EBV in allo-HCT patients.
