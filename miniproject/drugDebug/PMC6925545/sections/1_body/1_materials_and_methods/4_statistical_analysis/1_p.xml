<p>An event was defined as the diagnosis of a first specific infectious disorder. Categorical variables were compared by the chi-square test, while non-categorical variables were compared by the Mann–Whitney U test. Hazard ratio (HR) and confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for the difference in occurrence of infections in patients. Cumulative incidences of viral infections were calculated using competing risk analysis,
