<p>Some major improvements in outcomes were associated with the application of drugs and molecular tests to detect and prevent early bacterial infections, HSV, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and pre-engraftment candidal infections.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Screening for reactivation with pre-emptive treatment or application of prophylaxis in seropositive recipients plays a role in preventing diseases caused by latent herpesviruses such as CMV, human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Implementation of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for management of Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV) infection, on the basis of monitoring of EBV-DNA-emia and pre-emptive or targeted therapy with rituximab, has reduced the incidence of mortality from post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (EBV-PTLD) from 84% before the year 2000 to 30% in 2013.
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Ganciclovir (GCV) can reduce EBV replication, but neither ganciclovir/foscarnet (FCV) nor cidofovir (CDV) therapy/prophylaxis have any impact on development of EBV-PTLD, so antiviral agents are not recommended.
