<p>The primary causes of morbidity and non-relapse mortality following HCT are acute and chronic GVHD, organ dysfunction and infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Changes in the transplantation procedure and the implementation of effective supportive care strategies have decreased the incidence of infectious complications early after conditioning therapy for allo-HCT, but have also prolonged the risks beyond day +100.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These late infections might be caused by all types of microorganisms; however, the risks are predictable and surmountable with the use of tailored prevention strategies.
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> There are only a few articles focused on viral complications in children after HCT.

 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Herein we reported the results of multicenter nationwide study of the epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of viral infections in children and adolescents after HCT over a period of six consecutive years. All patients were treated with the same therapeutic protocols, using comparable principles of supportive therapy.
