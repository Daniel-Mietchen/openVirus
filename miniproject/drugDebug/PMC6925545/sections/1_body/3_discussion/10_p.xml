<p>We found that allo-HCT, acute leukemia, a/cGVHD, MUD/MMUD-HCT were the risk factors for viral infections. CMV donor/recipient serostatus, era of transplantation, MUD-HCT, and cGVHD were found in other studies as risk factors for viral infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> We have also found that CMV-IgG seropositivity in ALL recipients, and MUD/MMUD-HCT were the risk factors for deaths from viral infection in children after HCT. This is a unique observation, as there is no study available analyzing this issue.
