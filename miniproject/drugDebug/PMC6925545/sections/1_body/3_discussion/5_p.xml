<p>The clinical manifestations of ADV infections in immunocompetent hosts include upper respiratory disease, gastroenteritis or (kerato-)conjunctivitis and are self-limited in most cases, although severe manifestations including encephalitis, myocarditis, and pneumonia have been sporadically observed. In immunocompromised patients, ADV can cause systemic disease and lethal organ damage.
