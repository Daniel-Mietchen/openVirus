<p>A relatively low percentage of infections with CARV origin was observed in our analysis. CARV respiratory tract infections have been recognized as a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with leukemia and those undergoing HCT.
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In the late 1990s the frequency of documented respiratory virus infections was 3.5% among allo-HCT and 0.4% among auto-HCT.
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, in that time period, viral antigen detection by immunofluorescence or enzyme immunoassays were used in diagnostics.
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> During the last decade, rapid and highly sensitive molecular tests have been developed and made available, with the most recent multiplex PCR platform that can detect multiple viral pathogens.
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Choi et al. reported in allo-HCT children the incidence 28.1% of RhV infection, 25.8% RSV, 18% HPIV, 1.1% hMPV; yet more than half of the infections were acquired during hospitalization.
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the case of CARV infections, ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin are recommended in hMPV, HPIV and RSV infections, while there is insufficient evidence for the specific recommendation against infections caused by coronavirus and RhV.
