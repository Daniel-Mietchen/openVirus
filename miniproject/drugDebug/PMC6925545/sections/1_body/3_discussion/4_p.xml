<p>We observed that cumulative incidence of BKV infection was 23.8% with survival rate of 90.7%. Cesaro et al. reported that BKV-related hemorrhagic cystitis occurred in 8–25% of pediatric and 7–54% of adult recipients undergoing allo-HCT.
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Specific anti-BKV prophylaxis is not available and fluoroquinolones are not recommended given the lack of significant effects on BKV replication and hemorrhagic cystitis severity, and the selection of antibiotic resistance.
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In our study cidofovir was the most frequently used drug in the treatment of BKV infection. Cidofovir at a dose of 3–5 mg/kg every 1–2 weeks with probenecid, or 0.5–1.5 mg/kg 1–3 times/week without probenecid, were used by other authors for the treatment of BKV hemorrhagic cystitis, although without strong recommendation on its use in these doses.
