<p>We observed a relatively low (1.2%) rate of influenza A infection, with no cases of influenza B infection, which may be due to environmental prophylaxis (annual vaccination of patients, household contacts, and hospital and prophylactic use of neuraminidase inhibitors during influenza season in some cases). The current guidelines of the 4th European Conference of Infections in Leukemia (ECIL-4) recommend diagnosis based on PCR of material collected from the respiratory tract, especially broncho-alveolar lavage.
