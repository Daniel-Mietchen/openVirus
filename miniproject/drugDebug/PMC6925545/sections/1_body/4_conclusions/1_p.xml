<p>The incidence of viral infections was high in allo-HCT patients while in auto-HCT patients viral infections were episodic. The most frequent viral infection after allo-HCT were CMV, BKV and EBV. Most viral infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 days (for CMV). The highest infection-related mortality was observed in case of CMV infection, whereas primary diagnosis did not influence survival from viral infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, a/cGVHD, MUD/MMUD vs MSD. The risk factor for death from viral infection were CMV-IgG seropositivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia recipients, MUD/MMUD vs MSD. The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HSCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% of cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of significant EBV-DNA-emia with the need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% of cases. This is clinically proven evidence that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients. Additionally, in 47.7% of these cases GVHD was a risk factor, possibly facilitating development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infections.</p>
