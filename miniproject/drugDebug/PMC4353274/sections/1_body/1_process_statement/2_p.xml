<p>The development of this updated guidance arose in November 2014 from information provided by the Public Health Agency of Canada regarding early data indicating a mismatch of the influenza vaccine H3N2 component to an emerging H3N2 seasonal strain. This created a need to update recommendations for the use of antiviral drugs for this yearâ€™s seasonal influenza. The concept was then approved by Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease (AMMI) Canada. A first draft was cowritten by all the authors (HGS, FYA, UDA, GAE and ML). Subsequently, all the authors reviewed, revised and approved the document before a further review from the AMMI Canada Guidelines Committee and the Infectious Diseases and Immunization Committee of the Canadian Paediatric Society. AMMI Canada approved the final document before submission to the Journal for publication.</p>
