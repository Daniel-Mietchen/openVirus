<p>All HCWs who develop ILI symptoms should immediately be sent home if working, or told to remain at home. Guidelines from the institutionâ€™s occupational health service should be consulted to determine when the HCW can return to work. HCWs should use their personal health care provider for care and additional information.</p>
