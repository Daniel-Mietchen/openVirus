<p>In the current 2014â€“2015 influenza season, A(H3N2) influenza has accounted for the majority of influenza cases documented by testing. In addition, a significant antigenic drift has occurred in the majority of H3N2 influenza strains obtained from ill patients, resulting in a clinically relevant mismatch between the predominant circulating H3N2 influenza virus and the H3N2 vaccine strain. The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System laboratories have tested &gt;96,535 specimens: 23,421 were positive for influenza viruses, of which 22,129 (94.5%) were typed as influenza A and 1292 (5.5%) as influenza B. Of the subtyped influenza A viruses, 163 (1.7%) were influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, and 9211 (98.3%) were influenza A (H3N2) (
