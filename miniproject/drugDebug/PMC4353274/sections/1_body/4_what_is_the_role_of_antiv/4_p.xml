<p>Patients with severe immunodeficiency, and very ill patients on ventilators may not improve and continue to shed influenza viruses for prolonged periods, even after five days on antiviral therapy. In these circumstances, repeat endotracheal samples should be sent for viral PCR and susceptibility testing for oseltamivir resistance. Suspected oseltamivir resistance should prompt a switch to intravenous zanamivir until results of antiviral susceptibility testing are available. Repeated viral testing should be performed if the clinical condition fails to improve.</p>
