<p>Treatment of patients with mild illness without risk factors for severe or complicated influenza with antiviral drugs is not recommended if &gt;48 h have passed since the onset of influenza-like symptoms. However, in severe illness requiring hospitalization, oseltamivir treatment has been shown to reduce mortality even if treatment is started up to 96 h after the start of symptoms (

Following initial clinical assessment and collection of appropriate specimens for virus testing, treatment should be started immediately, most frequently with oseltamivir orally. For adults with normal renal function, the typical regimen is 75 mg every 12 h for five days. In ventilated patients, oseltamivir should be administered by nasogastric tube. If zanamivir is required in a severely ill patient, intravenous zanamivir is recommended at a dose of 600 mg every 12 h. If intravenous zanamivir is needed, it can be obtained by request to the Government of Canada Health Protection Branch, Special Access Program, Ottawa. (Web access at

Inhaled zanamivir is not advised in a severely ill patient because the inhaled powder deposits chiefly in the upper airways. Zanamivir powder administered through ventilator circuits is contraindicated.
