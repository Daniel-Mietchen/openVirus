<p>Secondary cases of influenza in family members of an index case can be reduced by early institution of post-exposure prophylactic oseltamivir or zanamivir (
 <xref rid="b16-idmm-26-e5" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Hospitalized patients and HCW, regardless of their vaccine status, who have had unprotected close contact with a patient with ILI, may be offered either oseltamivir at a dose of 75 mg once daily or zanamivir inhalation, two puffs (10 mg) once daily for seven (oseltamivir) to 10 (zanamivir) days to reduce the chance of influenza illness. This is especially important this influenza season in the face of the vaccine mismatch. Post-exposure prophylaxis is less likely to be effective if started &gt;48 h after the exposure. In high-risk patients, the use of post-exposure prophylaxis, even &gt;48 h, may be justified. In HCWs and low-risk hospitalized patients identified &gt;48 h after exposure, observation and early treatment if symptoms arise is the preferred strategy.
