<p>A detailed discussion of the appropriate antibiotic management of patients with suspected bacterial pneumonia is beyond the scope of this document. However, if a patient presents with an acute respiratory infection on a background of an influenza outbreak, and a chest radiograph demonstrates pulmonary infiltrates, primary influenza or secondary bacterial pneumonia, or both, are possibilities. Primary influenza pneumonia typically presents with severe shortness of breath and occurs within one to three days of initial symptom onset (

Clinicians should be aware that the presentation of a biphasic illness with reappearance of fever after defervesence from a typical influenza illness might represent a complicating secondary bacterial pneumonia. Bacterial pneumonia should be strongly suspected when a typical influenza illness is resolving, usually around the fifth day, and then there is a recurrence of fever and productive cough, often but not always with purulent sputum. In severely ill patients, appropriate antibiotics for community-acquired or nursing home-acquired pneumonia should be instituted immediately, as well as NI antiviral drug treatment, pending an etiologic diagnosis.
