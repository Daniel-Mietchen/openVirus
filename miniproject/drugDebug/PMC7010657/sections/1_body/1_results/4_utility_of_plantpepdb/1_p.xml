<p id="Par8">PlantPepDB is a powerful web-resource that provides in-depth information about most of the bioactive and therapeutic plant peptides published so far. The physicochemical properties and the structure of peptides play a vital role in the functional aspect. Both of these information have been incorporated into the database. User can exploit the structural information of peptides for further in-silico screening studies, docking, binding pockets, molecular simulations and peptide interaction with receptors. The biggest advantage of a database like PlantPepDB is that users can get all information of a single peptide, in a single entry. For example, plant peptide with id ‘PPepDB_3988’ is ‘Fabatin-1’ which is present in multiple databases like PhytAMP

 </sup> with various information. Now in PlantPepDB, users can find all those scattered information and additional curated information about ‘Fabatin-1’ in a single place which will prove to be extremely useful. Users can even search peptides based on their physicochemical properties using the ‘Advanced PhysicoChem Search’ module of PlantPepDB. This is very useful in case users have pre-handed information about their experiments and they want plant peptides with particular properties.
