<p id="Par6">It was also seen that many peptides despite been collected from different resources exhibit multiple properties. Out of 3848 peptides, 2673 exhibit single function, however, 556 peptides exhibit two functions, 239 show three functions, 69 peptides show four functions, 30 exhibits five functions, and only 19 peptides exhibit more than five functions. The peptides which are found to display multiple functions may play vital roles in various therapeutic and biological activities. Much detailed information about the peptides which were found to possess more than five functions is shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The information of each of those 19 peptides can be tracked by using the PPepDB ID given in the table. All of these peptides are available in multiple sources but the information was very scattered till we collected all the data, curated it and compiled it and incorporated in PlantPepDB. We have also incorporated information about peptide families, among which cyclotides was the most occurring peptide family with 27.4% of the total peptides, followed by thaumatin peptide family with 26.5%, defensin family with 10.7% and rest all the families had below 10% of peptides like thionin (6.7%), ACE inhibitory peptide (6.5%), Orbitide (4.6%), lipid-transfer (2%), hevein family (1.5%), glycinin (2.2%), snaking (1.1%), cyclic peptides (0.7%) and lectin family (0.6%). There are other peptide families also which comprise a very small number of peptides and hence collectively put into the “other” category (8.1%). A detailed pie chart is available in the statistics page of PlantPepDB.
