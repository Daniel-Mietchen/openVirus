<p id="Par17">The previously mentioned search options majorly deal with basic peptide information but the ‘Physico Search’ option allows the user to search peptides based on their physicochemical properties. ‘AA Composition Search’ allows users to search peptides according to their amino acid count as well as amino acid percentage. Users must provide a minimum and maximum range of amino acids to search for peptides. Users can select different amino acids by using the dropdown in the amino acid selection column. The ‘Advanced PhysicoChem Search’ is very similar to ‘advanced search’, however, the only difference is that this search module is completely dedicated to physicochemical properties. There are total of 16 physicochemical properties from which the user can perform the search (e.g. molecular weight, gravy, aliphatic index, instability index, aromaticity, etc.).</p>
