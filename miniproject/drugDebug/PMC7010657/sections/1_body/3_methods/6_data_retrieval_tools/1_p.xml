<p id="Par16">‘Simple Search’ module allows user to search the PlantPepDB database using various keywords from different fields given on the search page. Users can search from one field at a time. To make simple search more flexible, ‘containing’ and ‘exact’ options are also incorporated to search for a wide range of data to a more specific search. In the ‘Advanced search’ module, users can make complex queries and can search from multiple fields using conditional operators for each field. Advanced search allows user to search from 14 different fields that cover all the important information about a peptide entry in PlantPepDB. Users can download the results of the search in both cases.</p>
