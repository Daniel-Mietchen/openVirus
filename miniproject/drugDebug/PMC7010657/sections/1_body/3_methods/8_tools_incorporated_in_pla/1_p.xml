<p id="Par19">We have incorporated a total of three tools at PlantPepDB to facilitate the user to find and match their query peptide sequences with the PlantPepDB sequences. The first tool is ‘SW Align’ i.e. Smith-Waterman Alignment
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>
 </sup>, which allows the user to align query sequences with the PlantPepDB database. This option assists the user to identify and characterize their sequence of interest. Here, we have incorporated ‘WATER’ utility of EMBOSS-6.6.0 package, following the Smith–Waterman Algorithm. ‘Mapping’ option helps the user to map all the peptide sequences of the PlantPepDB database on to the user-provided peptide sequences. Sequences having &gt;99% similarity with user-provided sequences are displayed as the result of this alignment module. Here, we have incorporated BLASTp option of the BLAST software package. ‘BLAST’
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>
 </sup> module is effective to find the regions of similarity between the FASTA sequences provided by the user and PlantPepDB database sequences using BLASTp with the option to change Expect value (E value). The respective ID(s) of PlantPepDB sequences producing significant alignments with the query sequences are further hyperlinked to display the detailed information of each peptide entry.
