 </sup>. The entries from databases were first filtered for plant peptides only. Data retrieval was done using export and download options available at the databases. In case, there is no option to download the data, we used our in-house Perl scripts to retrieve the data and, in some cases, used ‘wget’ command. Using ‘wget’ and Perl scripts, we have downloaded the information of peptides in ‘HTML’ format from the databases, which were processed using Linux commands and ‘awk’ scripts to extract desired information. A total of 835 research articles were manually curated for bioactive plant peptides information. Since the literature was very huge to search from, therefore, to narrow down the papers only to search for plant-related peptides, we used the advanced search option of NCBI’s PubMed database. The search for articles was performed by queries using various combinations of keywords (e.g. to search for all the antimicrobial peptides published in the last 5 years of 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plant we used keywords like ‘antimicrobial’, ‘peptides’, ‘Arabidopsis thaliana’). Further, research articles and reviews lacking relevant or insufficient information were excluded. Full-text search was performed for all the relevant articles having any plant peptide information and was curated to form a tabular format.
