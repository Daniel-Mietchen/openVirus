<p id="Par18">The ‘Browse module’ provides 4 major options (e.g. plant classification, peptide family, peptide activity and sequence length range) to browse all the entries of this database. Hence, if a user is interested in extracting all the peptides which belong to the Defensin family, the user have to use ‘Browse Peptide Family → Defensin’ to get the desired results. This module is useful in case a user has very little or no information on what to search on the database. The user can choose from the available options and can obtain all the information on the peptide.</p>
