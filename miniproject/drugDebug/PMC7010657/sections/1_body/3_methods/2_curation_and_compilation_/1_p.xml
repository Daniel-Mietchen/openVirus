<p id="Par12">We curated the functional properties of each peptide from their source database as well as literature. Initially, after collecting and compiling all the data into a tabular format we had 8356 plant peptide entries but after the second level of curation and refinement of the data, we were left with 3848 plant peptide entries. The second level of curation involved regrouping of duplicate and repeated peptide entries and making only one information-rich entry. For e.g.: same peptide information is available in two different databases or articles, but both the sources contain partly different information like one source has information about peptide activity, plant source, activity against two bacteria while the other source also contains the same peptide and most of the reported information is same, but some are different and new information like activity against some fungal infection or shown to possess toxic property. Initially, these two entries were separate but after the second level of manual curation, such entries were merged to form one single data enriched peptide entry. This careful curation will help the researchers to get all the information in a single entry, collected from multiple research articles and databases.</p>
