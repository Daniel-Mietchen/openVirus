<p id="Par15">We have developed PlantPepDB using Apache HTTP server (version 2.4.6) integrated with PHP (version 7.3.3) and MySQL (version 8.0.15) on a server machine with Centos 7 Linux as the operating system. JavaScript (version 1.8.0) and PHP were used to develop the back-end of the database while MySQL (version 8.0.15) was used to process the data at the back-end. CSS and HTML were used to make the template responsive. Perl scripts were also integrated at the back-end of the database for multiple file handling and data manipulation.</p>
