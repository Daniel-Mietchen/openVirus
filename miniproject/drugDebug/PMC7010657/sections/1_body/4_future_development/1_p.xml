<p id="Par20">In the current release of PlantPepDB, there are 3848 peptide entries, a future release of this database will contain updated datasets with the incorporation of new tools and features. We are also planning to incorporate a tool that can predict the userâ€™s query sequence properties by using the existing dataset of PlantPepDB. For this, we will use machine learning approaches to train the available dataset and select key features that can be used as descriptors of a plant peptide sequence. This feature will enhance the utility of PlantPepDB so that the user can also characterize an unknown peptide sequences. As the dataset size will increase we will also integrate API access for the users so that data extraction from the database in large amounts will be more straightforward and simpler.</p>
