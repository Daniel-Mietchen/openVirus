<p id="Par2">The past decade has seen exceptional growth in peptide-based therapeutic research. Currently, over 60 peptide drugs are approved in the market
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup> and more than 200 peptide drugs are in different clinical trial phases
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>. These numbers clearly denote the applicability of peptide-based therapeutics in the field of drug discovery
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>
 </sup>. Higher as well as the lower group of plants possess a broad range of defense mechanisms to combat chemical, physical and biological stress conditions. Plant-derived peptides are one of their defensive approaches. Bioactive plant peptides are an underexplored domain in the field of proteomics and peptidomics
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>
 </sup>. Plenty of bioactive peptides, including toxins and venoms that act upon intriguing molecular targets, have been identified in all plant taxonomic groups. Plant-derived peptides possess numerous activities like antifungal, antibacterial, antiviral, anticancer, antihypertensive, immune system related, antiparasitic, antifeedant, insecticidal, etc., that can be utilized for many therapeutic and biological applications. Over the last few years, peptides emerged as an alternative for chemical drugs due to the change in drug development and treatment paradigms
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>
 </sup>. Therapeutic peptides are advantageous over proteins or antibodies as they have high target specificity and selectivity as well as easy to synthesize
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>
 </sup>, and are less toxic. Plant peptides may be a starting point for new therapeutic peptides. Apart from therapeutic peptides, there are seven other functional categories of peptides available in PlantPepDB like inhibitory peptides, toxic, plant defense response, microbe killing, etc. which also plays a vital role in several biological phenomena. To achieve more success in plant peptide therapeutics and biological applications, a deeper knowledge of peptide sequence, their complete details are required and a compiled repository of them is more useful. Despite the huge potential of plant peptides, to date, there is no dedicated database available for plant peptides with a variety of therapeutic and bioactive properties. There are various databases available for peptides, such as APD3

 </sup> (database of antimicrobial, antiparasitic and insecticidal peptides), PhytAMP
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>
