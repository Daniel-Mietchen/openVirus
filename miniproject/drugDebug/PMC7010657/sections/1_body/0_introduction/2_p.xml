<p id="Par3">In this study, we present a comprehensive plant peptide database e.g. PlantPepDB, which provides thorough information about various plant peptides having different functional, physicochemical and structural properties. Overall architecture of PlantPepDB along with its features is displayed in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. It consists of 3848 peptide entries collected from 11 different databases and 835 research articles. Peptide sequences from 443 plants have been extracted, out of which only six belong to algae and rest are land plants which include bryophytes, gymnosperms, monocots, and dicots. This database will not only facilitate the plant researchers but will also attract people from a wide range of domain working on peptide-based research.
