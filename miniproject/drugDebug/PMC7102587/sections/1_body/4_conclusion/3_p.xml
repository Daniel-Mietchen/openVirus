   <p id="p0120">Use of HCQ in patients with diabetes in India where it is already approved for treatment: It would be interesting to research COVID-19 infection in patients with diabetes who are already on HCQ for treatment of diabetes. Further, the effect of HCQ on glycemia, cardiovascular function and viral load, in patients with diabetes needs to be researched.</p>
