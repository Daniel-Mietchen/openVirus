<p id="p0080">Expectedly, some precautions will be needed while using both these drugs that include frequent monitoring of hematological parameters (RBC, WBC and platelet counts), measurement of serum electrolytes, blood glucose (because of hypoglycemic potential of HCQ) and hepatic as well as renal functions. Since both these drugs have the potential to prolong QTc, routine electrocardiography is essential prior to starting these drugs. Co-administration of other drugs known to prolong the QTc interval (such as anti-arrhythmic, anti-depressants, anti-psychotics, anti-histaminic, teneligliptin, ondansetron and moxifloxacin etc.) must be avoided [

 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Moreover, addition of azithromycin to HCQ as done in French trial by Gautret et al. may increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Perform ECG daily if QTc is 450–500 msec. Additionally, hypoglycemia must be looked for in patients with diabetes especially with concurrent use of chloroquine/HCQ and lopinavir/ritonavir. Chloroquine and HCQ should not be used concurrently with lopinavir/ritonavir and remdisivir for anticipated QTc prolongation. Finally, pharmacovigilance on visual and mental disturbance is also closely required.
