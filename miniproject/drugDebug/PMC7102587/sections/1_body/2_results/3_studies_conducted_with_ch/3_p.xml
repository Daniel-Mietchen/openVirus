<p id="p0065">The second human study which is currently available was conducted with HCQ. In an open-label, non-randomized trial (n = 36) conducted in Marseille, France, Gautret et al. found that HCQ alone and combination of HCQ plus azithromycin was highly and significantly effective in clearing viral nasopharyngeal carriage (measured by polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) in only three-to six days in COVID-19 subjects, compared to control. The virological clearance day-6 post-inclusion (primary outcome) with HCQ 
 <italic>vs.</italic> control was 70.0% versus 12.5%, respectively (p = 0.001). In addition, the virological clearance at day-6 post-inclusion in HCQ plus azithromycin, HCQ and control arm was 100%, 57.1% and 12.5% respectively (p &lt; 0.001). This data suggests a synergistic effect of azithromycin with HCQ. Indeed, azithromycin has shown an antiviral effect against Zika and Ebola viruses in

These results of converting a potential carrier to a seronegative patient are of importance with regards to preventing community transmission of COVID-19. Since the data from Wuhan, China showed that some patients were carrier as long as up to 37 days (usually around 20 days), results of this study are very encouraging in the context of converting a patient to a seronegative subject within 6 days. Interestingly, this study also showed that the effect of HCQ was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) in symptomatic patients as compared to asymptomatic patients with COVID-19. The authors have acknowledged limitations of the study; a small sample size, dropout of six patients and limited follow-up, apart from the non-randomized and open-label nature of the trial. A close look in to this study also suggests that the Cycle threshold (Ct) value for nasopharyngeal swab PCR to call it as a sample negative, was lower (Ct value &gt; 35 was deemed as negative for virus) compared to conventional Ct threshold of &gt;40. Ct is defined as the number of cycles to be run for the PCR test to turn positive. In other words, lower the number of Ct denotes more virus is present and lesser number of cycles are required to hit the threshold. Moreover, nasopharyngeal swab PCR is a less sensitive tool, compared to PCR of Broncho-alveolar lavage and sputum in COVID-19. Furthermore, exclusion of five patients (26%) receiving HCQ from the overall analysis, exaggerate the final results of this study.
