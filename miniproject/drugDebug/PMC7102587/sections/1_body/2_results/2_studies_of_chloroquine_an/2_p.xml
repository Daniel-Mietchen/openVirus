<p id="p0045">Experimental studies have suggested that chloroquine is a proven anti-malarial drug that has the capability of inhibiting the replication of several intracellular micro-organisms including coronaviruses 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. It is also believed that chloroquine may have a varied mechanism of action which may differ depending upon the pathogen studied. It has been increasingly learnt that the anti-viral and anti-inflammatory activities of chloroquine may have a role in the treatment of patients with novel COVID-19. Chloroquine increases endosomal pH and interferes with the glycosylation of cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and thereby it has the potential to block viral infection [

In addition, chloroquine also inhibits the quinone reductase-2, which is involved in sialic acid biosynthesis (an acidic monosaccharides of cell transmembrane proteins required for ligand recognition) that makes this agent a broad antiviral agent. It is important to note that both human coronavirus HCoV-O43 and orthomyxoviruses uses sialic acid moieties as a receptor. Moreover, chloroquine changes the pH of lysosomes and likely inhibits cathepsins, that leads to the formation of the autophagosome which cleaves SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Furthermore, chloroquine through the inhibition of MAP-kinase interferes with SARS-CoV-2 molecular crosstalk, besides altering the virion assembly, budding and interfering with the proteolytic processing of the M protein [

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Previous experimental studies have also demonstrated that chloroquine has potent anti-SARS-CoV-1 effects 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, primarily attributable to a deficit in the glycosylation receptors at the virus cell surface, so that it cannot bind to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressed in lung, heart, kidney and intestine. Since SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the similar surface receptor ACE2, it is believed that chloroquine can also interfere with ACE2 receptor glycosylation thus prevents SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the target cells [
