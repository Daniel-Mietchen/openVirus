<p id="Par28">To improve the detection of RNA synthesis, we examined how changes in the concentration of reagents (i.e., NaCl, DTT, MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> and enzyme) affected RdRp activity. The presence or absence of DTT and NaCl in the assay had little effect on RNA synthesis, which was only slightly impeded at high concentrations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3A,B</xref>). As expected, no increase in fluorescence was detected when using MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> (0 to 20 mM), whereas maximum activity was recorded with 2.5 mM MnCl
 <sub>2</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3C</xref>). The increase in the velocity of reaction correlated linearly with increases in RdRp concentration along the 10–250 nM range. The maximum velocity was reached with 750 nM RdRp in the assay (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3D</xref>). From these assays we obtained a K
 <sub>m</sub> for poly-U of 3.3 ± 0.5 μg/mL (~31 nM) and a K
 <sub>m</sub> for ATP of 561 ± 38 μM (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>).
