<p id="Par31">To investigate whether the assay can be adapted to other viral polymerases, we used two unrelated RdRps from FMDV (3Dpol) and HCV (recombinant NS5B) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4A</xref>). We found that recombinant HCV polymerase can synthesize RNA 
 <italic>de novo</italic> using radiolabeling (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>) and the fluorescence-based approach (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>), which is in agreement with the mechanism of genome replication for this virus

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. Again, an increase in fluorescence was only observed with a catalytically-active HCV RdRp (NS5bΔ21) but not an inactive mutant, and the activity was dependent on the presence of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4C</xref>). We also found that FMDV 3D polymerase can catalyze RNA synthesis 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, in an assay primed by the viral protein-primer VPg. It has been previously demonstrated that FMDV 3D catalyzes the addition of a uridine-monophosphate residue to Tyr3 in VPg. Once uridylylated, VPg can act as a competent primer to initiate viral genome replication

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>
 </sup>. Vpg protein-primed polymerization 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> can be achieved using a polyadenylic acid as template, UTP as substrate, Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> as catalytic metal and the VPg1 peptide synthetically produced
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>. Real-time experiments showed an increase of fluorescence as a function of time when using active 3D, whereas no activity was monitored in the presence of a catalytically-inactive protein, or in the absence of Mn
 <sup>2+</sup> or VPg1 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4D</xref>). Overall, our data show that this 96-well format assay can be exploited to characterize different viral RdRps 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, as it permits real-time monitoring of replication, allowing the characterization of small-molecule libraries in a cost-effective and rapid manner.
