<p id="Par27">To further investigate the possible use of SYTO 9 dye to detect activity in the presence of other templates, we used poly-C. However, we detected increases in fluorescence only in end-point reactions, when SYTO 9 was added after the recation was complete, and not in a continuous reading assay when it was added before initiating the reaction (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1B</xref>). These results suggest that poly-C is not a suitable substrate for real-time assays.
