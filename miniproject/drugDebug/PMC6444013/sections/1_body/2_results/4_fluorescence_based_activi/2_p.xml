<p id="Par30">The robustness and suitability of this assay as a prospective, high-throughput method to screen polymerase antiviral compounds was examined by calculating the Z′ value, a standard statistical measure to evaluate the quality for high-throughput platforms

 </sup>. The relative activity of both positive and negative controls was calculated as the average value obtained from 8 independent experiments (see Methods). Each experiment was carried out in triplicate and on independent days. Relative activity values were determined as the velocity of polymerization recorded during the first 10 min of the reaction. The mean Z’ value obtained was 0.62, which according to published standards, qualifies our method as an excellent assay for high-throughput screening application
