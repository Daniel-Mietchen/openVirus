<p id="Par29">We hypothesized that this fluorescence-based method could be exploited for the development of high-throughput screening methods to identify polymerase inhibitors. To test this, we used several broad-spectrum nucleoside and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors. Addition of polymerase NNI heparin

 </sup> to the reaction completely abrogated fluorescence-associated activity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). To further confirm the sensitivity of our assay to inhibitors, we tested two nucleoside analogs: cordycepin 5′-triphosphate (3′dATP; a chain terminator analog of ATP

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>
 </sup>) and ribavirin 5′-triphosphate (RTP; a purine analog that inhibits but does not terminate RNA elongation during viral replication
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>–
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>
 </sup>). Both compounds reduced the polymerase activities (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3A</xref>). We calculated the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of these compounds (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>): as expected, the most potent inhibitor was the NNI heparin (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 81 ± 21 nM), followed by the NAIs, 3′dATP (54 ± 7 μM) and RTP (946 ± 46 μM). To confirm that the decrease in fluorescence was linked to the inhibition of RNA synthesis, we repeated these experiments using radioactive-labeled nucleotides. We found a reduced polymerization activity in the presence of inhibitors (3′dATP, RTP and heparin) that correlated with the aforementioned IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>). Similar inhibitory activities were observed when poly-C or poly-U were used as template molecules in radioactive-based activity assays (Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>).
