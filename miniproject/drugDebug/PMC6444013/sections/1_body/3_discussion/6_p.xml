<p id="Par37">In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the procedures developed here can be easily adapted to measure polymerization activity of several viral RdRps, strengthening our method as a universal procedure for the development of high-throughput tools to characterize viral polymerases (e.g., enzymology, polymerase variants of interest) and to screen small-molecule libraries to identify antiviral drugs. In particular, we believe that this platform can be a useful tool for the development of therapeutics against ZIKV and other flaviviruses, which are currently unavailable.</p>
