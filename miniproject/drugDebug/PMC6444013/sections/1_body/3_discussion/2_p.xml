Indeed, an advantage of fluorescence-based methods over traditional approaches is the absence of radioactive compounds, which facilitates their broad use in different laboratory settings without specific facilities or training requirements. An additional advantage of our strategy is that it allows the time-resolving determination of the polymerase activity, which we believe gives further insight into the mechanisms of replication and inhibition.
