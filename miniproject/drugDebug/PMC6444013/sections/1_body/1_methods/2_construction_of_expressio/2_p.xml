<p id="Par8">A catalytically inactive enzyme was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis of the pET16a-ZIKV-NS5RdRp plasmid, encoding for substitutions D665N and D666N in the active site, which affects two catalytic Asp residues. The amplification reagents were the same as above with primers NS5_GNN_Fw and NS5_GNN_rv (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>) and pET16a-ZIKV-NS5RdRp as template. PCR reaction conditions used were 98 °C (3 min), 30 cycles of 98 °C (15 s), 54 °C (20 s) and 72 °C (4 min), followed by an elongation step of 10 min at 72 °C. The resulting expression plasmid was termed pET16a-ZIKV-NS5RdRp-GNN.
