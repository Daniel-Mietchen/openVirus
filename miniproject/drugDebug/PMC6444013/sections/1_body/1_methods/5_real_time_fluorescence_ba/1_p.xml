<p id="Par19">Polymerase activity assays with HCV NS5bΔ21 were performed as described above for ZIKV RdRp. For the detection of FMDV 3D polymerase activity, 49 μL of reaction mix [50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.6 mM MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 33 mM NaCl, 100 μM UTP, 40 μg/mL poly-A, 8% glycerol (v/v), 150 μM VPg1, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 0.25 μM of SYTO 9 (50 μM stock solution in TE buffer, pH 7.5)] was added to each well of a black 96-well flat-bottom plate. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 1 μL of FMDV 3D (1 μM final concentration) and plates were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. Fluorescence intensity was recorded as above.
