<p id="Par14">Reactions were performed in individual wells of black 96-well flat-bottom plates. The standard reaction contained 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 500 μM ATP, 20 μg/mL poly-U, 0.1 mg/mL BSA and 0.25 μM SYTO 9 (50 μM stock solution in TE buffer pH 7.5). The assay was initiated by the addition of 250 nM ZIKV RdRp and the fluorescence was recorded over 30 min at 30 °C.
