<p id="Par18">End-point fluorometric reactions were performed in black 96-well black-flat bottom plates at 30 °C in the presence of the same reagents as described above, but in the absence of dye. The reactions were quenched at 60 min by adding in 25 mM EDTA to the samples. Either SYTO9 or SYBR Green II dye was then added to the sample (0.25 μM or 1x, respectively) and the mix reaction was incubated at room temperature for 5 min to allow the stabilization of RNA-dye complexes and fluorescence emission. To determine background fluorescence levels, a negative control was assayed in parallel, where the reaction was quenched before adding ZIKV RdRp. The quenched control reaction was incubated for 1 h at 30 °C, and then 0.25 μM SYTO9 or 1 × SYBR Green II, respectively, was added to the sample and fluorescence recorded as described above.</p>
