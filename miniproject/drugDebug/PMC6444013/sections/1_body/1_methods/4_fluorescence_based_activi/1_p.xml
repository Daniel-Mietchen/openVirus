<p id="Par13">For the detection of RNA synthesis by ZIKV RdRp, we established a real-time assay based on the fluorescent dye SYTO 9, which binds dsRNA but not ssRNA template molecules. The fluorescence emitted was recorded in real-time using a Fluostar Optima fluorimeter (BMG Labtech) using excitation and emission filters at 485 and 520â€‰nm, respectively. The assay records the synthesis of dsRNA in a reaction using a poly-U molecule as a template and ATP as the nucleotide substrate. This technique has been adapted from methods previously documented for the detection of DNA synthesis
