<p id="Par16">To determine K
 <sub>m</sub> and V
 <sub>max</sub> constants for ZIKV RdRp binding to poly-U ssRNA, standard reactions were carried out in increasing concentrations of the template (0.5–50 μg/mL) in the presence of ATP at 500 μM. The kinetic parameters for ATP were obtained from assays in the presence of increasing concentrations of this nucleotide (200–2250 μM) and using 3 μg/mL of poly-U.
