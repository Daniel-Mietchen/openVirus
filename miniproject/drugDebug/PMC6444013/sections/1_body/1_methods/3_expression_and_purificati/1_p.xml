<p id="Par11">For the expression of ZIKV NS5 RdRp (hereafter referred to as ZIKV RdRp), 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were transformed by electroporation with pET16a-ZIKV-NS5RdRp. Single kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistant colonies were cultured overnight in 10 mL of LB in the presence of antibiotics at 37 °C. Each culture was then inoculated into 200 mL of LB with antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C. When an optical density at 600 nm of 0.7 was reached, 500 μM IPTG, 50 μM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub> and 50 μM ZnCl
 <sub>2</sub> were added to the culture, which was incubated at 30 °C for 4 additional hours. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C and stored at −80 °C until further use.
