<p id="Par20">Similar procedures were used for both ZIKV NS5 RdRp domain and HCV NS5bΔ21 polymerases. Radioactivity assays were performed in 10 μL reactions containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mM MnCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, and either 500 μM ATP, 16 nM [α-
 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP and 40 μg/mL poly-U; or 500 μM GTP, 16 nM [α-
 <sup>32</sup>P]GTP and 20 μg/mL poly-C. Reactions were performed at 30 °C and initiated by addition of of 1 μL of either ZIKV or HCV recombinant polymerases to reach a final concentration of 1 μM in the assay. The reaction was stopped at different time points by addition of 2 μL of formamide loading buffer [10 mM EDTA, 95% (v/v) formamide, 0.03% (w/v), xylene-cyanol, final concentration]. The reaction products were resolved by electrophoresis in 20% polyacrylamide gels containing 1 × TBE buffer and 8 M urea, at 30 W for 120 min.

 <sup>32</sup>P]ATP as substrates were detected either by autoradiography or by phosphorimaging (Phosphorimager BAS 1500, Fuji).
