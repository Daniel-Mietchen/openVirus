<p id="Par21">Fluorometric results were expressed as mean ± SD. Statistical significance was analyzed by two-way ANOVA using GraphPad Prism, version 7, as specified in the figure legends. K
 <sub>m</sub> determinations were obtained by plotting the velocity of the reaction as a function of nucleotide or ssRNA template concentrations using nonlinear regression. IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were obtained by fitting the velocity data to a four-parameter logistic equation. Kinetic parameters and IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using Sigmaplot, version 11. Z’ factor was calculated according to Zhang
