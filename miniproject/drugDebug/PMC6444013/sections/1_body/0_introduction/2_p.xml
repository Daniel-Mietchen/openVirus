<p id="Par3">ZIKV has a positive-sense ssRNA genome of approximately 10.8 kb in length, which encodes a single polyprotein of 3400 amino acids flanked by untranslated RNA regions

 </sup>. The polyprotein undergoes successive proteolytic processing to generate three structural proteins: the capsid protein, the precursor of the membrane protein and the envelope protein, as well as seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B and NS5). The different non-structural proteins are involved in the essential steps of the viral replication cycle inside the host cell. Among them, NS5 is the largest (903 amino acids) and most conserved viral protein

 </sup>. NS5 includes an N-terminal domain containing methyltransferase activity (residues 1–262) and a C-terminal RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) domain (residues 275–903). A short linker interdomain formed by residues 263–274 covalently connects both enzymatic activities

 </sup>. ZIKV RdRp exhibits a typical encircled right-hand configuration with palm, fingers and thumb subdomains, and six conserved motifs (A–F) that are common to other viral RdRps. These motifs are critical for its polymerase activity, as they are involved in RNA and nucleotide binding, coordination of metal ions, and catalysis

 </sup>. The catalytic aspartates are located in conserved motifs A (D536) and C (GDD tract at positions 665–667). These aspartates constitute the catalytic triad responsible for nucleotide transfer to nascent RNA. The process entails the coordination of two divalent cations by these residues that are essential to the catalytic process
