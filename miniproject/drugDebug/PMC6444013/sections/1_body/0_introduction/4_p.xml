<p id="Par5">In this study, we outline the development of a reliable method for rapid detection of ZIKV polymerase activity in real-time. We show that recombinant ZIKV RdRp can synthesize RNA 
 <italic>de novo</italic>, which can be then quantified in real-time using a fluorescent dye (SYTO 9), which detects the presence of double-stranded (ds) RNA generated after the copy of single-stranded homopolymeric RNA. We also demonstrate the potential value of this protocol to screen antiviral compounds by using known broad-spectrum antivirals, which reproduce their inhibitory activities in this assay. The versatility of this method was further established with RdRps from two distinct viruses: foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The implications of these results for high-throughput approaches are discussed.
