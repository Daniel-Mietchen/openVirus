 <caption> Enzymatic activity of ZIKV NS5 RdRp in the presence of inhibitory compounds. ( A) Real-time fluorescence-based polymerization assays in the absence (black circles, same as in Fig.  2B), or in the presence of different inhibitory compounds at the indicated concentrations. Shown are average values obtained from five independent experiments. Statistically significant differences of fluorescence in the presence of RTP, relative to its absence, are represented (upper panel; *P &lt; 0.01; **P &lt; 0.005; ***P &lt; 0.001). ( B) Radioactive nucleotide assays using poly-U as a template molecule and [α- 32P]ATP as the reaction substrate. Different inhibitory compounds were added to the reaction at the indicated concentrations. Elongation reactions were stopped at different time points (from 0 to 3 hours) in the presence of 500 μM RTP (panel 2), 50 μM 3′dATP (panel 3) or in the presence of 1.5 μM heparin (panel 4) and loaded onto 8 M urea-containing 20% polyacrylamide gels. The same electropherogram previously shown in Fig.  1 is displayed here (panel 1) for comparison. Representative gel images are shown. The panels were cropped from different full-length gels that were run and autoradiographied using the same experimental conditions. The position of the labeled non-incorporated nucleotide is indicated (*). See Methods for details. </caption>
