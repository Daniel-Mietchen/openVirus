  <p>Real-time fluorescence-based polymerization assay using HCV RdRp and FMDV RdRp. (
   <bold>A</bold>) SDS-PAGE analysis of different purification stages of HCV NS5bΔ21 and HCV NS5bΔ21-GNN polymerases after expression in 
   <italic>E. coli</italic>. Lane 1, a lysate of 
   <italic>E. coli</italic> BL21(DE3)-pRIL containing plasmid pET28-HCV NS5bΔ21 and grown in the absence of IPTG is shown. Lane 2, same as lane 1 but grown in the presence of 500 μM IPTG. Purified proteins HCV NS5bΔ21 (lane 3) and HCV NS5bΔ21-GNN (lane 4) obtained after purification through Ni-NTA resin. M, molecular marker. The molecular weight of each band is indicated in kDa. (
   <bold>B</bold>) 
   <italic>De novo</italic> polymerase activity performed by recombinant HCV RdRp in the presence of [α-
   <sup>32</sup>P]ATP using poly-U as template. Each lane represents a reaction stopped at a different time point (from 0 to 2 hours; lanes 2 to 6). Polymerization assays in the presence of MgCl
   <sub>2</sub> (lane 7), in the absence of any metal donor (lane 8), or using GNN inactive mutant (lane 9) showed no detectable activity. Lane 1 represents a negative control reaction in the absence of enzyme. The position of the labeled non-incorporated nucleotide is indicated (*). A vertical black line separates non-contiguous images from the same gel. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Real-time determination of fluorescence emitted in assays containing purified NS5bΔ21 wild-type (WT) and NS5bΔ21 GNN, and in the presence of different components indicated in the figure. Shown are average values obtained from five different replicas. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Same as in (
   <bold>C</bold>) but using FMDV 3D WT and GNN RdRps. Gel electrophoresis, visualization by autoradiography analysis and fluorometric measurements were performed as described in Methods.
