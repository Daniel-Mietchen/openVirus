 <caption> Reporter luciferase-based one-cycle infection inhibition assay. MDCK cells growing in 96-well plates were infected with reporter influenza PR8-PB2-Gluc virus at an MOI of 0.1, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of (A) CHLA and (B) CHLI. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were used as culture medium during infection to avoid generation of infectious progeny viruses. At 24 h post infection (p.i.), Gluc expression was determined, and viral infectivities were evaluated. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; Student’s t-test. </caption>
