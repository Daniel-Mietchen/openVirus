 <caption> Doseâ€“response curves of CHLA, CHLI, and reference compound oseltamivir acid against virus replication in a yield reduction assay. MDCK cells in 24-well plates were infected with (A) A/H1N1/PR8, (B) A/H3N2/NY, (C) oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus A/H1N1/pdm(09), (D) A/H3N2/Brisbane, (E) B-Yamagata, and (F) B-Victoria at an MOI of 0.01. The culture supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i., and virus titers (TCID 50/mL) in the culture supernatants were determined using MDCK cells. Each point represents the mean and standard deviation of three independent experiments. </caption>
