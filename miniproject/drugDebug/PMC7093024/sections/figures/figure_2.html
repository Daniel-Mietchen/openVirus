 <caption> Identification of chebulagic acid (CHLA) and chebulinic acid (CHLI) as novel antiviral actives against influenza virus infection. (A) Antiviral determination of 15 overlapped components of unripe and ripe pods of T. chebula at 12.5 μM. (B) CHLA and (C) CHLI were examined against influenza virus in MDCK cells in vitro for dose–response evaluation (red) and cytotoxicity assay (blue). Insets: molecular structures of (B) CHLA and (C) CHLI. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. </caption>
