 <caption> CHLA and CHLI block neuraminidase (NA)-mediated virus release. (A) Virus release inhibition assay. MDCK cells were infected with reporter influenza PR8-PB2-Gluc virus at an MOI of 0.1. At 20 h p.i., infected cells were washed three times, and fresh Opti-MEM containing 2 μg/mL of N-tosyl- L-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)–trypsin was added for another 2-h incubation, in the absence or presence of indicated compounds. The supernatants were harvested, and progeny viruses were titrated by luciferase assay. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001; Student’s t-test. (B) NA inhibition assay. The NA was incubated with fluorimetric substrates in the absence or presence of indicated compounds. The intensity of fluorescence was detected to reflect NA activities. Data are means ± SD from three independent experiments. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001; Student’s t-test. </caption>
