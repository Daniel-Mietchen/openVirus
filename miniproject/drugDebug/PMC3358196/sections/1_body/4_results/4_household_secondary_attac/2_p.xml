<p>Univariate analysis revealed a significantly higher confirmed SAR for patients aged &lt;16 years and for those 16â€“49 years, compared to those 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>50 years. The SAR in male patients was higher than female patients, but the difference was not significant (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). Most secondary case-patients (86.8%, 45/53) had not received prophylaxis; contacts who had not received AV prophylaxis had a significantly higher confirmed SAR than those who had (

 <underline>&lt;</underline>2 days after onset in the primary case-patient had a nonsignificantly higher SAR than those who received therapy later (

 <underline>&lt;</underline>48 hours of onset rather than after 48 hours (
