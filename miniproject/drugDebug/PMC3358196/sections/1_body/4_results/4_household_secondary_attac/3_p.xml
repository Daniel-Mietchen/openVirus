<p>The confirmed SAR by age of primary case-patients is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>. Confirmed SAR was high among those &lt;16 years of age, whether the primary case-patient was a child or an adult. Similarly, SAR was low among adults, whether the primary case-patient was a child or an adult (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">Table 5</xref>). When transmission from adults to children was analyzed by gender, a significant difference was found for SARs in children according to sex of the adult primary case-patient: 33.3% (10/30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 17.3–52.8) for female primary case-patients and 2.9% (1/34, 95% CI 0.1–15.3) for men (odds ratio 16.5, 95% CI 2.0–138.8; p = 0.010).
