<p>Recent publications have explored the possibility of using household data to estimate AV effectiveness for seasonal influenza (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>). Our study provides evidence that AV prophylaxis of household contacts significantly reduces SAR for all endpoints, updating earlier work (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>). Most secondary cases occurred in contacts who had not yet received AV prophylaxis after onset of illness in the primary case-patient, with a very high SAR observed in those that had not received AV for all endpoints, due to the delay for many before prophylaxis was started. The adjusted survival analysis took into account the confounding effect of time to prophylaxis and demonstrated that AVs are effective for all endpoints. Other studies in Japan (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>), Hong Kong, China (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>), and Germany (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>) have attempted to determine the effectiveness of postexposure prophylaxis for pandemic influenza. Most show a statistically nonsignificant positive effect of AVs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>). Studies concerning AV effectiveness for seasonal influenza, in particular a large placebo-controlled household study, found that postexposure prophylaxis reduced the incidence of infection in close household contacts by 89% (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>). Our study demonstrates that timely administration of AVs to close contacts provides significant protection against clinical disease.
