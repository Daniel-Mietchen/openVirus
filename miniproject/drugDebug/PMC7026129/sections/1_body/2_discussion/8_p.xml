<p>The anti-SFTSV efficacy of IFN-γ both 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> (Ning et al., 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) was reported. Because IFN-γ is an FDA-approved drug, it has been suggested as a candidate antiviral drug for SFTSV alone or in combination with other drugs (Shimojima et al., 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
