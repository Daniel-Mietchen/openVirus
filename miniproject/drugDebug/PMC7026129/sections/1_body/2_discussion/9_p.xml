<p>The efficacy of antibody-based treatment has been studied against SFTS disease. Generally, antibodies play a critical role in the treating a wide variety of viral diseases; such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Ferrari et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>), diseases caused by ebola virus (Mendoza et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and influenza (Nachbagauer and Krammer, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Antibody drugs neutralize viruses or bind to the virion to enhance antigen uptake by cytotoxic T cells, making them highly specific for the target virus. It was reported that antiserum of a patient recovered from SFTS completely protected mice from the lethal infection of SFTSV (Shimada et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It was also shown that antibodies against SFTSV Gn protein significantly reduced the fatality rate in mice infected with SFTSV, even when treatment was initiated from 3 days post inoculation (Kim et al., 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). These reports suggested that antibodies alone or in combination with antiviral drugs could be used to treat patients with SFTS.
