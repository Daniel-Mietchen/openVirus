<p>Baba et al. (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) investigated the effect of amodiaquine and other halogen molecules (fluorine, bromine, and iodine) against the replication of SFTSV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. All the derivatives also displayed anti-SFTSV activity, and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> was 36.6, 31.1, and 15.6 μM for fluorine bromine, and iodine, respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Among the compounds tested, amodiaquine was identified as a selective inhibitor against SFTSV replication. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> and the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of amodiaquine was &gt;100 and 19.1 μM, respectively. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> of amodiaquine was lower than those of ribavirin (40.1 μM) and favipiravir (25.0 μM).
