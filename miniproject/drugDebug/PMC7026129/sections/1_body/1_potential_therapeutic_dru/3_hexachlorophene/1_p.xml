<p>Yuan et al. (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>) screened an FDA-approved drug library that contained 1,528 drug compounds and identified five that inhibited SFTSV replication at concentrations of &lt;10 μM, including two antibacterial and antifungal disinfectants (hexachlorophene and triclosan), a multi-kinase inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid organ tumors (regorafenib), a small molecule agonist of the C-mannosylation of thrombopoietin receptor (c-Mpl) for the treatment of immune thrombocytopenic purpura and aplastic anemia (eltrombopag), and an antiprotozoal agent (broxyquinoline). Of them, hexachlorophene was the most potent, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.3 ± 0.3 μM (RNA load) and 2.6 ± 0.14 μM (plaque reduction) and the highest selectivity index (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC
 <sub>50</sub>]/IC
 <sub>50</sub>, 18.7), which was lower than that of the other four antiviral drugs identified (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, the results indicated that hexachlorophene treatment interfered with SFTSV entry without affecting virus-host cell attachment to the cells and virus infectivity (Yuan et al., 
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). It was predicted that hexachlorophene would bind to the deep hydrophobic pocket between domains I and III of the SFTSV Gc glycoprotein and would interfere with cell membrane fusion.
