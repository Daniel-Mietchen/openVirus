<p>The efficacy of favipiravir 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> has been examined using animal models (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of favipiravir at a dose of 60 or 300 mg/kg/day for 5 days completely protected mice from death upon SFTSV infection, causing only a slight reduction in weight (Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). On the other hand, ~40% of the mice treated with ribavirin (i.p.) at a dose of 25 or 100 mg/kg/day lost body weight and died from SFTSV infection with reduction of the case fatality rate. All favipiravir-treated mice survived when the treatment was initiated on or earlier than 3 days post infection, whereas the mice treated at 4 and 5 days post infection exhibited 83% and 50% survival, respectively (Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). These results demonstrated that favipiravir would be potentially effective for prophylactic use and also for treating of SFTSV infections.
