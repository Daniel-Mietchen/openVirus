<p>Another study reported that two patients, in whom plasma exchange and ribavirin treatment were initiated early, recovered from rapidly progressing SFTS (Oh et al., 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In these patients, the platelet counts began to gradually recover after initiating ribavirin treatment. Furthermore, according to a large-scale epidemiological study in China including 2096 patients with laboratory-confirmed SFTS between 2011 and 2017, ribavirin therapy was effective in reducing the case fatality rate from 6.25% (15/240 patients) to 1.16% (2/173 patients) in patients with viral loads of &lt;1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mL (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). However, no effect was observed among those with a viral load of &gt;1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mL.
