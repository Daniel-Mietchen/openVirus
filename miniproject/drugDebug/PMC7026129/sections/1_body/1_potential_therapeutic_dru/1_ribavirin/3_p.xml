<p>Shimojima et al. (
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) investigated the improvement in efficacy when ribavirin was used in combination with IFNs. All IFNs showed dose-dependent inhibitory effects when used alone. The IC
 <sub>90</sub> of IFNα, IFNβ, and IFNγ was 29 U/ml, 24 U/ml, and 12 ng/ml, respectively, and that of ribavirin was 43 μg/mL (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). When IFNs were combined with ribavirin at IC
 <sub>90</sub>, significant inhibitory effects were observed, with reductions of &gt;3 log
 <sub>10</sub> in viral titers. This study suggested that the combination of ribavirin with IFNs or other agents that function via different mechanisms might be useful in treating patients with SFTS. Ribavirin has shown a limited protective effect in lethal SFTSV challenges in animal experiments (Tani et al., 
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Gowen et al., 
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The Chinese Ministry of Health initially approved the use of ribavirin to treat SFTS based on the results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (Ministry of Health People's Republic of China, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). However, a clinical study in China showed that the case fatality rate was similar between patients who received ribavirin and those who did not (Liu et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). This study included 311 patients, of whom 54 died; in those who received ribavirin therapy, the platelet counts did not increase and the viral loads did not decrease in comparison with those who did not receive the therapy. Furthermore, although the differences were not statistically significant, it was unexpectedly observed that the patients who received ribavirin therapy had lower platelet counts than those who did not.
