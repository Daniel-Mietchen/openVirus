<p>Smee et al. (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>) has shown the antiviral activity of 2′-FdC against various bunyaviruses, such as La Crosse virus, Maporal virus, Punta Toro virus, Rift Valley fever virus, San Angelo virus, Heartland virus, and SFTSV. The IC
 <sub>90</sub> of 2′-FdC against SFTSV was 3.7 μM in an

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This value was much lower than that of ribavirin (49.7 μM) in the same study and favipiravir (22 μM) in the study conducted by Tani et al. (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In an 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> study using IFNAR
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, a 100 mg/kg/day treatment with 2′-FdC was 100% protective against death caused by SFTSV (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). However, all the mice treated with 2′-FdC experienced substantial weight loss after SFTSV inoculation, whereas the favipiravir-treated mice displayed very little weight loss, suggesting that favipiravir was more effective than 2′-FdC in controlling morbidity during the infection (Smee et al., 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). It was also found that treatments with 100 mg/kg/day of either 2′-FdC or favipiravir significantly reduced the viral titers in the serum. Furthermore, there was a slight discrepancy both in the survival rates and virus titers between mice treated with 100 mg/kg/day of 2′-FdC and those with 200 mg/kg/day of 2′-FdC. The survival rate was 80 vs. 100% for 200- and 100-mg/kg/day treatments, respectively; and the virus titer in the serum of 200 mg/kg/day-treated mice was higher than that of mice receiving the 100-mg/kg/day treatment. It was speculated that this was caused by the limited sample size (
