<p>Screening a library of 700 FDA-approved drugs identified the CCBs benidipine hydrochloride and nifedipine as inhibitors of SFTSV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> by impairing virus internalization and reducing genome replication during the post-entry phase (Li et al., 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). This mechanism did not affect viral binding, fusion, and budding. The results of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study suggested that treatment with benidipine hydrochloride or nifedipine inhibited SFTSV replication by reducing virus induced Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> influx. The anti-SFTSV effect of these two CCBs was further analyzed in C57BL/6 mice and humanized mouse models (
