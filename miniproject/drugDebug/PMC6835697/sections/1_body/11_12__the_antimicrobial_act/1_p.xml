<p>GRFT not only displays antiviral activity against HIV but also for other enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B11-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], HCV [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], HSV [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B64-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>], JEV [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and PEDV [
 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Even human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a non-enveloped virus, was inactivated by GRFT via a glycosylation-independent mechanism [
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. GRFT specifically bound to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and inhibited viral entry [
 <xref rid="B10-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. GRFT also inhibited particles pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV spike protein from entering host cells [
 <xref rid="B11-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Preincubation of HCV particles with GRFT prevented infection of Huh-7 hepatoma cells [
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Furthermore, GRFT was able to interfere with the direct cell-to-cell transmission of HCV [
 <xref rid="B13-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This anti-HCV activity was further demonstrated in vivo when HCV infection was mitigated in chimeric mice [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In this report, GRFT was readily bioavailable after subcutaneous injection, and it showed significant in vivo efficacy by reducing HCV viral titers in a mouse model system with engrafted human hepatocytes [
 <xref rid="B12-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In contrast to HIV, HCV resistance to GRFT was not directly conferred by mutations in the envelope protein genes, but it could occur through an indirect mechanism involving mutations in other viral proteins [
 <xref rid="B65-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. GRFT displayed modest inhibitory activity against HSV-2 if it was present during viral entry, but if it was present post-entry, it completely blocked plaque formation, reduced plaque size, and prevented cell-to-cell propagation [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. These in vitro findings translated into significant protection against genital herpes in mice treated with a 0.1% griffithsin gel [
 <xref rid="B14-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The in vivo anti-HSV activity of GRFT was further demonstrated when murine model test subjects were protected by 
 <italic>C. crescentus</italic> expressing GRFT after intravaginal infection with HSV-2 [
 <xref rid="B64-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Levendosky et al. explored the antiviral properties of a combination product composed of GRFT and CG against HSV-2 and HPV. They found that GRFT was able to block the entry of HSV-2 and HPV into target cells but not the adsorption of HSV-2 and HPV onto target cells [
 <xref rid="B15-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This GRFT/CG combination was also tested as a freeze-dried, FDI formulation. This product protected rhesus macaques against a high-dose vaginal simian HIV challenge 4 h after FDI insertion [
 <xref rid="B66-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Furthermore, this GRFT/CG FDI also protected mice, vaginally, against HSV-2 and HPV pseudovirus [
 <xref rid="B66-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. In vitro experiments showed that the treatment of JEV with GRFT before inoculation into BHK- 21 cells inhibited infection in a dose-dependent manner [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In vivo experiments showed that GRFT (5 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally before virus infection prevented mortality in mice challenged intraperitoneally with a lethal dose of JEV [
 <xref rid="B17-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. With regard to its antiviral mechanism, GRFT was shown to bind to JEV glycosylated viral proteins, specifically the enveloped and pre-mature glycoproteins [
 <xref rid="B16-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. In addition, GRFT was able to reduce PEDV infection in Vero cells [
 <xref rid="B18-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].
