<p>Four studies have described the combination effects of GRFT with either current anti-HIV drugs or potential therapeutics under development (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. GRFT showed synergistic antiviral activity with tenofovir, maraviroc (a CCR5 antagonist), and enfuvirtide (a gp41 fusion peptide inhibitor) [
 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The different glycosylation patterns on the viral envelope of clade B and clade C gp120 had no observable effect on their synergistic antiviral action [
 <xref rid="B29-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Covalently linking GRFT to the gp41-binding peptide C37 also exhibited a potency several-fold greater than that of GRFT alone in inhibiting HIV Env-mediated fusion in a CCR5-tropic cell-cell fusion assay [
 <xref rid="B32-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In line with this observation, all GRFT/antiretroviral drug (entry inhibitors, reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, and protease inhibitors) combinations displayed either synergistic or additive effects in inhibiting cell–cell fusion and protected against target CD4+ T cell destruction [
 <xref rid="B33-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. GRFT/antiretroviral combinations also potently inhibited short-term viral replication in T-cells via DC-SIGN-mediated transmission [
 <xref rid="B33-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Combinations of GRFT and other carbohydrate-binding agents (CBAs) including 
 <italic>Hippeastrum</italic> hybrid agglutinin, 
 <italic>Galanthus nivalis</italic> agglutinin, a mannose-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) (2G12), microvirin, and banana lectin also showed synergistic activity against HIV-1, HIV-2, and even against certain CBA-resistant HIV-1 strains [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. None of the CBAs competed with each other’s glycan-binding sites on gp120 since they have distinct binding patterns on the gp120 envelope [
 <xref rid="B28-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition to antiviral synergy, gp120-GRFT complexes showed higher immunogenicity than the individual proteins per se. This suggests that removing the mannose moieties on monomeric gp120 improves the humoral immune response to this protein [
