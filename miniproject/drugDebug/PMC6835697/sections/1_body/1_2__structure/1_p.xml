<p>GRFT is a carbohydrate-binding protein made of 121 amino acids and is 12.7 kDa in size [
 <xref rid="B9-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. It has a unique amino acid residue at position 31 which does not match any of the 20 standard amino acids [
 <xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-f001">Figure 1</xref>). It was initially isolated from an aqueous extract of the red algae 
 <italic>Griffithsia</italic> sp. collected from waters off the shores of New Zealand. Researchers at the U.S. National Cancer Institute first reported its potent cytoprotective activity against HIV-1 in T-lymphoblastoid cells [
 <xref rid="B5-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Five research papers reported structural results on GRFT by using either X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques (
 <xref rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In terms of structural classification, GRFT is a Jacalin-related lectin harboring three repeats of an antiparallel four-stranded β-sheet with a triangular prism shape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="marinedrugs-17-00567-f002">Figure 2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is called a domain-swapped dimer because two β-strands from one protein forming the dimer display domain-exchanging properties with the same two β-strands of its counterpart [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has three identical carbohydrate-binding sites (located within residues 20–34, 58–76, and 96–120) on each monomer with three conserved glycine-rich repeats (GGSGG) [
 <xref rid="B19-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It is estimated that as many as 11 high-mannose oligosaccharides are present on one HIV-1 gp120 protein. Therefore, GRFT’s multivalent interactions with gp120 via these three carbohydrate-binding domains seem to be essential for its high-affinity and anti-HIV-1 potency at low concentrations (picomolar range) [
 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In particular, three aspartate residues in these carbohydrate-binding sites (Asp30, Asp70, and Asp112) play a critical role in the interaction of GRFT with high-mannose type oligosaccharides such as Man9GlcNAc2, which is composed of nine mannose molecules and two 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamines [
 <xref rid="B22-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This was supported by a study demonstrating that GRFT point mutations (D30A, D70A, or D112A) partially inhibit its ability to bind to gp120, and a GRFT mutant with all three mutations loses almost all of its binding capacity [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, tyrosine residues such as Tyr28, Tyr68, and Tyr110 are necessary for GRFT to bind to carbohydrates [
 <xref rid="B24-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, the apparent disparity between the gp120-binding ability and HIV-1 inhibitory potency for these GRFT variants indicates the existence of another antiviral mechanism beyond simple gp120-GRFT binding [
 <xref rid="B21-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. With regard to carbohydrate-binding specificity, all six GRFT dimer carbohydrate-binding sites can be occupied by mannose, glucose, 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetyl glucosamine, and 1-6 α-mannobiose with similar affinities [
 <xref rid="B23-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To determine whether GRFT must form a dimer to exert its antiviral activity, a monomeric form of GRFT (mGRFT) was created by inserting either two or four amino acids at its dimerization interface. mGRFT possesses greatly reduced antiviral activity against HIV-1 in spite of its comparable association with high-mannose oligosaccharides, since mGRFT possesses all three carbohydrate-binding sites [
 <xref rid="B20-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This suggests that the intact dimeric form of GRFT is required to efficiently disrupt HIV-1 infectivity [
