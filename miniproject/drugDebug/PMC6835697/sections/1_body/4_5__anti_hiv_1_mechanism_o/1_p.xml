<p>Six different antiviral mechanisms of action against HIV-1 by GRFT have been proposed (

 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,

 <xref rid="B37-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. A carbohydrate binding-dependent antiviral mechanism of GRFT was explored by using HIV-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as 2G12, 48d, b12, and b6 [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. GRFT preferentially inhibited gp120 from binding to the 2G12 mAb, which targets N-linked glycans at positions 332, 339, and 392 on gp120. This suggests an overlapping binding specificity with the 2G12 mAb [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In addition, GRFT increased the interaction between gp120 and the 48d mAb, which recognizes a CD4-induced epitope [
 <xref rid="B25-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GRFT also enhanced the binding of HIV-1 to plates coated with b12 and b6 mAbs [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This indicates that the binding of GRFT to gp120 triggers the exposure of the CD4-binding site on gp120. In particular, the glycan at position 386, which shields the CD4 binding domain of gp120, is also involved in the GRFT-mediated binding enhancements and the neutralization synergy between GRFT and b12 [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. In addition, a synergy between GRFT and b12 was also exhibited when HIV-1 isolates became more sensitive to neutralization upon increasing HIV-1 binding of GRFT to b12 and b6 mAbs [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Together, these data suggest that GRFT-mediated blockage of a post-CD4 receptor binding event, such as the coreceptor binding with gp120, might be another plausible mechanism through which GRFT inhibits HIV-1 infection [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Since the glycans on HIV-1 gp120 play an important role in shielding neutralization-sensitive epitopes from antibody recognition [
 <xref rid="B26-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], disruption of the mannose molecules on gp120 by GRFT may also increase antibody-dependent neutralization of HIV-1 particles.
