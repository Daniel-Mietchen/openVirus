<p>Due to its novel carbohydrate-targeting antiviral mechanism of action, superior anti-HIV-1 efficacy, excellent host toxicity profile, synergistic interaction with other antiretroviral drugs, optimized large-scale production methodology, and various formulation methods for its efficient delivery, GRFT holds great promise as the first topical protein-based anti-HIV pre-exposure prophylactic. Even though a potentially adverse immunotoxicity issue observed during preclinical animal studies needs to be resolved, its broad antiviral spectrum, which is applicable to other enveloped viruses, could make GRFT the first universal antiviral therapeutic that can specifically target virus carbohydrates. Favorable outcomes from two ongoing phase-one clinical trials will accelerate the drug development process. If approved, GRFT will provide a superior way to prevent many transmissible viral infections.</p>
