<p>Serious endeavors to develop antiviral therapeutics and vaccines against HIV began during the epidemics of the early 1980s. HIV infection was linked with the development of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). With no effective antiviral drugs available during that time, a diagnosis of HIV infection was a death sentence for most patients [

However, the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) improved patient outcomes, rendering AIDS as a clinically manageable disease. However, a lack of preventive measures such as an HIV vaccine has hindered efforts to decrease the number of new HIV cases per year. Particularly, young women who live in resource-poor and HIV-endemic regions such as sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="B7-marinedrugs-17-00567" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] have been the most vulnerable population to new HIV infections since they do not have the freedom to control sexual situations or use protective devices. Individuals who practice unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) are also responsible for the ongoing spread of new HIV infections because of a high preponderance of HIV target cells in the traumatized rectal mucosal area [

To that end, topical anti-HIV microbicides such as creams, gels, or intravaginal rings could be promising, with on-demand pre-exposure prophylactic options not only for vulnerable populations but also for the general public.
