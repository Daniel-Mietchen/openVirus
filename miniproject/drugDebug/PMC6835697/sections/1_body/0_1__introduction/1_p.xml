<p>Every virus starts its life cycle by entering a susceptible host cell. The host cell-targeting ability of a virus is mainly determined by the presence of appropriate host cell receptors which are engaged by a virus. For successful host cell entry, enveloped viruses have evolved a diverse array of envelope glycoproteins on their membrane with different receptor association capabilities. The best-characterized example of this viral glycoprotein–host cell receptor relationship might be the interaction between the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) glycoprotein gp120 and the human T lymphocyte CD4 molecule. Due to its essential role in the overall virus life cycle, viral entry has been an attractive target for both vaccine and antiviral drug development with the goal of disrupting the binding of viral glycoproteins to host cell receptors. In addition, heavy and unique glycosylation patterns found only on viral glycoproteins provide another level of virus specificity, which could increase the selectivity of virus-targeting therapeutics and prophylactics. In this regard, the use of carbohydrate-binding proteins, collectively called “lectins”, has been explored as a new therapeutic antiviral strategy. Recently discovered virus-targeting lectins include banana lectin [
