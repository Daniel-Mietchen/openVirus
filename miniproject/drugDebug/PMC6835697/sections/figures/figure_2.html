 <caption> The crystal structure of a GRFT dimer with six mannoses at a resolution of 1.78 Ã… [ 19]. Each GRFT monomer is presented in either red or blue. Six bound mannose molecules are shown with ball and stick models. This image was created with PDB ID and associated publication, NGL Viewer (AS Rose et al. (2018) NGL viewer: web-based molecular graphics for large complexes. Bioinformatics doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/bty419), and RCSB PDB. </caption>
