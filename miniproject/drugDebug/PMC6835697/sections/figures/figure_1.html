 <caption> The amino acid sequence of griffithsin (GRFT). Corresponding secondary β-sheet structures are marked with yellow arrows based on the crystal structure of a GRFT dimer with mannose at a resolution of 1.78 Å [ 19]. Tyrosine and aspartate residues in three carbohydrate-binding domains, which are essential for mannose-binding, are noted with blue and orange arrows, respectively. Wild-type GRFT has a non-standard amino acid at position 31, but it is replaced by alanine (colored in red) in recombinant GRFT. The sequence display was generated by the RCSB protein data bank website ( www.rcsb.org). </caption>
