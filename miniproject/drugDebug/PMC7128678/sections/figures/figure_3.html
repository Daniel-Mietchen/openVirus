 <caption> Molecular modelling of hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH) interaction with sialic acids. (a,b) Surface representation of CLQ-OH bound to N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-SIA). Two opposite views of the complex are shown. Note the geometric complementarity between CLQ-OH (in blue) and 9-O-SIA (in red). (c,d) Molecular mechanism of CLQ-OH binding to 9-O-SIA: combination of electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonding. </caption>
