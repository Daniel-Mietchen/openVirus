 <caption> Molecular complex between the N-terminal domain (NTD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and a single GM1 ganglioside. The NTD is represented in ribbons superposed with a transparent surface rendering (light green). Two symmetric views of the complex are shown (a,b). The amino acid residues Q-134 to D-138 located in the centre of the ganglioside-binding domain are represented as green spheres. The saccharide part of the ganglioside forms a landing surface for the tip of the NTD. </caption>
