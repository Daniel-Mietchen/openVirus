<p id="para0009">N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) was generated with the Hyperchem database. 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-SIA) was retrieved from pdb file 6Q06 
 <xref rid="bib0018" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. CLQ is N-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-N,N-di√©thyl-pentane-1,4-diamine. Its three-dimensioanl structure was retrieved from pdb file # 4V2O 
 <xref rid="bib0019" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. CLQ-OH is (RS)-2-[{4-[(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)amino]pentyl}(ethyl)amino]ethanol. CLQ-OH was generated by hydroxylation of CLQ with Hyperchem. Both CLQ and CLQ-OH were energy-minimized and merged with water molecules as described below.
