<p id="para0024">Sialic acids linked to glycoproteins and gangliosides are used by a broad range of viruses as receptors and/or attachment factors for cell entry 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. These viruses include major human pathogens affecting the respiratory tract, such as influenza 
 <xref rid="bib0021" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and coronaviruses 
 <xref rid="bib0022" ref-type="bibr">[22</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0023" ref-type="bibr">23]</xref>. The attachment to sialic-acid-containing cell surface structures is mediated by receptor-binding proteins that belong to the viral spike. In the case of coronaviruses, this function is fulfilled by the S glycoprotein

 <xref rid="bib0024" ref-type="bibr">24]</xref>. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 interact with the ACE-2 protein, which has been identified as a key determinant of the contagiousness of viruses 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, considering the increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 compared with SARS-CoV, binding to ACE-2 alone might not be enough to ensure robust infection of the upper respiratory tract. Thus, it is likely that SARS-CoV-2 might also bind to other cell surface attachment factors, such as sialic-acid-containing glycoproteins and gangliosides. Consistent with this notion, it has been shown that depletion of cell surface sialic acids by neuraminidase treatment inhibited MERS-CoV entry of human airway cells 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. These data, which provide direct evidence that sialic acids play a critical role in human coronavirus attachment, broaden the therapeutic options to block the replication of SARS-CoV-2 that is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
