<p id="para0027">A major outcome of this study is the demonstration that CLQ and CLQ-OH display molecular groups that fully mimic the way in which the S protein binds to gangliosides. Two CLQ (or two CLQ-OH) molecules can bind simultaneously to the polar head group of ganglioside GM1. Interestingly, these simulations indicated that CLQ-OH is more potent than CLQ, in line with the reported increased antiviral activity of CLQ-OH against SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. Once bound to GM1, the drugs prevent any access to the Glc and GalNAc units of the ganglioside, which are the critical binding residues for Phe-135 and Asn-137, respectively. This amino acid dyad, as well as all the other residues that mediate ganglioside binding by the SARS-CoV-2 spike, is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide. It is also conserved in the bat RaTG13 isolate, which reinforces the hypothesis of bat-to-human transmission. From an epidemiological point of view, it can be hypothesized that the evolution of this motif has conferred an enhanced attachment capacity of human coronaviruses to the respiratory tract through improved Sâ€“ganglioside interactions.
