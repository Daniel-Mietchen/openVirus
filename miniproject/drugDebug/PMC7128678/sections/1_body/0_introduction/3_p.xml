<p id="para0007">One important characteristic of human coronaviruses is that besides their protein membrane receptor, they also depend upon sialic-acid-containing glycoproteins and gangliosides that act as primary attachment factors along the respiratory tract 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The present study used a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> to investigate the potential interaction between CLQ and sialic acids. A ganglioside-binding site in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the spike (S) glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 was identified, and CLQ was shown to be a potential blocker of the Sâ€“ganglioside interaction which occurs in the first step of the viral replication cycle (i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the S protein). In addition, the antiviral potential of CLQ and its derivative hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH) against SARS-CoV-2 were compared. Overall, this study found that CLQ and CLQ-OH may be used to fight pathogenic human coronaviruses
