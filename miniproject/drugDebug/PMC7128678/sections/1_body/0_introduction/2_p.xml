<p id="para0006">The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a global pandemic 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, and there is an urgent need to identify active antiviral agents. Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay 
 <xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr">[2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">3]</xref>. Several drugs have already been tested, among which chloroquine (CLQ), a well-known antimalarial drug, is one of the most promising as it has shown apparent efficacy in the treatment of COVID-19-associated pneumonia in recent clinical studies 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, the mechanism of action of CLQ against SARS-CoV-2 is unclear as the drug seems to exert a broad range of potential antiviral effects 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Therefore, although CLQ is classically considered as an inhibitor of endocytic pathways through elevation of endosomal pH 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, its detailed molecular mechanism of action as an antiviral compound remains unclear 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">5]</xref>. Interestingly, CLQ has been shown to interfere with the terminal glycosylation of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, which acts as a plasma membrane receptor for both SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, and CLQ could act at several steps of the coronavirus replication cycle 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. These data suggest the interesting and mostly unexplored possibility that CLQ could prevent viral attachment through a direct effect on host cell surface molecules.
