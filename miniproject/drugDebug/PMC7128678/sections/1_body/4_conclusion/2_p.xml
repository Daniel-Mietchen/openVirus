However, a considerable amount of time could be saved by in-silico testing to determine the capability of any potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 to disrupt the interaction of the S protein with the host cell membrane. Applied to both RBD–ACE-2 and NTD–ganglioside interactions, this molecular modelling method will help select those drugs that are likely to interfere with the initial attachment of virus particles to the respiratory tract surface epithelium. The study data support the use of CLQ, and preferentially CLQ-OH, as initial therapy for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
