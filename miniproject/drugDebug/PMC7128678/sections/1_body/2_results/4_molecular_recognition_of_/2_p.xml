<p id="para0014">In the respiratory tract, sialic acids are usually part of glycoproteins and gangliosides. Molecular modelling approaches were used to assess whether CLQ and CLQ-OH can recognize sialic acid units in their natural molecular environment. In these simulations, ganglioside GM1 was chosen as a representative example of human plasma membrane gangliosides. A first series of simulations was performed with CLQ. When merged with the ganglioside, CLQ had two distinct binding sites, both located in the polar saccharide part of GM1. The first site was located at the tip of the saccharide moiety of the ganglioside

 <sup>−1</sup>. CLQ retained the typical L-shape structure of the water-soluble conformer bound to isolated sialic acids [compare 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Figs 2</xref>(c) and 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>(a)]. From a mechanistic point of view, the carboxylate group of the sialic acid of GM1 was oriented towards the cationic groups of CLQ. The rings of CLQ faced the N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residue of GM1, establishing both OH-π interaction and hydrogen bonding

 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(c). The chlorine atom of CLQ was oriented towards the ceramide axis, allowing the nitrogen-containing ring of CLQ to stack on to the pyrane ring of the first sugar residue [i.e. glucose (Glc)]. The perfect geometric complementarity of the two partners 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(c,d) accounted for a particularly high energy of interaction in this case (-61 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>). Interestingly, there was no overlap between the two CLQ-binding sites on GM1, so the ganglioside could accommodate two CLQ molecules 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(e), reaching a global energy of interaction of -108 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. A similar situation was observed with CLQ-OH, which occupies the same binding site as CLQ 
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(f). In this case, the energy of interaction was further increased by stabilizing contacts established between the two CLQ-OH molecules, reaching -120 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. Overall, these data showed that CLQ and CLQ-OH have a good fit for sialic acids, either isolated or bound to gangliosides.
