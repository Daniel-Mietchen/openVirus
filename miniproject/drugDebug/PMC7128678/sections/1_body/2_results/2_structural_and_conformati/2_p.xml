<p id="para0010">The chemical structures of CLQ and CLQ-OH are shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> (a,b). The only difference between the two molecules is the presence of a terminal hydroxyl group in CLQ-OH. This OH group has a marked influence on the conformation and water-solubilization properties of the drug. CLQ-OH may adopt a wide range of conformations, the most stable being the extended one shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(c). When immersed in a periodic box of 31.5 Å
 <sup>2</sup> with 1042 water molecules, the system reached, at equilibrium, an estimated energy of interaction of -92 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, accounting for 56 water molecules solvating CLQ-OH 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(d). In contrast, due to an intramolecular hydrophobic effect, CLQ appeared to be more condensed than CLQ-OH 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>(e). At equilibrium, CLQ was surrounded by 58 water molecules with an energy of interaction of -79 kJ.mol
