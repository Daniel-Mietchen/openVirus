<p id="para0017">The amino acid sequence of the planar interfacial surface located at the tip of the NTD was analysed for the presence of consensus ganglioside-binding domains 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These motifs are constituted by a triad of mandatory amino acid residues such as (K,R)-X
 <sub>n</sub>-(F,Y,W)-X
 <sub>n</sub>-(K,R). The X
 <sub>n</sub> intercalating segments, usually four to five residues, may contain any amino acid, but often Gly, Pro and/or Ser residues. The strict application of this algorithm did not allow the detection of any potential ganglioside-binding domain in this region of the NTD. However, an intriguing over-representation of aromatic and basic residues was found in the 129â€“158 segment: 129-
 <underline>K</underline>VCE
 <underline>F</underline>Q
 <underline>F</underline>CNDP
 <underline>F</underline>LGV
 <underline>YY</underline>H
 <underline>K</underline>NN
 <underline>K</underline>S
 <underline>W</underline>MESE
 <underline>FR</underline>-158. This 30-amino acid stretch also contains Gly, Pro and/or Ser residues that are often found in ganglioside-binding motifs. These observations supported the notion that the tip of the NTD could display a large ganglioside-attachment interface.
