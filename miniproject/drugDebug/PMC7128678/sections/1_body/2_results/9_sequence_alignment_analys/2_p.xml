<p id="para0022">As CLQ and CLQ-OH are potential therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is important to check whether the amino acid residues identified as critical for ganglioside binding are conserved among clinical isolates. The alignment of the 111–162 domain of 11 clinical isolates of SARS-CoV-2 from various geographic origins (including Asia and USA) is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref> . In this region, which contains the ganglioside-binding domain identified in the present report, all amino acids are fully conserved. Interestingly, the motif is built like a giant consensus ganglioside-binding domain: a central region displaying the critical aromatic residue (Phe-135) and a basic residue at each end (Lys-113 and Arg-158). In the middle of each stretch separating this typical triad, there is a N-glycosylation site (Asn-122 and Asn-149). These last regions are not directly involved in ganglioside binding, so the oligosaccharide linked to these asparagine residues could be perfectly intercalated between the sugar head group of gangliosides.
