<p id="para0012">Neu5Ac is the predominant sialic acid found in human glycoproteins and gangliosides. When CLQ was merged with Neu5Ac, a quasi-instantaneous fit occurred between the two molecules, whose global shapes in water are geometrically complementary 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> (a). This is particularly obvious in the views of the CLQ–Neu5Ac complex in mixed surface/balls and sticks rendition 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(a,b). The interaction was driven by the positioning of the negative charge of the carboxylate group of Neu5Ac and one of the two cationic charges of CLQ (pKa 10.2) 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(c). The energy of interaction of this complex was estimated to be -47 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. As coronaviruses preferentially interact with 9-O-acetyl-N-acetylneuraminic acid (9-O-SIA) 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, this study used a similar molecular modelling approach to assess whether CLQ could also interact with this specific sialic acid. A good fit between CLQ and 9-O-SIA was obtained 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(d–f), with an energy of interaction of -45 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. In this case, the carboxylate group of the sialic acid interacted with the cationic group of the nitrogen-containing ring of CLQ (pKa 8.1) 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(d). The complex was further stabilized by OH-π and van der Waals interactions.
