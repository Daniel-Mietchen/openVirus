<p id="para0013">Next, CLQ-OH was tested to assess whether it could, as CLQ, bind to 9-O-SIA (
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). The complex obtained with CLQ-OH was very similar to that obtained with CLQ [compare 
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(a,b) with 
 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>(e,f), although several conformational adjustments occurred during the simulations. Interestingly, the OH group of CLQ-OH reinforced the binding of CLQ to sialic acid through establishment of a hydrogen bond 
 <xref rid="fig0003" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>(c,d). Overall, this hydrogen bond compensated for the slight loss of energy caused by the conformational rearrangement, and the energy of interaction of the complex was estimated to be -46 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>, which is very close to the value obtained for CLQ (-45 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>).
