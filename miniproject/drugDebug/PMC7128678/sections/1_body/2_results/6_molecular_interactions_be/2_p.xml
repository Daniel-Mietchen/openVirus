 <xref rid="fig0006" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> , the large flat area of this structural domain fitted very well with the protruding oligosaccharide part of the ganglioside. Several amino acid residues appear to be critical for this interaction, especially Phe-135, Asn-137 and Arg-158 (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Overall, the complex involved 10 amino acid residues for a total energy of interaction of -100 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. At this stage, it was observed that approximately 50% of the interface was involved in the complex, leaving the remaining 50% available for interaction with a second GM1 molecule. As expected, merging a second GM1 molecule with the preformed GM1–NTD complex led to a trimolecular complex consisting of two gangliosides in a typical symmetrical chalice-like structure into which the NTD could insert its interfacial ganglioside-binding domain (
 <xref rid="fig0007" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> ). The formation of this trimolecular complex was progressive, starting with a conformational rearrangement of the first ganglioside–NTD complex triggered by the second GM1 molecule. The energy of interaction of the new complex was consistently increased by 37%, reaching an estimated value of -137 kJ.mol
 <sup>−1</sup>. At this stage, attachment of the NTD to the ganglioside-rich microdomain involved the whole interface (i.e. 15 surface-accessible residues from Asp-111 to Ser-162). The critical residues were Asp-111, Gln-134, Phe-135, Arg-158 and Ser-161 (
