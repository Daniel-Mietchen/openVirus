<p id="par0035">On the basis of phylogenic analyses, evolutionary studies have shown that SARS-CoV originated most likely from bats. It has been reported to be transmitted to humans by aerosols through intermediate hosts like palm civets infected by the virus [

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, the zoonosis of CoV is a threat, due to its ability of interspecies transfer into human population. This has been recapitulated with the novel MERS-CoV, as recent studies have suggested that bats and dromedary camels serve as a reservoir for this virus [
