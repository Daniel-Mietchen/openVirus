<p id="par0080">The surface glycoprotein of SARS-CoV, SARS-S, has two constituents: S1, which comprises the receptor binding domain (RBD), and S2, which comprises the fusion peptide. SARS-CoV gains entry into permissive cells through interactions of the SARS-S RBD with the cell surface receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (
