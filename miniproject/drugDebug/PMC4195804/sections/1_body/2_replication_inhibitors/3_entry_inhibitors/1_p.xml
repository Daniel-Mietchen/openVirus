<p id="par0075">Viral entry is an essential step of the virus replication cycle that can be targeted for therapy [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Entry inhibitors of several viruses have been identified. Examples include: RFI 641 and VP-14637, which are small molecules that inhibit the entry of respiratory syncytial virus by binding at a hydrophobic pocket of the fusion (F) glycoprotein [
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]; some inhibitors have been reported to block HIV entry by using different strategies. Maraviroc is an entry inhibitor of HIV that targets CCR5, a host protein used as a coreceptor during HIV entry [

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Enfuvirtide and SC29EK are peptides that can also block viral entry by binding to the viral transmembrane protein gp41 and blocking the final stage of fusion with the target cell [

 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. A few monoclonal antibodies are currently in clinical trials, and they include KD-247 and PRO140. They prevent HIV entry by binding either the viral surface glycoprotein gp120 [
