<p id="par0085">The possible targets for SARS viral entry, thus, include cathepsin L, ACE2–SARS-S1 interaction and S2-cell membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). A number of studies have identified some inhibitors that interfere with these targets. Dipeptide epoxyketones, calpain inhibitor III, oxocarbazate, MDL28170 and SSAA09E1 are all cathepsin L inhibitors (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>) [
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">67••</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>,

 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">76••</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77••</xref>]. Although the first four compounds are peptidomimetic in nature (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>a–c), SSAA09E1 (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>d) is a small molecule cathepsin L inhibitor that is likely to have improved bioavailability over others. These compounds have been shown to inhibit SARS viral entry by hindering the ability of cathepsin L to cleave S1 from S2, thereby preventing the fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane, following endocytosis. Other SARS viral entry inhibitors include SSAA09E2 (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>e), SSAA09E3 (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>f), and NAAE (N-(2-aminoethyl)-l-aziridine-ethanamine), all of which are small molecule compounds. SSAA09E3 [

  <sup>••</sup>
 </xref>] prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). SSAA09E2 [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77
  <sup>••</sup>
 </xref>] and NAAE [
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] act by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). NAAE is a unique small molecule entry inhibitor in that, it inhibits both ACE2 catalytic activity and S-protein-induced cell-cell fusion [
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Although dual inhibitory effects on ACE2 catalytic activity and SARS-CoV binding is not expected, because the catalytic site of ACE2 is distinct from the S-protein-binding domain [
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">79••</xref>], NAAE did show antiviral activity. Overexpression of ACE has been shown to cause hypertension, which is counterbalanced by ACE2 (through vasodilation) [
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Hence, inhibition of ACE2 by NAAE stands as a potential risk for hypertension.
