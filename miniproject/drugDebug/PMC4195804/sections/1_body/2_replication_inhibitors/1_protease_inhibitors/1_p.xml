<p id="par0045">The first coronavirus proteins that have been studied in detail include viral proteinases, namely the papain-like protease (PLP) or nsp3 and the 3C-like protease (3CLP, nsp5 or Mpro), which cleave the polyprotein into individual polypeptides that are required for replication and transcription [
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Following the translation of the messenger RNA to yield the polyproteins, the 3CLP is first auto-cleaved from the polyproteins to become a mature enzyme. The 3CLP further cleaves all the 11 remaining downstream non-structural proteins. Hence, 3CLP is an essential viral protein for the viral replication cycle, and as a result becomes an attractive target for anti-SARS drug development [

 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">21••</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. 3CLP inhibitors are among the first SARS-CoV inhibitors that were discovered by screening compound libraries using an assay that utilizes a fluorogenic peptide as the substrate and with structure-based design on the basis of the crystal structures of the product-bound form of 3CLP [
