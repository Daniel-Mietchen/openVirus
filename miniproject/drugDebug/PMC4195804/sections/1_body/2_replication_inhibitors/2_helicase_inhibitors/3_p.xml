 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Using biochemical analyses, the authors demonstrated that this compound, SSYA10-001 (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>d), is a noncompetitive inhibitor of nsp13 with respect to its major substrates, namely, nucleic acids and ATP. Since this compound did not inhibit nsp13's binding and hydrolysis of nucleic acids and ATP, coupled with the fact that it did not bind the nucleic acid substrate, the authors suggested that, SSYA10-001 may be inhibiting nsp13 unwinding activity by interfering with its conformational changes during the course of the reaction or translocation on the nucleic acid [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Moreover, SSYA10-001 was also shown to be an efficient inhibitor of viral replication in a SARS-CoV replicon and live viral assays. More recently, SSYA10-001 was shown to exhibit a broad-spectrum activity against other coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) [
