<p id="par0065">The helicase of SARS-CoV is called nsp13. A few potential inhibitors of nsp13 have been identified [
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Some of these inhibitors inhibit nsp13 by interfering with its unwinding and ATPase activities. They include the bananins and the 5-hydroxychromone derivatives [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The bananins are a class of antiviral compounds with an exclusive structural signature that incorporates a trioxa-adamantane moiety covalently bound to a pyridoxal derivative [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Six members of this class of compounds were synthesized by Tanner 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The compounds are bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, ansabananin, eubananin, and adeninobananin. Of the six compounds, bananin, iodobananin, vanillinbananin, and eubananin effectively inhibited the helicase activity of nsp13 by inhibiting the ATPase activity of the helicase with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the range 0.5–3 μM. Bananin was also shown to exhibit antiviral activity against SARS-CoV in a cell culture assay, with an EC50 of less than 10 μM [
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The structure of vanillinbananin is shown in 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>a. For the 5-hydroxychromone derivatives, 5-hydroxychromone was used as a scaffold on which two arylmethyloxy substituents were installed. The resulting derivatives include 5-hydroxy-6-(3-chlorobenzyloxy)-chromone with chloro-benzyloxy or iodo-benzyloxy substituents [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>b). These compounds, similar to the bananins, also inhibited the unwinding activities of SARS-CoV nsp13 by inhibiting the ATPase activity of the helicase at comparable EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of ∼10 μM [
 <xref rid="bib0215" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Although these compounds portend to be a promising therapy, the potential ability of these compounds to inhibit the ATPase activity of cellular ATPases or kinases may affect cellular activities, thereby creating a risk of cytotoxicity. A study reported that an aryl diketoacid compound (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>c) selectively inhibited the duplex DNA unwinding activity of SARS-CoV nsp13 without significantly inhibiting its ATPase activity [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the effects of this compound on nsp13's unwinding activity of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and the replication of SARS-CoV were not determined [
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].
