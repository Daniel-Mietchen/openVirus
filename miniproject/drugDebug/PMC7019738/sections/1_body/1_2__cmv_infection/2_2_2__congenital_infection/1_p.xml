<p>CMV is transmitted by close interpersonal contact such as saliva, semen, urine, breast milk, or vertically transmission which viruses pass the placenta and directly infect the fetus [

 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. CMV is the leading cause of congenital viral infection [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. CMV infection is mostly or mildly asymptomatic among the general population (85%–90%). However, around 10%–15% of infants with the congenital infection may be at risk of sequelae such as mental retardation, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, microcephaly, hearing impairment and thrombocytopenia [

 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Among the above sequelae, the most devastating one is the central nervous system (CNS) sequelae related to neurodevelopment in that CNS injury is irreversible and persists for life, including mental retardation, seizures, hearing loss, ocular abnormalities and cognitive impairment [

 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. That means the asymptomatic newborns with CMV infection still have an increased risk for long-term sequelaes, especially, mental retardation and sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) [
