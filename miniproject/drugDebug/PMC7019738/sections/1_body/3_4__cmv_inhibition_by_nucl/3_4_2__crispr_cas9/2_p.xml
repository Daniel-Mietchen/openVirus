<p>Gergen et al. designed two CRISPR/Cas9 systems which contain three sgRNAs to target the HCMV UL122/123 gene crucial for the regulation of lytic replication and reactivation from latency [

The singleplex strategy caused 50% of insertions and/or deletions (indels) in the viral genome to appear in further detailed analyses in U-251 MG cells, resulting in a reduction in immediately early protein production. The multiplex strategy cleaved the immediate early gene in 90% of viral genomes and thereby inhibited immediate early gene expression. Therefore, viral genome replication and late protein expression were reduced by 90%. The multiplex CRISPR/Cas9 system can target the HCMV UL122/123 gene efficiently and prevent viral replication significantly [
