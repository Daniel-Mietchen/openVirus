<p>van Diemen et al. observed that the clear depletion emerged in the anti-HCMV sgRNA expressing cells targeting essential genes UL57 and UL70 (1.3% and 4.6% mutants with frameshifts, respectively), compared with the sgRNAs targeting the nonessential genes US7 and US11 (83.5% and 85.8% mutants with frameshifts, respectively) [

The sequence complexity of the mutants selected upon UL57 and UL70 targeting was low, this suggested the selection of few suitable variants and subsequent expansion of infectious mutants need a lot of time. The results showed that the CRISPR/Cas9 is a promising strategy to restrict HCMV replication [
