<p>In CRISPR/Cas9 system, CRISPR is used to build RNA-guided genes drives to target a specific DNA sequence. By the Cas proteins and a specifically designed single-guiding RNA (sgRNA), the genome can be cut at most locations with only the limitation of a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence (NGG) existing in the target site [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. CRISPR/Cas9 has been extensively used as an effective technique of gene editing for engineering or modifying specific genes. It was shown to successfully work as an efficient genome editing tool in a wide range of organisms including HCMV [
