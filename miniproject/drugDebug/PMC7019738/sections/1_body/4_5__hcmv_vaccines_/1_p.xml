<p>The vaccines against HCMV are still being developed, no licensed vaccine is available so far. It is necessary to have a specific and strong antibody and cell-mediated immunity to confer protection against HCMV primary infection through the analysis of the immune response to HCMV. Many efforts have been made to produce an HCMV vaccine for years, but a successful vaccine candidate has not yet to be developed, probably due to what immune responses needed for protecting against HCMV infections are still poorly understood [
 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. To develop an effective HCMV vaccine, immune responses required to fight against HCMV and how to enhance these specific immune responses requires further study.
