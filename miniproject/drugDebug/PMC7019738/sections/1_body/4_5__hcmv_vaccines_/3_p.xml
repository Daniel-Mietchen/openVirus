<p>Liu et al. hypothesized that a vaccine candidate able to elicit immune responses analogous to those of HCMV-seropositive subjects may confer protection against congenital HCMV [
 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The V160 vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in HCMV-seronegative humans, inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. In this study, they further demonstrated that sera from V160-immunized HCMV-seronegative subjects had similar quality attributes to those from seropositive subjects, including high avidity antibodies to viral antigens. This vaccine is a promising candidate against HCMV, but further evaluation in clinics for the prevention of congenital HCMV is required to warrant its safety, efficiency, and effectiveness [
