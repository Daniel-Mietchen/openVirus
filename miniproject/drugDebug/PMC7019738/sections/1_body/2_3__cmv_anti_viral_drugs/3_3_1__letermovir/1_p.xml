<p>Letermovir is a novel antiviral drug which has been approved by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through a fast track procedure and granted as an orphan drug by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). The drug was tested in CMV infected patients and likely be useful for other patients who had organ transplantation or human immunodeficient virus (HIV) infections [

 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Letermovir has several advantages over conventional CMV antiviral agents as follows. Firstly, it can be given orally, so hospitalization and intravenous injection are not needed. Secondly, it is mild in toxicity, not related to myelotoxicity and nephrotoxicity [

 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Thirdly, it targets the CMV terminase complex instead of CMV DNA polymerase, so there is no risk to induce cross-resistance with existing anti-CMV drugs [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. However, the CMV antiviral therapy will finally fail and acquired antiviral drug resistance is not avoidable if there is no immune control [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It should be noted that more data are required to provide insights of the mutations detected in vivo, interpretation of genotyping results, and outcomes of the clinical correlation. To provide useful information, it would be recommended to establish databases for the surveillance and interpretation of resistance for CMV [
