<p>Faist et al. used the peptide specific proliferation assay (PSPA) to study CMV specific central memory T cells (TCM) repertoires and determined their functional and reproductive abilities in vitro [

In the animal model, the pathogen-specific TCM has demonstrated to have protective ability even at low numbers and could survive for long-term, proliferate extensively and show high plasticity after adoptive transfer. Though the clinical data showed that minimal doses of purified human CMV epitope-specific T cells are competent to remove viremia, it is still necessary to evaluate whether the human virus-specific TCM shows the same characteristic for ACT as mice. The results concluded that TCM had potential for prophylactic low-dose ACT. These good manufacturing practice (GMP)-compatible TCM could be used as a broad-spectrum antiviral T cell prophylaxis in allogeneic HSCT patients. In addition, PSPA would be a necessary tool for TCM characterization further during simultaneous immune monitoring [
