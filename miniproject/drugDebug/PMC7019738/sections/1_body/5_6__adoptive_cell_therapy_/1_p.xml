<p>It is known that the infection-related morbidity and mortality will be increased, if the T cell-mediated immune responses are impaired in transplantation recipients. Virus-specific T cells capable of targeting a variety of pathogens in patients after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have demonstrated potential efficacy for multiple viruses such as CMV, Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and adenovirus [
 <xref rid="B57-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Adoptive T cell therapy (ACT), a type of immunotherapy in which T cells are given to a patient to treat diseases, has been developed to fight against drug resistant and recurrent CMV in SOT recipients. Therefore, ACT has become one of the therapeutic strategies for CMV reactivations in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT and SOT.
