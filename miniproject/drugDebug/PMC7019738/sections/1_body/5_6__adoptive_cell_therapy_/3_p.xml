<p>Smith et al. applied high-throughput T cell receptor Vβ sequencing and T cell functional profiling to demonstrate the influence of ACT on T cell repertoire remodeling in the pretherapy immunity and ACT products [
 <xref rid="B59-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The clinical response was consistent with significant changes in the T cell receptor Vβ landscape after therapy. This reconstitution was related to the emergence of effector memory T cells in responding patients, while nonresponding patients showed dramatic pretherapy T cell expansions with minimal change following ACT. The results revealed that immunological modulation following ACT required significant repertoire remodeling which might be damaged in nonresponding patients on account of the preexisting immune environment. Immunological interventions which controlled this environment were likely to improve clinical outcomes. ACT appears to be an advantageous strategy to restore immunological control against CMV affecting immunosuppressed patients such as SOT recipients [
