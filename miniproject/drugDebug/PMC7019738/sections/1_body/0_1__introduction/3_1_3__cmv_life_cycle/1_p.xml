<p>CMV infection will start once a virion attaches a host cell with specific receptors on the cellular surface. For a lytic infection pathway, following linking of viral envelope glycoproteins to host cell membrane receptors, the virions enter the hosts by receptor-mediated endocytosis and membrane fusion. The viral capsid decomposes to release viral DNA genome to manipulates host enzyme systems to make new virions. During symptomatic infection, infected cells express lytic genes to demonstrate a lytic pathway [

In this pattern, viruses can persist in host cells indefinitely to have a latent infection pathway. The primary infection may be accompanied by limited illness and long-term latency is often asymptomatic. For the lysogenic pathway, the viruses are persistent in the host, not causing any adverse reactions, but can be transmitted to other hosts by direct contact. When CMV are stimulated by explanation or their host immune system is suppressed, the dormant viruses can reactivate to begin generating large number of viral progenies to cause symptoms and diseases, described as the lytic life cycle [
