<p>Viral latency can be divided into two models, namely proviral latency and episomal latency. CMV is defined as the episomal latency model which is essentially quiescent in myeloid progenitor cells. It can be reactivated by differentiation, inflammation, immunosuppression or critical diseases [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Latency is a specific phase in CMV life cycles in which virions stop producing posterior to infection, but the viral genome has not been entirely removed from host cells, that is, CMV latency is referred to as the absence of virions, despite the detection of viral DNA in hosts. In some clinical cases, the reactivation of latent infections is likely to lead to health risk. The molecular mechanisms by which latency is established and maintained have been explored. However, our understanding of the biology of CMV latency and reactivation at the molecular level would be significantly strengthened through analyses of both experimental and natural latency using systematic approaches [
