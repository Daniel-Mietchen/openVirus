<p>CMV structure mainly consist of DNA core, capsid, tegument and envelope from inside to outside. The genome is complexed helically to form a DNA core, which is enclosed in a capsid composed of a total of 162 capsomere protein subunits. The capsid with a diameter of 100 nm is surrounded by the tegument. The tegument is enclosed by a lipid bilayer envelope containing viral glycoproteins to give a final diameter of about 180 nm for mature infectious viral particles (virions) [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The tegument compartment contains most of the viral proteins, with the most abundant one being the lower matrix phosphoprotein 65 (pp65) which is also referred as unique long 83 (UL83). The function of the tegument proteins can be classified as follows: (1) proteins that play an important role for the assembly of virions during proliferation and the disassembly of the virions during entry (structural use) and (2) proteins that modulate the host cell responses for viral infection (non-structural use) [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The viral envelope surrounding the tegument contains more than 20 glycoproteins that are involved in the attachment and penetration of host cells. These structural proteins include glycoprotein B, H, L, M, N, and O. CMV productive infection results in the coordinated synthesis of proteins in three overlapping phases according to the time of synthesis after infection, that is, immediate-early (0 to 2 h), early (&lt;24 h), and late (&gt;24 h) viral proteins which are expressed by immediate-early, early and late genes, respectively [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Immediately after CMV infections, the immediate early genes transcribe and ensure the transcription of early genes, which encode proteins required for the viral replication. The late genes mainly code for structural proteins.
