<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a genus of 
 <italic>Herpesvirus</italic> in the order Herpesvirales, in the family Herpesviridae, and in the subfamily Betaherpesvirinae. There are nine distinct human herpesvirus (HHV) species known to cause human diseases such as HHV-1, HHV-2, HHV-3, HHV-4, HHV-5, HHV-6A, HHV-6B, HHV-7, HHV-8 [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, HHV-5), with a double-stranded DNA genome of about 230 kb, is the most studied one among all CMV. HCMV usually causes moderate or subclinical diseases in immunocompetent adults; however, it may lead to opportunistic infections to affect individuals whose immune functions are compromised or immature [

 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The primary target cells of HCMV are monocytes, lymphocytes, and epithelial cells, and its major sites of latency are peripheral monocytes and CD34+ progenitor cells. HCMV infection causes a broad range of diseases such as pneumonia, retinitis, gastrointestinal diseases, mental retardation and vascular disorders, and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality for humans [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. After infection, HCMV is recurrent and competent to remain latent within the body over long periods [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00021" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In all patients, the reactivation of latent HCMV can damage tissues and lead to organ disease, and reactivated CMV may trigger indirect immunomodulatory effects to cause detrimental outcomes, including increased mortality and graft rejection of organ transplantation in recipients [
