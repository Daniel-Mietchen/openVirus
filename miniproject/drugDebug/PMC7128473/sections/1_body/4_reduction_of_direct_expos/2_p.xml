<p id="p0045">Face-to-face contact is the basis for the physician-patient relationships and allows physicians to quickly assess the overall condition of the patient. However, due to the amount of individual contacts, physicians are at risk of infection and subsequently also dissemination of the virus. Thus, it seems appropriate to also limit the amount of face-to-face contacts for patients at risk of a more severe course of infection. Technical solutions are available to enable remote physician-patient interactions and their benefits have already been discussed in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

 </xref> Health authorities should be urged to equip hospitals with such systems not only to attend to COVID-19 patients who stay in quarantine at home but also to care for patients that need to be protected from a potentially harmful infection and guide them through the pandemic, explaining the future treatment/management strategies/plan and provide advice concerning general prevention measures. TheÂ current pandemic clearly underlines the importance of making these technical solutions available to health care providers in order to be better prepared for situations like these in the future.
