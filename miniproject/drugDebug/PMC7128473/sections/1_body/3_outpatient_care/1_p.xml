<p id="p0035">The management and surveillance of patients with advanced liver disease and those receiving immunosuppressive treatment is often performed in larger units or centres. These institutions, however, are currently also COVID-19 hotspots, thus, potentially putting outpatients with chronic liver diseases at risk of nosocomial infections. In addition, hospital staffs face challenges such as long working hours and even reduced staffing because of COVID-19 quarantining. Therefore, several factors have to be considered by hepatologists who provide care for these vulnerable patients. Clearly, prioritisation criteria need to be defined for outpatient contacts. The general and specific recommendations provided here (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig.Â 1</xref>) cannot comprehensively cover all patient cohorts and are not backed up by datasets. Moreover, the precise management of these patients strongly depends on the local COVID-19 burden. In case of COVID-19 in patients with more advanced chronic liver disease, we recommend admission for inpatient care depending on the presence of certain risk factors, which is discussed in more detail in a separate section.
