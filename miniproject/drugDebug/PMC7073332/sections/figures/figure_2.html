 <caption> Phylogenetic analysis of coronaviruses. a Phylogenetic tree of coronavirus (CoV). Phylogenetic algorithm analyzed evolutionary conservation among whole genomes of 15 coronaviruses. Red color highlights the recent emergent coronavirus, 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Numbers on the branches indicate bootstrap support values. The scale shows the evolutionary distance computed using the p-distance method. b Schematic plot for HCoV genomes. The genus and host information of viruses was labeled on the left by different colors. Empty dark gray boxes represent accessory open reading frames (ORFs). câ€“ e The 3D structures of SARS-CoV nsp12 (PDB ID: 6NUR) ( c), spike (PDB ID: 6ACK) ( d), and nucleocapsid (PDB ID: 2CJR) ( e) shown were based on homology modeling. Genome information and phylogenetic analysis results are provided in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. </caption>
