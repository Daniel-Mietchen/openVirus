 <caption> Drug-target network analysis of the HCoV–host interactome. a A subnetwork highlighting the HCoV–host interactome. Nodes represent three types of HCoV-associated host proteins: targetgable (proteins can be targeted by approved drugs or drugs under clinical trials), non-targetable (proteins do not have any known ligands), neighbors (protein–protein interaction partners). Edge colors indicate five types of experimental evidence of the protein–protein interactions (see Materials and methods). 3D three-dimensional structure. b, c KEGG human pathway ( b) and gene ontology enrichment analyses ( c) for the HCoV-associated proteins. </caption>
