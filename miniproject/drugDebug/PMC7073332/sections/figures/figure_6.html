 <caption> Network-based rational design of drug combinations for 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. a The possible exposure mode of the HCoV-associated protein module to the pairwise drug combinations. An effective drug combination will be captured by the “ Complementary Exposure” pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV–host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. Z CA and Z CB denote the network proximity ( Z-score) between targets (Drugs A and B) and a specific HCoV. S AB denotes separation score (see Materials and methods) of targets between Drug A and Drug B. b– d Inferred mechanism-of-action networks for three selected pairwise drug combinations: b sirolimus (a potent immunosuppressant with both antifungal and antineoplastic properties) plus dactinomycin (an RNA synthesis inhibitor for treatment of various tumors), c toremifene (first-generation nonsteroidal-selective estrogen receptor modulator) plus emodin (an experimental drug for the treatment of polycystic kidney), and d melatonin (a biogenic amine for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders) plus mercaptopurine (an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties). </caption>
