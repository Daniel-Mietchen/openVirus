 <caption> A discovered drug-HCoV network. a A subnetwork highlighting network-predicted drug-HCoV associations connecting 135 drugs and HCoVs. From the 2938 drugs evaluated, 135 ones achieved significant proximities between drug targets and the HCoV-associated proteins in the human interactome network. Drugs are colored by their first-level of the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system code. b A heatmap highlighting network proximity values for SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, IBV, and MHV, respectively. Color key denotes network proximity ( Z-score) between drug targets and the HCoV-associated proteins in the human interactome network. P value was computed by permutation test. </caption>
