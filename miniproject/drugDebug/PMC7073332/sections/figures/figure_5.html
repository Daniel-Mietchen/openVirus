 <caption> A discovered drug-protein-HCoV network for 16 candidate repurposable drugs. a Network-predicted evidence and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) scores for 16 potential repurposable drugs for HCoVs. The overall connectivity of the top drug candidates to the HCoV-associated proteins was examined. Most of these drugs indirectly target HCoV-associated proteins via the human protein–protein interaction networks. All the drug–target-HCoV-associated protein connections were examined, and those proteins with at least five connections are shown. The box heights for the proteins indicate the number of connections. GSEA scores for eight drugs were not available (NA) due to the lack of transcriptome profiles for the drugs. b– e Inferred mechanism-of-action networks for four selected drugs: b toremifene (first-generation nonsteroidal-selective estrogen receptor modulator), c irbesartan (an angiotensin receptor blocker), d mercaptopurine (an antimetabolite antineoplastic agent with immunosuppressant properties), and e melatonin (a biogenic amine for treating circadian rhythm sleep disorders). </caption>
