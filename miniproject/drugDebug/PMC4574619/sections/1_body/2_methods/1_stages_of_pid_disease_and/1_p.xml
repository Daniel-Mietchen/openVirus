<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> provides our conceptual diagram of the progression of PID patients through various clinical and poliovirus excretion stages (large boxes) with inflows and outflows from the stages indicated by arrows with solid lines. The arrows with dotted lines indicate model inputs that influence the flows. The accumulation of individuals in the stages provides the overall prevalence in the population, with the total number in the two stages on the right representing the prevalence of long-term (i.e., prolonged and chronic) excretors. We include trees with branches within some of the stages to indicate stratification of stages into different groups that may experience different outflows going forward. For example, the death rate for clinical PIDs depends on the type of PID and effective treatment with IVIG. Death rates, treatment probabilities, and OPV infection rates further change over time and vary between countries. Infected patients may develop VAPP at any time as they move through the OPV, prolonged, and chronic infection stages, so long as the infection continues and the individuals survive. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> suggests that once individuals recover from infection, they can potentially become re-infected. No known cases of longterm re-infection after recovery from a long-term infection exist, but some evidence exists of many repeated poliovirus and other enterovirus infections in a PID patient, with one poliovirus infection of at least 4 months [
