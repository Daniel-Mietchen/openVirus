<p>As we enter the polio endgame, modeling can provide important insights about the different risks that may occur, which may help to identify opportunities to manage them. This reanalysis of iVDPV risks suggests that they may represent a larger concern after OPV cessation than previously recognized, although significant uncertainty remains. The estimated current prevalence of long-term excretors remains higher than the base case for our prior analysis based on the zero observed long-term excretors in screening studies available at the time, but lower than the prior upper bound estimate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], reflecting the current non-zero observation of long-term excretors in more recent screening studies (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) and our efforts to account for missing long-term excretors in those studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The proportion of PID patients who may develop prolonged or chronic excretion nevertheless remains a major uncertainty. Improved treatment of immunocompromised individuals continues to increase their survival, with treatment strategies increasingly transferred to relatively lower-income countries, which also contributed to the overall higher prevalence than previously estimated for these countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The insufficient data and uncertainty imply limitations of our model and results. For example, insufficient data exist to model the properties of each PID defect in the combined oPID category, but important differences certainly exist. More serious forms of PID (e.g., SCID) may imply a greater probability of long-term poliovirus excretion, but also lead to reduced survival, particularly in developing countries. However, treatment of SCID patients with bone marrow transplantation may also make these patients effectively immunocompetent and remove them from the risk pool altogether. In contrast, patients with milder PID defects with longer survival (e.g., hypogammaglobulinemia) probably recover spontaneously from poliovirus infections relatively early during prolonged replication. Combining all oPIDs without a correlation between survival and probability of long-term infection given OPV exposure represents the conservative approach and may overestimate prolonged excretion.
