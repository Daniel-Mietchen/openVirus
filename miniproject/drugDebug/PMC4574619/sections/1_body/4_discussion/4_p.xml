<p>After OPV cessation, efforts to identify chronic excretors will represent a necessity for risk management. If effective PAVDs exist, then treating chronic excretors both to protect them from potentially developing VAPP and to protect the rest of the population from exposure to LPVs will offer an important strategy to reduce risk. Efforts to identify patients in the presence of an effective treatment strategy will most likely benefit from the potential to prevent future VAPP in these patients and may support widespread testing of PIDs for poliovirus excretion, including asymptomatic patients. Development of a second compound (or more) will potentially help to both motivate a scale-up of screening for long-term poliovirus excretors and achieve more impact of widespread PAVD use on the risk of iVDPVs after OPV cessation. In contrast, in the absence of any PAVDs, risk management efforts may focus on patient education aimed at asking the patients to limit their exposure to others (i.e., self-isolation to some degree). This will represent a challenge given the asymptomatic nature of most infections and the lack of incentives for patient participation.</p>
