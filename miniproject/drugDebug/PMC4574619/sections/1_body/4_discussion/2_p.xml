<p>Other significant uncertainties also impact the risk estimates, which could lead to higher or lower estimates. The relatively high assumed probabilities of potential long-term excretion of 1 % (prolonged) or 0.5 % (chronic) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) used to adjust for missing excretors based on the limited cross-sectional screening studies may contribute to overestimation of the model because they exceed the observed rates of 0.1 % (prolonged) and 0 % (chronic). In contrast, our model may underestimate the current prevalence of long-term excretors in high-income countries by assuming that all high-income countries that use IPV-only as of 2013 stopped IPV use as early as the year 2000 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), while in reality some countries (e.g., Japan) continued to use OPV-only until recently. In addition, almost no data exits to quantify PID survival in developing countries and therefore our assumed survival rates could over- or underestimate the risk. Although we present the average results of 1000 realizations of the model, the stochastic events modeled could lead to very different potential futures and even with all of the new information collected since our prior analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], iVDPV risks remain highly uncertain and of significant concern for polio endgame risk management. Further studies should provide additional information that may help to reduce uncertainties.
