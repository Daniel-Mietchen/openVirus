<p>Although the acute flaccid paralysis surveillance system cannot detect individual asymptomatic long-term excretors, the GPEI registry identified 16 asymptomatic long-term excretors through other sources (primarily known PID patients in higher-income countries identified by the treating physician). In addition, environmental surveillance activities in several countries identified 9 highly divergent VDPVs likely from different immunodeficient chronic excretors in sewage, but they could not link the detected viruses to any individuals with PIDs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The detection of these viruses suggests the existence of significantly more asymptomatic long-term iVDPV excretors than the 16 individuals known to the GPEI.
