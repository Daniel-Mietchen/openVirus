<p>Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy reduces morbidity and probably also mortality. Patients with CVIDs can survive for many years with appropriate and uninterrupted IVIG therapy, although they experience higher death rates than the general population even in developed countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The life expectancy of other types of PIDs varies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], with more severe forms (e.g., SCID) rarely surviving beyond 1 year of age in developing countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], and less severe forms with life expectancy more similar to CVID patients (e.g., patients with other hypogammaglobulinemia). The onset of symptoms varies widely among CVID patients, with an average of approximately 25 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], while severe oPIDs most commonly associated with long-term poliovirus excretion typically occur earlier in life. Over the past 25 years, IVIG therapy has become the standard of care for PID patients in developed countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>], and some developing countries recently began providing IVIG to identified PID patients through their health care systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The global supply of IVIG remains limited [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and effective treatment requires consistent and high quality IVIG administration, with any disruptions exposing patients to a risk of developing infectious disease complications [
