<p>Further research into PID incidence, survival, and long-term excretion would reduce important uncertainties associated with the risk from long-term poliovirus excretors. Efforts to develop a second polio antiviral compound to increase PAVD effectiveness and/or to maximize the identification and treatment of affected individuals represent important risk management opportunities for the polio endgame.</p>
