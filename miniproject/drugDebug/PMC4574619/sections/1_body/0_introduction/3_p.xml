<p>We previously estimated the prevalence of long-term iVDPV excretors (i.e., defined as either prolonged excretors with between 6 months and 5 years of excretion, or chronic excretors with over 5 years of excretion) and associated probabilities of post-OPV-cessation outbreaks based on the information available as of late 2005 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The analysis relied on limited studies that observed no long-term iVDPV excretors among 384 persons with PIDs studied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and knowledge about 4 identified asymptomatic and active long-term excretors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. We accounted for uncertainty by characterizing a wide distribution of the risk that included an upper bound for the prevalence of long-term excretors of 140 in upper middle- and high-income countries before OPV cessation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The probability distribution for the ratio of reported to actual long-term excretors reflected the findings from screening studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and an estimate of approximately 1:100,000 people affected with agammaglobulinemia, which represents only one of the many PIDs that can lead to long-term excretion. The 2006 analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] emphasized the need for additional studies that would reduce uncertainty.
