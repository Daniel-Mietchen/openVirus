<p>The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) plans to stop the use of the oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) after assurance of global interruption of wild poliovirus (WPV) transmission to eliminate the risks of poliomyelitis disease associated with continued OPV use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Given the apparent global interruption of indigenous serotype 2 WPV (WPV2) by 2000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], the GPEI Strategic Plan 2013-2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] calls for phased, but coordinated cessation of the three OPV serotypes, starting with coordinated cessation of serotype 2-containing OPV (OPV2 cessation) in April 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The risks associated with OPV use include the relatively predictable cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in a small fraction of OPV recipients and close contacts, the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPVs) in populations with low immunity to poliovirus transmission that can behave like WPVs and cause outbreaks, and possible reintroduction of immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) from rare individuals with B-cell-related primary immunodeficiencieÂ diseases (PIDs) who can continue to excrete polioviruses for years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In addition, after cessation of one or more OPV serotypes, any OPV of the withdrawn serotype(s) that mistakenly remains in the field or insufficiently contained in laboratories and vaccine production sites poses a risk of reintroducing a live poliovirus (LPV) in increasingly susceptible populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For any given serotype, new recipient VAPP cases of that serotype in immunocompetent individuals will almost immediately stop after OPV cessation, but cVDPVs can still evolve from continued circulation of OPV-related strains and get recognized through paralytic cases within about a year or so of OPV cessation in populations with insufficient immunity at the time of OPV cessation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. If the world can successfully control these cVDPV outbreaks, then long-term iVDPV excretors represent the primary OPV-associated risk of outbreaks.
