<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> shows the impact on iVDPV prevalence from the potential use of a PAVDs with low drug effectiveness of 40 % in clearing the infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>) or high drug effectiveness of 90 % (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>) for both PAVD use scenarios. Consistent with the low proportion of symptomatic iVDPV excretors in the model, relying on the occurrence of VAPP in PID patients to identify long-term excretors and treating 50 % of them leads to a negligible reduction in the prevalence, particularly if coupled with low drug effectiveness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref>, red curve overlapping the black curve). The hypothetical scenario of active PAVD use with 90 % of all long-term excretors receiving PAVDs suggests potentially larger benefits, especially for high drug effectiveness (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>, green curve). However, this scenario would require significant efforts to scale-up screening of PID patients in order to treat them. With the lower bound of PAVD effectiveness of 40 %, the active PAVD use scenario attains a 15 % reduction in iVDPV prevalence 10 years after OPV2 cessation. In contrast, with the upper bound of PAVD effectiveness of 90 %, the same level of PAVD use results in a 79 % reduction in iVDPV prevalence 10 years after OPV2 cessation.
