<p>The results in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> correspond to an average cumulative incidence of approximately 200 long-term iVDPV excretors during 2009–2013, compared to 33 reported by the GPEI during this period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Given our approach for estimating VAPP rates, we obtain approximately the same number of paralytic long-term excretors as reported (i.e., 30 vs. 26), while the model estimates approximately 170 asymptomatic long-term excretors compared to 7 reported asymptomatic long-term excretors. Overall, the model suggests a global prevalence of approximately 30,000 PID patients in January, 2015 with suspected immunodeficiencies that may lead to longer times required to clear poliovirus infections. Combined with the 30 estimated current long-term excretors, this translates into a rate of approximately 0.001 long-term excretors per PID patient, consistent with the rate of approximately 0.001 observed among 978 PID patients screened for long-term poliovirus excretion shown in Table
