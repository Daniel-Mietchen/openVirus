 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> shows the baseline prevalence (i.e., without PAVDs) of long-term iVDPV excretors by (a) income level, (b) serotype, (c) prolonged vs. chronic excretors, and (d) clinical manifestation. The estimated total global prevalence in 2013 equals approximately 30 long-term excretors, including approximately 27 active prolonged and 4 active chronic excretors. The number of prolonged excretors includes potential chronic excretors who did not yet progress past 5 years of excretion. In the context of high levels of continued OPV use to achieve eradication, the contributions of the relatively small number of long-term excretors to overall transmission of LPVs remains small and not easily observable. Thus, iVDPVs currently represent a relatively low and unnoticeable risk, except in countries that already switched to IPV-only routine immunization schedules for which any long-term excretors may represent a source of exposure to LPV. This includes high-income countries that maintain very high routine immunization coverage and benefit from relatively low R
 <sub>0</sub> values such that any transmissions that may occur will die out.
