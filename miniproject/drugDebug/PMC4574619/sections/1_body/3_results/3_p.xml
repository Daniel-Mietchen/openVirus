<p>As suggested in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, after OPV2 cessation, the prevalence of long-term serotype 2 excretors drops sharply, but serotype 1 and serotype 3 excretors increase because the first OPV infection now always occurs with one of these two serotypes. Before cessation of all OPV serotypes in 2019, prolonged excretors (including potential chronic excretors who excreted between 0.5-5 years) attain approximately seven times the prevalence of chronic excretors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). However, after OPV cessation of all serotypes, not surprisingly the prevalence of prolonged excretors drops quickly, while a few chronic excretors continue to exist for over a decade. Most of the chronic iVDPV excretors after OPV cessation of all serotypes reside in upper middle- and high-income countries, with the prevalence in low- and lower middle-income countries dropping below the level of high-income countries within a few years of OPV cessation of all serotypes. Despite the relatively high monthly VAPP rates continuing throughout each long-term infection (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>), long-term excretors with VAPP still account for only approximately 10 % of all long-term excretors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>) because the remainder either will recover or die before VAPP or will not experience VAPP until later during their infection.
