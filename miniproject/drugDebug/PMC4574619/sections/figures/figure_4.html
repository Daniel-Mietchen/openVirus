 <caption> Impact of PAVD use on iVDPV prevalence for different PAVD use scenarios starting on January 1, 2020, based on the first 100 stochastic iterations of the DES model. a Lower bound on effectiveness of a single PAVD compound (i.e., assuming 40 % of recipients recover from infection). b Hypothetical upper bound on effectiveness of one or more PAVD compounds (i.e., assuming 90 % of recipients recover from infection) </caption>
