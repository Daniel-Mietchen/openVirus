 <caption> (a) The Hypothesized Mechanism of Action for Tilorone is Activation of Innate Immunity Pathways such as the RIG-I-Like Receptor Pathway that Induces IFN and Activates a Cellular Antiviral Response. (b) Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) Binding Data of Tilorone to the Human Viral RNA Sensor RIG-I Shows a Low-Affinity (EC 50 = 0.5 mM) in this Cell-Free in vitro Model. </caption>
