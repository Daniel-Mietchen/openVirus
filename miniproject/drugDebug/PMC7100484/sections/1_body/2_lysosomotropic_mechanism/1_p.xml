<p id="Par21">Lysosomotropic amines can diffuse freely and rapidly across the membranes of acidic cytoplasmic organelles in their unprotonated form, then when they enter the acidic environment they become protonated. This halts free diffusion out, causing substantial accumulation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>). The lysosomotropic amine concentration in the organelle increases such that the concentration of [H
 <sup>+</sup>] decreases. Tilorone, is an amphiphilic cationic compound which was shown to induce the storage of sulfated glycosaminoglycans in fibroblasts as well as enhanced the secretion of precursor forms of lysosomal enzymes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>). Tilorone was also found to increase lysosomal pH and inhibited the ATP-dependent acidification (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>). We have also recently confirmed that tilorone is lysosomotropic, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> (~4 μM), on par with the well known lysosomotropic compound chloroquine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Others have shown that the tilorone induced glycosaminoglycans storage can be separated from the tilorone induced secretion of lysosomal enzymes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>). The lysosomotropic mechanism may also have an important role as tilorone blocks viral entry. Cationic amphiphilic drugs have been proposed recently as a useful starting point for broad spectrum antivirals (
