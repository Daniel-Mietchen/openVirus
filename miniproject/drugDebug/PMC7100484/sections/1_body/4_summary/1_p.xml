<p id="Par23">While there are many antiviral drugs for several individual viral diseases e.g. HIV, HBV, influenza etc., there are currently no broad-spectrum antivirals approved in the USA. In contrast, tilorone has been widely used outside the USA for several decades and recent data suggests efficacy in an animal model of EBOV infection (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>) while additional 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> activities from several groups support the use of this molecule as a broad-spectrum treatment of various viral infections. The preclinical data around this compound and all available data allows a candidate product profile to be generated (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">III</xref>). This document will serve as a guide for future development efforts. It is expected that some changes and additions will occur with additional data and any interactions with the FDA or other regulatory agencies, but our preliminary data characterizing the activities and properties of tilorone already support many of the target parameters needed to move this forward as a broad-spectrum antiviral. Several recent articles have focused on repurposing of other classes of drugs in order to identify novel broad spectrum antivirals (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>) and a few of these were found to impact viral entry (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>). In addition, there are other broad spectrum antiviral drugs approved in Russia or elsewhere which may also be worthy of further assessment globally such as arbidol (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>), triazavirin (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>), cycloferon (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>) and Kagocel (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>). Tilorone is already an antiviral drug which we have barely begun to exploit since its development 50 years ago and with recent discoveries it has revealed a little more on its potential antiviral mechanism and several additional activities. This compound is therefore ripe for more wide-spread testing against emerging viruses like coronaviruses that are impacting human health globally such as Covid-19.
