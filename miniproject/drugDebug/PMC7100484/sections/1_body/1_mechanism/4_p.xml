<p id="Par20">The antiviral efficacy of tilorone and the observation of its lack of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-EBOV potency in IFN-deficient cell lines led us to hypothesize that the drug may work by activating specific innate immune system pathways that suppress viral replication. One candidate target is the RIG-like receptor (RLR) signaling pathway that can recognize intracellular viral RNA and induce a cellular response that leads to induction of IFNs (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). This exact mechanism is not yet proven, but several pieces of data support this hypothesis: Activation of RLR signaling pathways leads to IFN production (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>), a well-known activity of tilorone. Tilorone causes a rapid increase in the mitochondrial potential (after 30 minutes), which may reflect the activity of the direct downstream signaling partner of RIG-I called the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>). The RLR signaling and the MAVS protein have been shown to be a critical mediator of viral replication in mice (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> binding data shows that tilorone can directly bind human RIG-I, though only weakly when the assay is performed in a simple buffer with no other cellular components (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>).
