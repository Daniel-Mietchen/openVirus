<p id="Par18">To our surprise, the differences in anti-EBOV assays performed in HeLa cells and Vero 76 cells (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">II</xref>) initially indicated it may be due to the latter being IFN-deficient [24], unlike normal mammalian cells, and may not respond to tilorone in the same manner as HeLa cells. Given the reported activity of tilorone as an inducer of IFN, this differential antiviral activity data supported the hypothesis that the antiviral activity of tilorone is likely derived from its activation of host innate immunity pathways. Interestingly, the fact that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity is observed against MERS-CoV and CHIKV in Vero 76 cells suggests that these viruses are affected by different innate immunity pathways or tilorone has multiple targets that contribute to its overall antiviral activity.
