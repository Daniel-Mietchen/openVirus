<p id="Par14">In the last 5 years there have been 2 major Ebola virus outbreaks in Africa (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>), the Zika virus in Brazil (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>) and currently we are in the midst of a novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>) currently spreading globally from China at the time of writing. Some of these viruses have the ability to rapidly spread to additional countries from their original location and they all create massive financial impacts. The overall morbidity from these virus outbreaks generally pales in comparison to the more common viral infections, such as influenza (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>), HIV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>), and HBV (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>) which kill orders of magnitude more annually. Newer viruses however attract significant attention because of the lack of available treatments and the fear of the unknown. It also indicates the need for broader spectrum antivirals that can be used for any new or emerging virus affecting human health.
