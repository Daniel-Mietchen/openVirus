<p id="Par15">One such promising drug is tilorone dihydrochloride (Tilorone, 2,7-Bis[2-(diethylamino)ethoxy]-9H-fluoren-9-one) which is a small-molecule (410.549 Da) that is orally bioavailable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The drug has typically been used in the dihydrochloride salt form and is yellow/orange in color. Tilorone was originally synthesized and developed at the pharmaceutical company Merrell Dow which is now part of Sanofi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>). The synthesis has been improved upon in recent years (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>). Tilorone is currently used clinically as an antiviral in several countries outside the USA and is sold under the trade names Amixin® or Lavomax®. It is approved for use in Russia for several viral disease indications (influenza, acute respiratory viral infection, viral hepatitis, viral encephalitis, myelitis, and others), and is included in the list of vital and essential medicines of the Russian Federation (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>). Tilorone is also registered for human use in Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan as an antiviral and immunomodulating medication. In Russia, tilorone is also available over the counter in both adult and child (ages 7 and above) dosages. Tilorone has a track record of safe use in children and adults for ~20 years as both a prophylaxis and treatment for viral diseases. The drug has been produced and manufactured at the kiloton (1000 kg) scale and can be produced at a very low cost per dose based on the current list price (

 <italic>In vivo</italic> efficacy studies from the literature support possible uses of tilorone against a broad array of infections including influenza A, influenza B, herpes simplex virus 1, West Nile virus, Mengo virus, Semliki Forest virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, encephalomyocarditis virus (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">I</xref>). Human clinical studies outside the US evaluated tilorone as a treatment for Acute Respiratory Viral Infections (ARVIs), where it demonstrated significantly improved patient outcomes (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>). The drug also showed 72% prophylactic efficacy in respiratory tract infections in humans (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>). Tilorone has undergone several clinical trials published in Russian journals (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>). Besides this track record of use in Russia and neighboring countries, tilorone has never been evaluated and tested for safety and efficacy under studies that meet current ICH and FDA guidelines and regulations, and previous nonclinical data (if any) are not readily available.
