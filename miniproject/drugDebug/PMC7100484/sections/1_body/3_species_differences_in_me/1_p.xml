<p id="Par22">A recent species comparison of metabolism of tilorone demonstrated N-deethylation and mono-oxygenation was higher in guinea pig relative to both mouse and human (

The differences in metabolic stability between species could also account for any differences in efficacy observed between the mouse and guinea pig models of EBOV treated with tilorone. Whereas we saw efficacy for mouse, this was not apparent for guinea pig and it may be due to the metabolic stability differences.
