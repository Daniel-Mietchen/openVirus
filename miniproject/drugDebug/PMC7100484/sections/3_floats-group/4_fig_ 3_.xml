  <p>Inhibition of total Fluorescent Intensity/Cell of Lysotracker Red in MCF7 Cells. Lysotracker Accumulation in Lysosomes is pH Dependent, therefore a Reduction in Signal from the Lysotracker Suggests a pH Increase in these Organelles. This is Proposed to be caused by Accumulation of the Charged Base of the Lysosomotropic Compound in the Lysosome, which in a Lower pH Environment becomes Neutralized and Trapped in the Organelle.</p>
