<p>In the CRISPR/Cas9 system, CRISPR is used to build RNA-guided genes drives to target a specific DNA sequence. By the linkage of the specifically designed single-guiding RNA (sgRNA) and Cas proteins, the genome can be cleaved at most locations when a protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) sequence (NGG) is existing in the target site three nucleotides downstream [
