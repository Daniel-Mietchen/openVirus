<p>Li and Sheng et al. explored the antiviral effects of an EGS variant engineered by in vitro selection procedures using MCMV in an animal model [
 <xref rid="B77-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. EGSs were used to target the shared mRNA region of MCMV capsid scaffolding protein (mCSP) and assemblin which is essential for viral progeny production. In vitro, the EGS variant was 60 folds more active than the EGS originating from a natural tRNA in directing RNase P cleavage of the target mRNA. In MCMV-infected cells, the variant reduced mCSP expression by 92% and decreased viral growth by 8000 folds. In MCMV-infected mice, the EGS variant was more effective than the EGS originating from a natural tRNA in reducing mCSP expression, viral production, and mouse mortality. The results showed that engineered EGS variants with higher targeting activity in vitro are also more effective in inhibiting gene expression in vivo. Furthermore, their findings suggested its possiblility for engineered EGS variants to treat MCMV infections [
