<p>Li and Liu et al. used an in vitro selection procedure to engineer RNase P-based ribozyme variants with stronger targeting activity [
 <xref rid="B78-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. R388-AS, a novel engineered ribozyme variant, was designed to target the mRNA of assemblin of MCMV. These ribozyme variants were further used to test if they have improved activity in blocking gene expression in vivo. The results demonstrated that the engineered RNase P ribozyme variants with more active catalytic activity in vitro are also more effective in inhibiting MCMV gene expression in vivo. Additionally, their studies hinted that R388-AS can enhance ribozyme activity for therapeutic application [
