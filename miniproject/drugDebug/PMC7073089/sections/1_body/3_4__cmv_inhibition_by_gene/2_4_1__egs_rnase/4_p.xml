<p>Deng et al. revealed that engineered EGS variants induced RNase P to efficiently hydrolyze target mRNAs which encode HCMV major capsid protein [

In vitro, engineered EGS variants were more efficient than natural tRNA-derived EGSs in triggering human RNase P-mediated cleavage of the target mRNA by about 80 folds. In HCMV-infected cells, the EGS variant and natural EGSs led to HCMV gene expression reduction by about 98% and 73%, and the viral growth was inhibited by about 10,000 and 200 folds, respectively. The results showed that the EGS variant has improved efficiency in the inhibition of the expression of HCMV genes and viral growth, compared with the natural EGS [
