<p>RNase P is a ribonucleoprotein complex composed of a catalytically active RNA subunit (M1 RNA) and a protein subunit (C5 protein). In addition, M1 RNA can be modified to target transfer RNA (tRNA) substrates and specific messenger RNA (mRNA) sequences. M1GS RNA, a sequence-specific ribozyme, is capable of being designed by attaching an EGS to the 3â€² terminus of M1 RNA to target and cleave the specific gene sequences in cell culture and animals [
