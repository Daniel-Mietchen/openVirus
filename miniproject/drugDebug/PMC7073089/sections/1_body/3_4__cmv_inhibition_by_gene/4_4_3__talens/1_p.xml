<p>Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) are important virulence factors that act as transcriptional activators in the cell nucleus of plants, where they directly bind to DNA via a central domain of tandem repeats [
 <xref rid="B84-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. The DNA-binding domain contains a highly conserved 34-amino acid sequence, only the 12th and 13th amino acids in TALEs are variable. These two locationsâ€™ repeat variable di-residues show a strong correlation with a specific nucleotide recognition by different frequencies [
 <xref rid="B85-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Currently, TALENs were shown to be an efficient tool for engineering genome precisely without toxicity and could be engineered to be an antiviral agent [
