<p>Because CMV can be transmitted by the close interpersonal contact such as saliva, semen, urine, breast milk, or vertical transmission (viruses pass the placenta and directly infect the fetus) [

 <xref rid="B35-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Intrauterine transmission may occur in mothers without immune responses against CMV who are first infected by CMV in pregnancy (primary infection). Also, it may occur in the mothers with preexisting antibodies against CMV either by the reactivation of previous infections or by the infection of a different viral strain (non-primary infection) [
 <xref rid="B36-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. A mother can only transmit viruses to a neonate if she is undergoing primary infection or robust reactivation. Most of congenital infections are asymptomatic (85–90%) and some present with clinically apparent symptoms (10–15%), but the symptomatic disease usually emerges after primary maternal infection in pregnancy [
