<p>Brain diseases, a global human health problem associated with CNS, are usually complicated, serious, irreversible and difficult to treat. CMV is the leading infectious cause of mental retardation and may be associated with GBM. Currently, a variety of drugs (e.g., ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, foscarnet, and valnoctamide) are used to treat CMV acute infections. However, their efficacy is restricted by side effects, toxicity, cross-resistance and other adverse reactions. Also, there is still no effective cure for CMV latent infections. Fortunately, some antiviral agents have been approved for clinical application (e.g., letermovir) or many therapeutic approaches are being developed (e.g., maribavir, brincidofovir, EGS-RNase, CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, vaccine therapy/immunotherapy), though more studies and clinical trials are needed. </p>
