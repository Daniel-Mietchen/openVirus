<p>For GBM treatment, the standard therapeutic approach involves maximizing safe surgical resections and followed by concurrent chemoradiation with temozolomide, but its prognosis is often poor and still universally detrimental with short survival times after initial diagnosis. Despite extensive research, only few effects and outcomes have been achieved in long-term survival of patients. Recently, the vaccine therapy and immunotherapy for GBM are areas of intense studies. Novel vaccine therapies and immunotherapies have not been extensively integrated into standard practices, though they are promising and has been applied in some clinical cases. Regardless of the possible etiologic role of CMV infections in GBM, the research interest should focus on exploiting this association for the development of vaccine therapies and immunotherapies. It is essential to investigate the interactions and correlations between CMV and hosts thoroughly to make out how therapeutic approaches influence CMV infections and improve clinical outcomes for patients. Finally, we should study the rationale and feasibility using CMV as a therapeutic target and explore the first clinical evidence for safety and efficacy using CMV-specific vaccine therapy and immunotherapy for the treatment of GBM. </p>
