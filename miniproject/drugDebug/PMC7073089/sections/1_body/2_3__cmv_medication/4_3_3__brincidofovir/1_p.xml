<p>Brincidofovir (CMX001) is an orally bioavailable lipid prodrug of cidofovir which is less renal toxic than the parent compound. It is an experimental antiviral CMV drug being developed for the treatment of CMV, adenovirus, smallpox, and ebolavirus infections [
 <xref rid="B72-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Marty et al. significantly reduced CMV viremia in patients compared with placebo by administering brincidofovir 100 mg twice weekly (BIW) in a phase II dose-ranging trial for CMV prevention in allogeneic HCT recipients [
 <xref rid="B73-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In the dose cohort, the brincidofovir 200 mg BIW only caused dose-limiting toxicity. This cohort experienced severe diarrhea and gastrointestinal acute graft-versus-host diseases. These findings promoted the performance of a safety monitoring and management proposal for the brincidofovir 100 mg BIW. Overall tolerability and safety of brincidofovir was acceptable and no dose-dependent myelotoxicity or nephrotoxicity was observed. By these results, they continued to conduct a phase III trial for the prevention of clinically significant CMV infection in allogeneic HCT recipients. However, the results showed that there was no significant reduction in the incidence of viremia among patients randomized to receive brincidofovir and this drug was still not successful in the phase III evaluation [
