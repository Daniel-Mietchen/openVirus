<p>Current drugs for anti-CMV infections include the inhibitors of viral DNA polymerase, such as ganciclovir, valganciclovir, cidofovir, and foscarnet. At present, ganciclovir remains to be the first line drug for the treatment of CMV infections. Ganciclovir and valganciclovir are mainly used for both preemptive therapy and prophylaxis of CMV infections in solid organ transplant (SOT) patients, but their bone marrow toxicity precludes these drugs to be used for prophylaxis after stem cell transplant [

Valnoctamide, a neuroactive mood stabilizer which inhibits CMV infection in developing brain and attenuates neurobehavioral dysfunctions, was shown to have anti-CMV potential [
