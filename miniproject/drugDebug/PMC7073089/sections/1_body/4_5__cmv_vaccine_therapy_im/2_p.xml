<p>Nair et al. explored whether T cells were stimulated by CMV pp65 RNA-transfected dendritic cells (DC) target and remove autologous GBM tumor cells [
 <xref rid="B92-ijms-21-01376" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. CMV pp65-specific immune responses were elicited in vitro using RNA-pulsed autologous DCs recovered from patients with newly diagnosed GBM. In an antigen-specific manner, CMV pp65-specific T cells lyse autologous and primary GBM tumor cells. Moreover, T cells expanded in vitro using DCs pulsed with total tumor RNA demonstrated a 10- to 20-fold expansion of CMV pp65-specific T cells and destruction of CMV pp65-expressing target cells. The results showed that CMV-specific T cells can effectively target to kill GBM tumor cells immunologically in vitro and support the development of CMV-directed immunotherapy in patients with GBM [
