<p>Lamano et al. reported a clinical case of a woman who received immunotherapy had survived seven years post-diagnosed with GBM and recovered from CMV colitis [

Following tumor resection, the patient received radiation therapy and temozolomide combined therapy that was complicated by CMV colitis and abdominal abscesses. Not receiving adjuvant temozolomide, the patient still demonstrated a five-year PFS before requiring re-resection for radiation necrosis. The patient survived for two additional years following re-resection. Because the patientâ€™s tumor was stained positive for CMV antigens of immediately early protein-1 and pp65, Thus, they had a hypothesis that the patient developed an immune response against CMV during recovery that contributed to anti-tumor surveillance and prolonged survival. In conclusion, the presented case of a GBM patient with CMV suggested the development of anti-tumor immune responses against CMV antigens that contributed to long-term survival [
