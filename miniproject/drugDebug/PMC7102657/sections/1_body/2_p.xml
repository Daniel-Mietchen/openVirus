<p id="par0015">Remdesivir and favipiravir interfere with the synthesis of viral mRNA targeting RdRp. Remdesivir is being developed by Gilead as a monophosphoramidate prodrug: GS-441524. It was intended to be an intravenous treatment for Ebola but it also shows potential against coronavirus and Nipah virus infection. The results from evaluating the antiviral efficiency of remdesivir against a clinical isolate of SARS-CoV-2 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> suggest that it could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 strongly with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> ranging from 0.77 to 1.76 μM 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Remdesivir cured the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed in the USA, which prompted Gilead and the Chinese authorities to move the Phase III trial ahead and expand it to a lot more patients who desperately need treatment. Final results of the clinical trial will be announced in April 2020. In contrast to remdesivir, the activity report of favipiravir 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is limited. However, there are still three active clinical trials regarding favipiravir that have begun enrolling patients in China. Lopinavir and ritonavir, targeting 3Clpro, were used to treat SARS patients from China in 2003. Shortly after the emergence of MERS-CoV, researchers identified lopinavir and ritonavir as MERS-CoV inhibitors. The national expert group has recommended lopinavir and ritonavir as effective anti-COVID-19 agents in China, and most clinical trials on COVID-19 select both drugs as positive controls. Emtricitabine and tenofovir alafenamide are reverse transcriptase inhibitors that were approved to treat HIV and hepatitis B virus (HBV). Currently, only one trial combines emtricitabine/tenofovir-alafenamide and lopinavir/ritonavir to treat COVID-19 patients. Arbidol as a 2′-5′oligoadenylates synthesis (OAS) inhibitor against severe pneumonia and virus-associated cytokine dysregulation has displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 potential in clinical trials

Chloroquine and its derivatives including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine phosphate have elicited antiviral effects on several viruses such as SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E by interfering with endosomal acidification. Based on the advantage of known broad-spectrum activity and rarely occurring adverse reactions, a series of clinical trials on chloroquine and its derivatives have been advancing rapidly. Presently, Chinese government authorities have approved chloroquine phosphate to be used to treat adult patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, treatments combining Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) and chemical molecules (popularly known as Western medicine in China) have shown some exciting results. In view of inconclusive clinical evidence on TCM efficacy, pharmacologists should separate active pharmaceutical ingredients and identify explicit targets as soon as possible 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Surprisingly, various drugs are also in clinical trials despite the lack of biological rationale, such as the anti-influenza drugs umifenovir and oseltamivir targeting neuraminidase, baloxavirmarboxil targeting cap-dependent endonuclease that is not found in , ASC09 targeting protease with no anti-coronavirus research reported, and cobicistat targeting CYP3A4 with only unpersuasive predicted activity by computer virtual docking. As the crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 spike

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and SARS-CoV-2spike receptor-binding domain bound with the ACE2 receptor 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> are published in succession, the lead drug discovery strategy such as structure-based HTS and molecular dynamics simulation to discover inhibitors with affinity to ACE2, the S protein or the protein–protein interaction will be possible in the near future.
