Whether EGCG also inhibits the infectivity of circovirus remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the antiviral effect of EGCG on porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). EGCG targets PCV2 virions directly and blocks the attachment of virions to host cells. The microscale thermophoresis assay showed EGCG could interact with PCV2 capsid protein in vitro with considerable affinity (Kd = 98.03 &#x000b1; 4.76 &#x003bc;M), thereby interfering with the binding of the capsid to the cell surface receptor heparan sulfate. The molecular docking analysis of capsid&#x02013;EGCG interaction identified the key amino acids which formed the binding pocket accommodating EGCG. Amino acids ARG51, ASP70, ARG73 and ASP78 of capsid were found to be critical for maintaining the binding, and the arginine residues were also essential for the electrostatic interaction with heparan sulfate. The rescued mutant viruses also confirm the importance of the key amino acids of the capsid to the antiviral effect of EGCG. Our findings suggest that catechins could act as anti-infective agents against circovirus invasion, as well as provide the basic information for the development and synthesis of structure-based anti-circovirus drugs.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Porcine circovirus type 2</kwd><kwd>epigallocatechin gallate</kwd><kwd>heparan sulfate</kwd><kwd>antiviral effect</kwd><kwd>virus attachment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00176"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Circovirus is one of the smallest non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded circular genomic DNA and classified in the genus <italic>Circovirus</italic> of family <italic>Circoviridae</italic> [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It infects various species ranging from plants to animals with different pathogenicities [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a prototype circovirus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in swine [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and is associated with different syndromes, such as the post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and reproductive disorder [<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The genome of PCV2 contains two major open reading frames (ORFs). <italic>ORF1</italic> encodes the replicase protein (Rep) involved in rolling-circle viral DNA replication, while <italic>ORF2</italic> encodes the unique viral structural protein capsid [<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is involved in diverse and essential biological events during virus infection, such as virion attachment [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The primary attachment of the non-enveloped virus on the host cells is based on a low-affinity interaction between viral structural protein and cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) receptors [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. GAGs include heparan sulfate (HS), keratan sulfate (KS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), which are characterized by disaccharide units forming blocks of polysaccharides [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among these GAGs, HS is the most common polysaccharide molecule utilized by viruses for attachment to cell surfaces, such as the hepatitis C virus [<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], herpes simplex virus 1 [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], human enterovirus 71 [<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and rabies virus [<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. PCV2 has also been verified to use cell surface HS as attachment receptor, and adopts a distinct non-symmetrical receptor distributed pattern on the virion with a multitude of weak HS binding sites [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Chemical molecules acting as receptor mimics that interfere with HS-virion interactions might exhibit antiviral activities [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there are very few reports of PCV2 infection inhibition available for pertaining to such natural small molecule compounds.</p><p>The green tea catechins (GTCs) are polyphenolic compounds extracted from the leaves of <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic> [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and have shown numerous beneficial properties, such as anticancer activity [<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], anti-inflammatory ability [<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], antioxidative properties [<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], antibacterial function [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] and antiviral effects [<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. GTCs are predominantly comprised of four constituents: epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin, epicatechin gallate, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) [<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], among which the EGCG is the major component of GTCs accounting for approximately 59% of the total polyphenols, and it is also the most complicated and principal constituent, possessing the activity against infection of several viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], influenza A virus [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], Zika virus [<xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], herpes simplex viruses 1 [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and hepatitis C virus [<xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The mechanisms of EGCG antiviral activity are complicated and diverse, depending on the specific virus infection process or host cell response, one of which is that EGCG interacts with viral structural proteins, consequently blocking the latter from recognizing or binding with cellular receptors. In previous reports, EGCG has been shown to interact with the influenza A virus hemagglutinin, disrupting the binding of envelope glycoprotein to cell surface sialic acid receptor [<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. EGCG inhibited the interaction of HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120 with the cellular CD4 molecule [<xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Regarding the GAGs receptors, EGCG could bind to the herpes simplex virus-1 glycoprotein gB and gD, which should interact with HS and 3-O-sulfated HS of cellular glycans, respectively [<xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>In previous studies, there have been no reports of catechins inhibiting circovirus invasion, we aimed to investigate the effect of EGCG on PCV2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00176"><title>2.

The original catechin EC displayed no considerable anti-infective effect on PCV2 under similar treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f001">Figure 1</xref>c&#x02013;f). In addition, the EC<sub>50</sub> of the antiviral effect of EGCG on PCV2 was further determined to be 37.79 &#x000b1; 1.64 &#x003bc;M, which was consistent with its inhibitory concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M. Accordingly, EGCG could exert a prominent antiviral effect against the PCV2 infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot2-viruses-12-00176"><title>3.2. EGCG Exerts the Antiviral Effect via Directly Targeting Virions</title><p>The antiviral effect of EGCG might be exerted by targeting PCV2 virions, such as the effect on certain viral nucleic acids and proteins, or targeting host cells [<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To assess this issue, the time of addition assay was preformed, the cells were pretreated with EGCG and then inoculated with PCV2, or the PCV2 was premixed with EGCG before seeding to cells. Surprisingly, the inhibitory effect could not be detected with immunoblotting in the pre-treated cells group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), which was consistent with results of viral nucleic acid and titer determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>b,c). Meanwhile, the prominent antiviral effect could be displayed in the pre-treated virions group with high EGCG concentration (100 &#x003bc;M), but non-sensitive to the low EGCG concentration (10 &#x003bc;M) pretreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>a&#x02013;c), suggesting the compound might interact with virions. To rule out the possibility that the EGCG might also act on some cellular factors activated only in the presence of virions or some intracellular signaling pathways induced by the virus stimulation, we performed the dilution assay. Briefly, virus samples were pretreated at a high EGCG concentration (100 &#x003bc;M), and thereafter diluted 10-fold before being inoculated on the cells, ensuring the cells were treated with compound at 10-fold lower concentrations (10 &#x003bc;M) than the viral particles; in such a way, the inhibitory phenomenon would disappear if the compound really targeted host cells only in the presence of virions. However, the antiviral effect could still be detected with immunoblotting, qPCR and virus titer determination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>d&#x02013;f). Considering that the pretreatment of cells with 10 &#x003bc;M EGCG could not trigger antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>a&#x02013;c), this inhibition was attributed to the effect of 100 &#x003bc;M EGCG on virions, further supporting that EGCG performed an antiviral effect via directly targeting virions.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00176"><title>3.3. EGCG Impairs the Attachment of PCV2 to Host Cells</title><p>To investigate which stage of the EGCG antiviral effect could be active during the PCV2 infective process, EGCG was added post-infection and incubated for various time. The results showed that compared with of the EGCG whole process treatment PCV2 infection, a significant inhibitory effect could not be detected with treatment for 4 h or 12 h after PCV2 infection, only a slight effect was observed when the post treatment duration reached 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f003">Figure 3</xref>a), indicating that EGCG might work at the early stage of infection course. Thereby, the binding assay was performed, the virions were added to the cell surface at 4 &#x000b0;C to achieve the binding event for 1 h, and the results indicated that bound PCV2 particles would decrease significantly in cells with the EGCG treatment measured by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f003">Figure 3</xref>b). The cells attached by the virions could be detected by flow cytometry [<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], and its proportion also dropped from ~70% to ~55% in cells with the EGCG treatment for 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). This tendency was also detectable when the binding time was extended to 4 h to maximize virions binding, and the proportion of PCV2-attached cells reduced from about 85% to about 67% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that EGCG inhibited the binding of PCV2 to host cells, but exerted no distinct effect on downstream infection.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot4-viruses-12-00176"><title>3.4. EGCG Competitively Inhibits the Interaction between Capsid and Heparan Sulfate</title><p>PCV2 virions attached to host cells via direct interaction between viral capsid protein and cell surface heparan sulfate [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that EGCG might also bind to capsid, and competitively block the interaction between PCV2 capsid and HS. The microscale thermophoresis assay (MST) was utilized to evaluate the affinity between compounds and protein by measuring the dissociation constant (Kd). The Kd between dcapsid and EGCG was 98.03 &#x000b1; 4.76 &#x003bc;M, indicating that EGCG could indeed bind to capsid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>a), and capsid&#x02019;s affinity to EGCG was comparable to the affinity for heparin (an HS analog similar in structure to the sulfated domain of HS), or even a little stronger than the latter (Kd = 120.67 &#x000b1; 4.73 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>b). However, the EC, which did not exhibit the inhibitory activity against PCV2 infection, could also bind to capsid with a 10-fold lower affinity than EGCG (Kd = 951.33 &#x000b1; 6.81 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>c). These findings implied that the interaction between PCV2 capsid and HS might be hindered by EGCG. This was confirmed by heparin column chromatography assay. Briefly, the dcapsid protein was pre-loaded onto a heparin-Sepharose column, then eluted by the various competitor reagents. The results showed that approximately 40% protein fraction (42.33 &#x000b1; 3.52%) could be eluted by the EGCG at a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL, similar to the eluted level of heparin (36.00 &#x000b1; 6.25%), while in case of EC only 10.33 &#x000b1; 4.50% protein sample was eluted from the heparin column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>d), which was significantly reduced compared to the level of EGCG or heparin competitor reagents. The eluted fraction was further increased when the concentration of competitor reached 0.5 mg/mL. In that case, the heparin and EGCG could elute 89.33 &#x000b1; 4.16% and 90.00 &#x000b1; 5.29% of total protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>e), and the difference between then was still not significant. In summary, EGCG could directly interact with PCV2 capsid, competitively inhibiting the binding of latter to HS.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot5-viruses-12-00176"><title>3.5. Identification of Key Amino Acids in PCV2 Capsid Contributing to the Interaction with EGCG</title><p>To further investigate the detailed structural character of the interaction between EGCG and capsid, the flexible docking model of the complex was established with AutoDock software 4.2 (Olson Lab, <uri xlink:href="http://autodock.scripps.edu">http://autodock.scripps.edu</uri>). The crystal structure of PCV2 dcapsid was obtained as PDB accession ID:3R0R and the whole domain of protein was docked with ligand. Several docking model structures were obtained, and the one with the lowest interface energy was adopted for further analysis, which showed that each EGCG molecule could be attached to a capsid monomer at a distinct pocket, which was completely exposed to the surface of PCV2 particles according to the revealed structure of the PCV2 VLPs [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and the pocket was formed by some critical amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f005">Figure 5</xref>a), among which ARG-51, GLY 54, ASP-70, ARG-73, ASN-75, and ASP-78 were predicted to engage in hydrogen bonds with EGCG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f005">Figure 5</xref>b). We established an amino acid sequence alignment to assess the conservation of these amino acid. It was demonstrated that all of these 6 amino acids were highly conserved in PCV2 ranging from PCV2a to PCV2f except for ASN-75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f005">Figure 5</xref>c), suggesting their critical importance for the interaction between capsid and EGCG molecule in the various subtypes of PCV2.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, and to identify the key amino acids for the interaction, we made a single-point mutation of these amino acids to alanine (A) residue and measured the affinity of each mutant to EGCG, the results of MST showed that the Kd of different mutants and EGCG could fluctuate significantly compared to the wild type (WT) capsid; among all the mutants, the D70A and D78A showed the loweest affinity to EGCG with Kd values of 863.67 &#x000b1; 7.23 &#x003bc;M and 1061.33 &#x000b1; 8.08 &#x003bc;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,f), almost 10 times lower than the Kd of WT to EGCG (Kd = 98.03 &#x000b1; 4.76 &#x003bc;M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Additionally, mutants aimed at arginine (R) residues also exhibited comparable reduction in affinity to EGCG, the Kd values of R51A and R73A were 591.00 &#x000b1; 5.57 &#x003bc;M and 971.00 &#x000b1; 9.54 &#x003bc;M, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>a,d). On the contrary, the affinity of G54A and N75A mutants did not change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,e). These results indicated that ARG-51, ARG-73, ASP-70 and ASP-78 were critical for the interaction of EGCG with the PCV2 capsid. To further assess the effect of these amino acids on the binding properties of capsid to HS, the heparin column chromatography assay of different mutants was performed and it showed that the eluted level of R51A, D70A, R73A and D78A mutants was remarkably reduced, with 0.5 mg/mL EGCG, especially in the case of D70A and D78A mutants, which is consistent with the results of Kd determination. Meanwhile, the mutation targeted to arginine residues (R51A and R73A) displayed the most significant eluted reduction with 0.5 mg/mL heparin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>g). Taken together, these results indicated that the ARG-51, ARG-73, ASP-70 and ASP-78 of PCV2 capsid protein were crucial for its interaction with EGCG, and the two arginine residues were also essential for binding with cell surface HS.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot6-viruses-12-00176"><title>3.6. Replacement of Key Amino Acids in Capsid Weakens the Antiviral Effect of EGCG</title><p>To further confirm the role of the key amino acids in capsid towards the antiviral activity of EGCG, we tried to use virus rescue strategy to generate mutant viruses and evaluate the regulation in EGCG&#x02019;s antiviral activity. The circularized PCV2 genome with R51A, G54A, D70A, R73A, N75A, and D78A mutations were transfected into PK-15 cells, respectively. Also, the genome with the A135A mutation was designated as a positive control. Transfected cells were serially passaged and cultured to harvest the rescued virus particles, which were then inoculated into PK-15 cells to test the infectivity. The results of IFA showed that PCV2 (G54A), PCV2 (D70A), PCV2 (N75A) and PCV2 (D78A) could be detectable at 72 hpi, similar to PCV2 (WT) and PCV2 (A135A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f007">Figure 7</xref>a). The results of immunoblotting also confirmed the capsid expression of these mutant viruses at 72 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f007">Figure 7</xref>b). One-step growth curves of PCV2 (G54A), PCV2 (D70A), PCV2 (N75A), and PCV2 (D78A) also displayed a similar replication ability to wild-type PCV2 (A135A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f007">Figure 7</xref>c). Surprisingly, PCV2 (G51A) and PCV2 (G73A) could not be rescued and obtained with the same operation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f007">Figure 7</xref>a&#x02013;c), which might be due to the replacement of these key arginine residues related to HS binding ability would cause the impairment of virus binding to cell surface, which eventually lead to the inability of virions to complete the infection process [<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>We next performed the infectivity assay of mutant viruses with 100 &#x003bc;M EGCG treatment during the whole infective process.

Discussion</title><p>As the most prominent component of GTCs, EGCG displayed broad and distinguished anti-viral activity compared to other GTC members [<xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Here, we showed that EGCG exhibited an inhibitory effect on the PCV2 infection at the concentration of 100 &#x003bc;M, without causing significant toxicity to the host cells. EGCG acted directly on PCV2 virions rather than any cellular factors with or without the stimulation of virions, and EGCG inhibited virion attachment to host cells by competitively interacting with capsid with cell surface receptor, but it did not affect other post-binding stages.</p><p>Heparan sulfate is a linear, synthetic, acidic polysaccharide belonging to the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) family, which is widely distributed on the surface and in extracellular matrix of various mammalian cells [<xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. HS was attached to the protein core and consisted of repeating 1 to 4 linked disaccharide units, one of which is an &#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucosamine residue and the other is an anionic acid. HS chains acquired negative charge though epimerization and terminal sulfation processes, thereby facilitating HS in establishing electrostatic interaction with positively charged motifs and residues [<xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], including signaling pathway proteins, growth factors, plasma proteins, immune modulators and viral structural proteins [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In general, these protein ligands possessed distinct HS binding region, which acted as a complementary structure for heparin-protein interactions [<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Based on the known ligands&#x02019; structural details, the molecular modeling of protein-glycosaminoglycan revealed that HS binding regions formed a hydrophilic pocket wrapped around and folded over heparin oligosaccharides. The key factors to produce such hydrophilic pocket were the clusters contributed by basic amino acids, especially arginines and lysines [<xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>The EGCG interacted with PCV2 capsid. Due to the considerable affinity, this interaction could competitively impair the binding of capsid to HS, thereby inhibiting the attachment of virions to the host cell surface. Meanwhile, the EC could not interact with the virus capsid, and hence did not exert an antiviral effect. Structurally, EGCG possessed numerous hydroxyl radicals attached on an extra benzene ring which is not the case for EC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), and the result of molecular docking showed that these additional free radicals were involved in forming hydrogen bonds with ASP70 and ARG-73 of capsid. Indeed, the mutagenesis assay demonstrated that aspartic acids (ASP70 and ASP78) and arginines (ARG51 and ARG73) were essential for EGCG- capsid interaction. It is also worth noticing that the arginine residues of GAG ligand were also important for the formation of a center with a high positive charge density, which could electrostatically interact with the acidic groups of HS; this was supported by the result of the replacement of ARG51 and ARG73 which remarkably attenuated the affinity of capsid to HS. Based on these findings, we conclude that the interaction of EGCG with PCV2 capsid might primarily depend on the formation of hydrogen bonds by specific positively charged amino acids in capsid, such as ARG51 and ARG73, while newly formed links might thus interfere with the original electrostatic interaction between capsid and HS, resulting in the impairment of virus attachment to the cell surface.</p><p>In previous studies, EGCG showed similar antiviral activity against various viruses, EGCG inhibited the infection of PRRSV with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 48.2&#x02013;63.09 &#x003bc;M in vitro [<xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and EGCG exhibited an antiviral effect against JEV with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 4.9&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M in vitro [<xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In our study, the EC<sub>50</sub> of EGCG against PCV2 in vitro was calculated as 37.79 &#x000b1; 1.64 &#x003bc;M. These comparable findings suggested that the antiviral activity of EGCG in vitro did not reach the efficacy of traditional antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin. It is worth noting that although this level of potency of EGCG at this stage is not of practical value in the treatment of clinical virus infections, the identification of key amino acids of viral proteins that bind EGCG is valuable for the development of structure-based anti-virus drugs, such as the EGCG-based synthetic EGCG palmitate, whose EC<sub>50</sub> against PRRSV is decreased to 5.86&#x02013;12.69 &#x003bc;M, which is nearly 5 times lower than for the original EGCG [<xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. On the other hand, more research data focusing on in vivo antiviral effects of EGCG and detailed structural analysis of EGCG-protein interaction should be studied in future research to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the antiviral potential of EGCG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the National Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines for their support of MST instruments and technology, and also the instrumental and technical assistance on heparin column chromatography from technicians of general electric (GE) healthcare life sciences.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceptualization, J.L., J.G. and J.Z; methodology, J.L.; software, J.L.; validation, D.S., S.W.; formal analysis, J.L. and D.S.; investigation, D.S.; resources, Y.D.; data curation, J.L. and J.G.; writing&#x02014;original draft preparation, J.L.; writing&#x02014;review and editing, J.G. and J.Z.; visualization, J.L. and D.S.; supervision, J.G. and J.Z.; project administration, J.Z.; funding acquisition, J.Z.
