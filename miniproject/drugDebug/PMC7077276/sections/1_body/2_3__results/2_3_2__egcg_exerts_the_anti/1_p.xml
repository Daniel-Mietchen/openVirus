<p>The antiviral effect of EGCG might be exerted by targeting PCV2 virions, such as the effect on certain viral nucleic acids and proteins, or targeting host cells [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. To assess this issue, the time of addition assay was preformed, the cells were pretreated with EGCG and then inoculated with PCV2, or the PCV2 was premixed with EGCG before seeding to cells. Surprisingly, the inhibitory effect could not be detected with immunoblotting in the pre-treated cells group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>a), which was consistent with results of viral nucleic acid and titer determination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>b,c). Meanwhile, the prominent antiviral effect could be displayed in the pre-treated virions group with high EGCG concentration (100 μM), but non-sensitive to the low EGCG concentration (10 μM) pretreatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>a–c), suggesting the compound might interact with virions. To rule out the possibility that the EGCG might also act on some cellular factors activated only in the presence of virions or some intracellular signaling pathways induced by the virus stimulation, we performed the dilution assay. Briefly, virus samples were pretreated at a high EGCG concentration (100 μM), and thereafter diluted 10-fold before being inoculated on the cells, ensuring the cells were treated with compound at 10-fold lower concentrations (10 μM) than the viral particles; in such a way, the inhibitory phenomenon would disappear if the compound really targeted host cells only in the presence of virions. However, the antiviral effect could still be detected with immunoblotting, qPCR and virus titer determination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>d–f). Considering that the pretreatment of cells with 10 μM EGCG could not trigger antiviral activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f002">Figure 2</xref>a–c), this inhibition was attributed to the effect of 100 μM EGCG on virions, further supporting that EGCG performed an antiviral effect via directly targeting virions.
