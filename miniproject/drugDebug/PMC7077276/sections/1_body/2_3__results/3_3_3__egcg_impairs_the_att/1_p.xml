<p>To investigate which stage of the EGCG antiviral effect could be active during the PCV2 infective process, EGCG was added post-infection and incubated for various time. The results showed that compared with of the EGCG whole process treatment PCV2 infection, a significant inhibitory effect could not be detected with treatment for 4 h or 12 h after PCV2 infection, only a slight effect was observed when the post treatment duration reached 24 h (

Thereby, the binding assay was performed, the virions were added to the cell surface at 4 Â°C to achieve the binding event for 1 h, and the results indicated that bound PCV2 particles would decrease significantly in cells with the EGCG treatment measured by qRT-PCR (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f003">Figure 3</xref>c). This tendency was also detectable when the binding time was extended to 4 h to maximize virions binding, and the proportion of PCV2-attached cells reduced from about 85% to about 67% (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f003">Figure 3</xref>b,c). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that EGCG inhibited the binding of PCV2 to host cells, but exerted no distinct effect on downstream infection.
