<p>To test this hypothesis, and to identify the key amino acids for the interaction, we made a single-point mutation of these amino acids to alanine (A) residue and measured the affinity of each mutant to EGCG, the results of MST showed that the Kd of different mutants and EGCG could fluctuate significantly compared to the wild type (WT) capsid; among all the mutants, the D70A and D78A showed the loweest affinity to EGCG with Kd values of 863.67 ± 7.23 μM and 1061.33 ± 8.08 μM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>c,f), almost 10 times lower than the Kd of WT to EGCG (Kd = 98.03 ± 4.76 μM) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f004">Figure 4</xref>a). Additionally, mutants aimed at arginine (R) residues also exhibited comparable reduction in affinity to EGCG, the Kd values of R51A and R73A were 591.00 ± 5.57 μM and 971.00 ± 9.54 μM, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>b,e). These results indicated that ARG-51, ARG-73, ASP-70 and ASP-78 were critical for the interaction of EGCG with the PCV2 capsid. To further assess the effect of these amino acids on the binding properties of capsid to HS, the heparin column chromatography assay of different mutants was performed and it showed that the eluted level of R51A, D70A, R73A and D78A mutants was remarkably reduced, with 0.5 mg/mL EGCG, especially in the case of D70A and D78A mutants, which is consistent with the results of Kd determination. Meanwhile, the mutation targeted to arginine residues (R51A and R73A) displayed the most significant eluted reduction with 0.5 mg/mL heparin (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f006">Figure 6</xref>g). Taken together, these results indicated that the ARG-51, ARG-73, ASP-70 and ASP-78 of PCV2 capsid protein were crucial for its interaction with EGCG, and the two arginine residues were also essential for binding with cell surface HS.
