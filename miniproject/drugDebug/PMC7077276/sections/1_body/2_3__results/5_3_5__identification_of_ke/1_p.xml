<p>To further investigate the detailed structural character of the interaction between EGCG and capsid, the flexible docking model of the complex was established with AutoDock software 4.2 (Olson Lab, 
 <uri xlink:href="http://autodock.scripps.edu" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://autodock.scripps.edu</uri>). The crystal structure of PCV2 dcapsid was obtained as PDB accession ID:3R0R and the whole domain of protein was docked with ligand. Several docking model structures were obtained, and the one with the lowest interface energy was adopted for further analysis, which showed that each EGCG molecule could be attached to a capsid monomer at a distinct pocket, which was completely exposed to the surface of PCV2 particles according to the revealed structure of the PCV2 VLPs [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f005">Figure 5</xref>a), among which ARG-51, GLY 54, ASP-70, ARG-73, ASN-75, and ASP-78 were predicted to engage in hydrogen bonds with EGCG (
