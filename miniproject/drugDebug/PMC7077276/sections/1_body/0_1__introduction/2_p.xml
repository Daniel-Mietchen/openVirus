<p>The primary attachment of the non-enveloped virus on the host cells is based on a low-affinity interaction between viral structural protein and cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) receptors [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. GAGs include heparan sulfate (HS), keratan sulfate (KS), and chondroitin sulfate (CS), which are characterized by disaccharide units forming blocks of polysaccharides [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Among these GAGs, HS is the most common polysaccharide molecule utilized by viruses for attachment to cell surfaces, such as the hepatitis C virus [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], herpes simplex virus 1 [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], human enterovirus 71 [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and rabies virus [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. PCV2 has also been verified to use cell surface HS as attachment receptor, and adopts a distinct non-symmetrical receptor distributed pattern on the virion with a multitude of weak HS binding sites [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Chemical molecules acting as receptor mimics that interfere with HS-virion interactions might exhibit antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, there are very few reports of PCV2 infection inhibition available for pertaining to such natural small molecule compounds.
