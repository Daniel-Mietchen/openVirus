<p>Circovirus is one of the smallest non-enveloped viruses with a single-stranded circular genomic DNA and classified in the genus 
 <italic>Circovirus</italic> of family 
 <italic>Circoviridae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It infects various species ranging from plants to animals with different pathogenicities [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is a prototype circovirus that causes significant morbidity and mortality in swine [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and is associated with different syndromes, such as the post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and reproductive disorder [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The genome of PCV2 contains two major open reading frames (ORFs). 
 <italic>ORF1</italic> encodes the replicase protein (Rep) involved in rolling-circle viral DNA replication, while 
 <italic>ORF2</italic> encodes the unique viral structural protein capsid [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which is involved in diverse and essential biological events during virus infection, such as virion attachment [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].
