<p>EGCG was serially diluted to 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25 and 3.125 μM, and was added to PK-15 cells which were infected with PCV2 at MOI = 1.0. EGCG was present during whole PCV2 infection. The infected cells without EGCG treatment was set as mock control. TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was determined at 72 hpi and the values of inhibition were calculated as 1 − TCID
 <sub>50(compound)</sub>/TCID
 <sub>50(mock)</sub> × 100%. The values of inhibition and EGCG concentration were used to establish a dose response curve and further calculate the EC
 <sub>50</sub> (concentration for 50% of maximal effect).
