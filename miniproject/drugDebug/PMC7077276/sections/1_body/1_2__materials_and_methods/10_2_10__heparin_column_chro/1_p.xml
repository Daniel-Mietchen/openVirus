<p>The purified recombinant PCV2 dcapsid were bound to a 5-mL HiTrapâ„¢ Heparin-Sepharose HP Column (17040701, GE Healthcare, Los Angeles, CA, USA) in loading buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.3 M NaCl, pH 7.4) at a flow rate of 1 mL per minute. The column was washed with 10 mL loading buffer to remove excess molecules, and thereafter eluted with soluble heparin, EGCG or EC competitor in loading buffer. The remaining bound protein was ultimately eluted with 3 M NaCl in loading buffer because the electrostatic interactions between Heparin-Sepharose and heparin-binding proteins could be disrupted by high salt concentrations. The original and eluted fractions were diluted to equal volumes, and analyzed using Western immunoblotting with the mAb 5E11 and HRP- goat anti-mouse IgG. The intensities of the immunoreactive protein bands were measured using Image J software (Version 1.52 g, ImageJ, Bethesda, MD, USA).</p>
