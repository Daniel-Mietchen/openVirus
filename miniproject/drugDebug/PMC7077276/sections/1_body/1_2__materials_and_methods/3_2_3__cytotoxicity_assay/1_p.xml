<p>The cytotoxicity assay of compounds was performed using enhanced CCK8 kit (C0014, Beyotime, Shanghai, China) according to the standard instructions. PK-15 cells seeded into 96-well plate was treated with different concentrations of EGCG or EC for 12 h. Subsequently, 10 μL CCK8 reagent per well was added into the culture medium and after 1 h of incubation, absorbance value (A450) was measured by a spectrophotometer. The cell viability was calculated as (A450
 <sub>compound</sub>/A450
 <sub>mock</sub>) × 100%.
