<p>The EGCG interacted with PCV2 capsid. Due to the considerable affinity, this interaction could competitively impair the binding of capsid to HS, thereby inhibiting the attachment of virions to the host cell surface. Meanwhile, the EC could not interact with the virus capsid, and hence did not exert an antiviral effect. Structurally, EGCG possessed numerous hydroxyl radicals attached on an extra benzene ring which is not the case for EC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00176-f001">Figure 1</xref>a), and the result of molecular docking showed that these additional free radicals were involved in forming hydrogen bonds with ASP70 and ARG-73 of capsid. Indeed, the mutagenesis assay demonstrated that aspartic acids (ASP70 and ASP78) and arginines (ARG51 and ARG73) were essential for EGCG- capsid interaction. It is also worth noticing that the arginine residues of GAG ligand were also important for the formation of a center with a high positive charge density, which could electrostatically interact with the acidic groups of HS; this was supported by the result of the replacement of ARG51 and ARG73 which remarkably attenuated the affinity of capsid to HS. Based on these findings, we conclude that the interaction of EGCG with PCV2 capsid might primarily depend on the formation of hydrogen bonds by specific positively charged amino acids in capsid, such as ARG51 and ARG73, while newly formed links might thus interfere with the original electrostatic interaction between capsid and HS, resulting in the impairment of virus attachment to the cell surface.
