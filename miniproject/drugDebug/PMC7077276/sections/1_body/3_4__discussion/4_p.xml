<p>In previous studies, EGCG showed similar antiviral activity against various viruses, EGCG inhibited the infection of PRRSV with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 48.2–63.09 μM in vitro [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and EGCG exhibited an antiviral effect against JEV with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 4.9–20 μM in vitro [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. In our study, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of EGCG against PCV2 in vitro was calculated as 37.79 ± 1.64 μM. These comparable findings suggested that the antiviral activity of EGCG in vitro did not reach the efficacy of traditional antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin. It is worth noting that although this level of potency of EGCG at this stage is not of practical value in the treatment of clinical virus infections, the identification of key amino acids of viral proteins that bind EGCG is valuable for the development of structure-based anti-virus drugs, such as the EGCG-based synthetic EGCG palmitate, whose EC
 <sub>50</sub> against PRRSV is decreased to 5.86–12.69 μM, which is nearly 5 times lower than for the original EGCG [
 <xref rid="B45-viruses-12-00176" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. On the other hand, more research data focusing on in vivo antiviral effects of EGCG and detailed structural analysis of EGCG-protein interaction should be studied in future research to facilitate a more comprehensive assessment of the antiviral potential of EGCG.
