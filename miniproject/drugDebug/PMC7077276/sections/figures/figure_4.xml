  <p>EGCG competitively inhibited capsid binding to heparan sulfate. (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>) EGCG could interact with capsid or with heparin. The dcapsid protein was labeled with the Cy5 fluorophore and incubated with two-fold serial dilutions of EGCG or heprarin (10–50 nM), and then the Kd values of the dcapsid were measured for EGCG (
   <bold>a</bold>), heparin (
   <bold>b</bold>), and EC (
   <bold>c</bold>) were measured by MST. (
   <bold>d</bold>,
   <bold>e</bold>) EGCG eluted dcapsid protein bound to a heparin column with similar efficiency as heparin. Heparin-Sepharose HP column was pre-loaded with dcapsid and eluted with 0.05 (
   <bold>d</bold>) or 0.5 (
   <bold>e</bold>) mg/mL soluble competitor reagents (heparin, EGCG and EC). The eluted samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Three independent experiments were conducted. The results are presented as Mean ± SD and compared using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (n.s., not significant; * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
