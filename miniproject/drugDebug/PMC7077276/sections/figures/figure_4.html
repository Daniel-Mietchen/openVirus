 <caption> EGCG competitively inhibited capsid binding to heparan sulfate. ( a– c) EGCG could interact with capsid or with heparin. The dcapsid protein was labeled with the Cy5 fluorophore and incubated with two-fold serial dilutions of EGCG or heprarin (10–50 nM), and then the Kd values of the dcapsid were measured for EGCG ( a), heparin ( b), and EC ( c) were measured by MST. ( d, e) EGCG eluted dcapsid protein bound to a heparin column with similar efficiency as heparin. Heparin-Sepharose HP column was pre-loaded with dcapsid and eluted with 0.05 ( d) or 0.5 ( e) mg/mL soluble competitor reagents (heparin, EGCG and EC). The eluted samples were analyzed using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. Three independent experiments were conducted. The results are presented as Mean ± SD and compared using Student’s t-test (n.s., not significant; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
