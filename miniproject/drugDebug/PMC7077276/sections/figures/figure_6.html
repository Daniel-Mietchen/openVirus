 <caption> Verification of key amino acids involved in the interaction of EGCG with capsid. ( a– f) The affinity impairment of capsid to EGCG induced by the key amino acid mutation. The Cy5 fluorophore labeled dcapsid mutants were incubated with two-fold serially dilutions of EGCG at room temperature for 15 min before being tested with MST, and the Kd values between EGCG and capsid mutants R51A ( a), G54A ( b), D70A ( c), R73A ( d), N75A ( e) and D78A ( f) were measured, respectively. ( g) The eluted level of capsid mutants bound to the heparin column. Heparin column preloaded with dcapsid mutants was eluted with 0.5 mg/mL soluble heparin or EGCG. The eluted level of each mutants was analyzed using immunoblotting. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments were statistically analyzed using Student’s t-test (* p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
