  <p>Molecular docking model of interaction between EGCG and PCV2 Capsid. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Structural diagram of EGCG-capsid complex based on the flexible docking model. The amino acids involved in the formation of the pocket accommodating EGCG molecule (green) were labeled blue in the dcapsid (light grey) in the zoom graph. (
   <bold>b</bold>) The putative amino acids (yellow) in dcapsid that could establish hydrogen bonds with EGCG (green) based on the docking model. The predicted hydrogen bonds are shown as a yellow dotted line. (
   <bold>c</bold>) The conservation of the key amino acids in the capsid to maintain the interaction among PCV2 subtypes. All the amino acid sequence data were obtained from GenBank. Among the predicted amino acids which might form hydrogen bonds with EGCG, the ones with high conservation (ARG-51, GLY 54, ASP-70, ARG-73 and ASP-78) are highlighted with a red frame, and the rest (ASN-75) are labeled with a green frame.
