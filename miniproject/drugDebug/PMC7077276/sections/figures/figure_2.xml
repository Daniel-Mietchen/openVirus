  <p>EGCG inhibits the PCV2 infectivity by directly targeting virions. (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>) Cells were pre-exposed to 10 μM or 100 μM EGCG for 60 min at 37 °C, then infected with PCV2 at MOI = 1.0 for 1 h, alternatively, virus was pre-mixed with EGCG under the same condition before being added to the cells, then the cells were cultured without EGCG. At 72 hpi PCV2 infectivity was assessed by viral protein expression (
   <bold>a</bold>), viral genome copies (
   <bold>b</bold>), and virus titers (
   <bold>c</bold>). (
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) Virions were pretreated with 100 μM EGCG and thereafter diluted 10-fold prior to infecting cells, which were cultured without EGCG and tested with immunoblotting (
   <bold>d</bold>), qPCR (
   <bold>e</bold>), and virus titers determination (
   <bold>f</bold>). Three independent experiments were performed and the results were compared using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (n.s., not significant; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
