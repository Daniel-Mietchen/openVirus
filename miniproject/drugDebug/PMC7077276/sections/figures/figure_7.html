 <caption> Regulation of EGCG antiviral activity by replacement of key amino acids in capsid. ( a, b) The infectivity of rescued PCV2 mutants. The rescued PCV2 mutant virus was inoculated into PK-15 cells at MOI = 1.0; at 72 hpi the cell samples were detected by IFA ( a), and the capsid expression was measured by immunoblotting ( b). ( c) One-step growth curve of PCV2 mutants. PK-15 cells were inoculated with mutant viruses at MOI = 1.0, TCID 50 at various time points were determined by IFA and calculated according to the Reed-Muench method. ( d– i) Antiviral effect of EGCG on PCV2 mutants. PK-15 cells were infected by mutant viruses at MOI = 1.0 with 100 μM EGCG treatment during the whole infective process and the titers were detected by IFA at 72 hpi. Mean ± SD of three independent experiments were statistically analyzed using Student’s t-test (* p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
