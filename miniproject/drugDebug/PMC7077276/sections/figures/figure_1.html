 <caption> EGCG exhibits an anti-viral effect on PCV2 infection. ( a) Molecular structure of EGCG and EC. ( b) Cytotoxicity assay of soluble EGCG and EC. PK-15 cells were added with a concentration of 0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 μM EGCG or EC and cultured for 24 h, 72 h and 120 h, respectively. Cell vitality was detected by CCK8 assay and calculated as (A450 compound / A450 mock) × 100%. ( c) One-step growth curve of PCV2 with EGCG treatment. PK-15 cells were inoculated with PCV2 at MOI = 1.0 and cultured with 100 μM EGCG or EC treatment. TCID 50 at various time points were determined by IFA and calculated according to the Reed-Muench method. ( d– f) EGCG inhibited the infectivity of PCV2. PK-15 cells were inoculated with PCV2 at MOI=1.0 with EGCG or EC addition. ( d) The expression inhibition of PCV2 capsid protein was detected by immunoblotting at 72 hpi. ( e) PCV2 genome copies were measured by real-time PCR. ( f) Indirect IFA detection of PCV2 infected cells. ( g) Dose response curve and EC 50 of the EGCG’s antiviral effect on PCV2. The mean ± SD of three independent experiments was compared using Student’s t-test (n.s., not significant; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
