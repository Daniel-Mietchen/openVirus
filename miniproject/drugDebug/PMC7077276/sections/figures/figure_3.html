 <caption> EGCG prevents PCV2 virions binding to host cells. ( a) Cells were inoculated with PCV2 at MOI = 1.0 with 100 μM EGCG treatment during all the phases, or followed by post-treatment of EGCG for 4 h, 12 h and 24 h, respectively, after which the cells were maintained without EGCG until determined with immunoblotting at 72 hpi. ( b, c) Virus was added to PK-15 cells at MOI = 5.0 in the presence of 100 μM EGCG. After the binding for 1 h or 4 h at 4 °C. the genome copy numbers of the attached virions were determined using the qPCR method ( b); PCV2-attached cells were measured by flow cytometry ( c). Mean ± SD of three independent experiments were shown and Student’s t-test was conducted for statistical analysis (* p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01). </caption>
