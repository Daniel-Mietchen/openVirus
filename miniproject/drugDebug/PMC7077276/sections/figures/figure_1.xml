  <p>EGCG exhibits an anti-viral effect on PCV2 infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Molecular structure of EGCG and EC. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Cytotoxicity assay of soluble EGCG and EC. PK-15 cells were added with a concentration of 0, 10, 50, 100 and 200 μM EGCG or EC and cultured for 24 h, 72 h and 120 h, respectively. Cell vitality was detected by CCK8 assay and calculated as (A450
   <sub>compound</sub> / A450
   <sub>mock</sub>) × 100%. (
   <bold>c</bold>) One-step growth curve of PCV2 with EGCG treatment. PK-15 cells were inoculated with PCV2 at MOI = 1.0 and cultured with 100 μM EGCG or EC treatment. TCID
   <sub>50</sub> at various time points were determined by IFA and calculated according to the Reed-Muench method. (
   <bold>d</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>) EGCG inhibited the infectivity of PCV2. PK-15 cells were inoculated with PCV2 at MOI=1.0 with EGCG or EC addition. (
   <bold>d</bold>) The expression inhibition of PCV2 capsid protein was detected by immunoblotting at 72 hpi. (
   <bold>e</bold>) PCV2 genome copies were measured by real-time PCR. (
   <bold>f</bold>) Indirect IFA detection of PCV2 infected cells. (
   <bold>g</bold>) Dose response curve and EC
   <sub>50</sub> of the EGCG’s antiviral effect on PCV2. The mean ± SD of three independent experiments was compared using Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic>-test (n.s., not significant; * 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05; ** 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01).
