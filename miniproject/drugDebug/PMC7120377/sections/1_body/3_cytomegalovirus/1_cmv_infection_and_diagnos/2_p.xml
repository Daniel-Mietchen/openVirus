<p>Serologic studies of CMV-IgM antibodies are helpful for the diagnosis of primary infections. Viral culture techniques use the “shell vial” assay and CMV early antigens. Molecular techniques to detect CMV early antigen or CMV DNA increase sensitivity for detecting CMV infection in blood and end organ tissue. To clearly establish the diagnosis of active CMV infection, it is necessary to have histological evidence of cellular injury associated with infection. Distinct pathologic findings on liver biopsy are important for the diagnosis of CMV hepatitis, especially in immunocompromised hosts. Giant multinucleated cell reaction with an inflammatory response, multifocal necrosis, and biliary stasis are common. Large nuclear inclusion-bearing cells, the so-called owl’s eye inclusions, are detected in hepatocytes or in bile duct epithelium.</p>
