<p>For severe cases, particularly in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, therapy can be life-saving [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Drugs approved for treatment of CMV disease include ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. Ganciclovir is considered the antiviral agent of choice against CMV. The duration of therapy is guided by repeated measurements of CMV in blood samples. Emerging strains resistant to ganciclovir pose a therapeutic challenge for which foscarnet or cidofovir may become alternative antiviral agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Valganciclovir has recently been evaluated among liver transplant recipients with CMV disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Ganciclovir can lead to myelosuppression, central nervous system disorders, hepatotoxicity, irreversible infertility, or teratogenesis, whereas foscarnet can cause disturbances in mineral and electrolyte homeostasis and nephrotoxicity. Long-term administration of these agents may lead to the emergence of resistant viral strains [
