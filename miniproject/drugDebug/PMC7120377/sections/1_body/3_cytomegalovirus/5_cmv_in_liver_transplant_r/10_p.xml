<p>For antiviral prophylaxis, antiviral drugs such as ganciclovir and valganciclovir are administered to patients at risk of CMV disease after liver transplantation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. While there is no clear consensus regarding antiviral prophylaxis, it is administered by the majority of transplant centers for prevention of primary CMV disease in high-risk CMV D+/R− transplant recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Prophylaxis is recommended in all CMV D+/R− liver recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Several clinical trials have demonstrated its effectiveness in preventing the direct and indirect effects of CMV after liver transplantation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Compared to placebo, patients who received antiviral prophylaxis had a 58–80 % reduction in CMV disease and a 40 % reduction in CMV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The use of acyclovir as anti-CMV prophylaxis after liver transplantation has been supplanted by ganciclovir and valganciclovir because of their superior efficacy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Prophylactic versus preemptive therapy for intermediate- and low-risk groups (D+/R+, D−/R+, and D−/R−, respectively) is based on the local expertise of each transplant center. However, the general approach for D−/R− patients is that only seronegative blood products are used and no prophylaxis is administered. D+/R+ or D−/R+ patients are monitored for CMV reactivation and treated preemptively for 7 days. Where available, “protective matching” of donor and recipient based on CMV serological status is advocated because it has been shown to reduce the risk of post-transplant CMV disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. The current recommendation for antiviral treatment of CMV disease after liver transplantation is intravenous ganciclovir along with a reduction in the degree of pharmacologic immunosuppression [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Valganciclovir is a possible oral treatment for mild to moderate disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In cases of ganciclovir-resistant CMV disease, treatment options include foscarnet, cidofovir, CMV hyperimmune globulins, or leflunomide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Compartmentalized CMV disease refers to clinical syndromes wherein the virus is detected in the affected tissues but is minimally detectable or undetectable in the blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In the gastrointestinal system, “compartmentalized” CMV disease in the form of gastritis, esophagitis, enteritis, or colitis constitutes the vast majority of tissue-invasive conditions [
