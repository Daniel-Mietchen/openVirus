<p>There are two strategies for CMV disease prevention after liver transplantation: preemptive therapy and antiviral prophylaxis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. For preemptive therapy, CMV reactivation is monitored by sensitive assays; upon detection, antiviral drugs are administered early to halt progression of the asymptomatic infection to full-blown clinical disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Preemptive therapy with oral ganciclovir or intravenous ganciclovir or valganciclovir resulted in reduction of CMV disease by 70 % [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>], and, unlike antiviral prophylaxis, was not associated with late-onset CMV disease. Valganciclovir is currently the most commonly used drug for preemptive therapy. Preemptive therapy may not be completely effective in CMV D+/Râˆ’ liver transplant recipients because the replication kinetics of CMV in immune deficient individuals is very rapid [
