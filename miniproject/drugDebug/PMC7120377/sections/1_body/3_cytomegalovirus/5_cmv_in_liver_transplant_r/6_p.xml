<p>Several indirect outcomes in these patients are mediated by the ability of the virus to modulate the immune system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. CMV is known to be a potent up-regulator of alloantigens, thereby increasing the risk of acute rejection and chronic allograft dysfunction. CMV is associated with vanishing bile duct syndrome and ductopenic rejection, leading to chronic cholestasis and allograft failure and with a higher incidence of hepatic artery thrombosis. The immunomodulatory effects of CMV predispose to other opportunistic infections including fungi, other viruses, and bacteria such as
