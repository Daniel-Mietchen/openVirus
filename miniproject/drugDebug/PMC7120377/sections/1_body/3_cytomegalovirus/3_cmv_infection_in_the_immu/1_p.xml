<p>In immunocompromised patients, CMV disease results either from a primary infection or, more commonly, from reactivation of a latent infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Disseminated CMV infections in immunocompromised patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity, including HIV-infected patients, transplant recipients, and congenitally infected patients, are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Anti-CMV antibodies are detected during episodes of reactivation. However, the incidence and severity of CMV disease closely parallels the degree of cellular immune dysfunction, characterized by decreased numbers of CTLs and natural killer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The clinical syndromes observed in these patients include encephalitis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, uveitis, retinitis, colitis, and graft rejection. CMV infection affecting the human embryo, a host with immature immunologic responses, may lead to serious complications such as microcephaly, mental retardation, spastic paralysis, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, thrombocytopenia, deafness, and optic nerve atrophy leading to blindness [
