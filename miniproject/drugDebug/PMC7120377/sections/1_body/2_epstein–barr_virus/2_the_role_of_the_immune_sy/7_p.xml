<p>CTLs are major determinants in the control of acute EBV infection and are directed against both lytic and latent antigens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. About half of the total CD8+ T cells in acute infection are specific for a single lytic EBV epitope, and most of these epitope-specific cells have an activated/memory phenotype. In the late stages of infection, the frequency of epitope-specific CD8+ T cells directed against latent EBV proteins selectively increases, confirming that CTLs are the most important cells for limiting infection in the convalescent phase of virus infection.
