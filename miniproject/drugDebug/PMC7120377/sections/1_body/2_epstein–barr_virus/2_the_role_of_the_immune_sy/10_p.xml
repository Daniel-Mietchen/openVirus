<p>While cellular immunity is fundamental for controlling both the primary and persistent phases of EBV propagation, the humoral response controls viral spread in late phases of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. EBV stimulates strong humoral responses to lytic cycle proteins. IgM and developing IgG responses to nucleocapsid and envelope proteins are detectable in primary EBV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. IgG responses to immediate-early and early lytic cycle proteins and to the latent proteins EBNA1 and 2 are also detectable, together with neutralizing antibodies directed against gp350 [
