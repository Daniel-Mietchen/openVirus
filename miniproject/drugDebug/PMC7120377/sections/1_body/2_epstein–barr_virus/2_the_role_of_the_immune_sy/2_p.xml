<p>Both the innate and the adaptive arms of the immune system play a role in anti-EBV immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. EBV interacts with NK cells, neutrophils, monocytes, and macrophages, as well as with epithelial cells that are relevant to viral resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The tonsils are the primary site for EBV infection. EBV triggers monocyte TLRs, inducing maturation of DCs, which activate CD16–CD56 bright NK cells via IL12. NK cells hamper pathogen entry at mucosal sites, thus restricting EBV infection until the adaptive immunity establishes viral immune control [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> secreted by DC-activated NK cells is associated with delayed latent EBV antigen expression. It inhibits B-cell transformation, decreasing their proliferation during the first week following infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> also promotes an EBV-specific adaptive immune response by favoring a Th1-polarization.
