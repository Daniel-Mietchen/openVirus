<p>The EBV genome is also detected in non-B cells, including phagocytes. Monocytes and macrophages are involved in the uptake of small vesicles called exosomes that contain viral mRNA. Exosomes play a role during the early phases of EBV infection and also involve innate immunity-related cell types that are not targeted by the virus [
