<p>Episodes of monocytopenia are observed during the acute phase of IM [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients with EBV-associated malignancy show a deficiency in monocyte-mediated ADCC, suggesting that monocyte functions are affected during the course of EBV infection. This is also demonstrated by the reduced phagocytic activity observed in EBV-infected monocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. EBV infection inhibits the functional ability of macrophages to respond to bacterial challenge by reducing their phagocytic potential [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. By inhibiting the differentiation of monocytes into mature DCs, EBV temporarily halts the onset of immune responses during primary infection, enabling efficient viral replication. This permits the accumulation of a large pool of virus-infected B lymphocytes, allowing access of the virus to the memory B-cell compartment, interfering with the functions of DCs during the initiation of virus-specific immunity, and modifying the profile of secreted cytokines, thus creating a favorable environment for viral propagation [
