<p>In lytic infections, the virus expresses a full complement of immediate-early, early, and late lytic cycle proteins and is capable of replicating within the host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In latent infection, the virus expresses fewer proteins, does not replicate, and is able to persist within the host cell. EBV has developed the ability to rapidly promote the expression of its own genes while simultaneously shutting down the transcriptional program of its host cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> levels are increased in IM patients, indicating its importance in ongoing antiviral response. However, the entire virus inhibits TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> secretion by monocytes and macrophages [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. EBV downregulates TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> mRNA transcripts via suppressive action at the transcriptional level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. EBV proteins can also modulate IFN signaling. This effect promotes viral persistence and may also contribute to tumor development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].
