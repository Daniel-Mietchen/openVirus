<p>In some patients with chronic liver disease caused by a major hepatotropic virus, a co-EBV infection was suggested. In a cohort of patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, patients with reactivated EBV infection had lower levels of HBV DNA and higher mean values of serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, respectively, compared to EBV patients without reactivation [

Reactivation of EBV-specific T cells promotes production of several cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, and IL-10. EBV BCRF1 shares high sequence homology with IL-10, and exogenous IL-10 enhances HCV replication. EBNA1 can promote HCV replication. IFN-γ inhibits HBV replication in the absence of cell necrosis. T-cell cross-activation may also explain HBV or HCV reactivation [
