<p>Of patients with X-linked lymphoproliferative disorder (XLP), approximately 60 % may develop a severe form of IM with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and fulminant hepatitis. Treatment consists of etoposide-based chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Early treatment of primary EBV infection in these patients (prior to development of HLH) may be comprised of treatment with anti-CD20 antibodies in combination with antivirals (acyclovir or ganciclovir), IVIG, or steroids.</p>
