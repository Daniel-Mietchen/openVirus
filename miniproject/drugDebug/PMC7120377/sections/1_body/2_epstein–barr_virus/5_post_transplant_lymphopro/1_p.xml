<p>PTLD is a spectrum of lymphoproliferative diseases occurring in the post-transplantation setting. EBV infection is the main cause of PTLD. The incidence of PTLD ranges from 0.5 to 30 % [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Risk factors for the development of PTLD include EBV-seronegativity at the time of transplantation, the type of organ transplanted, being highest in lung and heart and lowest in liver and kidney recipients, and the level and type of immune suppression (specifically anti-T-cell immunosuppression) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. PTLD complicates up to 10 % of pediatric liver graft recipients, with a mortality of up to 50 %. In the pediatric population, post-transplant primary infection within 3 months of OLT was associated with sustained EBV detection and increased the risk of the late occurrence of PTLD [
