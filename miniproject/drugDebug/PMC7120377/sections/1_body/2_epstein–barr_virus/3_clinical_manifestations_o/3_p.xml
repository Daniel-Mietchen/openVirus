<p>Compared with IM, which usually affects young patients, EBV hepatitis usually affects an older age group. In a recent review of nearly 2,000 cases in England, 10/17 patients (59 %) were aged &gt;30, and 7/17 (41 %) were â‰¥60 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. While 88 % had clinical or biochemical jaundice, 100 % had lymphocytosis, and 88 % had splenomegaly, only 12 % had the classic symptoms of IM. Symptoms lasted for a median of 8 weeks, and only 3/17 patients required a brief hospitalization. Severe cholestatic jaundice and right upper quadrant abdominal pain, which could be mistaken for bile duct obstruction, may occur in elderly patients [

In this setting, indirect hyperbilirubinemia resulting from EBV-associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia is more commonly the cause of jaundice than viral-induced cholestasis. Other occasional clinical settings for EBV liver involvement include posttransfusion hepatitis, granulomatous hepatitis, and fatal fulminant hepatitis [
