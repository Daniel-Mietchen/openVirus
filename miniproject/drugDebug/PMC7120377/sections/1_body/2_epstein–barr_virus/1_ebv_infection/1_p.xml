<p>EBV is a double-stranded DNA virus that is a member of the gamma herpes virus family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Its genome consists of a linear DNA molecule that encodes nearly 100 viral proteins. Expression of different combinations of these proteins allows the virus to establish different forms of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Cell entry and translocation of EBV particles to the nucleus is confirmed by detection of the EBV genome in isolated nuclei [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. While B cells in the oropharynx may be the primary site of infection, resting memory B cells are thought to be the site of persistence of EBV throughout the body. EBV has evolved several strategies to evade immune system recognition and to establish latent infection in memory B cells, where it resides lifelong without any consequence in the majority of individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. After infecting B lymphocytes, the linear EBV genome becomes circular, forming an episome, which usually remains latent in these B cells. Only ten of the viral proteins are expressed in latently infected B cells in vitro. Limited gene expression during latency ensures successful escape from cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) recognition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. EBV shares the tendency of establishing latency in the host with other herpes viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Viral replication is spontaneously activated in only a small percentage of latently infected B cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].
