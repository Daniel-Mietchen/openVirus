<p>Diagnosis of EBV infection is based on clinical features and on laboratory and serological findings indicative of a recent infection. The most common is leukocytosis, which appears in 70 % of cases, predominantly as lymphocytosis and monocytosis, as well as mild thrombocytopenia in up to 50 % of affected individuals. EBV-specific IgG and IgM antibodies directed against the viral capsid antigens (VCA), the early antigens (EBV anti-D and anti-R), the nuclear antigen (EBVNA), and soluble complement-fixing antigens (anti-S) are used for viral detection [

In the vast majority of cases, there is no indication for liver biopsy, but when performed there may be portal and sinusoidal mononuclear cell infiltration with focal hepatic necrosis or fatty infiltration [

Specifically, the diagnosis of EBV hepatitis is established based on the combination of elevated aminotransferases, serology compatible with active EBV infection, typical findings on liver biopsy, and demonstration of the presence of the viral genome in liver tissue by various molecular methods.
