<p id="p0095">Antiviral medications are related to many drug interactions. Severe COVID-19 patients tend to have underlying diseases, and the combined symptomatic drugs are more complicated. Therefore, in order to avoid symptoms aggravation due to drug interactions, pharmacists should be highly vigilant for potential drug-drug or drug-food interactions, strengthen the management of patientsâ€™ medication and diet. Taking lopinavir-ritonavir as an example, clinicians and pharmacists should avoid combining other drugs metabolized by the CYP3A enzyme (nifedipine, atorvastatin, midazolam, etc.), and educate patients not to eat foods that affect the CYP3A enzyme (grapefruit, honey, etc.). In addition, in the current clinical practice, it has been proved that integrated traditional Chinese and western medicine has a certain effect on COVID-19. Pharmacists should also strengthen the interaction management between traditional Chinese and western medicine, and recommend patients to take medicines at intervals.</p>
