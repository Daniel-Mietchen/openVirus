<p id="p0090">No specific therapeutic drug has been proved to treat COVID-19 currently. Related antiviral drugs of pre-approval access are in ongoing clinical trials, including anti-influenza drugs, anti-HIV drugs and anti-malaria drugs. Evidence-based medical researches on medication efficacy for COVID-19 are still lacking. Therefore, pharmacists should cooperate with clinicians to closely monitor and evaluate the medication efficacy, gather evidence on drug efficacy during pharmaceutical care if possible, and keep optimizing medication regimens, to promote the COVID-19 treatment.</p>
