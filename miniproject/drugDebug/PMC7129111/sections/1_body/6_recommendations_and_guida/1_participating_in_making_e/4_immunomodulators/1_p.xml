 </xref> for patients with progressive worsening of oxygenation indicators and rapid progress in imaging, corticosteroids can be used conditionally in a short period of time. A retrospective study

  <sup>21</sup>
 </xref> showed that for COVID-19 patients with different clinincal classification, low-to-moderate corticosteroids have no significant difference in the time of virus clearance. For moderate cases, low-to-moderate corticosteroids have no significant difference in the time of improvement of lung imaging. Therefore, before taking corticosteroids into account, pharmacists should fully evaluate the patientsâ€™ individual conditions, and carefully balance clinical benefits and the medicaiton risk.
