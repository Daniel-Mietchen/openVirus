 <caption> Comparison of the efficacy of favipiravir and oseltamivir in lethal influenza virus infection. Mice were infected with 3 × 10 4 plaque forming units of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus and were orally administered favipiravir and oseltamivir at doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg/day for 5 days beginning at 1 h post-infection ( n = 14). The results presented in this figure were obtained from a representative experiment. * P &lt; .01 compared to 0.5% methylcellulose solution-treated controls and oseltamivir-treated groups (log-rank test).
