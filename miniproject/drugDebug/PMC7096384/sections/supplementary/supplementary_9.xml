  <p>The effect of pre-incubation or post-incubation of cathelicidins on viral replication of H1N1/PR8 strain. PR8 infection in HD11 cells 
   <bold>(A)</bold> or MDCK cells 
   <bold>(B)</bold> for pre-incubation with cathelicidins. PR8 infection in HD11 cells 
   <bold>(C)</bold> or MDCK cells 
   <bold>(D)</bold> for post-incubation with cathelicidins. Viral infection was determined by immunofluorescent detection of IAV nuclear protein. Three images per well were taken and the infected cells were counted. The infection rate in the presence of cathelicidins was normalized against virus-only control wells. Data are represented as mean Â± SEM of two independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment.
