 <caption> The effect of CATH-B1 on PR8-induced immune response in HD11 cells. Cytokine expression in HD11 cells at 8 hpi in the presence or absence of peptides. Relative gene expression levels were normalized against the expression levels of the house keeping gene GAPDH. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. ∗ p ≤ 0.05; ∗∗ p ≤ 0.01; ∗∗∗ p ≤ 0.005; **** p ≤ 0.001. </caption>
