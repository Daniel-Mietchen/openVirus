<p>To investigate the anti-IAV activity of cathelicidins, three IAV strains (H1N1/PR8, H3N1 and H5N1) were used in this study. Both HD11 and MDCK cells were inoculated with IAVs in the presence or absence of 5 μM cathelicidins for 1 h. After 1 h, viruses and peptides were removed, and cells were incubated for another 7 h. At 8 hours post infection (hpi), the number of infected cells was quantified by immunofluorescent labeling of the influenza nuclear protein. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>, the cathelicidins displayed different antiviral activities, which for some of them depended to some extent on the viral strain and the cell line used. PMAP-23 and K9 did not significantly inhibit infection. Interestingly, LL-37 only showed activity against H3N1 and to a lower extent H1N1 but not against H5N1, while the chicken cathelicidins were active against all three influenza strains with inhibition of infectivity of 40–70%. However, regardless of the cell line or viral strain used, CATH-B1 clearly displayed the strongest antiviral activity, inhibiting infection up to 80–90%.
