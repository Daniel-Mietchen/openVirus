<p>When cathelicidins and virus were sequentially added to cells (either pre- or post-incubation of peptide relative to virus inoculation), the inhibitory effect was mostly lost (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). This indicates that the antiviral effect of the peptides was not achieved through interaction with the HD11 or MDCK cells or by an inhibitory effect on viral replication after the viruses entered the cells, but that CATH-B1 likely blocked viral entry to the cells by direct interaction with the virus.
