<p>Virus infection resulted in induced gene expression of IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, but surprisingly not IFN-α. However, whether this lack of IFN-α gene expression was IAV strain specific was not further investigated. CATH-B1 downregulated PR8-induced gene expression of IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8, but the relative mRNA level of IFN-α was unaffected (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="FS2">Supplementary Figure S2</xref>). CATH-2 and LL-37 also showed similar effects on gene expression upon virus infection, but the inhibition was not as pronounced as observed for CATH-B1, correlating with the effect of the peptides on virus infection shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The effect of CATH-B1 on virus-induced gene expression was diminished when the cells were incubated with CATH-B1 prior to, or immediately after virus infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating that the reduction of the response results from the ability of the peptide to inhibit infection.
