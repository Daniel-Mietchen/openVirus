<p>CATH-B1 is different from the other three chicken cathelicidins in several ways. Besides some structural and sequence differences (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), it was reported to be exclusively present in the bursa of Fabricius. The peptide is expressed by secretory epithelial cells but is located after secretion surrounding bursal M-cells (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Goitsuka et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, CATH-1,-2, and -3 are mostly expressed in the bone marrow and at least for CATH-2 it was shown that it is present in specific granules in heterophils (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Sekelova et al., 2017</xref>) where the peptide is released upon infection (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Van Dijk et al., 2009</xref>). In order to determine if CATH-B1 is important 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> against viral infections, more detailed studies on its expression and localization are needed. If CATH-B1 is indeed only present in the bursa, only a limited antiviral role against for example infectious bursal disease virus can be envisioned, but not really against IAV or other repiratory or intestinal viruses. However, CATH-B1 gene expression seems not restricted to the bursa of Fabricius. Although at much lower levels than found in the bursa, CATH-B1 mRNA was present in several tissues, including spleen and multiple segments of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract of chicken (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Rodriguez-Lecompte et al., 2016</xref>). CATH-B1 gene expression was also observed in chicken HD11 macrophages and primary monocytes (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Sunkara, 2011</xref>). Finally, some studies have described induced gene-expression upon LPS and LTA stimulation 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that higher CATH-B1 levels in multiple tissues upon viral infection could be obtained.
