<p>In conclusion, this study showed the potential of CATH-B1 to bind and inhibit the infectivity of IAV, likely by interfering with HA-mediated virus-receptor binding and thereby blocking viral entry. This new activity is important to understand the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> role of this cathelicidin, but might also have important implications for the future development of new antivirals based on cathelicidins in general.
