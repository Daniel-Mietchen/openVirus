<p>The activity of NA in the presence of CATH-B1 toward the synthetic monovalent substrate 2′-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-alpha-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA) (Sigma-Aldrich) was determined using a fluorometric assay similarly to what was described previously (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Dai et al., 2017</xref>). In short, IAV was incubated with CATH-B1 (0–40 μM) for 1 h at 37°C, followed by addition of MUNANA for another 1 h at 37°C. Next, the reaction was stopped, and fluorescence intensity was measured using a FLUOstar Omega microplate reader. The activity of NA toward the sialylated glycoprotein fetuin was analyzed in a solid phase cleavage assay using a previously described enzyme linked lectin assay (ELLA) (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Du et al., 2019</xref>). Fetuin (2.5 ug/mL) was coated on Maxisorp Nunc 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Plates were incubated with IAV PR8 (1.78 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> PFU/mL) in the presence or absence of 5 μM CATH-B1 (in 50 mM Tris–HCl with 4 mM CaCl
 <sub>2</sub>, pH = 6) for 2 h at 37°C. Subsequently, the plates were washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 after which terminal galactose moieties were quantified using biotin-conjugated peanut agglutinin E. Cristagalli (ECA) lectin (Vector laboratories) (1.5 μg/ml) in combination with streptavidin-HRP (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (1:1000). After washing, TMB was added and plates were incubated for 1–4 min at room temperature. Sulfide acid (25%) was used to stop the reaction. Finally, the plate was read at OD450 nm using the FLUOstar Omega microplate reader. Final OD450 nm values are presented as OD450 nm
