<p>HD11 cells were infected with virus for 1 h at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 in the presence or absence of CATH-B1 as described above. After 8 or 24 h incubation, total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA, United States) reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA (500 ng) was reverse transcribed by the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad, Veenendaal, Netherlands) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers and probes were designed and produced by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Quantitative real time PCR was performed on a CFX Connect qPCR with CFX Manager 3.0 (Bio-Rad). Reactions were performed as follows: 3 min at 95°C; 40 cycles: 10 s at 95°C, 30 s at 60°C and 30 s at 72°C. Relative gene expression levels were normalized against the expression levels of the house keeping gene GAPDH.
