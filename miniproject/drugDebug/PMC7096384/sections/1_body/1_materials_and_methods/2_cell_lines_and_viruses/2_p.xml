<p>Influenza virus A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai (H1N1/PR8) and reassortant viruses were propagated in MDCK-II cells as described previously and stored aliquoted at −80°C until use. Generation of reassortant viruses H3N1 (containing the HA gene from A/Bilthoven/1761/76 (H3N2) in the genetic background of PR8) and H5N1 (containing the HA gene from A/duck/Hunan/795/2002 (H5N1) in the genetic background of PR8) was described previously (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Peeters et al., 2017</xref>). The H3N1 virus was kindly provided by Ron Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands). Virus titers were determined for MDCK-II cells by calculating 50% tissue culture infectious dose per ml (TCID50/mL) as described before (
