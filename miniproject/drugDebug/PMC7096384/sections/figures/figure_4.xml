  <p>The effect of CATH-B1 on PR8-induced immune response in HD11 cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Cytokine expression in HD11 cells at 24 hpi in the presence or absence of peptides. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Cytokine expression in HD11 cells for pre- or post-incubation with CATH-B1. Relative gene expression levels were normalized against the expression levels of the house keeping gene GAPDH. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of two or three independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. *
