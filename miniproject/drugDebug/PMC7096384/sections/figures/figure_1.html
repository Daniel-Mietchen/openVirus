 <caption> The antiviral effect of cathelicidins against 3 IAV strains (H1N1/PR8, H3N1 and H5N1). Cathelicidins were mixed with virus strains before addition to either HD11 or MDCK cells. H1N1/PR8 infection in the presence of cathelicidins of HD11 (A) or MDCK (B) cells. H3N1 infection in the presence of cathelicidins of HD11 (C) or MDCK (D) cells. H5N1 infection in the presence of cathelicidins of HD11 (E) and MDCK (F) cells. Viral infection was determined by immunofluorescent detection of IAV nuclear protein. Three images per well were taken and the infected cells were counted. The infection rate in the presence of cathelicidins was normalized against only virus-treated wells. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. * p ≤ 0.05;** p ≤ 0.01;*** p ≤ 0.005; **** p ≤ 0.001. </caption>
