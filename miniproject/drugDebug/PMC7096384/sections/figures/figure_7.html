 <caption> The effect of CATH-B1 on HA and NA activity. (A) NA activity of H1N1/PR8 was directly measured using MUNANA substrate in presence or absence of CATH-B1. (B) Desialylated N-glycans of fetuin were detected using HRP-conjugated ECA lectins, after incubation with H1N1/PR8 in presence or absence of CATH-B1. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of two independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. * p ≤ 0.05;** p ≤ 0.01. </caption>
