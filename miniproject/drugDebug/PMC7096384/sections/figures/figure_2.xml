  <p>Dose-dependent antiviral activity of CATH-B1 against IAV strains (H1N1/PR8, H3N1 and H5N1). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Viral infection in the presence of CATH-B1 in HD11 cells, 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Viral infection in the presence of CATH-B1 in MDCK cells. Viral infection was determined by immunofluorescent detection of IAV nuclear protein. Three images per well were taken and the infected cells were counted. The infection rate in the presence of cathelicidins was normalized against the virus only control wells. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of two independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. *
