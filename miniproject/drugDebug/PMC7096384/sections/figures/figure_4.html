 <caption> The effect of CATH-B1 on PR8-induced immune response in HD11 cells. (A) Cytokine expression in HD11 cells at 24 hpi in the presence or absence of peptides. (B) Cytokine expression in HD11 cells for pre- or post-incubation with CATH-B1. Relative gene expression levels were normalized against the expression levels of the house keeping gene GAPDH. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of two or three independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. * P ≤ 0.05;** P ≤ 0.01;*** P ≤ 0.005; **** P ≤ 0.001. </caption>
