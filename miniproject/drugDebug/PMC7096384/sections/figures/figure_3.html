 <caption> Cytotoxicity of cathelicidins. HD11 and MDCK cells were incubated with cathelicidins, and metabolic activity was tested using WST-reagent. (A) Metabolic activity of HD11 cells incubated for 24 h with cathelicidins. (B) Metabolic activity of MDCK cells incubated for 8 h with cathelicidins. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. * p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01. </caption>
