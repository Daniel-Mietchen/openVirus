  <p>Binding of CATH-B1 to PR8 virus. CATH-B1 was pre-incubated with H1N1 virus after which peptide and virus were separated using Capto beads. (Virus containing) supernatant was then used to infect HD11 cells. Viral infection was determined by immunofluorescent detection of IAV nuclear protein. Three images per well were taken and the infected cells were counted. The infection rate in the presence of CATH-B1 was normalized against virus-only control wells. Data are represented as mean ± SEM of three independent experiments of triplicate samples per experiment. *
