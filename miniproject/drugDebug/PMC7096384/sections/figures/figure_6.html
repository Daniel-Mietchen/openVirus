 <caption> The effect of CATH-B1 on viral morphology. Representative electron microscopic images of (A) H3N1 IAV alone (B–G) IAV pretreated with 20 μM and (H–J) 5 μM of peptides. Shown are representative images at 60,000x magnification (A–D) to visualize morphology of individual virus particles, or 16,500 × magnification (E–J) to visualize aggregation of viral particles. Large peptides aggregates (black arrows) containing viruses and small aggregates (dashed arrows) were visible at high concentration and low concentration of peptides, respectively. </caption>
