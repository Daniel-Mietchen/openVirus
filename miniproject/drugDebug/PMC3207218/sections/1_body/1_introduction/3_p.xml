<p>NS1 and PB1‐F2 are accessory proteins that promote virus replication indirectly by either subverting or promoting cellular signaling pathways. NS1 is a multifunctional protein, but its major function is to inhibit activation of the cellular innate immune response 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>. In the absence of NS1 expression, influenza virus is rendered non‐pathogenic in an immune‐competent host, and thus it is classified as a viral pathogenicity factor 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref>. PB1‐F2 is expressed from an alternative ORF in the 
 <italic>PB1</italic> gene. This ORF is absent in some viruses 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>, which obviously indicates that it is nonessential. However, its presence in pandemic strains or avian viruses correlates with increased lung inflammation and pathology, which contributes to increased virulence and therefore PB1‐F2 constitutes the second pathogenicity factor encoded by influenza virus
