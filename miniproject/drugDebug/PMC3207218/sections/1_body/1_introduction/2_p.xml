<p>Influenza virus initiates infection via attachment of HA to sialic acid‐containing proteins on the host cell membrane (Figure 
 <xref rid="rmv703-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The virus particle then enters the cell by pH‐dependent endocytosis, although there appears to be flexibility in the pathway that is used, with an estimated two thirds using a clathrin‐dependent pathway and the remaining third entering via an undefined pathway that is independent of both clathrin and caveolin 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2</xref>. Once in the acid environment of the late endosome, the HA undergoes a conformational change and drives fusion of the viral envelope with that of the endosome 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">3</xref>. In addition, the M2 protein, which has ion channel activity 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, pumps H+ ions into the interior of the virion and this dissociates M1 from the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (vRNPs). The released vRNPs enter the cytoplasm through the fusion pore and are transported into the nucleus via interaction of NP with karyopherin alpha proteins 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref>, which are part of the nuclear import machinery. Once in the nucleus, the incoming viral polymerase complex initiates genome transcription. In a process known as “cap‐snatching”, the PB2 protein binds to the 5′ methyl cap of cellular pre‐mRNAs, and the PA protein cleaves the pre‐mRNA to produce a capped primer that is used to start transcription

 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref>. The PB1 protein contains the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase activity, and it is also responsible for the addition of a poly(A) tail via a stuttering mechanism 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref>. PB1 also catalyzes genome replication, which occurs via a positive sense cRNA intermediate that is an exact copy of the vRNA. In the case of replication, it is still unclear whether initiation is primer‐dependent,—independent or a combination of both depending on anti‐genome or genome synthesis 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>. The newly‐synthesized vRNA, NP, and polymerase proteins are complexed together with M1 and NEP in the nucleus and via an interaction with Crm1, NEP exports the new vRNPs back out of the nucleus 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0012" ref-type="ref">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>. The assembly pathway for influenza virus is one of the least well‐understood stages of the viral life cycle. We know that the viral glycoproteins, HA and NA, traffic through the endoplasmic reticulum and accumulate at the plasma membrane in specific regions termed lipid raft domains 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>. These serve as a virus assembly platform, and the other components of the virion are recruited via mechanisms that have yet to be fully determined. Evidence strongly suggests that HA initiates bud formation, and it has recently been shown that the M2 protein provides membrane scission activity and thereby completes bud formation 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>. Finally, the neuraminidase activity of the NA protein is required to release virus from the cell by cleaving sialic acid attachments from HA and other surface glycoproteins
