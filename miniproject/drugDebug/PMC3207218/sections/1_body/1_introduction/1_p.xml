<p>Influenza viruses belong to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family, whose members are defined by a segmented, single‐stranded, negative‐sense RNA genome (which is replicated in the nucleus), and an envelope that is derived from the host cell 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1</xref>. Influenza A viruses have eight genome segments that encode for 10 or 11 viral proteins, depending on the strain. Nine of these proteins are found in the virion. These include the following: the HA, NA, and M2 proteins that are all inserted into the lipid envelope; the matrix (M1) protein that lies beneath the membrane; the NP that coats the viral genome; the polymerase complex (PB1, PB1, and PA) that is associated with the encapsidated genome; and the nuclear export protein (NEP). The remaining viral proteins, NS1 and PB1‐F2, are expressed in infected cells but are not packaged into the virus particle.
