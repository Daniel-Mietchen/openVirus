<p>Faced with this vast amount of new data, how does one progress to the identification of host factors that would make suitable targets for anti‐influenza virus drugs? Beyond anything else, it is important to gather more supporting information that the host factor plays a critical role in influenza virus replication. The precise mechanism of action will have to be elucidated, and it must be determined whether the required function is something that is amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. In some cases, small molecule inhibitors of the host factors already exist and can be used as validation for the requirement of that cellular function. For example, König 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> identified the calcium/calmodulin‐dependent kinase, CAMK2B, in their screen, and they showed that a specific inhibitor of this kinase, KN93, could inhibit influenza virus replication in a dose‐dependent manner. Similarly, Karlas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> showed that TG003, an inhibitor of CDC‐like kinase 1 (CLK1), can reduce influenza virus growth. When interpreting these results, one has to ensure that the inhibitor is specific for the intended target, as it is often the case that small molecules can inhibit multiple related proteins to varying extents. Apart from chemical inhibitors, it is also possible to test whether enzymatic activity is required by expressing dominant negative forms of the enzyme and determining whether this reduces influenza virus replication. Knock‐out mice, when available, are particularly beneficial in terms of examining whether the loss of the cellular factor has an impact on influenza virus replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and if this translates into reduced pathogenicity. This was demonstrated for one of the hits identified in the screens, where p27‐deficient mice were shown to have lower viral titers in their lungs compared with wild‐type mice 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. In addition, knock‐out mice provide evidence that the cellular factor is not required for viability. Although this is a comforting finding, it is unclear whether it is entirely necessary in order to support a case for a host factor as a drug target. With drug‐mediated inhibition, especially if treating an acute disease such as influenza, the loss of cellular function is temporary and it may be quite possible for the host to withstand this without deleterious consequences.
