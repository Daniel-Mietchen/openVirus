<p>Genome‐wide RNAi screens are proving to be a vital tool in our efforts to gather more information on host‐pathogen interactions because they provide a global view of all host factors that are required by a particular pathogen. For influenza virus, five studies have used this approach to define the cellular network that is critical for efficient replication of the virus. In addition to learning how these host factors facilitate virus replication, it is hoped that we can use this information to pursue new targets for antiviral therapy.</p>
