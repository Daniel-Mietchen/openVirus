<p>The first RNAi screen for influenza virus was performed by Hao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>. This was done in 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, as at that time the RNAi systems and tools were more advanced in this species. 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells are not permissive for influenza virus infection, so the authors generated a modified influenza virus. To enable the virus to enter, they replaced the HA gene with that of the glycoprotein from vesicular stomatitis virus. In the absence of HA, NA is not essential, so they also replaced the NA with a gene encoding 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase and this served as a convenient marker for virus gene expression. The 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells were shown to support entry and gene expression of this recombinant influenza A/WSN/33‐based virus, however, virus assembly was defective due to lack of expression of certain influenza virus proteins. Thus, this system could be used for detecting the stages of the influenza virus life cycle that cover post‐entry events up to and including gene expression. A library of dsRNA (Ambion) targeting 13 071 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes was screened for those that would reduce luciferase expression in cells infected with the recombinant influenza virus. The authors describe 176 primary hits, of which 110 could be confirmed with alternate dsRNAs. The human homologues for three selected genes (
 <italic>ATP6V0D1</italic>, 
 <italic>COX6A1</italic>, and 
 <italic>NXF1</italic>) were confirmed to be required for influenza infection of human cells, indicating that data from 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> screens can be translated to the human system.
