<p>The second, third, and fourth screens are probably the most similar in that each is a genome‐wide siRNA screen performed in human cells. Yet, all used distinct approaches. Brass

 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0021" ref-type="ref">21</xref> infected osteosarcoma (U2OS) cells with influenza A/PR/8/34 virus for 12 h and monitored infection by staining for cell surface expression of HA. This captures all stages of the life cycle up to and including HA trafficking to the cell surface. The authors targeted 17 877 genes using the Dharmacon siRNA library that comes in pools of four siRNAs per gene. They identified 312 pools that reduced HA surface expression, and of these, 129 genes were confirmed with at least two individuals siRNAs per gene. These represent the genes required by the virus. Another four genes (
 <italic>IFITM3</italic>, 
 <italic>PUSL1</italic>, 
 <italic>TPST1</italic>, and 
 <italic>WDR33</italic>) were identified as restriction factors because infection was enhanced in their absence. The first of these has been characterized in more detail along with other IFITM family members and shown to block entry of not only influenza virus but also West Nile virus, dengue virus, HIV‐1, filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus

 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">24</xref> used lung epithelial carcinoma (A549) cells for their genome‐wide RNAi screen. Using a similar strategy to that of Hao 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref>, they also engineered influenza A/WSN/33 virus so that it expressed 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase in place of HA. This recombinant virus was only capable of multi‐cycle growth in HA‐complementing cells and when used to infect A549, as done in the screen, it established a single round of infection. Thus, their screen captured everything from attachment up until viral gene expression, which was monitored via luciferase activity. They targeted 19 628 genes with an siRNA library from Qiagen and reported 295 primary hits for which at least two siRNAs per gene reduced luciferase expression. Of these, 219 genes were confirmed to be required in the context of wild‐type influenza A/WSN/33 virus infection. Karlas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> also used A549 cells and the Qiagen siRNA library (22,843 genes targeted) but they used a two‐step infection process that allowed them to capture the entire influenza virus life cycle. The siRNA‐transfected A549 cells were infected with influenza A/WSN/33 virus and stained for NP expression at 24 h post‐infection, which captured the early to mid stages of the life‐cycle. The supernatants from this infection were then transferred onto 293T cells, which contained an influenza‐specific luciferase reporter that is activated upon influenza virus infection. siRNAs that resulted in reduced luciferase expression here but did not affect the NP levels in the first round would indicate that the targeted gene was required for the assembly or release of virus particles, which was a unique aspect of this study. The authors report 287 primary hits from this screening approach, with 168 of these confirmed to reduce replication of either influenza A/WSN/33 or A/Hamburg/04/2009 (H1N1) viruses with at least two siRNAs per gene. Of note, 72 of these genes were commonly required by both influenza virus strains, and König 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also showed that 12 out of 12 selected hits were also required by influenza A/Netherlands/602/2009 (H1N1) virus, whereas only two of the 12 were required by vesicular stomatitis virus. This suggests that these RNAi screens are able to identify host factors that are specifically required by influenza viruses, as well as those that may be required for efficient replication of multiple viruses. The latter would of course be potential targets for antiviral agents with broad‐spectrum activity.
