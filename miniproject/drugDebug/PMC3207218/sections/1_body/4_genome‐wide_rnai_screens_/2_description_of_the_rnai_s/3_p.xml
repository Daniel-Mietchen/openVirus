<p>The fifth screen by Shapira 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref> used a very different approach from the other four. They did not perform a genome‐wide RNAi screen, but instead selected genes to target based on protein interaction and transcriptional response datasets. From yeast‐2‐hybrid screens performed with 10 influenza A/PR/8/34 virus proteins (all except PB1‐F2), they selected 259 genes that encode either direct interacting proteins or their first neighbors in the interaction network. A further 1056 genes were selected because they were shown to be transcriptionally regulated in response to influenza virus infection. Finally, 504 genes that encode proteins involved in several pathways found to be over‐represented in the datasets were selected for inclusion. In total, 1745 genes were targeted with siRNA pools from Dharmacon. The siRNAs were transfected into primary human bronchial epithelial cells, and growth of influenza A/PR/8/34 virus in these cells was monitored by transferring the supernatants onto 293T cells that contained an influenza polymerase‐driven reporter, similar to that used by Karlas 
 <italic>et al</italic>. 
 <xref rid="rmv703-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref>. This captures the entire life cycle from attachment until virus budding and release. In addition, these authors monitored the involvement of the selected host factors in the ability of the cells to induce interferon‐β in response to (i) infection with PR8 virus lacking NS1 expression and (ii) transfection with viral RNA. A total of 616 genes scored as hits in one of these assays with 220 of these being involved in influenza virus replication.
