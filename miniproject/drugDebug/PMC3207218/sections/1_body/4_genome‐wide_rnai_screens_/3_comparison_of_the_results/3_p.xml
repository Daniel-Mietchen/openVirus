<p>One of the possible reasons that there is not more overlap in the hits identified by the different screens is that each RNAi library contains siRNAs with varying efficacies for particular targets. (It should be noted that due to the use of multiple siRNAs per target, off‐target effects are not considered to be a major contributing factor). Those that made it to the hit‐list in each screen, will be those for which efficient knockdown was achieved in order for the biological effect on influenza virus replication to be observed. Yet, cellular proteins rarely act alone and if the virus is dependent on particular pathways or complexes, it is likely that depletion of any vital factor in that pathway will affect the virus. Therefore, despite the lower confidence level, useful information can still be obtained by analyzing the hits that were only identified in one screen. When combined with the list of 85 higher confidence hits, and analyzed for over‐represented functions or classifications, these unique hits change the ranking of enriched categories (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv703-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Factors involved in kinase signaling are now the most highly enriched, indicating that the addition of the unique hits has extended the support for this category. There are also some new categories that score highly, such as mitosis/cell cycle, translation initiation, phosphoinositide metabolism, and several others. This stresses the point that comparison of these screens at the pathway level rather than at the gene level will reveal more functional overlap and may also provide new information that would not be observed if studying the results of each screen in isolation.
