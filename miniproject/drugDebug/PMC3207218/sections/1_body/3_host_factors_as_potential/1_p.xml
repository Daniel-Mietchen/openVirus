<p>Almost all approved antiviral drugs on the market are highly specific for a particular virus or family of viruses by virtue of the fact that they target viral proteins. Understandably, this strategy is used because of the need to establish selectivity and to not cause undue harm to the host. The downside is that resistance is far more likely to develop if the target is virus‐encoded and also that there are a limited number of viral proteins that possess properties amenable to developing pharmaceutically acceptable inhibitors (“druggable”). As described above, all approved influenza antiviral drugs are directed at either the M2 or NA proteins. For small RNA viruses in particular, the number of host functions they rely on is likely to far outnumber the viral functions, so by identifying these required host factors, we will immediately increase the number of potential drug targets.</p>
