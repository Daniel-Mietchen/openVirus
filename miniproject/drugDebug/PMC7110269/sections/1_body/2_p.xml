<p id="Par3">Based on SARS and MERS coronaviruses, it was believed 2–14 days as incubation period for COVID-19. The Chinese researchers found that the incubation period could be 24 days and asymptomatic carriers were evidenced to transmit the COVID-19 also. The incubation period may be as long as 0–24 days in some cases (

The viral genomes, isolated from both bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cell cultures, were sequenced using next-generation sequencing, and found COVID-19 virus was similar to betacoronavirus ‘bat-SL-CoVZC45’. However, the remarkable exception was the spike protein, which is only 80% similar to bat coronaviruses. The envelope spike protein plays major role in binding to receptor, membrane fusion, and transmission capacity. Interestingly, it was more similar to SARS-CoV with respect to receptor-binding domain [
