<p id="Par5">Some clinical trials with remdesivir, ritonavir-boosted lopinavir monotherapy, have been launched (ChiCTR2000029308, NCT04257656). Xia et al. developed a pan-CoV fusion inhibitor, EK1 peptide, to inhibit the infection of five human coronaviruses including SARS-CoV. The same group showed that the EK1 peptide and the peptide derived from HR2 domain in spike protein of COVID-19 virus could effectively inhibit COVID-19 pseudo virus infection and domain S2 mediated cell fusion [
