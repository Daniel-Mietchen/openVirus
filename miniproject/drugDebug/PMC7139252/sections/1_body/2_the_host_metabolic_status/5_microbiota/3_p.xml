<p id="p0100">Interferons (IFNs) are the first line of immune defense against viral infection, particularly the type I IFNs and the type III IFNs, or IFN-λs [
 <xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Despite the preliminary understanding of their roles, IFN-λs are probably the critical antiviral cytokines in the respiratory epithelial surfaces during the early stages of viral infection. While the type I IFN signaling during acute viral infection increase the pro-inflammatory responses, their signaling in the persistent infection modulates the counter-regulatory immune responses [
 <xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Some gut microbiomes mediate the IFN responses to viral infection through their metabolites, such as the

 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Certain strains of 
 <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> also influence the IFN responses following the influenza infection [
