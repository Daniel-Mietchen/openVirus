<p id="p0225">It is a great tragedy for the ugly fact that a lot of world population will contract SARS-CoV infection. While specific treatment is not yet coming soon, individual preventive and protective measures drive the personal risk of getting the disease. Among the virus-infected hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19.
