<p id="p0135">As the integral part of several selenoproteins, including the glutathione peroxidases and thioredoxin reductases, selenium has a critical role in the defense against viral infection through its antioxidant, redox signaling, and redox homeostatic contributions [
 <xref rid="bb0470" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Selenium deficiency is associated with increased pathogenicity of several virus infections [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">[95]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0485" ref-type="bibr">[97]</xref>]. In the deficient state, the selenium supplementation is helpful for the prevention and treatment of viral infections [

 <xref rid="bb0490" ref-type="bibr">[98]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0495" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0500" ref-type="bibr">[100]</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that a mild strain of influenza virus, also shows increased virulence in selenium-deficient mice. Increased virulence is related to several modifications in the viral genome [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0505" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Furthermore, the immune response, such as proinflammatory chemokines, can be increased in selenium-deficient mice. Moreover, the mRNA expression of macrophage inflammatory protein-1α and -1β, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) were changed in selenium-deficient mice. The mRNA levels of cytokine were also modified in the selenium-deficient mice. IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 were increased, whereas

 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Therefore, selenium intake differentially affects numerous types of immune responses and related mechanisms, revealing an effective role of selenium-supplementation in viral diseases.
