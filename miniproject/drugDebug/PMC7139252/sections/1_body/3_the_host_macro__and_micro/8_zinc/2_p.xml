<p id="p0140">Zinc is an essential micronutrient with the crucial contributions to most enzymatic functions and the transcription regulations in the human body [
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0295" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Zinc is essential for normal function and development of cells regulating nonspecific immunity, including natural killer cells and neutrophils. Zinc is the main structural component of around 750 zinc-finger transcription factors [
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. The deficiency of zinc also modifies the development of acquired immunity by limiting both the certain and outgrowth functions of T lymphocytes, including the production and activation of Th1 cytokine [
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The function of macrophage also is adversely affected by the deficiency of zinc through the dysregulation of cytokine production, intracellular killing, and phagocytosis [
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. Zinc deficiency is surprisingly common in modern-day lifestyle [
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. Zinc deficiency impairs the antiviral immunity, particularly to herpes simplex, common cold, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [
 <xref rid="bb0520" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0525" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. A meta-analysis of oral zinc supplementation studies suggested beneficial effects on the shortened of symptoms and duration of common cold infection [

 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">[108]</xref>]. Zinc supplementation was also helpful against hepatitis C virus infection through the induction of metallothionein expressions [
 <xref rid="bb0545" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0550" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. Moreover, research has shown that zinc has antiviral effects; it improves immune responses and suppresses viral replication. Therefore, the consumption of up to 50Â mg zinc per day may provide a protective role against the COVID-19 pandemic, likely by improving the host's resistance against viral infection [
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. However, these studies did not account for the underlying zinc status in the studied participants.
