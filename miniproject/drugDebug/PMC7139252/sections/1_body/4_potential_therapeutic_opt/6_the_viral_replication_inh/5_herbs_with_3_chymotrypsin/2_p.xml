<p id="p0205">The 3 chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>) is essential for the replication of coronavirus, including MERS-CoV and SARS-COV, which lead to the potential therapeutic benefit of its inhibitors [

 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory effect, such as the antioxidant flavonoids. The in-vitro studies demonstrated that various flavonoids suppress the hepatitis C virus, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV, through their 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitory effects. These flavonoids include herbacetine, isobavachalcone, quercetin, and helichrysetin, rhoifolin, and pectolinarin, [
