<p id="p0175">The medications that inhibit viral RNA synthesis include remdesivir, favipiravir, and ribavirin. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analog with the broad-spectrum antiviral activities against the single-stranded RNA viruses, including the Ebola virus, Marburg virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Junin virus, Lassa fever virus, Nipah virus, Hendra virus, and the coronaviruses [

 <xref rid="bb0615" ref-type="bibr">[123]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">[124]</xref>]. Remdesivir inhibits the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which crucially replicates copies of viral RNA in the host cells. The animal models and cell line studies suggested the effectiveness of remdesivir to selectively inhibit the infection and pathology of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-II [
