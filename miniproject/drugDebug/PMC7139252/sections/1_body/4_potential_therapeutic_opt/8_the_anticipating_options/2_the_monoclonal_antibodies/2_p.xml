<p id="p0215">The monoclonal antibodies are the well-recognized passive immunotherapeutic options in many diseases. This human-made antibody can specifically bind to the designated target, thus involves in its molecular mechanisms and provides the desirable effects, which can either inhibit or enhance those molecular pathways [

With the updated knowledge of the SARS-CoV-II molecular mechanisms, there are several studies on monoclonal antibody and their trials for COVID-19, conducted by many pharmaceutical companies. Some previously approved drugs for other conditions and several novel drugs target various molecular targets of SARS-CoV II infection, with the promising therapeutic outcome for COVID-19 management soon [

 <xref rid="bb0820" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>]. These clinical trials include the monoclonal antibodies that target the pathogenic and pathophysiologic processes of COVID-19. These trials comprise the tocilizumab, which targets the interleukin-6 receptor and possibly mediates the SARS-CoV II-mediated inflammation and modulates the cytokine storms, and several neutralized monoclonal antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV molecular mechanism [
