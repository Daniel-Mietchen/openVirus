 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>]. The current data suggest the mortality rate from COVID-19 at 2–5%, which is substantially lower than the mortality rate of 10% and 40% in SARS and MERS, respectively [
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the concerning high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-II, with the basic reproduction number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) at 1.4–5.5, make it a rapidly spreading disease, as compared to the R
 <sub>0</sub> of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV at 2–5 and less than 1, respectively [
