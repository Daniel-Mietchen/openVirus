<p id="p0065">This would represent the first successful use of chloroquine in humans for the treatment of an acute viral disease, and is undoubtedly excellent news, since this drug is cheap and widely available. However, it should be considered carefully before drawing definitive conclusions, since no data has been provided yet to support this announcement. Results were produced in ten different hospitals and possibly from a number of different clinical protocols among those listed above, which include various designs for control groups (none, different antivirals, placebo, etc.) and various outcome primary indicators. The final interpretation is therefore technically demanding, and in the absence of published data, it is difficult to reach any firm conclusion. It will be of the utmost importance to know if the observed efficacy is associated specifically with chloroquine phosphate, or if this includes other salts (e.g., sulfate) of chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine. It is also necessary to determine if the benefit of chloroquine therapy depends on the age class, the clinical presentation or the stage of the disease.</p>
