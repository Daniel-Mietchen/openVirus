<p id="para20">One of the main assumptions of the model by Hellewell and colleagues is that all individuals with symptomatic infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are eventually tested and reported. However, under the guidelines of most countries with low-grade transmission, clinicians will test suspected patients only if they have travelled to an epidemic region since the outbreak began. A second assumption of the model is that isolation of cases is 100% effective in stopping transmission. Yet home confinement of infected individuals and contacts is challenging, efficacy is variable, and the rigorous tracking involved requires a considerable amount of public health resources.</p>
