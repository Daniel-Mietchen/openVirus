However, disseminated VZV infection with multiple organ involvement can occur in immunocompromised patients with impaired T cell immunity including solid or hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, receiving immunosuppressive therapy, leukemia, lymphoma, and HIV infection. Prompt antiviral therapy is mandatory in those immunocompromised persons. A 52 year-old man receiving chronic immunosuppressive drugs for his underlying leukocytoclastic vasculitis visited emergency department for diffuse skin vesicular rash that developed 4 days after contact with varicella zoster patients at his office. Despite prompt initiation of oral antiviral agents had been prescribed, rapid progression with septic shock, lactate acidosis, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy occurred. The patient died within 24&#x0202f;h of intensive care unit admission. Varicella zoster infection commonly causes severe complications in adults receiving chronic immunosuppressive therapy. Post exposure prophylaxis varicella zoster immune globulin and early parenteral antiviral agents use after acute varicella virus infection may be mandatory in immunocompromised patients.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwd0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Varicella zoster</kwd><kwd>Systemic infection</kwd><kwd>Mortality</kwd><kwd>Vasculitis</kwd><kwd>Immunosuppressive agents</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec0005"><title>Background</title><p id="par0020">Immunosuppressive drugs and disease modifying antirheumatic medicines are widely used in the treatment of connective tissue disease. However, usage of immunosuppressive medications is associated with increased risk of severe infection [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Varicella zoster infection can be caused by primary infection or reactivation. Risk of reactivation is related to age-related immune senescence or immunocompromised status. Complications include cutaneous dissemination and serious visceral organ involvement such as severe pneumonia, hepatitis and meningo-encephalitis. Post exposure varicella immune globulin and prompt antiviral therapy may contribute to decrease disease progression in immunocompromised patients [<xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In this case report, we described a fulminant clinical course of varicella zoster infection in a immunosuppressed host after contact with varicella zoster patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec0010"><title>Case presentation</title><p id="par0025">A 52-year-old man visit emergency department for diffuse vesicular skin rash over the trunk for one day (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A) after contact with his co-workers diagnosed as varicella infection 4 days before. He also had headache, sore throat and nausea. He denied prior history of chicken pox. He took immunosuppressants including methotrexate (12.5&#x0202f;mg per week), azathioprine (100&#x0202f;mg per day) and prednisolone (10&#x0202f;mg per day) for his underlying cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis since 5 years ago. Vesicle Tzank smear was performed. Multinucleated giant cells were found (<xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), which implied herpes virus infection. Serum labratory examination showed: white blood cell count 4100/uL, hemoglobin 14.8&#x0202f;gm/dL, platelets 13,4000/uL, serum creatinine 0.62&#x0202f;mg/dL, Aspartate transaminase (AST) 782 U/L (&#x0202f;&#x02264;&#x0202f;34), Alanine transaminase (ALT) 603 U/L (&#x02264;36), total bilirubin 0.4&#x0202f;mg/dL, prothrombin time 12.6&#x0202f;s (10&#x02013;13) and C reactive protein 1.45&#x0202f;mg/L. Under the impression of varicella zoster complicated with hepatitis, oral famciclovir 500&#x0202f;mg three times per day was prescribed and his immunosuppressive drugs was discontinued by the doctor at emergency room. He was discharged home and outpatient clinics follow up was arranged. However, he visited emergency department again two days later for general malaise and nausea. Upon admission, his clinical status was acute ill looking and alert (E4V5M6). Vital sign were: temperature 36.2&#x0202f;&#x000b0;C, blood pressure 54/46&#x0202f;mmHg, pulse rate 102 beats/minute, respiratory rate 20 cycles/min. Blood labratory examination were: white blood cell 12700/uL, hemoglobin 15.4&#x0202f;g/dL, and platelets 61000/uL, prothrombin time 35.7&#x0202f;s, actived partial thrombin time 44.5&#x0202f;s (24&#x02013;31), fibrinogen &#x0003c;50&#x0202f;mg/dL, AST 8989 U/L, ALT 6048 U/L, total bilirubine 2.0&#x0202f;mg/dL, indirect total bilirubin 1.5&#x0202f;mg/dL and serum creatinine 2.99&#x0202f;mg/dL. Blood arterial gas analysis showed PH 7.31 CO2 23&#x0202f;mmHg O2 83&#x0202f;mmHg HCO3 15.1&#x0202f;mm/L under nasal cannula oxgen flow 5&#x0202f;L/min. Serum tests for possible causes of acute hepatitis were all negative, including Hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), antibodies against hepatitis C (anti-HCV), anti-hepatitis A immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG), serum Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM and IgG, CMV pp65 antigen test, serum Herpes simplex virus IgM and IgG, and serum HSV DNA PCR. Only PCR test for VZV was positive during admission. Vesicular base and serum viral isolation also yielded the growth of VZV thereafter. In contrast, serum VZV IgM and IgG test were both negative. He was admitted to an intensive care unit due to septic shock, multiple organ failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. He received aggressive fluid resuscitation, broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics including glycopeptide and carbapenem, blood transfusion for correcting anemia and coagulopathy, and intravenous acyclovir for severe VZV infection. However, the clinical condition deteriorated rapidly. He was intubated 2&#x0202f;h after ICU admission because of comatose consciousness (E2M2V1), dyspnea, and profound shock. Brain CT was not done due to unstable hemodynamic status with high risk for transportation from the ICU to CT scan room. Lumbar puncture was not considered due to coagulopathy and absence of meningeal sign. However, lactate acidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and multiple organ failure were not reversed by aggressive treatment. He expired within 24&#x0202f;h after intensive care unit admission.<fig id="fig0005"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>A: Vesicular rash over trunk.
