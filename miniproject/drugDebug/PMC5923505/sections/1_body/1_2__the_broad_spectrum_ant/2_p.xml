<p>The antiviral activities of gemcitabine against the abovementioned viruses are summarized in 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="viruses-10-00211-t001">Table 1</xref>. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV belong to the family of Coronaviridae and are causative agents of severe viral respiratory illness in humans. To efficiently select appropriate antiviral drug candidates, Dyall et al. screened 290 FDA-approved drugs in virus-infected Vero E6 cells and identified gemcitabine as one of drugs with antiviral activity against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.2 μM and 4.9 μM, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. More recently, gemcitabine was shown to effectively suppress ZIKV infection and replication in human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells, particularly at non-cytotoxic concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.01 μM vs. CC
 <sub>50</sub> of &gt; 10 μM) [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. ZIKV, a member of the Flaviviridae family, can infect pregnant women and cause congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly in infants, which has attracted increasing public attention as well as extensive research and development into possible treatments. Effective antiviral activities of gemcitabine were also found for the replication of HCV in Huh-7 cells and the infection of HIV in U373-MAGI-CXCR4
 <sub>CEM</sub> cells, with estimated EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 12 nM and 16.3 nM, respectively [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], which were lower concentrations than those used in cancer therapy [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the case of HIV, the combination of gemcitabine with decitabine, another nucleoside analog in clinical use for cancer therapy, synergistically reduced HIV infectivity by increasing the viral mutation frequency [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In a follow up study, Clouser et al. further reported the antiviral effect of gemcitabine against HIV-related retrovirus, murine leukemia virus (MuLV), in vitro (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 1.6 nM) and even in murine AIDS model [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. A significant antiviral effect of gemcitabine on IAVs was also reported for RPE cells by Denisova et al. (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.068 μM) [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. They also tested whether gemcitabine had an antiviral effect on several other viruses of different families and found its strong inhibitory effect on Sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (&gt;2 log reduction in virus titer) but relatively weak effects on Semliki forest virus and human echovirus 6, and minimal effects on Bunyamwera virus, measles virus (MeV), and vaccinia virus [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The antiviral effect of gemcitabine on EVs, initially performed on Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), was found from screening FDA-approved drugs in CVB3 replicon-harboring Vero cells by our group (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.4 μM) [
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Its broad-spectrum antiviral activity on EVs was further identified by observing a similar inhibitory effect on enterovirus 71 (EV71) and human rhinoviruses (HRVs) (EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of 1 and 1–5 μM, respectively). In the case of HRV, the antiviral effect of gemcitabine was further confirmed in a virus-infected mouse model [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, intranasal administration of gemcitabine significantly lowered the pulmonary viral load and inflammation by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-1β, and the number of lung infiltrating lymphocytes. More recently, Zhang et al. also identified gemcitabine as the best anti-PV inhibitor from a screen of FDA-approved drugs in PV replicon-harboring HeLa cells (EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.3 µM) [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-10-00211" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].
