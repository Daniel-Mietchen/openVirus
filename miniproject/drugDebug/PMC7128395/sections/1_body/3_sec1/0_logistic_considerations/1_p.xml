<p id="p0025">Proper logistic planning is crucial in the management of this health emergency. The management of these patients makes it necessary to reconcile infection protocols (e.g., isolation), with needs that are intrinsic to our specialty (e.g., the need to move patients for hemodialysis). Our experience, although still limited, suggests a better outcome in patients who underwent a transplantation directly managed in a dedicated nephrology ward compared with the patients managed in other general COVID areas, and evaluated by the nephrologist only in consultation.</p>
