<p id="p0035">From February 27–28, 2020, we created a dedicated COVID unit that was dialysis capable and subsequently admitted the first COVID-positive patient (who underwent kidney transplantation). On February 28, we adopted surveillance measures for outpatients undergoing hemodialysis, which were applied in a small triage area in the waiting room of the dialysis center: patients’ body temperature was checked together with a brief anamnestic evaluation, alcohol-based hand sanitizer was dispensed, and surgical masks were provided. If the clinical suspicion of COVID-19 emerged, the patient was sent to perform specific testing. In case of urgency for dialysis treatment, this was performed in a room intended for suspected cases.</p>
