<p id="p0115">Patients with known COVID-19 infection receive a chest X-ray at baseline and repeated when respiratory deterioration is noted. Even patients who are afebrile may have an abnormal chest X-ray and other clinical signs of the hemophagocytic syndrome. These patients tend to be hypercoagulable, and prophylactic therapy with heparin and low-dose aspirin should be considered. During this phase, treatment with glucocorticoid and the interleukin-6 inhibitor tocilizumab should be considered, especially in patients with rapid clinical deterioration evidenced by escalating oxygen requirements or the need for ventilatory support. We recommend for this subgroup of patients, close monitoring of arterial oxygen levels with repeat arterial blood sampling, of the blood tests including ferritin–coagulation–liver enzymes, and of the chest X-ray.</p>
