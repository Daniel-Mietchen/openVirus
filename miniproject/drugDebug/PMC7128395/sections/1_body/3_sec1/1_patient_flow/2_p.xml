<p id="p0050">Up to March 22, in the nephrology unit of the hospital of Brescia, we have managed 46 patients, following the protocol presented in this article: 20 patients who underwent renal transplantation, 21 patients receiving hemodialysis, and 5 patients affected by CKD or acute kidney injury on CKD. The vast majority of patients (19 of 20 patients who underwent transplantation, 17 of 21 patients receiving hemodialysis, and 4 of 5 of the patients with CKD) received antiviral therapy and hydroxychloroquine as per our protocol. Dexamethasone and tocilizumab have been used, respectively, in 11 and 6 of the 20 patients who underwent transplantation, in 4 and 1 of the 21 patients receiving hemodialysis, and in 1 and none of the patients with CKD. To date, no patients on immunosuppressive treatment due to primary or secondary glomerulonephritis have been admitted or known to have symptoms imputable to SARS-CoV-2 infection; these patients were advised to respect social distancing rules since the early stages of the coronavirus crisis.</p>
