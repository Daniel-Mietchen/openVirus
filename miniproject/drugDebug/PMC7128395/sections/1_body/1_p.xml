<p id="p0015">The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently published the largest COVID-19 case series, which includes 44,672 cases. This study shows an overall mortality rate of 2.3%. Besides age (1.3% mortality in the 50–59 age group, 3.6% in the 60–69 age group, 8.0% in the 70–79 age group, and 14.8% in the ≥80 age group), the main risk factors are the presence of cardiovascular diseases (10.5% mortality), diabetes (7.3% mortality), chronic respiratory diseases (6.3% mortality), high blood pressure (6% mortality), and cancer (5.6% mortality).

 </xref> The comorbidities associated with increased mortality during COVID-19 are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and in patients undergoing renal replacement therapy with hemodialysis. There is a paucity of data on the risk factors and outcome of patients with kidney disease who are positive for COVID-19, including those receiving dialysis or who underwent a kidney transplantation. These groups of patients are unique in view of their immunosuppressed status. Reports from China suggest a less severe course of the disease in patients receiving dialysis, compared with patients who underwent a kidney transplantation, but also compared with patients without kidney disease.
