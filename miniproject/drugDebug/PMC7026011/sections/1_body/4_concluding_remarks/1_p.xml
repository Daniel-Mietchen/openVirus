<p>Taken together, numerous botanical compounds derived from algae, fungi and plants have been reported to have strong antiviral activities both, in cell culture assays and in animal studies against herpes simplex viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2). Interestingly, several mechanisms of action for these compounds have been identified, among which the most frequent seems to be virucidal activity. Other reported activities are inhibition of virus-entry into the target cells, inhibition of viral protein expression and interference with viral DNA replication, which are all essential processes for generating novel infectious viral particles (
