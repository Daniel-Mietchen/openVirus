<p>Importantly, botanical drugs derived from botanical extracts and compounds can undergo special health-regulatory conditions that favor their progress into the clinic in countries such as the United States, as botanical drugs that are marketed in this country as a dietary supplements may move forward into clinical studies without the need of non-clinical pharmacological/toxicological testing if they have already been proven to have a general recognition of safety (Botanical Drug Development Guidance for Industry, December 2016, Pharmaceutical Quality/CMC). Indeed, some botanical drug products may not require typical Phase 1 tolerability studies if the sponsors can provide adequate justification for the relevance of the prior use in humans and may eventually even be commercialized over-the-counter (OTC). Hence, such indications may significantly help botanical drugs rapidly reach the clinic and help treat both ACV-sensitive and antiviral-resistant HSV isolates. Taken together, botanical compounds have the advantage, over other synthetic drugs that they are generally recognized as safe, beneficial and are readily available resources, thus reducing the pricy steps needed for new drug discovery (
