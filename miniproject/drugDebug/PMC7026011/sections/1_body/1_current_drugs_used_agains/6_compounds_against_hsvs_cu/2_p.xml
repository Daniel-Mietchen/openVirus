<p>Brincidofovir is an acyclic nucleotide phosphonate, similar to cidofovir, yet it is conjugated to a lipid (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). When brincidofovir enters the cell, the lipid sidechain is cleaved and the compound is phosphorylated, acting as a substrate inhibitor for the viral DNA polymerase. Noteworthy, brincidofovir accumulates within the cell significantly more than cidofovir, and has up to 1,000-fold higher antiviral activity as compared to the latter (
