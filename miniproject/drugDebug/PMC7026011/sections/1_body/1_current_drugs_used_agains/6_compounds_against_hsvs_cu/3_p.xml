 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Poole and James, 2018</xref>). There are three finished clinical studies for pritelivir, yet similar to brincidofovir, the results have not been reported to the best of our knowledge (

There is also one clinical study that is currently ongoing and is in the recruitment phase for immunocompromised subjects with acyclovir-resistant mucocutaneous HSV-1 or HSV-2 infection (

Amenamevir is an oxadiazolephenyl derivate that belongs to the helicase-primase group of inhibitors and has been evaluated in at least three clinical trials, although the results have not been published (
