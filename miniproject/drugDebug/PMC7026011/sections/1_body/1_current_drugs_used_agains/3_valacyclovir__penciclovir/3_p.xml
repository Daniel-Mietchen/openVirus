<p>To increase the bioavailability of acyclovir, an L-valine ester of acyclovir was developed. Valacyclovir is a prodrug of ACV with enhanced absorption at the intestinal level (54%) (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">Soul-Lawton et al., 1995</xref>). Later, penciclovir was developed with the aim of being phosphorylated more rapidly than ACV, and consequently has a higher half-life than acyclovir (
