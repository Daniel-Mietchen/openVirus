<p>Other alternative drugs that have emerged in the last decades as second-line drugs that are commercially available are cidofovir (an acyclic nucleotide analog) (

 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Blot et al., 2000</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">James and Prichard, 2014</xref>) and foscarnet (a pyrophosphate analog) (

 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">Wagstaff and Bryson, 1994</xref>). When compared to each other, these two compounds affect different steps in the viral replication cycle. Cidofovir acts as a nucleotide analog and polymerase inhibitor with a high affinity for the viral DNA polymerase, with cidofovir-diphosphate having 25â€“50 fold higher affinity for the viral DNA polymerase than the host DNA polymerase, causing thus a more effective block in the replication of viral DNA than acyclovir (

Yet, a clinical study was carried out to evaluate the effectivity of topical cidofovir for refractory mucocutaneous HSV-1 and HSV-2 in AIDS; However, the results of this clinical study have not been reported (

On the other hand, foscarnet inhibits the viral DNA polymerase of herpesviruses by binding near to the pyrophosphate binding site that is needed for polymerase activity (

 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Poole and James, 2018</xref>). In contrast to nucleoside analogs, resistance to foscarnet only occurs because of mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene (
