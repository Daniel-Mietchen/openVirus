<p>Oral intake of ACV for treating skin lesions produced by HSV-1 and HSV-2 only reduces the healing process in little more than 2 days (time to loss of scab), from 7.9 days (placebo group) to 5.8 days, if taken as soon as signs of the prodrome or erythema are detected (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Spruance et al., 1990</xref>). Because these differences are moderate, although statistically significant, the clinical benefit of these antiviral drugs for the treatment of herpetic lesions has been somewhat questioned (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">Kroon, 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">Mindel, 1991</xref>). Importantly, when the drug is taken at the stage of papule, a significant effect for ACV is not observed (
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Spruance, 1993</xref>). Furthermore, within this scenario, the recovery time of cutaneous lesions was found to be larger in the treated group (antiviral) than in the placebo group (8 days vs. 7.2 days, respectively). Regretfully, nearly 50% of patients fail to perceive initial stages of the prodrome and the erythema phases before papule formation and therefore these individuals will not be in time to start an effective oral treatment with ACV in such a way to significantly reduce the time of the herpetic lesions (
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">Spruance et al., 1990</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">Spruance, 1993</xref>). Thus, treatment with ACV has poor benefits under these circumstances (
