<p>Griffithsin is a lectin extracted from the red alga 
 <italic>Griffithsia</italic> sp., which has been shown to be capable of inhibiting HSV infection in a murine model of HSV-2 infection (

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">Nixon et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism of action of Griffithsin consists on its binding to mannose N-glycosylations that blocks the infection process of HSV-2 and inhibits cell-to-cell spread of the virus. The results with this compound have been promising and its effectiveness is expected to be evaluated in humans in the near future. Additionally, Griffithsin has been evaluated as an antiviral in combination with carrageenan both, in cell cultures and in animals to evaluate the potential synergic effect of the two compounds against HSV-2 in a murine model of infection. The study showed a strong reduction in HSV-2 infection when applied together as a prophylactic, namely between 10 min and 1 h prior to infection (

A more recent article reported the efficacy of Griffithsin in combination with carrageenan against HSV-2 infections together with HPV and HIV-1, which was evaluated in both, a murine and rhesus macaque model using a vaginal fast-dissolving insert (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Derby et al., 2018</xref>). This study showed that a fast-dissolving vaginal insert with low moisture content is able to protect against SHIV in macaques, while in mice it showed promising results protecting against HSV-2 and HPV.
