<p>Several studies have assessed the antiviral effects of plant-derived compounds against herpes simplex virus in animal models either, alone or combined with acyclovir. One of these studies found that each of the following, 
 <italic>Geum japonicum</italic> Thunb., 
 <italic>Rhus javanica</italic> L., 
 <italic>Syzygium aromaticum</italic> (L.), or 
 <italic>Terminalia chebula Retzus</italic> displayed increased antiviral activity against HSV-1 when combined with acyclovir, as compared to acyclovir alone (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">Kurokawa et al., 1995</xref>). On the other hand, extracts from 
 <italic>A. odorata</italic>, 
 <italic>M. oleifera</italic>, and 
 <italic>V. denticulate</italic> were shown to have antiviral effects against HSV-1 upon cutaneous infections in BALB/c mice. Here, the plant extracts combined with ACV and orally administered to the mice were shown to hamper the development and progression of HSV-1 skin lesions and increased the mean survival times of the animals (

 <italic>Alternanthera philoxeroides</italic> has shown to have antiviral activity against HSV-2 when the compound is added to the inoculum for 1 h before viral infection or immediately after viral infection (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">Rattanathongkom et al., 2009</xref>). The authors suggested that the mechanism of action of the antiviral activity action of Chikusetsusaponin IV was virucidal (

 <italic>Melia azedarach</italic> has been reported to have antiviral activity against acyclovir-sensitive and acyclovir-resistant HSV-1 (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Barquero et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, MA showed favorable results against HSV-2 in a mouse model of infection when applied topically immediately after infection with HSV-2 (
