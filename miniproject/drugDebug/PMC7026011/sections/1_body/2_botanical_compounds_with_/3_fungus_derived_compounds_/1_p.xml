<p>Fungus-derived compounds have also been explored for identifying novel molecules with antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2. The fungus 
 <italic>Aspergillus versicolor</italic> has been shown to produce secondary metabolites, such as anthraquinones with anti-herpetic activity (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). In the study by 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2017)</xref>, three anthraquinones were found to have antiviral effects against HSV-1 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> using Vero cells. Another fungus of the 
 <italic>Aspergillus</italic> genus showed antiviral activity against HSV-1, with two secondary metabolites flavoglaucin and isodihydroauroglaucin derived from 
 <italic>A. ruber</italic> being assessed, and two compounds showing anti-HSV-1 effects (

 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">Liang et al., 2018</xref>). In another study, peptides produced by the marine-derived fungus 
 <italic>Scytalidium</italic> were found to have antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2, particularly by a peptide named Halovir, which was suggested to have virucidal activity when in direct contact with HSV-1 and HSV-2 (
