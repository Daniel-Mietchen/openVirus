<p>Aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts derived from native plants of Chile have also been investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2. Hydroalcoholic extracts of 
 <italic>Cassia stipulacea</italic> and 
 <italic>Escallonia illinita</italic> displayed antiviral activity against HSV-1, while hydroalcoholic extracts from 
 <italic>Aristotelia chilensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Drymis winteri</italic>, 
 <italic>Elytropus chilensis</italic>, as well as an aqueous extract from 
 <italic>Luma apiculata</italic> showed antiviral activity against HSV-2. The active antiviral compounds within these preparations have not been identified or reported yet (

 <italic>Quillaja saponaria</italic>, a Chilean soapbark tree that is endemic in the central zone of Chile, has antiviral activity against HSV-1 and other viruses. This extract, which is currently used in food and beverages was reported to have virucidal activity by blocking the attachment of viruses to the cell surface (
