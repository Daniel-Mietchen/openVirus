<p>Many studies have reported the existence of algae with bioactive compounds that display potent antiviral activity against numerous viruses, such as dengue (

A study performed in Brazil analyzed more than 36 species of algae from its coasts and reported that four of them had significant antiviral activity against both, HSV-1 and HSV-2. In their study, the authors suggested that the antiviral activity of extracts of green alga 
 <italic>Stypopodium zonale</italic> (Ochrophyta) against HSV-1 was related to the secondary metabolite atomaric acid (

 <italic>Ulva fasciata</italic> and 
 <italic>Codium decorticatum</italic> against HSV-1 were shown to be mediated by fatty acids present in high concentrations in the extracts, yet the precise molecules involved were not identified or reported (

 <italic>Laurencia dendroidea</italic>, the antiviral activity against HSV-1 was likely mediated by sesquiterpenes (
