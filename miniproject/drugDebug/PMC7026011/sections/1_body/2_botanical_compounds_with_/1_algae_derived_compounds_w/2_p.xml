<p>Another example of an alga with antiviral effects against HSV is 
 <italic>Hypnea musciformis</italic>, a red seaweed present in Italy, which has shown strong antiviral activity against HSV-1, even in different aqueous fractions obtained from its processing. Several mechanisms of action for these preparations were identified, such as virucidal activity and the inhibition of virus binding into the cell (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Mendes et al., 2012</xref>). Other reports have also described antiviral effects for different algae extracts against HSVs, such as 
 <italic>Xalas</italic>, a derivative of 
 <italic>Scinaia hatei</italic> that has antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2, which inhibits the entry of the virus into the cell, and is likely mediated by sulfated xylans present in the extract (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Damonte et al., 2009</xref>). On the other hand, 
 <italic>Osmundaria obtusiloba</italic>, an algae obtained from the Brazilian coast was reported to have antiviral activity against both, HSV-1 and HSV-2, which was suggested to be mediated by algae glycolipids interacting with viral glycoproteins (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">Souza et al., 2012</xref>). 
 <italic>Padina pavonia</italic>, another algae that inhibits HSV-1 replication, has been reported to have a bioactive compound consisting of sulfated polysaccharides (fucoidan) that hampers the binding of the virus to the surface of the cell (
