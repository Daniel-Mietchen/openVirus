<p>The reactivation of HSV-1 and HSV-2 from infected individuals is associated with numerous factors, such as immune-related and physicochemical stimuli, such as UV radiation, as well as menstruation, stress and traumatic events, among others (

 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">Rand et al., 1990</xref>). Upon viral reactivation, virions travel in a retrograde manner from the cell body of infected neurons in the trigeminal ganglia (orofacial infection), or the dorsal root ganglia (genital-associated infection), to sites neighboring epithelial cells and fibroblasts, nearby the original site of infection, forming new lesions that will repeat the process of additional neuron infection (

 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Benedetti et al., 1994</xref>). Given this scenario, it seems important to block neuron infection by HSV-1 and HSV-2 during primary infection or to treat neurons in such a way that these viruses do not reactivate from these cells. However, a prophylactic approach for HSV-1 and HSV-2 is yet not available in the form of a vaccine (
