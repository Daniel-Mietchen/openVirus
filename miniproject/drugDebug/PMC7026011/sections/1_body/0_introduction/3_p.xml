<p>Nevertheless, not all the individuals infected with HSV-1 and HSV-2 manifest symptoms. It is estimated that herpetic recurrences due to HSV occur within a wide range of frequencies, varying between 20–50% and 80–90% for HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections, respectively after primary infection (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">Fleming et al., 1997</xref>). This means that 50–80% and 10–20% of individuals with HSV-1 and HSV-2 infection, correspondingly will not show clinical symptoms of infection. Yet, it is important to note that these persons will nevertheless shed infectious viral particles from the mucosae, which could infect other individuals (

 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Ramchandani et al., 2017</xref>). On the other hand, up to one-third of the persons that have had clinical symptoms during primary infection show frequent reactivations, which occur on average six times a year (

Taking into consideration the numbers outlined above, approximately 16 and 5% of the world population will manifest herpetic lesions with HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. This extremely high percentage of individuals affected by symptomatic HSV infection is non-negligible and undoubtedly encompasses a significant number of persons that would like to have access to more effective solutions against these viruses.
