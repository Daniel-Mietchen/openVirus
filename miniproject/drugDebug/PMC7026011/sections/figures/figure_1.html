 <caption> Structure of botanical molecules with antiviral activity against herpes simplex viruses. Structure of molecules derived from (A) algae, (B) fungi and (C) plants that have been reported to have antiviral activity against HSV-1, HSV-2 or both viruses. Molecular structures were drawn using ACD/ChemSketch TM, (version 2018.1.1, Advanced Chemistry Development, Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada, www.acdlabs.com, 2019). Griffithsin (Protein Data Bank accession number 2GUD) was modeled using PyMOL TM (Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.3, Schr√∂dinger, LLC). </caption>
