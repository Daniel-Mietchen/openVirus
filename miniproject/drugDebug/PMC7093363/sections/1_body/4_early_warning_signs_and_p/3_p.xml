<p id="Par10">However, many other important aspects of virus biology, such as, whether the virus can travel across continents, the list of species it can infect and whether it can cause severe mortality, are much harder to forecast. Our premise is that the amount of sequencing data currently available and the latest advances in computing methods using that data will make it possible for the first time to generate virtual models of how viruses evolve in each environment and how those viruses behave. Such models have the potential to make risk assessments as they arise that can be used to inform policy and direct strategies to head off impending threats.</p>
