<p id="Par5">In addition to the major structural proteins, SARS-CoV genome encodes several accessory proteins and some of them play important roles with rapid evolution (Hilgenfeld and Peiris, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). 
 <italic>ORF8</italic> encoded protein is an example of what can be learned. During the early stages of SARS-CoV outbreak, the 
 <italic>ORF8</italic> gene coded for a single protein, but during the middle and late stages of the epidemic, the gene underwent a gradual 29 nt deletion and coded for two separate accessory proteins, ORF8a and ORF8b. It was hypothesized that this truncation event was responsible for the increased human-to human transmission efficiency that occurred during the late stages, triggering an epidemic. Interestingly, the 29 nt deletion in SARS-CoV led to an attenuating mutation with a reduction in virus replication levels (Muth et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2018</xref>; Oostra et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2007</xref>). Perhaps this attenuation was the potential reason why it was possible to eventually extinguish the outbreak. Unfortunately, the genome sequence of 2019-nCoV shows that 
 <italic>ORF8</italic> is intact. If the gene does not undergo a gradual loss or mutation during subsequent virus circulation in humans, the outbreak could be more severe.
