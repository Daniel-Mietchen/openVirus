<p id="Par4">Phylogenetic analysis of genomic sequences of coronavirus deposited in the GenBank revealed that 2019-nCoV also belonged to the genus beta-coronavirus and displayed the closest linkage with two SARS-like coronaviruses from bat (Benvenuto et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2020</xref>; Guo et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>; Wu et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2020</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with a single-stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The spike glycoprotein (S protein) is responsible for the receptor binding and membrane fusion. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as the receptor for SARS-CoV on the surface of human cells. Recent research demonstrated that ACE2 is also required for 2019-nCoV entry (Letko and Munster,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2020b</xref>; Zhou et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). The binding affinity of receptor-binding domain (RBD) of S protein present in coronavirus is related to virus infectivity and pathogenicity. Another study showed that, in comparison to human SARS-CoV, the RBD of 2019-nCoV exhibited much lower affinity to ACE2 indicating a possible lower virulence of 2019-nCoV (Dong et al.,
