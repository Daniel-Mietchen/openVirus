 <caption> Crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) 3CL protease (PDB ID: 6LU7) recently solved by the team of Zihe Rao and Haitao Yang at ShanghaiTech University, China. The detailed high-resolution crystal structural analysis of the viral main proteinase (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 may facilitate the in silico screening of existing drugs for drug repurposing or the identification of novel hits from compound libraries by targeting Mpro, which is considered to be a beneficial drug target regulating the activities of the virus replication complex. </caption>
