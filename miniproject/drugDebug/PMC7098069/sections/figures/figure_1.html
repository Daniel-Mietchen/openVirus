 <caption> Niclosamide has great potential in being repurposed to treat a variety of viral infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Zika virus (ZIKV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Ebola virus (EBOV), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), Chikungunya virus (CHIKV), human adenovirus (HAdV), and Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV). We envision that this broad spectrum of antival activities may offer the therapeutic potential to be extended to combat fast-spreading coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), given its inexpensive and low in vivo toxicity profile as an FDA-approved drug in clinical use. </caption>
