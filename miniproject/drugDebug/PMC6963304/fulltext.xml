The emergence of a novel variant strain brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccine strains were not completely effective against variant strains. Therefore, the development of new anti-pseudorabies virus drugs and vaccines is of great significance for the treatment and prevention of pseudorabies. In this study, we found that germacrone, one of the major components of the essential oils extracted from Rhizoma Curcuma, was able to effectively inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Germacrone showed antiviral activity against PRV in the early phase of the viral replication cycle. Moreover, we found that germacrone does not directly kill the virus, nor does it affect the expression of the PRV receptor protein nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155. Our results suggest germacrone could be used as an efficient microbicide or immunomodulatory agent in the control of the emerging variant PRV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>PRV</kwd><kwd>germacrone</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-pathogens-08-00258"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Pseudorabies (PR), an acute, febrile infectious disease caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV), usually occurs in sows and is characterized by reproductive disorders and neurological signs [<xref rid="B1-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. PRV was discovered at the beginning of the 20th century and is prevalent in at least 44 countries [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Pigs are the natural hosts and the main source of transmission, but PRV has a broad host range and can also infect a variety of livestock and wildlife [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that PRV can infect humans, with weakness, fever, sweating, dysphagia, and neurological dysfunction as typical symptoms [<xref rid="B4-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. PRV belongs to the <italic>Alpherpesvirus</italic> subfamily [<xref rid="B5-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. PR has been eradicated in several countries including the USA, New Zealand, and many European countries. However, PRV is still in circulation worldwide.</p><p>Highly pathogenic PRV variants emerged in several pig farms in China in late 2011 [<xref rid="B7-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. In previous reports, we analyzed all known PRV full-length genomes and all available gB, gC, gD, and gE gene sequences. We found that PRV could be divided into clade 1 and 2 based on the gC gene. The current vaccine strain Bartha-K61 clustered with clade 1. However, the most recent PRV variants clustered with clade 2. We previously reported that variant PRV forms and recombination in China could be the source of continued epidemics [<xref rid="B9-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. So far, the most effective method of prevention and control of pseudorabies is vaccination. The emergence of PRV variant strains brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccines were not completely effective against it [<xref rid="B11-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The fact that PRV can persist in the host for a long time after infection makes its prevention and control challenging [<xref rid="B13-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>The development of treatment with effective and safe antiviral drugs has become imperative since PRV vaccines do not provide complete protection. Due to the large specific surface area and unique physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials, some researchers studied the effect of nanomaterials on antiviral activity. In particular, graphene oxide significantly reduced PRV replication at noncytotoxic concentrations [<xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In addition, it has been reported that lithium chloride (LiCl) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) have good inhibitory effect on PRV replication [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Of note, although there are some studies on the antiviral effect of LiCl and DG on PRV, relatively few studies on their antiviral effect against newly emerged PRV variant virus were reported. Considering the currently wide prevalence of PRV variant in China, effective antiviral drugs against the variant PRV should be screened as soon as possible.</p><p>Germacrone is a monocyclic sesquiterpene extracted from gingeraceae plants with antitumor, anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In particular, germacrone antitumor effect on the human hepatoma cell line is mediated via G2/M cell cycle arrest and by promoting apoptosis [<xref rid="B19-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In terms of antiviral activity, germacrone inhibits influenza virus (IAV), Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Feline calicivirus (FCV), and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Germacrone has inhibitory effects on H1N1, H3N2 influenza viruses, and Influenza B viruses in the early stages of the viral cycle and can protect mice from fatal infection [<xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, it does not block PRRSV adsorption and invasion and cannot inhibit both classical and highly pathogenic II PRRSV strains [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>The objective of this study was to explore the antiviral effects of germacrone on PRV infection and its antiviral mechanism. We found that germacrone can inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner at the early stage of viral replication.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-pathogens-08-00258"><title>2.

Results</title><p>Germacrone is one of the main constituents of volatile oil from <italic>rhizoma curcuma</italic> [<xref rid="B24-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The structure of germacrone is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f001">Figure 1</xref>A. The concentration of germacrone that reduced cell viability by 50% was considered the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC<sub>50</sub>). The cytotoxic effect of germacrone on Vero and PK-1 cells was determined using the LDH cytotoxicity assay kit. For both cell lines, the CC<sub>50</sub> values were 233.5 and 184.1 &#x000b5;M germacrone in Vero and PK-1 cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f001">Figure 1</xref>B,C). The relative cell viability was above 90% after treatment with 150 &#x003bc;M germacrone. No changes in cell morphology were detected at 150 &#x003bc;M germacrone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>To evaluate whether germacrone could inhibit PRV replication, Vero or PK-1 cells were infected with PRV at a MOI of 0.01 or 0.1 for 1 h and treated with 150 &#x003bc;M germacrone for 24 h. Germacrone significantly inhibited viral replication compared with control cells and DMSO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B). In order to identify if germacrone has a direct negative effect on virions, we incubated virions with 150 &#x003bc;M of germacrone for 2 h at room temperature and determined the infectious titer by TCID<sub>50</sub> on Vero cells. Germacrone did not influence PRV infectivity at a MOI of 0.01 or 0.1, indicating that germacrone is not viricidal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>Next, to obtain detailed insight into the efficacy of germacrone against PRV, we tested the effect of germacrone in a dose-dependent manner on Vero and PK-1 cells. Treatment with 10&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M of germacrone inhibited PRV-gB protein levels and viral proliferation in Vero cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>A,B). On the other hand, treatment with 10 &#x003bc;M of germacrone did not affect PRV-gB protein levels nor virus yield in PK-1 cells; however, treatment with 50&#x02013;150 &#x003bc;M germacrone inhibited PRV-gB protein levels and viral proliferation in PK-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). In addition, a strong virus-positive signal was observed in negative control- and DMSO-treated cells 24 hpi in Vero and PK-1 cells by IFA. However, the fluorescent signal decreased after treatment with germacrone in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). The obtained titer values were used for estimation of the 50% effective concentration (EC<sub>50</sub>). To obtain detailed insight into the efficacy of germacrone against PRV, we next calculated the EC<sub>50</sub> values, which reflect the concentration of germacrone that is required to abolish infectious virus particle production by 50%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>G shows the EC<sub>50</sub> values for germacrone following infection with PRV in Vero or PK-1 cells. The EC<sub>50</sub> values were 54.51 and 88.78 &#x000b5;M germacrone in Vero and PK-1 cells, respectively. These results indicate that germacrone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in both virus titer and PRV-gB protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner.</p><p>To further illustrate the effect of germacrone on PRV infection, we performed time-of-addition assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Germacrone was added to Vero or PK-1 cells pre-, during or post-infection. In pretreatment experiments, cells were incubated with germacrone for 1 h, after which the compound was washed out, and then cells infected with PRV. In the &#x0201c;during&#x0201d; condition, germacrone and virus were added together to cells and 1 hpi the medium was removed, cells were washed, and continued to incubate with DMEM containing 150 &#x003bc;M germacrone. In the post-treatment experiments, cells were infected with PRV for 1 h, and after removing the PRV inoculum, cells were washed and germacrone was added at 1, 3, 6, and 12 hpi. In pre-, during or post-infection experiments, cells were infected at a MOI of 0.1 and germacrone was added at a final concentration of 150 &#x003bc;M. DMSO-treated cells were used as control. We observed that germacrone reduced PRV infectivity in the &#x0201c;during&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;post-infection&#x0201d; experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). No antiviral effect was observed when cells were pre-incubated with germacrone. This indicates that the antiviral effect of germacrone occurs at the early stage of PRV replication.</p><p>Next, we investigated the effect of germacrone on virus attachment and entry. Germacrone (150 &#x003bc;M) and PRV (MOI 10) were added together to cells and incubated for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. The viral genome load was then quantified by Q-PCR via amplification of the PRV gB gene. We found no difference in drug-treated and negative control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f005">Figure 5</xref>A,B), suggesting that germacrone does not affect viral attachment to cells. Next, cells were inoculated with PRV at a MOI of 10 for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C, and then germacrone (150 &#x003bc;M) was added for 1 h at 37 &#x000b0;C to allow virus entry. The cells were then washed three times with PBS (pH = 2.5) to remove bound virus [<xref rid="B25-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. After 6 hpi, the viral genome load was quantified by Q-PCR via amplification of the PRV gB gene. No difference was found between germacrone- or DMSO-treated cells and negative control-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D), suggesting that the germacrone does not affect virus entry. We also tested the effect of germacrone on nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155, which are believed to be the PRV receptors, by quantitative PCR. Germacrone had no influence on nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155 gene levels [<xref rid="B26-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f005">Figure 5</xref>E).</p><p>It has been reported that DG and LiCl inhibit PRV infection of Vero cells [<xref rid="B15-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Compared with LiCl, DG did not inhibit PRV infection after virus adsorption, and it seemed that this drug was only viricidal to PRV. Therefore, we explored the antiviral effects of germacone, DG, and LiCl after PRV variant strain infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the antiviral effect of germacone is better than that of DG and worse than that of LiCl, measured by western bolt and TCID<sub>50</sub> at the nontoxic concentration.</p><p>We also explored the antiviral activity of germacone against PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. Vero cells were infected with PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 at a MOI of 0.1 for 1 h and treated with 150 &#x003bc;M germacrone. The recovered virus yields were determined by TCID<sub>50.</sub> As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B, germacrone treatment significantly suppressed the growth of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 in Vero or PK-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f007">Figure 7</xref>A,B). In IFA, the fluorescence signals declined after treatment with 150 &#x003bc;M germacrone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f007">Figure 7</xref>C,D). This indicates that germacrone treatment inhibits the replication of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec4-pathogens-08-00258"><title>4. Discussion</title><p>Over the past decade, a number of novel viruses emerged in pigs in China and caused huge economic losses [<xref rid="B28-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As one of them, at the end of 2011, re-emergence PR outbreaks were reported in many pig farms in China. Evidence suggests that the new epidemic is the result of a variant PRV strain [<xref rid="B2-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B30-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The Bartha-K61 vaccine is inadequate to protect pigs from infection with variant PRV [<xref rid="B8-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and thus antiviral therapeutics may be a critical strategy to control variant PRV damage in the swine husbandry. PRV is an important threat to animals and possibly humans. A case of suspected PRV infection in humans occurred in China in 2017. The patient presented with fever, headaches, and visual impairment [<xref rid="B4-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many countries have also reported PRV interspecies transmission [<xref rid="B3-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With the emergence of new viruses that threaten both the pig industry and public health, the discovery of new functions in existing clinical drugs is often used in the screening of modern emergency drugs. Germacrone has an antiviral effect on a variety of viruses, such as IAV, PPV, FCV, and PRRSV [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the effect of germacrone on PRV variant strain. We found that germacrone could inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner at the early stage of virus replication by western blot and IFA. We showed that germacrone could not directly kill the virus nor affect the adsorption and invasion of PRV. We also found that it could not affect the expression of nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155, the receptors of PRV. To further investigate at which phase PRV replication is sensitive to germacrone treatment, cells were exposed to germacrone at various time points. PRV replication was impressed significantly when cells were treated with germacrone at 6 hpi. In addition, we found that the antiviral effect at 12 h was significantly higher than at 6 h, so we concluded that germacrone had the best antiviral effect in the early stage of virus replication, as in the case of PRRSV [<xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We speculate that treatment with germacrone may affect the expression of host genes or cellular factors, some of which may be required for viral replication. Therefore, we speculate that germacrone may inhibit PRV replication by affecting a cell antiviral mechanism.</p><p>We explored the anti-PRV virus drugs that have been reported, including a traditional Chinese medicine, DG, and a chemical drug, LiCl. Both DG and germarone belong to traditional Chinese medicine. However, unlike DG which directly kills the virus, germarone plays a role at the early stage of PRV replication and can be used as a therapeutic drug. Although the antiviral effect of germacone is worse than that of LiCl, germacone is safer, considering that resistance develops with the use of chemical drugs like LiCl in clinical applications. We also studied the effect of germarone on the vaccine strain Bartha-K61 and found that it inhibits the replication of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. So germacrone can be used in vaccinated pigs that are not completely protected against variant type PRV.</p><p>Germacrone is a monocyclic sesquiterpenoid compound. Recently, it was found that germacrone has strong antiviral activity, as well as anti-inflammatory and other pharmacological effects potentially useful for clinical applications [<xref rid="B31-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In particular, the germacrone and oseltamivir combination has a synergistic effect on the inhibition of influenza virus. On the other hand, there are no reports on potential antitumor activity in vivo [<xref rid="B33-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The main possible reasons for this phenomenon are: (1) germacrone is mainly extracted and isolated from plants with relatively low yield, therefore the purchase price is high, while the dosage for animal experiments is large; (2) the water solubility of germacrone is relatively poor; and (3) the lack of an antitumor and antivirus mechanism. For all the above reasons, we need to conduct in-depth research on the antiviral mechanism of germacrone, modify the extraction and separation methods to increase the yield, and improve it to make it safer for animal use.</p><p>In summary, we report for the first time the inhibitory effect of germacone on the replication of PRV. We show it acts at the early stage of infection and could serve as a potential treatment. However, the antiviral effect of germacone in vivo needs to be further explored.</p></sec></body><back><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>Conceived and designed the experiments: W.H., X.Z., S.S.
