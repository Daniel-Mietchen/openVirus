 <caption> Nontoxic concentrations of germacrone on Vero and PK-1 cells. ( A) Chemical structure of germacrone. ( B, C) Percentage cell viability after treatment with different concentrations of germacrone (0, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, 250 μM) in Vero ( B) and PK-1 cells ( C). The cell survival rates under different concentrations of drugs are given, and 90% above cell survival rate (over dotted line) is regarded as a nontoxic concentration of drugs. ( D) Cell morphology of Vero and PK-1 cells in the negative control (NC)-, DMSO-, and germacrone-treated groups. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. </caption>
