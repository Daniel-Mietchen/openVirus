 <caption> Comparison of antiviral effects of DG, LiCl, and germacrone. Cells were infected with PRV (MOI 0.1) for 1 h, then medium containing different drugs (150 μM of germacrone, 50 mM of LiCl, and 1250 μg/mL of DG) was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, the level of gB protein was detected by western blot and the virus yielded in supernatants were determined by TCID 50 in Vero cells (*** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
