 <caption> Germacrone reduces the production of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. ( A, B) Vero ( A) and PK-1 ( B) cells were infected with PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 (MOI 0.1) for 1 h. The unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, then medium containing 150 μM of germacrone was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, virus yielded in supernatants from infected cells was determined by TCID 50 in Vero cells. ( C, D) The effect of different concentrations of germacrone on PRV, shown by IFA at 24 hpi in Vero cells ( C) or PK-1 cells ( D). Scale bar, 250 μm (*** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
