 <caption> Germacrone reduces the production of infectious PRV particles and is not viricidal. ( A, B) Vero ( A) and PK-1 ( B) cells were infected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) (MOI 0.1) for 1 h. The unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, then medium containing 150 μM of germacrone was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, virus yielded in supernatants from infected cells was determined by TCID 50 (50% tissue culture-infected dose) in Vero cells. ( C) PRV was incubated with 150 μM of germacrone or DMSO at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the infectious titer was determined by TCID 50 in Vero cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate samples. All the results were confirmed by three independent experiments (*** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
