  <p>Germacrone can inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Cells were infected with PRV (MOI 0.1) for 1 h. The unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, then medium containing different concentrations of germacrone (0, 10, 50, 100, and 150 μM) was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, the level of gB protein was detected by western blot in Vero cells (
   <bold>A</bold>) or PK-1 cells (
   <bold>B</bold>). (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>) The virus yielded in supernatants from infected cells was quantified by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> in Vero cells. (
   <bold>E</bold>,
   <bold>F</bold>) The effect of different concentrations of germacrone on PRV, shown by IFA at 24 hpi in Vero cells (
   <bold>E</bold>) or PK-1 cells (
   <bold>F</bold>). Scale bar, 250 μm. (
   <bold>G</bold>) EC
   <sub>50</sub> (50% effective concentration) values were calculated with GraphPad Prism software. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate samples. All the results were confirmed by three independent experiments (*
