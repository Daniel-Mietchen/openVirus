  <p>Germacrone reduces the production of infectious PRV particles and is not viricidal. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Vero (
   <bold>A</bold>) and PK-1 (
   <bold>B</bold>) cells were infected with pseudorabies virus (PRV) (MOI 0.1) for 1 h. The unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, then medium containing 150 μM of germacrone was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, virus yielded in supernatants from infected cells was determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture-infected dose) in Vero cells. (
   <bold>C</bold>) PRV was incubated with 150 μM of germacrone or DMSO at room temperature for 1 h. After incubation, the infectious titer was determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> in Vero cells. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate samples. All the results were confirmed by three independent experiments (***
