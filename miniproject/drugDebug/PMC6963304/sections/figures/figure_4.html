 <caption> Germacrone inhibits PRV replication at an early stage. ( A) Outline of the experiment. ( B) Vero cells were infected with PRV (MOI 0.1), followed by treatment with 150 μM of germacrone at the indicated time (hpi). DMSO was used as a control. Virus titers were determined at 24 hpi. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate samples. All the results were confirmed by three independent experiments (*** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
