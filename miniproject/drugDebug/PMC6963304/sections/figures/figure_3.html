 <caption> Germacrone can inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner. ( A, B) Cells were infected with PRV (MOI 0.1) for 1 h. The unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM, then medium containing different concentrations of germacrone (0, 10, 50, 100, and 150 μM) was added. DMSO was used as a control. After 24 h of treatment, the level of gB protein was detected by western blot in Vero cells ( A) or PK-1 cells ( B). ( C, D) The virus yielded in supernatants from infected cells was quantified by TCID 50 in Vero cells. ( E, F) The effect of different concentrations of germacrone on PRV, shown by IFA at 24 hpi in Vero cells ( E) or PK-1 cells ( F). Scale bar, 250 μm. ( G) EC 50 (50% effective concentration) values were calculated with GraphPad Prism software. Data are presented as the mean ± SD from triplicate samples. All the results were confirmed by three independent experiments (* p &lt; 0.05, *** p &lt; 0.001). </caption>
