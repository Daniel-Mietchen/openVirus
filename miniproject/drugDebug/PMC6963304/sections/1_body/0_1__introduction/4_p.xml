<p>Germacrone is a monocyclic sesquiterpene extracted from gingeraceae plants with antitumor, anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory activity [

 <xref rid="B18-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In particular, germacrone antitumor effect on the human hepatoma cell line is mediated via G2/M cell cycle arrest and by promoting apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B19-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In terms of antiviral activity, germacrone inhibits influenza virus (IAV), Porcine parvovirus (PPV), Feline calicivirus (FCV), and Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication [

 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Germacrone has inhibitory effects on H1N1, H3N2 influenza viruses, and Influenza B viruses in the early stages of the viral cycle and can protect mice from fatal infection [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, it does not block PRRSV adsorption and invasion and cannot inhibit both classical and highly pathogenic II PRRSV strains [
