<p>The development of treatment with effective and safe antiviral drugs has become imperative since PRV vaccines do not provide complete protection. Due to the large specific surface area and unique physical and chemical properties of nanomaterials, some researchers studied the effect of nanomaterials on antiviral activity. In particular, graphene oxide significantly reduced PRV replication at noncytotoxic concentrations [

Of note, although there are some studies on the antiviral effect of LiCl and DG on PRV, relatively few studies on their antiviral effect against newly emerged PRV variant virus were reported. Considering the currently wide prevalence of PRV variant in China, effective antiviral drugs against the variant PRV should be screened as soon as possible.
