<p>Next, to obtain detailed insight into the efficacy of germacrone against PRV, we tested the effect of germacrone in a dose-dependent manner on Vero and PK-1 cells. Treatment with 10–150 μM of germacrone inhibited PRV-gB protein levels and viral proliferation in Vero cells (

On the other hand, treatment with 10 μM of germacrone did not affect PRV-gB protein levels nor virus yield in PK-1 cells; however, treatment with 50–150 μM germacrone inhibited PRV-gB protein levels and viral proliferation in PK-1 cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). In addition, a strong virus-positive signal was observed in negative control- and DMSO-treated cells 24 hpi in Vero and PK-1 cells by IFA. However, the fluorescent signal decreased after treatment with germacrone in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>E,F). The obtained titer values were used for estimation of the 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>). To obtain detailed insight into the efficacy of germacrone against PRV, we next calculated the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values, which reflect the concentration of germacrone that is required to abolish infectious virus particle production by 50%. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f003">Figure 3</xref>G shows the EC
 <sub>50</sub> values for germacrone following infection with PRV in Vero or PK-1 cells. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were 54.51 and 88.78 µM germacrone in Vero and PK-1 cells, respectively. These results indicate that germacrone treatment resulted in a significant reduction in both virus titer and PRV-gB protein levels in a concentration-dependent manner.
