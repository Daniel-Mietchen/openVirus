<p>To further illustrate the effect of germacrone on PRV infection, we performed time-of-addition assays (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). Germacrone was added to Vero or PK-1 cells pre-, during or post-infection. In pretreatment experiments, cells were incubated with germacrone for 1 h, after which the compound was washed out, and then cells infected with PRV. In the “during” condition, germacrone and virus were added together to cells and 1 hpi the medium was removed, cells were washed, and continued to incubate with DMEM containing 150 μM germacrone. In the post-treatment experiments, cells were infected with PRV for 1 h, and after removing the PRV inoculum, cells were washed and germacrone was added at 1, 3, 6, and 12 hpi. In pre-, during or post-infection experiments, cells were infected at a MOI of 0.1 and germacrone was added at a final concentration of 150 μM. DMSO-treated cells were used as control. We observed that germacrone reduced PRV infectivity in the “during” or “post-infection” experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00258-f004">Figure 4</xref>B,C). No antiviral effect was observed when cells were pre-incubated with germacrone. This indicates that the antiviral effect of germacrone occurs at the early stage of PRV replication.
