<p>Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After the cell confluence reached 90%, the culture medium was discarded and the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM. Vero cells were infected with PRV at MOI 0.1 for 1 h, and the unbound virus particles were washed with serum-free DMEM. After removing unbound virus, 150 μM germacrone was added for 24 h. The cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min. The fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibodies (mouse anti-PRV-gB mAb, 1:1000) for 2 h, washed five times with PBS, and incubated with secondary antibodies (goat anti-mouse–ITC) for 1 h at 37 °C in the dark. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were incubated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 15 min to stain the nuclei. Images were acquired by using a fluorescence microscope (Nikon) with a video documentation system.</p>
