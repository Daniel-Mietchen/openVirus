<p>The TIANamp Genomic DNA Kit (TIAN GEN DP304) was used for DNA extraction. Total RNA from Vero or LLC-PK1 cells was extracted using TRIzol (Vazyme), and 1 μg cDNA was synthesized using the Thermo Scientific Revert Aid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The SYBR Green master mix (Vazyme) was used to quantify the abundance of the target mRNA according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The procedure for real-time PCR consisted of an initial step at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 95 °C for 15 s. Specific primers are shown in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00258-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The PRV viral gB gene level was determined by absolute quantification real-time PCR. Nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155, which are believed to be the PRV receptors, were quantified by quantitative PCR. The relative level of RNA expression was determined by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method. β-actin mRNA level was used as a loading control. The mean RNA level of the negative control (NC) group was set at 100%.
