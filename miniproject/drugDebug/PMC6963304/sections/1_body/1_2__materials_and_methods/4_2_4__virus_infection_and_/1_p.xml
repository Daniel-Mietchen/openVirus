<p>Variant PRV and PRV vaccine strain Barth K61 were propagated in Vero cells. To infect, Vero cells were incubated with PRV for 1h, then washed with serum-free DMEM and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS for 48 h. Virus titration or subsequent infectivity analysis was titrated in Vero cells. Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in 96-well plates. After the cell confluence reached 90%, the culture medium was discarded and the cells were washed with serum-free DMEM. The virus was 10-fold serially diluted. After 1 h, the virus was discarded and the unbound virus particles were washed away with serum-free DMEM. Culture medium containing 2% FBS was added, and cells were cultured at 37 °C until obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) developed. After a further 48 h of incubation, the 50% tissue culture-infected dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by the Reed–Muench method.
