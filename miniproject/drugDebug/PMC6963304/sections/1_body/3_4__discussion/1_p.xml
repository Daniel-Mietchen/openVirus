<p>Over the past decade, a number of novel viruses emerged in pigs in China and caused huge economic losses [

 <xref rid="B29-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. As one of them, at the end of 2011, re-emergence PR outbreaks were reported in many pig farms in China. Evidence suggests that the new epidemic is the result of a variant PRV strain [
 <xref rid="B2-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The Bartha-K61 vaccine is inadequate to protect pigs from infection with variant PRV [
 <xref rid="B8-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and thus antiviral therapeutics may be a critical strategy to control variant PRV damage in the swine husbandry. PRV is an important threat to animals and possibly humans. A case of suspected PRV infection in humans occurred in China in 2017. The patient presented with fever, headaches, and visual impairment [
 <xref rid="B4-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Many countries have also reported PRV interspecies transmission [
 <xref rid="B3-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. With the emergence of new viruses that threaten both the pig industry and public health, the discovery of new functions in existing clinical drugs is often used in the screening of modern emergency drugs. Germacrone has an antiviral effect on a variety of viruses, such as IAV, PPV, FCV, and PRRSV [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In this study, we investigated the effect of germacrone on PRV variant strain. We found that germacrone could inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner at the early stage of virus replication by western blot and IFA. We showed that germacrone could not directly kill the virus nor affect the adsorption and invasion of PRV. We also found that it could not affect the expression of nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155, the receptors of PRV. To further investigate at which phase PRV replication is sensitive to germacrone treatment, cells were exposed to germacrone at various time points. PRV replication was impressed significantly when cells were treated with germacrone at 6 hpi. In addition, we found that the antiviral effect at 12 h was significantly higher than at 6 h, so we concluded that germacrone had the best antiviral effect in the early stage of virus replication, as in the case of PRRSV [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00258" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We speculate that treatment with germacrone may affect the expression of host genes or cellular factors, some of which may be required for viral replication. Therefore, we speculate that germacrone may inhibit PRV replication by affecting a cell antiviral mechanism.
