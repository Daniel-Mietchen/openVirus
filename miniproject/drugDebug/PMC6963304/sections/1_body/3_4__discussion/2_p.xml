<p>We explored the anti-PRV virus drugs that have been reported, including a traditional Chinese medicine, DG, and a chemical drug, LiCl. Both DG and germarone belong to traditional Chinese medicine. However, unlike DG which directly kills the virus, germarone plays a role at the early stage of PRV replication and can be used as a therapeutic drug. Although the antiviral effect of germacone is worse than that of LiCl, germacone is safer, considering that resistance develops with the use of chemical drugs like LiCl in clinical applications. We also studied the effect of germarone on the vaccine strain Bartha-K61 and found that it inhibits the replication of PRV vaccine strain Barth K61. So germacrone can be used in vaccinated pigs that are not completely protected against variant type PRV.</p>
