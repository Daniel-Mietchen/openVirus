<p id="Par7">To identify natural compounds with anti-HIV activity we screened a collection of 10,000 natural compounds: Anti-HIV activity was evaluated by determining compound effects on infectious virus production by LC5-RIC cells which are highly susceptible for HIV and contain a DsRed1-encoding reporter gene activated by HIV-infection

 </sup>. For screening, cultures of LC5-RIC reporter cells were first exposed to virus in the presence of the compound (first-step of the assay). Subsequently, supernatants of these cultures were transferred to secondary plates with uninfected LC5-RIC cells. The fluorescent signal of the cultures in the secondary plates served as a measure of compound effects on infectious virus production.
