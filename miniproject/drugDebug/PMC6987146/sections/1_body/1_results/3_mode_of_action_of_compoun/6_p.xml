<p id="Par22">The viral Gag protein is the major structural protein of HIV virus particles and is produced from integrated proviruses. Therefore, we investigated the effect of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment on intracellular Gag-levels by p24 ELISA and by western blot analysis of cell lysates with antibodies raised against the Gag p24 protein (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>, Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). These results revealed that compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> strongly suppressed production of Gag (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>).
