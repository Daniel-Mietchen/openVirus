 </sup>. Use of LC5-RIC cells in a previously described two-step assay format allows comparison of the effect of compound treatment on expression of the DsRed1 reporter gene and infectious virus production in the same cultures. As reference compound, we used an experimental inhibitor of HIV transcription called Flavopiridol. Flavopiridol blocks pTEFb, an essential co-factor for Tat-dependent activation

 </sup>. Experiments were performed with 50 nM of either compound, at which both compounds display potent anti-HIV activity and are nontoxic in LC5-RIC cells (see Supplementary Table
