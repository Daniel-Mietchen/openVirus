 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, Supplementary data file S1). In short, appropriately substituted benzaldehydes were converted to the substituted 2,2-dibromovinylbenzenes, and were reacted with the boronic ester of the key intermediate γ-pyrone-furanone (compound

 <sub>50</sub> below 10 nM) as well as other, less active derivatives (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). Profiling of anti-HIV activities of all Aureothin derivatives was then repeated using primary human target cells for HIV, i.e. peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), in at least three independent assays with PBMCs from different donors as described in Materials and Methods (
 <italic>Inhibition of infection assays</italic>). Compounds (
 <bold>#3</bold>, 
 <bold>#6, #7, #12</bold>, 
 <bold>#13</bold>, and 
 <bold>#21</bold>) showed half maximal (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) anti-HIV activities at similar concentrations as Aureothin (
 <bold>#1</bold>) in PBMCs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). However, determination of concentrations required for 90% inhibition of HIV infection of PBMC revealed an IC
 <sub>90</sub> value comparable to Aureothin only for compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>.
