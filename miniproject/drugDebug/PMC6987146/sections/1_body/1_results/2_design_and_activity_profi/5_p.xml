<p id="Par14">Cell safety of Aureothin derivatives in HIV-exposed PBMC cultures was profiled in various assays commonly used to evaluate adverse off-target effects of compounds on cells
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>
 </sup>. Cytotoxic effects were apparent for the natural product Aureothin, using the CellTiter-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> Viability Assay (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was ~2.27 µM, indicating a selectivity index (CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of ~194 for Aureothin (
 <bold>#1</bold>). In contrast, none of the most potent synthetic Aureothin derivatives showed cytotoxic effects up to 10 µM. This resulted in a selectivity index&gt;970 for compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>, which is 5 times higher than for Aureothin.
