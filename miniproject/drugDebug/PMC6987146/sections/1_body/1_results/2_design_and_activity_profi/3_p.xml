<p id="Par12">The other compounds in this collection showed lower anti-HIV activities than Aureothin. As expected, a truncated compound lacking the nitro-aryl moiety and the linker (
 <bold>#2</bold>) showed no activity at concentrations up to 10 µM. Replacement of the nitro-group with a carboxyl group in a full-length compound also led to a dramatic loss of activity (
 <bold>#18</bold>), underlining the importance of the nature of the para-substituent in the aryl-moiety for inhibition of HIV infection.
