<p id="Par37">Combinations of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> with FTC and 3TC, both commonly used reverse transcriptase inhibitors, revealed synergistic effects at ED
 <sub>90</sub> and ED
 <sub>75</sub>. Synergistic effects were also observed for combination of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> with an integrase inhibitor (DTG). Synergistic effects of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> and DTG combinations were somewhat lower at ED
 <sub>75</sub> than at ED
 <sub>90</sub>. Synergistic effects were not observed for combinations of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> and protease inhibitors at either ED
 <sub>90</sub> or ED
 <sub>75</sub>.
