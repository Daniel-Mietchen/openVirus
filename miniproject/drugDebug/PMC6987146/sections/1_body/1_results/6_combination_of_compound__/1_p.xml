<p id="Par36">Since current anti-HIV therapies depend on the combined activities of multiple HIV inhibitors, another important aspect in initial assessment of the drug potential of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> was to demonstrate that it is suitable for combination with selected clinical drugs. Furthermore, the different mode-of-action of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> from approved anti-HIV drugs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) further supported investigation of occurrence of synergistic effects. Efficacies of HIV inhibition were determined for two-drug mixtures and for single drugs in parallel in HIV exposed cells and combination effects evaluated with the Chou-Talalay theorem

 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> shows the combination indices and isobolograms determined for 90% and 75% HIV inhibition (ED
 <sub>90</sub>, ED
 <sub>75</sub>), respectively. As assay control we evaluated the combinatorial activities of the reverse transcriptase inhibitors Efavirenz (EFV; NNRTI) and Emtricitabine (FTC; NRTI), which were previously reported to synergistically inhibit HIV replication

 </sup>. Combination data points lying to the left of the hypotenuse and combination indices (CI) &lt;0.7 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) confirmed synergism of these drugs at ED
 <sub>90</sub> and ED
 <sub>75</sub> under our experimental conditions.
