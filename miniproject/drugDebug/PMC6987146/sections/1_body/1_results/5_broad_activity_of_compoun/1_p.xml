<p id="Par33">To evaluate the inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> against different HIV genotypes, we used clinical virus isolates representing the two HIV-types, i.e. HIV-type 1 and HIV-type 2. In addition, HIV-type 1 virus isolates were examined from two groups, i.e. the major group M (HIV-1M
 <sub>MVP899-87</sub>), and the outlier group O (HIV-1O
 <sub>MVP5180-91</sub>). Antiviral activities were evaluated in primary human HIV-1 target cells, i.e. PBMCs. As shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> inhibited replication of all clinical isolates with efficacies similar or even higher than against the prototypical laboratory HIV-1 isolate (HIV-1
 <sub>LAI</sub>, Table
