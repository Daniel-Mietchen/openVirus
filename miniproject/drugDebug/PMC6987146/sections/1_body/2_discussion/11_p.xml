<p id="Par49">We conclude that the compounds described here represent a promising new class of powerful HIV inhibitors that are chemically and functionally different from all current clinical anti-HIV drugs. The prototypical compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> inhibits HIV gene expression, with strong effects on production of components of virus particles, thus interfering with a stage of the virus replication cycle not attacked by clinical drugs so far. Proteomics analysis of treatment effects on PBMCs indicated no general disturbance of cellular protein expression, and revealed moderate HIV-selective responses. In addition we show that these compounds can synergize with selected clinical drugs in cell culture experiments and that they are active against multiple HIV genotypes. Future studies will be directed towards the use of these compounds to identify virus-host interactions that represent novel points of attack for HIV inhibition as well as further exploration of the potential of these compounds for development into drugs.
