<p id="Par46">Compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> affects only a small part of the proteome of PBMCs (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S4</xref>), confirming that the inhibition of viral protein expression is not a consequence of unspecific global inhibition of cellular protein expression. This was also observed for CD4+ enriched cells (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). Enrichment analysis of GO-, MeSH-terms and pathways identified various terms connected with the immune system and with viral (including HIV) infection (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Several terms were enriched only in HIV-exposed compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treated cultures. However, the overall results indicate that whole proteomics analysis, by itself, is not sufficient for identification of specific signalling pathways and single genes targeted by compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>. Thus the effect of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> on cellular processes specific for HIV-exposed human primary blood cells awaits further elucidation, possibly by combining results from multiple systems approaches.
