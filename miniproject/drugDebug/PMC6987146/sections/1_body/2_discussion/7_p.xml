<p id="Par45">Compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment affected levels of unspliced and partially spliced HIV transcripts much more strongly than those of multiply spliced transcripts. Thus, effects of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment on HIV transcripts were different from those of the HIV transcriptional inhibitor Flavopiridol

 </sup>, which reduced levels of all three HIV transcript classes to similar extents. This suggests that compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> affects post-transcriptional events of HIV expression involved in the production and accumulation of unspliced and multiply spliced transcripts. These post-transcriptional processes include alternative splicing of the HIV pre-mRNA, stabilization and nuclear export of intron-containing HIV mRNAs and their translation

 </sup> and involve numerous interactions of viral components with cellular partners. We expect future studies dissecting the mechanisms underlying the novel mode-of-action of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> to identify key cellular pathways of HIV expression that can be exploited for anti-HIV drug development.
