<p id="Par44">We chose compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> based on high antiviral potency, improved cell tolerance and photostability as a lead candidate for further analysis of this compound class. Compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment only very moderately affected proviral DNA levels, pointing to post-integration steps of the HIV replication cycle as targets for compound 
 <bold>#7</bold>. 
 <italic>De novo</italic> virus production depends on accumulation of unspliced Gag-encoding transcripts as well as partially spliced Env-encoding transcripts during the late phase of HIV expression

 </sup>. We show that compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> very strongly reduced levels of the viral Gag polyprotein. Importantly, compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> treatment inhibited accumulation of both unspliced and partially spliced mRNA, preventing the production of all major components of virus particles. The mode-of-action of compound 
 <bold>#7</bold> is different from all current clinical anti-HIV drugs (Fig.Â
