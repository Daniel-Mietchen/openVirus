<p id="Par4">Clinical anti-HIV drugs interfere with the HIV replication cycle at the steps of HIV entry, reverse transcription, integration and maturation of virus particles after release from the host cell. Most clinical drugs inhibit steps of the replication cycle catalysed by HIV enzymes (i.e. protease, integrase and reverse transcriptase). cART combines three active drugs, of which two are nucleotide or nucleoside reverse transcriptase (NRTI) inhibitors and the third is from a different class, i.e. a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), protease or integrase inhibitor
