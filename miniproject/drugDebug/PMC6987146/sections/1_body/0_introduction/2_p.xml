<p id="Par3">The main goal of cART is to suppress virus replication to undetectable levels and to minimize the emergence and transmission of drug resistant variants. Unfortunately, global HIV drug resistance is on the rise

 </sup>. This pertains both to pre-treatment drug resistance levels, which in 6 of 11 countries exceeded 10%, as well as prevalence of drug resistance acquired during cART treatment (4â€“28%). Therefore, a major target of the global action plan for overcoming HIV/AIDS is the intensification of research for the development of new treatments and drugs. These are also needed to improve individualization of antiretroviral therapy and to block HIV production by cell populations with persisting, integrated HIV proviruses.
