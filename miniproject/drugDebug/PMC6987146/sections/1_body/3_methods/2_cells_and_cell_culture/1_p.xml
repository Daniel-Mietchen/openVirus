 </sup>. Prior to infection, PBMCs were stimulated with 20 U/ml hIL-2 and 1 µg/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 72 h. CD4+ cells were enriched from whole blood using the RosetteSep
 <sup>TM</sup> Human CD4+ T Cell Enrichment Cocktail from Stemcell Technologies according to the manufacturer's instructions and cells handled like PBMCs. CD4+ cell enrichment was verified by staining with APC mouse anti-human CD4 antibody (BD Pharmingen) and FACS analysis, yielding ~94% CD4+−positive cells.
