<p id="Par60">To evaluate anti-HIV efficacies of test compounds in primary human target cells, stimulated PBMCs were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 500,000 cells per well, different #7concentrations of the compound (serial dilutions) and virus inoculum (MOI of 0.5) added to the PBMCs and cultures incubated for 48 h. Infectious virus production was quantified by transferring 35 µl of supernatant from the PBMC cultures to LC5-RIC cells, seeded in black 96-well plates one day earlier. LC5-RIC cultures were then incubated for 72 h and analysed for DsRed1 reporter expression and anti-HIV activity calculated as described for the EASY-HIT assay.</p>
