<p id="Par61">LC5-RIC cells were plated as described for the EASY-HIT assay. 24 h previous to treatment and inoculation of the cells, compounds (in DMSO) were diluted in cell culture medium to their IC
 <sub>90</sub> concentrations and applied to 96-well plates (triplicate wells for each compound). Plates were incubated either in the dark or under constant illumination with a commercially available desk lamp (2X Philips Master PL-S-9W/840/2 P, 30 cm between light source and compounds) for 24 h at room temperature. For analysis of anti-HIV activity, compound samples were transferred to LC5-RIC cells and their anti-HIV activity determined by measuring compound effects on infectious virus production with the EASY-HIT assay. Relative photostability was calculated by normalizing the anti-HIV activity of the illuminated compounds to the antiviral activity of compounds kept in the dark.
