<p id="Par58">The following assays were used to profile cell safety of compound treatment in HIV-exposed cultures (LC5-RIC or PBMC): (1) CellTox
 <sup>
  <bold>TM</bold>
 </sup> Green Cytotoxicity Assay, Promega, measures binding of a fluorescent dye to DNA of cells with impaired membrane integrity; (2) CellTiter-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> 2.0 Assay, Promega, which measures the amount of ATP in viable cells after lysis using an assay with luminescence read-out. Cells were plated into black 96-well plates followed by overnight incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Compounds dissolved in DMSO were screened at multiple concentrations from 0.6 to 10,000 nM at a final DMSO concentration of 0.04% followed by additional 48 h incubation. Both assays were performed according to manufacturer’s recommendations and consecutively in the above mentioned order. Cells were washed once with PBS between the assays.
