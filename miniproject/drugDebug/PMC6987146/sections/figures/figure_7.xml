  <p>Mode-of-action of compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> in the HIV replication cycle: blocking of 
   <italic>de novo</italic> virus production by inhibiting HIV gene expression. The HIV replication cycle is shown with numbers indicating the consecutive steps of the replication cycle. 1, Attachment of virus to receptor; 2, Fusion of viral and cellular membranes; 3, Uncoating and delivery of viral RNA to cytoplasm; 4, Generation of the DNA copy of viral genome by reverse transcription; 5, Nuclear import of viral DNA and integration into host cell genome; 6, Virus expression; 7, Assembly of Gag, Pol, Env proteins and unspliced viral RNAs to virus particles; 8, Budding of immature virus particles; 9, Maturation of virus particles. Steps of the replication cycle attacked by clinically approved drugs are indicated by circles with orange fill colour (Steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 9). Compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> inhibits virus expression (6, red fill colour), which is not blocked by current clinical drugs. The mRNAs suppressed by compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> encode for Gag, Pol, Env proteins and included viral RNAs packaged into new virions.
