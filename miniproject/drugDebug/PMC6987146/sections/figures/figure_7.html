 <caption> Mode-of-action of compound #7 in the HIV replication cycle: blocking of de novo virus production by inhibiting HIV gene expression. The HIV replication cycle is shown with numbers indicating the consecutive steps of the replication cycle. 1, Attachment of virus to receptor; 2, Fusion of viral and cellular membranes; 3, Uncoating and delivery of viral RNA to cytoplasm; 4, Generation of the DNA copy of viral genome by reverse transcription; 5, Nuclear import of viral DNA and integration into host cell genome; 6, Virus expression; 7, Assembly of Gag, Pol, Env proteins and unspliced viral RNAs to virus particles; 8, Budding of immature virus particles; 9, Maturation of virus particles. Steps of the replication cycle attacked by clinically approved drugs are indicated by circles with orange fill colour (Steps 1, 2, 4, 5, 9). Compound #7 inhibits virus expression (6, red fill colour), which is not blocked by current clinical drugs. The mRNAs suppressed by compound #7 encode for Gag, Pol, Env proteins and included viral RNAs packaged into new virions. </caption>
