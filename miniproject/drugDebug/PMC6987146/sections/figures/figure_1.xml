  <p>Profiling of photostability of anti-HIV activity of Aureothin and synthetic Aureothin-derivatives. Anti-HIV activity of compound samples illuminated for 24 h were normalised to anti-HIV activity of samples of the same compound kept in the dark. Anti-HIV activity was measured by quantifying the amounts of infectious virus produced by HIV-1
   <sub>LAI</sub> exposed LC5-RIC cells treated with compounds at IC
   <sub>90</sub> concentrations (Supplementary Table 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The black column shows data for Aureothin (
   <bold>#1</bold>) and the grey columns for Aureothin-derivatives. Shown are means of at least three independent experiments with biological triplicates (n ≥ 3; m = 3) and the standard error of the mean (SEM) indicated.
