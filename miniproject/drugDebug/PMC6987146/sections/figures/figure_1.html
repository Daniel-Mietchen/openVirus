 <caption> Profiling of photostability of anti-HIV activity of Aureothin and synthetic Aureothin-derivatives. Anti-HIV activity of compound samples illuminated for 24 h were normalised to anti-HIV activity of samples of the same compound kept in the dark. Anti-HIV activity was measured by quantifying the amounts of infectious virus produced by HIV-1 LAI exposed LC5-RIC cells treated with compounds at IC 90 concentrations (Supplementary Table  S1). The black column shows data for Aureothin ( #1) and the grey columns for Aureothin-derivatives. Shown are means of at least three independent experiments with biological triplicates (n ≥ 3; m = 3) and the standard error of the mean (SEM) indicated. </caption>
