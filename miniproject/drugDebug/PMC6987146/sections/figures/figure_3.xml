  <p>Compound #7 inhibits expression of HIV virion components from integrated proviruses on protein and RNA levels. LC5-RIC cells were exposed to HIV-1
   <sub>LAI</sub> and to Aureothin derivatives or to reference compounds or to solvent control (DMSO) for 48 h and subsequently assayed for levels of integrated proviral DNA 
   <bold>(a)</bold>, intracellular Gag proteins 
   <bold>(b)</bold> and different classes of HIV transcripts 
   <bold>(c)</bold>. Aureothin derivatives consisted of the prototypical compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> or the negative control compounds (
   <bold>#4</bold> or 
   <bold>#18</bold>).The HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitor Efavirenz (EFV), the integrase inhibitor Dolutegravir (DTG) and the HIV transcriptional inhibitor Flavopiridol (FLV) were used as reference compounds. Results from samples exposed to solvent (DMSO) without compound were used for normalization of compound effects. 
   <bold>(a)</bold> Genomic DNA was extracted from cells and used to quantify levels of integrated proviral DNA by Alu-PCR. Shown are the means of three independent experiments with biological triplicates (n = 3; m = 3) and the standard deviation (SD), normalized to DMSO control. 
   <bold>(b)</bold> Samples of cell lysates were evaluated for the presence of Gag by p24-ELISA and by western blot analysis, using antibodies against Gag-p24. GAPDH served as loading control in the western blot. The graph shows the means of three independent experiments with biological duplicates (n = 3; m = 2) and SD, normalized to DMSO control. The western blot is representative for 3 individual experiments. All samples for Gag and GAPDH detection derive from the same experiment; both blots were processed in parallel. Full-length blots are presented in Supplementary Fig. 
   <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S2</xref>. 
   <bold>(c)</bold> RNA was extracted from cells and real-time PCR used to quantify relative levels of the indicated HIV-transcript classes in treated versus untreated cultures. Shown are the means of three independent experiments with biological duplicates (n = 3; m = 2) and SD, normalized to DMSO control. Dunnett’s test was performed to determine whether results from treated samples were significantly different (
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) from the DMSO control. Levels of statistical significance of 
   <italic>P</italic> values are indicated by asterisks, with **
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.01, ***
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001, ****
   <italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001, ns = not significant.
