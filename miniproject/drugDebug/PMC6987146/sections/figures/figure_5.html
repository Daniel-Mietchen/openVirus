 <caption> Compound #7 potently inhibits multiple HIV genotypes. PBMCs were exposed to the indicated clinical virus isolates and serial concentrations of compound #7 and (a) half maximal (IC 50) and (b) 90% (IC 90) HIV-inhibitory concentrations were determined. Clinical isolates represented the following HIV genotypes: HIV-1M MVP899-87: HIV-type 1, Major group; HIV-1O MVP5180-91: HIV-type 1, Outlier group; HIV-2 MVP10668-93: HIV-type 2; HIV-1 V13-03413B: HIV-type 1, Major group/B-clade, isolate with multiple drug-resistance mutations 8 . Depicted are the means of three independent experiments with biological triplicates (n = 3; m = 3) and standard deviations (SD). </caption>
