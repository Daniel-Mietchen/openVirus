  <p>Comparison of effects of compound #7 treatment on reporter gene expression and production of infectious virus in LC5-RIC cultures. LC5-RIC cells contain a reporter gene that is activated by early viral gene expression during HIV infection and encodes a red fluorescent protein (DsRed1). Effects of compound treatment on reporter gene expression and production of infectious virus were determined in LC5-RIC cultures exposed to virus inoculum in the presence or absence of compounds for 48 h. Fluorescent signals of these primary cultures were measured to determine effects on reporter gene expression. Effects on infectious virus production were determined by transferring aliquots of the supernatants of primary cultures to uninfected LC5-RIC cells, and fluorescent signals determined in secondary plates 72 h after transfer. Fluorescent signal intensities of compound-treated cultures were normalized to those of untreated virus-exposed cultures. Compound treatments were performed at 50 nM. Flavopiridol, an inhibitor of HIV transcription, was used as control compound. Data points are from 10 assays performed in triplicate for compound 
   <bold>#7</bold> and 3 assays performed in triplicate for Flavopiridol.
