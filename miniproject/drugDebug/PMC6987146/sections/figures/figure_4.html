 <caption> Summarised enrichment analysis profile of proteins differentially expressed in PBMCs as a consequence of compound  #7 treatment. PBMC isolates from three different donors were used as biological replicates and the lists of genes up- or down regulated by treatment with compound #7 were determined. GO-terms, canonical pathways, and MeSH terms enriched in either HIV-exposed PBMC (↑ up-regulated, ↓ down-regulated) or PBMC exposed to compound #7 in the absence of HIV (also up- and down-regulated) were determined and shown as heat map. Summary terms are shown color-coded on the left. The heat map is coded by colour saturation (in %): p-value range =% colour saturation: e −3 to e −5 = 20, e −6 to e −8 = 40, e −9 to e −11 = 60, e −12 to e −14 = 80, ≥e −15 = 100. Shared enrichments are boxed in blue, HIV-exposure specific enrichments are boxed in red. More detailed information about terms and proteins are shown in Supplementary Table  S3 and Data files S2, S3. </caption>
