<p id="p0085">Several recent studies have identified promising drug candidates that may help reduce symptoms of COVID-19 by inhibiting some aspects of SARS-CoV-2. For example, remdesivir and chloroquine showed inhibitory effects against SARS-CoV-2

 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study showed that hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine for inhibiting SARS-CoV-2

 <xref rid="b0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. However, these studies are based on previous knowledge that these drugs showed some inhibitory effects on similar coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and/or MERS-CoV. In contrast, our approach was truly based on a pre-trained MT-DTI deep-learning model that understands drug-target interactions without domain knowledge 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. In fact, MT-DTI successfully identified the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted drugs that are used in clinics (in top-30 predicted candidates) among 1794 chemical compounds registered in the DrugBank database in a previous study 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, suggesting that 3D structural information of proteins and/or molecules is not necessarily required to predict drug-target interactions.
