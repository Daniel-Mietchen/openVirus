<p id="p0025">SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic>, contains a positive-sense single-stranded RNA [(+)ssRNA] genome (29,903 bp) and contains genes encoding 3C-like proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase, spike protein, envelope protein, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein, and several unknown proteins, according to the genome sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="b0050" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. During the life cycle of coronaviruses, the virus replicates via the following processes after entering the host cell: 1) translation of genomic RNA (gRNA), 2) proteolysis of the translated polyprotein with viral 3C-like proteinase, 3) replication of gRNA with the viral replication complex that consists of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, 3′-to-5′ exonuclease, endoRNAse, and 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase, and 4) assembly of viral components 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. These replication-associated proteins are the primary targets of post-entry treatment drugs to suppress viral replication. Although much intensive effort is being made worldwide to develop drugs or vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, patients currently suffering from COVID-19 cannot expect benefits from them due to the slow development process of novel drugs or vaccines.
