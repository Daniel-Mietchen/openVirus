<p id="p0035">In this study, we applied our pre-trained MT-DTI model to identify commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially disrupt SARS-CoV-2â€²s viral components, such as proteinase, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and/or helicase. Since the model utilizes simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings and amino acid (AA) sequences, which are 1D string inputs, it is possible to quickly apply target proteins that do not have experimentally confirmed 3D crystal structures, such as viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. We share a list of top commercially available antiviral drugs that could potentially hinder the multiplication cycle of SARS-CoV-2 with the hope that effective drugs can be developed based on these AI-proposed drug candidates and act against SARS-CoV-2.</p>
