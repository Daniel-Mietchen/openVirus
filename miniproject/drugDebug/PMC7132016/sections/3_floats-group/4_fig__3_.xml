   <bold>Schematic diagram showing the systemic inflammatory response syndrome induced by SARS-CoV2.</bold> After the SARS-CoV-2 infection, pathogenic T cells are rapidly activated, producing granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin (IL)-6 and other proinflammatory factors. GM-CSF will further activate CD14
   <sup>+</sup>CD16
   <sup>+</sup> inflammatory monocytes, producing a larger amount of IL-6 and other proinflammatory factors, and thereby inducing an inflammatory “storm” that leads to immune damage to other organs, such as the lungs and the liver. Both IL-6 and GM-CSF are two key proinflammatory factors that trigger the inflammatory “storm” in patients with COVID-19.
