<p>A total of six case series reporting the percentage of abnormal liver function test results amongst COVID-19 patients suggested that the proportion of infected men with increased serum AST levels was higher than that observed in infected women.

It is possible to hypothesize that infected men are more predisposed to develop COVID-19-associated liver dysfunction than infected women, and we suggest that further research is required to better understand this sex-related difference.
