<p>To better understand the distribution of COVID-19-related liver dysfunction in different regions of the world, we searched the available literature between December 11, 2019 and February 20, 2020. The literature search focused on initial case reports and case series covering COVID-19 patients, with a clear description of liver function tests and results. All case reports without any data on patients’ liver function tests were excluded. Finally, we included 14 eligible studies, including 5 case reports (
 <xref rid="t01" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and 9 case series (
 <xref rid="t02" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>

 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> By reviewing these 14 studies, we have described geographical and demographic characteristics of COVID-19-related liver dysfunction (as summarized below).
