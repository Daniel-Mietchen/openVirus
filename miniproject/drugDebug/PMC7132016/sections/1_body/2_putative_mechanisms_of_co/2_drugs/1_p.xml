<p>During the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, many infected patients have been treated with antipyretic agents. Most of these medications contain acetaminophen, which is a drug recognized as being able to cause significant liver damage or induce liver failure.
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> It is known that an acute ingestion of &gt;7.5 to 10 g of acetaminophen in adults or 150 to 200 mg/kg in children is likely to cause hepatotoxicity.
 <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Although the US Food and Drug Administration Advisory Committee has proposed a decrease in the maximum daily dosage of acetaminophen from 4 to 3 g, and the maximum individual dosage from 1 to 0.65 g, (relegating 500-mg tablets to prescription status), these recommendations have not been implemented worldwide.
 <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In addition, although there is currently no targeted antiviral treatment for COVID-19, many infected patients have also been treated with some antiviral drugs, such as oseltamivir, abidol or lopinavir, which may have some hepatotoxic effects.
