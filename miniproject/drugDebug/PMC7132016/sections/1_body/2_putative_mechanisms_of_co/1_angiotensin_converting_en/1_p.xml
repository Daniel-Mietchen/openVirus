<p>Whether SARS-CoV-2 has direct adverse effects on liver function is currently not known. Some studies have suggested that SARS-CoV-2 predominantly enters alveolar epithelial cells through the human ACE2 receptor.

However, previous studies have found that bile duct epithelial cells may also express ACE2 receptor at a concentration 20 times higher than in hepatocytes and these findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection might also cause bile duct epithelial cell damage.

 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> However, significant increases in circulating levels of serum alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin or gamma-glutamyltransferase (that may reflect bile duct injury) have been rarely reported in COVID-19 patients.
 <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Liver histopathologic features from COVID-19 patients also did not show any significant damage in hepatocytes or bile duct cells.
 <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> For this reason, it is reasonable to assume that COVID-19-related liver dysfunction is more likely due to secondary liver damage than the use of hepatotoxic therapies or the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, or multiple organ dysfunction.
