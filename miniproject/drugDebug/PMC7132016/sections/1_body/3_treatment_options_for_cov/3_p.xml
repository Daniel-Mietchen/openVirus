 <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> reported that glycyrrhizic acid derivatives might also have antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Glycyrrhizic acid is one of the first-line drugs for anti-inflammatory protection in liver disease, and it has been used in clinical practice for many years.
 <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> In particular, glycyrrhizic acid is a triterpene glycoside isolated from the root of the licorice plant. ACE2 is a cellular type I membrane protein that is mostly expressed in the lungs, heart, kidneys, and intestine. Full-length ACE2 consists of an N-terminal peptidase domain and a C-terminal collectrin-like domain that ends with a single trans-membrane helix and a ∼40-residue intracellular segment.
 <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> Glycyrrhizin has the potential to bind to ACE2 receptor with an estimated ΔG (kcal/mol) of -9, with the binding sites of ARG-559, GLN-388, ARG-393, and ASP-30.
