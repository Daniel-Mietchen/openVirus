 <caption> A Small Molecule That Mimics Antiviral Drug Signaling Modulation. A. pS6 kinase inhibitor in HSV-1 inhibition. SL0101 displayed a RIB-like anti-HSV-1 behavior. B. SL0101 showed a general decrease in signaling across multiple pathways, particularly at 100 μM. C. SL0101 appeared to decrease all signaling pathways that have basal activity. SL0101 inhibited pS6 at 50 μM when no virus was present, but it was not effective at that dose when virus was present. When HSV-1 was present, SL0101 required as high as 100 μM to show inhibition on pS6. Flow cytometry histograms are color-coded as in a heatmap according to the scale in B. All experimental data shown is representative data from three independent experiments. In part C, *, p value &lt; 0.05 **, p value &lt; 0.01. Quantitation of plots from B are shown in Supplemental Fig. 6 with pAKT levels in 6A, pMAPKAPK2 levels in 6B, p-p70 S6K levels in 6C and pS6 levels in 6D. </caption>
