 <caption> Drug Treatment of Viral Infection Affecting Distinct Signaling Nodes. Host cells were pre-infected with HSV-1 for 8h and then received drug treatments for 16 h. The signaling alterations became more complex compared to host cells treated only with drugs but without virus. A. RIB reduced both pS6 level and viral burden. B. pSTAT1 signaling was blocked in HSV-1 infected cells, but it was recovered by IFN treatments. C. pMAPKAPK2 level was decreased by HSV-1 treatment, whereas blocking HSV-1 infection increased pMAPKAPK2 signaling. D. pNFĸB was induced in HSV-1 infected cells, whereas ACV containing treatments reduced pNFĸB level to baseline. E. ACV treatments that reduced HSV-1 levels appeared to induce pAKT levels in the HSV-1 positive population. As a reminder: high dose IFNs and ACV (Optimal_A). All experimental data shown is representative data from three independent experiments. </caption>
