   <bold>Cellular Signaling During Drug-Treated Viral Infection.</bold> A. Host cells were infected with HSV-1, and 8 h post-infection they were treated with drugs. B. 0.5 h after drug treatments, all infected samples had approximately equivalent viral infection levels/percentages, which indicates that the drugs would not instantly lead to viral reduction. C. 16 h post-treatment (24 h post-infection), pAKT, pMAPKAPK2, pNFĸB, pS6 and pSTAT1 were found to be involved during the viral infection and inhibition process. As a reminder: high dose IFNs and ACV (Optimal_A and Optimal_AA), high dose RIB and ACV (Optimal_B), low dose IFNs and ACV (Subopt_A), and low dose IFNs and RIB (Subopt_B). All experimental data shown is representative data from three independent experiments. Flow cytometry histograms are color-coded as in a heatmap with black being unchanged and shades of yellow denoting increases. Quantitation of pSTAT1 from B are shown in 
   <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 3</xref>. Quantitation of plots from C are shown in 
   <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplemental Fig. 4</xref> with GFP levels in 4A, pAKT levels in 4B, pMAPKAPK2 levels in 4C, pNFĸB levels in 4D, pS6 levels in 4E and pSTAT1 levels in 4F. Red arrows in Supplemental Fig. 4 A, E and F indicate Optimal_B and Ribavirin treatments across the analysis.
