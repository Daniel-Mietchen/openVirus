 <caption> Translating Cellular Signaling Analysis to a Small Molecule Treatment of HSV Infection. SL0101 (RSK p90 inhibitor) inhibited HSV-1 infection in vivo. A. Demonstration of the animal model used in the current study. B. Drug combination Optimal_B (high dose RIB and ACV) effectively prevented HSV-1 infection in the animal model, indicating that the animal model was valid for further evaluations on the anti-HSV-1 potency of SL0101. C. SL0101 significantly reduced viral burden in vivo. D. Unlike drug combination Optimal_B, which started to show strong an anti-HSV-1 effect on day 2, SL0101 took longer (day 3) to induce viral inhibition. Each experiment used nine animals for each data point. *, p value &lt; 0.05 **, p value &lt; 0.01. </caption>
