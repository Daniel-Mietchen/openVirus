<p id="p0035">Treatment of different disease states through combinations of multiple drugs is used to achieve better therapeutic results, reduce the impact of drug resistance, and sustain high efficacy with low toxicity often with lower doses of the individual drug components. The use of drug combinations is well documented in both cancer and infectious disease therapy (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arts and Hazuda, 2012</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">George et al., 2015</xref>). Therapeutic drug combinations work by simultaneously controlling several cellular pathways in the complex network system. In a previous study (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), two combinations of antiviral drugs, one combination rich in interferon and one rich in Ribavirin, were determined due to their ability to inhibit Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. These combinations were identified through a Feedback System Control (FSC) technique which uses an unbiased search based on the outcome of the drug combination treatment and can identify many unexpected drug combinations offering desired therapeutic outputs (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). However, due to the focus on outputs, the FSC search methodology does not give any information on which cellular signaling pathways are stimulated by these drug combination or the mechanistic reasoning behind efficacy of the optimal drug combination.
