<p id="p0050">The standard therapy for HSV management includes acyclovir (ACV), a compound developed in the 1980s. Extensive use of ACV, as is expected with antiviral therapeutics, has led to resistance to ACV being increasingly reported (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Though both drug combinations were effective in reducing HSV-1 infection, the underlying mechanisms as to why these particular drug combinations were so potent have not been fully explored. In this study, infected cells treated with either the RIB-rich drug combination or the IFN-rich drug combination were compared side-by-side using phosphoflow technology to determine how these drug combinations affect cellular signaling networks. By not focusing on one set pathway of cellular signaling we used an unbiased approach looking across various signaling nodes in cells to better understand the antiviral mechanisms of these two drug combinations and directly identify cellular signaling pathways that are critical in the control of HSV-1 replication. This study demonstrates the power of using this approach to analyze drug combinations and how to translate the findings. Importantly, we also directly translate our findings into the signaling changes involved in the HSV-1 infection to directly target those changes with antiviral therapies.
