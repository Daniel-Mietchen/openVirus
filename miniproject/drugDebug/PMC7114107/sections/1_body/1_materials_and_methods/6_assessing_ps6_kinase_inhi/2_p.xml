<p id="p0075">To validate the cause-effect relationships between pS6 signaling and HSV-1 infection, we used a pS6 kinase inhibitor, SL0101, to evaluate the effect of anti-HSV-1 drug combinations on down-regulating the S6 signaling pathway. SL0101 at three doses (25, 50, and 100 μM) was compared with RIB at 100 μM and ACV at 100 μM. Cells were infected with HSV-1 at the same time that drugs were administered. We also examined the effects of these treatments on pAKT, pERK, pMAPKAPK2, p-p38, p-p70, p-p90
