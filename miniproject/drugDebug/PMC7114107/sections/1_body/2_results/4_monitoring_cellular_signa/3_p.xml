<p id="p0110">All samples infected with HSV-1 were done so at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 (+HSV) for 8 h after which the cells were treated with drugs. All conditions had equivalent GFP levels/percentages 0.5 h after drug treatment (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). The GFP level in +HSV samples was low across all treatments, indicating that viral infection was still in progress and that the majority of cells remained uninfected. Neither IFN-rich nor RIB-rich treatments lowered levels of viral infection in an instantaneous manner (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). 16 h after drug treatments, GFP levels in +HSV samples increased extensively throughout the cell population indicating that the viral infection was able to infect the whole cell population during this time frame. In this model with virus infection prior to drug treatment, drug combination Optimal_B (RIB-rich combination) outperformed Optimal_A (IFN-rich combination) in viral inhibition at 16 h post treatment. Although Optimal_A and Optimal_B combinations were identified in a drug-virus co-infection model (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), drug combination Optimal_A barely reduced the viral infection level in cells infected with virus prior to treatment (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). This may be due to the previous work using a viral co-infection/treatment model for determining the optimal drug combinations.
