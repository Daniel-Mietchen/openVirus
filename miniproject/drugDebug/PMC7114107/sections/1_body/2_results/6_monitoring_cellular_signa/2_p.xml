<p id="p0125">To confirm the correlations among RIB, pS6 signaling, and HSV-1 infection obtained in the initial screening, we investigated the state of cellular signaling in cells simultaneously treated with the drug combinations and infected with HSV-1 (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A). In order to allow viral infection to propagate adequately, we focused on the time point 16 h after cells were treated with drug combinations and infected with HSV-1. In this model, Optimal_A and Optimal_B both profoundly reduced HSV-1 infections compared to unstimulated controls (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). This result is in line with conclusions in the previously published findings (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). When we further compared HSV-1 infection levels (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C) and pS6 levels (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D), HSV-1 infection induced an increase in pS6 levels by 5–10 fold, and RIB or the RIB-containing drug combination reduced percent infection and pS6 levels following a similar pattern. Percent infection plotted against pS6 levels revealed that viral infection followed a log-linear relationship with pS6 level (
