<p id="p0090">To better understand how the therapeutic drug combinations were able to inhibit HSV-1 replication, we used phosphoflow to simultaneously monitor the phosphorylated states of 12 cellular signaling nodes (Akt, ERK, JNK, cJun, MAPKAPK2, NFĸB, p38, S6, STAT1, STAT3, STAT5, and STAT6) in individual cells upon drug stimulation. We chose these different signaling nodes to highlight key signal transduction cascades that if modulated would lead to direct changes in the state of the cells. This system is robust enough to track the changes in cellular physiology, as indicated by changes in cellular signaling, induced by the different drug combinations to provide definitive insight into how the cell is affected by these drugs individually and in their optimal combinations by looking at the panel of phosphoproteins. Each individual drug from the combinations was administrated alone and in combination in duplicate at time 0. Samples were collected at four time points post simulation (0.5, 4, 8, and 16 h).</p>
