<p id="p0095">Using this approach, we were able to discern the exact changes in treated cells that were signatures of the optimal drug combinations. An overview of the phosphoprotein panel shown in 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> indicates that most proteins phosphorylation states were unaffected in cells treated with drug combinations. However, analysis of these panels of signaling nodes revealed that levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6) were noticeably regulated by treatment with different drug combinations (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A). Sixteen hours after drug treatment, we found that stimulation with individual revealed that, as expected, Interferons including IFN-β and IFN-γ induced upregulation of pSTAT1 in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, 
 <bold>left panel, yellow histograms</bold>). In addition, we see that most of the drugs individually cause minimal to no change to the high levels of pS6 proteins, except the higher dose of Ribavirin (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, 
 <bold>right panel, black histogram</bold>). The optimal combinations followed these key individual drugs with the IFN-rich treatments (Optimal_A) inducing increased levels of pSTAT1 but induced no obvious changes in pS6 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). Conversely, RIB-rich treatments (Optimal_B) decreased levels of pS6 but induced no obvious changes in pSTAT1 (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C). While both of these drug combinations were discovered for their effectiveness at blocking HSV-1 replication (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), these two drug combinations seems to change cellular signaling in distinct ways.
