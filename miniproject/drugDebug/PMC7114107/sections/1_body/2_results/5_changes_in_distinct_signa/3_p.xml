<p id="p0120">Differences in phosphoprotein signaling became more complex 16 h after treatment (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C). pAKT, pMAPKAPK2, pNFĸB, pS6, and pSTAT1 were regulated to various extents by the different drug combinations. In particular, RIB treatments led to both a decrease in pS6 levels and a reduction in HSV-1 viral burden (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> A). pSTAT1 levels were diminished in HSV-1 infected cells, but pSTAT1 levels were recovered by IFN treatments (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). HSV-1 infection decreased pMAPKAPK2 levels, whereas blocking HSV-1 infection with ACV containing treatments increased pMAPKAPK2 signaling (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). pNFĸB was induced in HSV-1 infected cells, but ACV treatments reduced pNFĸB levels to baseline (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>D). ACV containing treatments that reduced HSV-1 levels appeared to induce pAKT levels in the HSV-1 positive population (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>E). Overall, when HSV-1 viral infection was present, phosphoprotein changes became more complex. However, the most significant changes in phosphorylation status for drug combination optimal_A was still pSTAT1, and the most significant changes in phosphorylation status for drug combination optimal_B was still pS6. The correlation between IFN, pSTAT1 status, and HSV-1 infection has been widely reported and part of the known biology of IFN. However, the lack of agreement about the mechanisms of RIB and the high efficacy of the RIB-rich drug combination in blocking HSV-1 encouraged us to focus our further investigation into the correlations among RIB, pS6 levels, and HSV-1 infection.
