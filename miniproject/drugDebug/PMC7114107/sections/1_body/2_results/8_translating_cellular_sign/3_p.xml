<p id="p0145">We then tested SL0101 for its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-HSV-1 effect using this animal model (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A). Mice treated with SL0101 did not show significant viral reduction compared to the untreated group on day 2. However, the treated group showed more than 12 fold viral reduction compared to untreated group on day 3 (
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>C). When we compared the fold change in HSV-1 levels (e.g. levels on day 2 divided by day 1 levels (day2/day1) and levels on day 3 divided by day 1 levels (day3/day1)), the benefit of SL0101 treatment in limiting HSV-1 replication became much clearer, especially for day3/day1. Unlike drug combination Optimal_B, which started to show strong an anti-HSV-1 effect on day 2, the antiviral effect of SL0101 was delayed by about a day (
