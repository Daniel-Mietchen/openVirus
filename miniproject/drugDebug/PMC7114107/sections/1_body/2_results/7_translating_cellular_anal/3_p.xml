<p id="p0135">It is important to note that broad spectrum modulation of signaling pathways by a drug may lead to drug-induced toxicity. Therefore, it is possible that SL0101 could be more toxic than RIB even though such toxicity was not obvious based on observation of cellular morphology in our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 5A</xref>) and SL0101 only induced toxicity in an MTT assay at concentrations above what we used in this study (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 5B</xref>). SL0101 inhibited pS6 at 50 μM when virus was absent, but it was not effective at that dose when virus was present (
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>C). When virus was present, SL0101 only down-regulated pS6 at 100 μM. Furthermore, with HSV infection present, SL0101 did not obviously reduce viral infection levels at 50 μM, but infection levels were diminished at 100 μM. Therefore, SL0101 regulates pS6 signaling in a dose-dependent manner in uninfected cells, but SL0101 treatment inhibits HSV infection at a high dose in concordance with changes in pS6 during viral infection.
