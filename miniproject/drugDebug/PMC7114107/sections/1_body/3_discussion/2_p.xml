<p id="p0150">Analysis of alternations in cellular signaling induced by any one drug, combination of drugs, or the disease state can rapidly elucidate the intricate changes in cellular signaling which is crucial for determining how to therapeutically apply drugs for a proper balance between therapeutic outcomes and potential side effects. Phosphoflow technology is a robust tool that can monitor many cellular signaling pathways that can be modulated during drug treatment (

We focused our work on changes in phosphorylation states in a panel of key signaling nodes representative of the major cellular processes that could be altered by the drug treatments being used.
