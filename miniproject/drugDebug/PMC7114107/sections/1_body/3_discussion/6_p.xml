<p id="p0170">The efficacy of the S6 phosphorylation inhibition in reducing HSV-1 replication in an animal model of vaginal HSV-1 infection shows how important it is to understand the changes in cellular signaling that are effective in blocking viral infection. However, results of this study revealed that even without HSV-1 infection, RIB directly lowers the level of phosphorylated S6. This finding is important because it underscores that regulation of S6 phosphorylation occurs in cells with and without viral infection. Consequently, the consequences of changing the phosphorylation state of a key ribosomal protein by any drug may be immense. We did not see any obvious changes in cellular morphology nor changes in cell viability as assessed by MTT assay when cells were treated with SL0101, suggesting that minimal cellular toxicity was induced by the SL0101. However, further investigations into how SL0101 can impact cellular physiology are warranted in order to develop effective counter measures against side effects that may be induced by this type of antiviral.</p>
