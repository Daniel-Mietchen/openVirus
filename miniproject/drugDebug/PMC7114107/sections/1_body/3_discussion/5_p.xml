<p id="p0165">HSV-1 is one of the most well studied viruses known so it is intriguing that our analysis of cellular signaling modulation in infected cells, using an unbiased approach to discovered that S6 phosphorylation is a new target for antivirals targeting HSV-1. Given the importance of the S6 protein control of ribosomal translation, further studies of how HSV-1 replication benefits from this change in S6 and how common this method of manipulation of cellular translation is among different viruses is needed (
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006</xref>). Could it be that the efficacy of RIB is conveyed via changes in S6 induced by viruses? If the theme of S6 manipulation by viruses is common in other viral disease, S6 phosphorylation modulators may be a new class of antivirals.
