   <bold>SL0101 Does Not Induce Cellular Toxicity</bold>. A. NIH3T3 cells used in the previous 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments were subjected to treatment with mock conditions or 100 mm of SL0101 for 48 h. After which they were observed for changes in morphology that would be a sign of SL0101 induced cytotoxicity. No changes were seen. Images shown are representative of several (N = 5) images taken within each well. B. SL0101 was added to cells in increasing amounts and a standard MTT assay was used to determine toxicity. Cell viability from the MTT assay was plotted against SL0101 concentrations. Data points were done in triplicates and averaged of the values for each point were graphed with error bars representing standard error of triplicates shown.
