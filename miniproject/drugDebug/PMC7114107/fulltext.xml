Here we use phospho-specific flow cytometry to assess perturbations of many different cellular signaling pathways during treatment with drug combinations that are highly effective in blocking Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation. We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and in an <italic>in vivo</italic> animal model of HSV-1 infection. Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection.

However, potential side effects and off-label indications are often not found until clinical trials or post-market drug safety monitoring. Consequently, this approach to drug discovery often leads to unexpected problems or misfires that delay or block significant advancements. Techniques that can determine the best drug or combination of drugs to optimally treat a disease without using conventional drug screening approaches are needed for rapid, efficient translational medicine (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). Developing targeted therapies that focus on the key signaling pathways that lead to pathology and avoid bystander perturbations of the physiology of a cell are possible when looking at how a therapeutic drug combination impacts a cell using an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Bendall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bodenmiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Schweizer and Zhang, 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0035">Treatment of different disease states through combinations of multiple drugs is used to achieve better therapeutic results, reduce the impact of drug resistance, and sustain high efficacy with low toxicity often with lower doses of the individual drug components. The use of drug combinations is well documented in both cancer and infectious disease therapy (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Al-Lazikani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Arts and Hazuda, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">George et al., 2015</xref>). Therapeutic drug combinations work by simultaneously controlling several cellular pathways in the complex network system. In a previous study (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>), two combinations of antiviral drugs, one combination rich in interferon and one rich in Ribavirin, were determined due to their ability to inhibit Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) infection. These combinations were identified through a Feedback System Control (FSC) technique which uses an unbiased search based on the outcome of the drug combination treatment and can identify many unexpected drug combinations offering desired therapeutic outputs (<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al., 2008</xref>). However, due to the focus on outputs, the FSC search methodology does not give any information on which cellular signaling pathways are stimulated by these drug combination or the mechanistic reasoning behind efficacy of the optimal drug combination.</p><p id="p0040">In this study, we use phosphospecific flow cytometry, or phosphoflow, to understand the changes in cellular signaling using potent antiviral drug combinations as stimuli. The phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins by kinases and phosphatases are part of the essential regulatory networks that drive the phenotype and function of cells, tissues, and organisms, especially after exposure to a drug or biological therapeutic (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Sachs et al., 2005</xref>). Advances in phosphoflow have made studies at the phosphoproteomic level possible (<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Krutzik and Nolan, 2006</xref>). Using phosphoflow to monitor multiple indicators of cellular physiology allows us to determine how drug combinations affect the intricate cellular signaling by simultaneously interrogating distinct signaling nodes within treated cells. The insight afforded to us by phosphoflow analysis of a drug combination or disease state may allow us to better design specific therapeutics that modulate the activity of disease-related kinases or phosphatases (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Krutzik et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Bodenmiller et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p id="p0045">Antivirals represent a class of drugs for which development is often focused on the singular outcome of limiting viral infection. However, side effects and potential off-label or secondary indications for the use of a drug are often only discovered after the drug is used with FDA approval. A prime example of a virus that is well studied with regards to antiviral therapy is HSV-1. HSV-1 frequently infects humans leading to diseases ranging from mild mucocutaneous lesions to life threatening infections, especially in elderly or immunocompromised patients (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Whitley and Roizman, 2001</xref>). HSV-1 is characterized by its ability to develop latency in neurons of sensory ganglia and lytic outbreaks that often require drug therapy (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Knickelbein et al., 2008</xref>). Although extensive research efforts have been made to unveil the mechanism of HSV-1 infection, new aspects of HSV-1 pathogenesis are frequently discovered (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Tognarelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Sauerbrei, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Johnston and Corey, 2016</xref>).</p><p id="p0050">The standard therapy for HSV management includes acyclovir (ACV), a compound developed in the 1980s. Extensive use of ACV, as is expected with antiviral therapeutics, has led to resistance to ACV being increasingly reported (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Morfin and Thouvenot, 2003</xref>; <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Piret and Boivin, 2011</xref>). As the future clinical efficacy of ACV is being assessed, therapies with increased efficacy, reduced resistance potential, and improved pharmacokinetics will undoubtedly benefit clinical outcomes (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">James and Prichard, 2014</xref>). Combinatorial drugs often provide better efficacy with reduced individual drug doses compared to treatment with a single drug (<xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Nowak-Sliwinska et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2014</xref>). As mentioned above, two distinct drug combinations identified through the FSC technique (a mixture of ACV with either ribavirin (RIB) or interferons (IFNs)) could both effectively inhibit HSV-1 infection (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ding et al., 2012</xref>). Though both drug combinations were effective in reducing HSV-1 infection, the underlying mechanisms as to why these particular drug combinations were so potent have not been fully explored. In this study, infected cells treated with either the RIB-rich drug combination or the IFN-rich drug combination were compared side-by-side using phosphoflow technology to determine how these drug combinations affect cellular signaling networks. By not focusing on one set pathway of cellular signaling we used an unbiased approach looking across various signaling nodes in cells to better understand the antiviral mechanisms of these two drug combinations and directly identify cellular signaling pathways that are critical in the control of HSV-1 replication. This study demonstrates the power of using this approach to analyze drug combinations and how to translate the findings. Importantly, we also directly translate our findings into the signaling changes involved in the HSV-1 infection to directly target those changes with antiviral therapies.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Cell culture and HSV-1 infections</title><p id="p0055">This <italic>in vitro</italic> investigation was carried out in NIH 3T3 cells, which is a cell line derived from mouse embryo fibroblasts.

We chose these different signaling nodes to highlight key signal transduction cascades that if modulated would lead to direct changes in the state of the cells. This system is robust enough to track the changes in cellular physiology, as indicated by changes in cellular signaling, induced by the different drug combinations to provide definitive insight into how the cell is affected by these drugs individually and in their optimal combinations by looking at the panel of phosphoproteins. Each individual drug from the combinations was administrated alone and in combination in duplicate at time 0. Samples were collected at four time points post simulation (0.5, 4, 8, and 16&#x0202f;h).</p><p id="p0095">Using this approach, we were able to discern the exact changes in treated cells that were signatures of the optimal drug combinations. An overview of the phosphoprotein panel shown in <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> indicates that most proteins phosphorylation states were unaffected in cells treated with drug combinations. However, analysis of these panels of signaling nodes revealed that levels of phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) and phosphorylated S6 (pS6) were noticeably regulated by treatment with different drug combinations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>

Sixteen hours after drug treatment, we found that stimulation with individual revealed that, as expected, Interferons including IFN-&#x003b2; and IFN-&#x003b3; induced upregulation of pSTAT1 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, <bold>left panel, yellow histograms</bold>).

We focused our work on changes in phosphorylation states in a panel of key signaling nodes representative of the major cellular processes that could be altered by the drug treatments being used.</p><p id="p0155">Here we present a study focusing on HSV-1 infection. While HSV-1 infection can be well controlled by currently available antivirals, we must develop alternative therapeutic strategies due to several reasons. These reasons include the appearance of anti-viral resistant strains, the possibility of HSV-1 inducing enhanced disease in immunocompromised individuals, and the lack of an effective HSV-1 vaccine. Here we analyze cellular signaling on a system level to determine how antiviral drug combinations modulate many different pathways and discovered that they have different molecular signatures when assayed by phosphoflow. Our results reveal that HSV-1 infection can be targeted using antivirals that modulate one of two pathways: STAT1 or S6. Combinations containing RIB cause changes in S6 phosphorylation, whereas IFN-containing combinations lead to changes in STAT1 phosphorylation. STAT1 is a well-known cellular inducer of the antiviral state (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Horvath and Darnell, 1996</xref>; <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). This antiviral state efficiently blocks viral growth and thus it makes sense as a marker of antiviral activity.</p><p id="p0160">The impact that modulation of S6 phosphorylation would have on viral replication is not a well-understood idea. While HSV-1 replication either induced or required upregulated levels of S6 phosphorylation, blocking these heightened levels of S6 phosphorylation by RIB was sufficient to block HSV-1 replicaiton. We used these findings to focus on the phosphorylation of S6 as a new target when developing therapeutics against HSV-1 infection. Using this focus, we used a small molecule (SL0101), an inhibitor of an S6 kinase that can reduce S6 phosphorulation and thereby mimic the efficacy of one of the drug combination by lowering S6 phosphorylation. We went on to show that SL0101 could effectively block the replication of HSV-1 in an animal model of vaginal HSV infection.</p><p id="p0165">HSV-1 is one of the most well studied viruses known so it is intriguing that our analysis of cellular signaling modulation in infected cells, using an unbiased approach to discovered that S6 phosphorylation is a new target for antivirals targeting HSV-1. Given the importance of the S6 protein control of ribosomal translation, further studies of how HSV-1 replication benefits from this change in S6 and how common this method of manipulation of cellular translation is among different viruses is needed (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Ruvinsky and Meyuhas, 2006</xref>). Could it be that the efficacy of RIB is conveyed via changes in S6 induced by viruses? If the theme of S6 manipulation by viruses is common in other viral disease, S6 phosphorylation modulators may be a new class of antivirals.</p><p id="p0170">The efficacy of the S6 phosphorylation inhibition in reducing HSV-1 replication in an animal model of vaginal HSV-1 infection shows how important it is to understand the changes in cellular signaling that are effective in blocking viral infection. However, results of this study revealed that even without HSV-1 infection, RIB directly lowers the level of phosphorylated S6. This finding is important because it underscores that regulation of S6 phosphorylation occurs in cells with and without viral infection. Consequently, the consequences of changing the phosphorylation state of a key ribosomal protein by any drug may be immense. We did not see any obvious changes in cellular morphology nor changes in cell viability as assessed by MTT assay when cells were treated with SL0101, suggesting that minimal cellular toxicity was induced by the SL0101. However, further investigations into how SL0101 can impact cellular physiology are warranted in order to develop effective counter measures against side effects that may be induced by this type of antiviral.</p><p id="p0175">RIB has become a go-to drug in antiviral therapy, especially when looking to target the replication of viruses with few options for treatment.

The efficacy of targeting this phosphorylation step shows that using analysis of cellular signaling modulation can determine new, efficacious antivirals and drug targets.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Author contributions</title><p id="p0185">XD, DMJr, CMH, GPN, and DJS wrote the manuscript.
