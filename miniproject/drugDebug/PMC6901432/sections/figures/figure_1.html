 <caption> Cytopathogenic effect (CPE) formation and viral gene expression in the presence of antiviral nucleoside analogues and omeprazole. (A) Effects of omeprazole (80 μg/mL) on the concentrations of antiviral nucleoside analogues that reduce CPE formation by 50% (IC 50) using West Nile virus (WNV)-infected Vero cells, influenza A H1N1-infected MDCK cells, and HSV-1- or HSV-2-infected Vero or HaCaT cells. Omeprazole alone did not reduce CPE formation. Numerical values are presented in Supplementary Table S1. (B) Effects of omeprazole and acyclovir on the expression of virus proteins in HSV-1- and HSV-2-infected Vero cells. HSV-1-infected cells were treated with omeprazole 80 μg/mL and/or acyclovir 0.31 μg/mL. HSV-2-infected cells were treated with omeprazole 40 μg/mL and/or acyclovir 0.6 μg/mL. (C) HSV gB levels in HSV-1-infected Vero cells treated with omeprazole 80 μg/mL and/or acyclovir 0.31 μg/mL as determined by Western blot 24 h post infection. </caption>
