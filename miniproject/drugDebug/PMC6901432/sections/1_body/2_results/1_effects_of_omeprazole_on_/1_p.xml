<p>The effects of omeprazole on the viability of the investigated cell lines was tested in concentrations of up to 160 μg/mL. Omeprazole concentrations of 80 μg/mL and lower did not affect the viability of any of the tested cell lines. Omeprazole 160 μg/mL resulted in a reduction of cell viability, but the concentration that reduces cell viability by 50% (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was not reached (
