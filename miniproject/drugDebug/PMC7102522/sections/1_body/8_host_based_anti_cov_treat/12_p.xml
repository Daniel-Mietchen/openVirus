<p id="par0255">Another class of anti-CoV agents that target S to inhibit CoV entry is the carbohydrate-binding agents. Griffithsin is an anti-viral protein originally isolated from the red alga 
 <italic>Griffithsia</italic> spp. 
 <xref rid="bib0795" ref-type="bibr">[159]</xref>. It binds specifically to oligosaccharides on viral surface glycoproteins such as S and HIV glycoprotein and inhibits a broad range of CoVs, including SARS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63

 <xref rid="bib0795" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0800" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>. The optimal delivery modes and safety profiles of these agents in humans should be further evaluated.
