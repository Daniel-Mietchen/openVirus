<p id="par0245">Recently some small molecules were discovered and characterized as inhibitors of SARS-CoV replication that block viral entry by three different mechanisms 
 <xref rid="bib0780" ref-type="bibr">[156]</xref>. (i) compound 
 <bold>100</bold> (SSAA09E2) acts through a novel mechanism of action, by blocking early interactions of SARS-S with the receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2); (ii) Compound 
 <bold>101</bold> (SSAA09E1) acts later, by blocking cathepsin L, a host protease required for processing of SARS-S during viral entry; and (iii) compound 
 <bold>102</bold> (SSAA09E3) also acts later and does not affect interactions of SARS-S with ACE2 or the enzymatic functions of cathepsin L but prevents fusion of the viral membrane with the host cellular membrane. Naphthalene sulfonamide derivative 
 <bold>103</bold> a selective clathrin inhibitor targeting its amino-terminal domain, and tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (MiTMAB), a dynamin I and II GTPase inhibitor were reported to inhibit the HCoV-NL63 replication by inhibiting the clathrin-mediated entry 
 <xref rid="bib0785" ref-type="bibr">[157]</xref>. Importantly, no cytotoxic effect was observed for the tested inhibitors applied to LLC-Mk2 cells.
