<p id="par0195">Like all RNA viruses, coronaviruses employ host cells membranes to assemble the viral replicase complex. This evolutionary conserved strategy provides a compartment for viral RNA synthesis, a crucial step in the coronavirus life cycle. Antiviral agents that target membrane-bound coronaviral RNA synthesis is important for the replication and therefore, represent a novel and attractive target. Lundin A.
