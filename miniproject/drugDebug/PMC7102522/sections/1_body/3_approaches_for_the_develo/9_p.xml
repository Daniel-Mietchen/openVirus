<p id="par0090">The second approach for anti-CoV drug discovery involves the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> development of novel, specific agents based on the genomic and biophysical understanding of the individual coronavirus. Examples include siRNA molecules or inhibitors that target specific viral enzymes involved in the viral replication cycle, mAbs that target the host receptor, inhibitors of host cellular proteases, inhibitors of virus endocytosis by the host cell, human or humanized mAbs that target the S1 subunit RBD and antiviral peptides that target the S2 subunit.
