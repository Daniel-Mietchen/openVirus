<p id="par0065">Shen et al reported broad-spectrum inhibitors of human coronaviruses, see 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>
 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. They identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) from HTS screening as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> at low-micromolar concentrations. These seven broad-spectrum inhibitors suppressed the replication of all CoVs in a dose-dependent manner and with low EC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Although the cytotoxic concentration for some compound is as high as of their inhibitions, phenazopyridine, pyrvinium pamoate, and monensin sodium displayed less CC
 <sub>50</sub> values. Further, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies showed lycorine protected mice against lethal HCoV-OC43 infection.
