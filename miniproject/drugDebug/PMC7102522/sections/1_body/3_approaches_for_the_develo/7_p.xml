<p id="par0080">In continuation, several classes of compounds that have been used for other indications identified as potent inhibitors of SARS-and MERS-CoVs. These drugs were classified into different therapeutic groups as neurotransmitter inhibitors, estrogen receptor antagonists, kinase signaling inhibitors, protein-processing inhibitors, inhibitors of lipid or sterol metabolism and inhibitors of DNA synthesis or pair (see, for representative examples, 
 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> and the activities in 
 <xref rid="tbl0015" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> ). Antidiarrheal agent loperamide (
 <bold>9</bold>), or anti-HIV-1 agent lopinavir (
 <bold>10</bold>) were able to inhibit both MERS-and SARS-CoVs infection in the low-micromolar range and was linear with the study by de Wilde 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Antiparasitics, mefloquine (
 <bold>20</bold>), and amodiaquine dihydrochloride (
 <bold>21</bold>) or antibacterial, emetine dihydrochloride hydrate (
 <bold>19</bold>) in which that function was not linked to coronaviruses in general, showed antiviral activity against both CoVs. Cathepsins are important for the fusion step during virus entry of coronavirus 
 <xref rid="bib0400" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>. Cathepsin inhibitor, E-64-D (
 <bold>22</bold>), blocked the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at the entry stage. The neurotransmitter inhibitor triflupromazine (
 <bold>33</bold>) inhibited both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. In addition to that, other neurotransmitters fluphenazine (
 <bold>29</bold>) and promethazine (
 <bold>30</bold>) were reported to inhibit MERS-CoVs protein-mediated cell-cell fusion with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of about 20 and 29 μM, respectively 
 <xref rid="bib0405" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref>. Kinase signaling pathway inhibitors imatinib mesylate (
 <bold>35</bold>) and dasatinib (
 <bold>36</bold>) are known inhibitors of the Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog-1 pathway (ABL-1) and were active against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. The data suggest that the ABL-1 pathway may be important for the viral replication and inhibitors of this pathway may have the potential in the discovery of antiviral agents.
