<p id="par0075">Current anti-MERS-CoV agents have been primarily resulted from previous drugs used for the SARS-CoV infection. To identify potential antiviral agents against MERS-CoV, Shin 
 <italic>et al.</italic> screened a library consisting of 2334 approved drugs and pharmaceutically active compounds 
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>. This yielded a series of hit compounds, primarily categorized as anti-protozoal, anti-cancer, anti-psychotics (

 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>), with micromolar inhibitory activity ranging from 2.1 to 14.4 μM (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). Among them, saracatinib (
 <bold>14</bold>) was particularly important as it showed an excellent anti-MERS-CoV activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.9 μM and a CC
 <sub>50</sub>&gt;50 μM. Saracatinib (
 <bold>14</bold>) is an orally available small molecule drug used for the treatment of tumor malignancies through the Src-family of tyrosine kinases (SFKs) inhibition. It also inhibited other coronaviruses SARS-CoV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 2.4 μM) and HCoV-229E (EC
 <sub>50</sub> 5.1 μM), and feline infectious peritonitis (FIPV, EC
 <sub>50</sub> 7.0 μM) within a not-toxic range of concentration. An
