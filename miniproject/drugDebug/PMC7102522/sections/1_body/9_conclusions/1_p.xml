<p id="par0275">Human coronaviruses utilizes host cellular components to achieve various physiological processes, including viral entry, genomic replication, and the assembly and budding of virions, thereby resulting in pathological damage to the host. Therefore, interrupting any stages of the viral life cycle would become a potential therapeutic target for developing antiviral therapies. Although numerous anti-human coronaviral agents have been identified through various approaches, no specific treatment is currently available for HCoVs, to date. One of the main reasons for that is most of the identified agents were not properly evaluated for
