<p id="par0010">Coronaviruses are members of two subfamilies of 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> and 
 <italic>Torovirinae</italic> in the family of 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, which in turn comprise the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic>
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily is further classified into four main genera: α-coronavirus, β-coronavirus, γ-coronavirus and δ-coronavirus based on the International Committee for Taxonomy of Viruses (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL6 belong to α-coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43 are β-coronaviruses, and they both infect only mammals. γ-Coronavirus and δ-coronavirus infect birds, but some of them can also infect mammals 
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Based on current sequence databases, it has been discovered that all human CoVs have animal origins; SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E are considered to have originated in bats; HCoV-OC43 and HKU1N are likely originated from rodents
