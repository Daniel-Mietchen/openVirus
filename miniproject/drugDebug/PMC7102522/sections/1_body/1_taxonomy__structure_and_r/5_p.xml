<p id="par0030">Upon the entry, the viral particle is uncoded and ready for translation ORF 1a and 1b into polyproteins pp1a (4382 amino acids) and pp1ab (7073 amino acids) that are processed by proteases 3-C-like protease (3CLpro) and papain-like protease (PLpro). Subsequently, these polyproteins are cleaved into at least 15 non-structural proteins (nsp), which assembles and form the replication-transcription complex. With the aid of replicases, the full-length positive strand of genomic RNA is transcribed to form a full-length negative-strand template for the synthesis of new genomic RNAs. These mRNAs are then transcribed and translated to produce the structural and accessory proteins. Interrupting any replication processes would become a potential molecular target to develop therapeutics.</p>
