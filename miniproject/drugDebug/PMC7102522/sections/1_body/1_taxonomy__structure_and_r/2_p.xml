<p id="par0015">Under the electron microscope, coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with the largest genome size, ranging approximately from 26-32-kilobases found to date 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. The genomic RNA, which acts as a messenger RNA (mRNA), plays an important role in the initial RNA synthesis of the infectious cycle, template for replication and transcription and as a substrate for packaging into the progeny virus. In all CoVs, 5â€™ two-thirds of the genome encodes a replicase polyproteins, pp1ab, which comprises of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b. These ORFs are then processed by viral proteases to cleave into 16 non-structural proteins that are involved in genome transcription and replication. The 3' terminus encodes CoV canonical set of four structural proteins; including (i) the nucleocapsid (N) protein, a basic RNA-binding protein, (ii) a spike protein (S), a type of glycoprotein I, (ii) a membrane protein (M) that spans the membrane, and (iii) an envelope protein (E), a highly hydrophobic protein that covers the entire structure of the coronavirus
