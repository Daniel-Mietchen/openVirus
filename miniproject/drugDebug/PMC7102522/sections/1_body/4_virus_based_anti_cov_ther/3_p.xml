<p id="par0105">Proteases are indispensable for the viral life cycle and they play an essential role in viral replication by mediating the maturation of viral replicases. Therefore, targeting proteases has become an attractive approach for developing potential antiviral drugs. Protease inhibitors block the replication of coronaviruses (CoVs), including the causative agents of MERS and SARS infection. The papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and a 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> also known as the main protease) are important two proteases that mediate the process replicase polyproteins pp1a and pp1b. PL
 <sup>pro</sup> is a cysteine protease that uses the thiol group of cysteine as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl group of the scissile peptide bond for cleavage at first three positions of its polyprotein to produce three nonstructural proteins, while 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> cleaves the remaining 11 locations, releasing non-structural proteins from nsp4 to nsp16. As a result, sequence motifs recognized by MERS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> and SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> are (L/I)XGG↓(A/D)X and LXGG↓(A/K)X, respectively (
