 <italic>et al.</italic> reported a novel library of fused 1,2,3-triazole derivatives against coronavirus 229E in HEL cells 
 <xref rid="bib0425" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Structure-activity relationship studies showed that some compounds displayed moderate inhibitory activities in micromolar range without alterations of the normal cell morphology in confluent HEL cell cultures at concentrations up to 100 μM. For example, compounds
