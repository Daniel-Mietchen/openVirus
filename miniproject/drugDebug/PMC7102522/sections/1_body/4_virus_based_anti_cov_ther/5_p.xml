 <xref rid="fig0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>), a specific inhibitor of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, for MERS-CoV and HCoV-22E on viral translation using a dual luciferase assay and virus-infected primary cells 
 <xref rid="bib0430" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. Silvestrol was recently shown to have potent antiviral activity in Ebola virus-infected human macrophages. They found that silvestrol is also a potent and non-toxic inhibitor of cap-dependent viral mRNA translation in CoV-infected human embryonic lung fibroblast (MRC-5) cells. It was found to be highly effective against both infections with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.3 nM and 3 nM, respectively. For MERS-CoV, the potent antiviral activities of silvestrol were also confirmed using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a second type of human primary cells. Mechanistically Silvestrol strongly inhibited the expression of CoV structural and nonstructural proteins (N, nsp8) and the formation of viral replication/transcription complexes. They also confirmed that silvestrol found to inhibit human rhinovirus (HRV) A1 and poliovirus 1 (PV), respectively.
