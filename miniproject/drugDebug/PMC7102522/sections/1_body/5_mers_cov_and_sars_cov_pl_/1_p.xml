<p id="par0125">In anti-viral therapy, P
 <sup>Lpro</sup> is an important target as it is a multifunctional protein involved in proteolytic, deubiquitination, de-ISGylation (ISG = interferon-stimulated gene), and viral evasion of the innate immune response in addition to its proteolytic activity 
 <xref rid="bib0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>. Several X-ray crystallography studies have facilitated the characterization of these PL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzymes and the identification of PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors 
 <xref rid="bib0450" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Numerous SARS-CoV PL
 <sup>pro</sup> inhibitors belonging to different classeshave been identified, including small-molecule inhibitors, thiopurine compounds, natural products, zinc ion, and zinc conjugate inhibitors and naphthalene inhibitors 
 <xref rid="bib0455" ref-type="bibr">[91]</xref>. 6-Mercaptopurine (

 <bold>44)</bold> and 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (
 <bold>45</bold>) as well as the immunosuppressive drug, mycophenolic acid (
 <bold>46</bold>), were all independently able to inhibit the proteolytic activity and deubiquitination of MERS-CoV PLpro (

 <xref rid="bib0460" ref-type="bibr">[92]</xref>. Compared with 
 <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide (
 <bold>45</bold>), 6-mercaptopurine (
 <bold>43</bold>), 6-thioguanine (
 <bold>44)</bold> were more effective inhibitors, while mycophenolic acid (
 <bold>46</bold>) was a less effective inhibitor against the MERS-CoV PL
