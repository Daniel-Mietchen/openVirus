 <bold>48</bold>, F2124–0890, 
 <xref rid="fig0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) was identified as a selective dual inhibitor of both PL
 <sup>pro</sup> enzymes of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV through a high-throughput screening of molecule library containing 25,000 chemical entities 
 <xref rid="bib0480" ref-type="bibr">[96]</xref>. As a mode of action, this compound acts as a competitive inhibitor against MERS-CoV with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 6.0 μM, while acts as an allosteric inhibitor against SARS-CoV (IC
 <sub>50</sub> 11 μM). Compound 
 <bold>48</bold> was first synthesized in 1958 as a potential anticancer agent, and in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the compound was used as a reactant for designing arrhythmia and antiviral drugs as well as compounds set to regulate plant growth
