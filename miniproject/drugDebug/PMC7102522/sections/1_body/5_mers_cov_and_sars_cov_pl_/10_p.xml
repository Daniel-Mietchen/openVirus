<p id="par0170">The co-crystal structures of SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> with decahydroisoquinoline inhibitors (
 <bold>76-80</bold>) revealed that P2-decahydroisoquinoline scaffold was inserted into a large S2 pocket and the P1-imidazole was occupied into the S1 pocket as expected. The study was extended to find out the novel inhibitors that interact at S3 to S4 site 
 <xref rid="bib0595" ref-type="bibr">[119]</xref>. For this reason, a non-prime site substituent and warheads combined with the decahydroisonoline was designed and evaluated against SARS-CoV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The resulting analogs have Ac-Thr-Gly-OH (compound 
 <bold>81,</bold>
 <xref rid="fig0055" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>), instead of an original Ac-Thr-Val sequence in 
 <bold>75</bold>, since an isopropyl side chain of the Val in 
 <bold>75</bold> is directed to an outward of SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> and no interactions with SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> at the Val site is detected. Indeed the compound showed about 2.4 times potent inhibitory activities for SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> when combined with a non-prime site substituent. This finding indicated not only the expected additional interactions with the SARS 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> but also the possibility of new inhibitors containing a fused-ring system as a hydrophobic scaffold and a new warhead such as thioacetal.
