<p id="p0020">In this issue of the 
 <italic>Journal of Integrative Medicine</italic>, Zhang et al. 
 <xref rid="b0040" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> provided 
 <italic>in silico</italic> methods to narrow down TCM remedies that may directly inhibit the coronaviral reproduction. Two principals for selection were proposed: oral effectiveness to inhibit viral infection and compatibility of patient manifestation. The identified TCM remedies should contain anti-novel coronavirus chemicals that meet the requirement for orally administered medical drugs. Meanwhile, the identified TCM remedies should be of the types of TCM remedy that have activity against virus-caused pneumonia. To this end, the authors conducted a series of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analyses. A number of natural compounds were selected, which were experimentally validated for their potential activity against SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. These chemicals were then evaluated for their suitability for oral administration. Most importantly, the molecular structures of these natural compounds were evaluated for their ability to interact, or dock, with the main proteins of the novel coronavirus. Positive docking suggested their ability to inhibit the novel coronavirus infection. In order to comply with patient manifestation, the authors conducted another three rounds of screening. First, TCM herbs that contained at least two of the above natural compounds were selected from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSPT) database 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. These medicinal plants were classified by the types of diseases they are used to treat. Only those belonging to the types that have been classically used to treat viral pneumonia were selected for further studies. Next, comprehensive evaluation of the effectiveness of these TCM herbs was performed. The authors downloaded its documented chemical constituents of each herb and analyzed their cellular protein targets for network pharmacological analysis. All these processes found that at least 26 TCM herbs have potential 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> anti-novel coronavirus effects and can simultaneously regulate host inflammation responses.
