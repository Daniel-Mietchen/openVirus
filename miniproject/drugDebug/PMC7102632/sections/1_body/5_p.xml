 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and broader knowledge of CoV entry frame important questions. Which animal CoVs have the greatest potential for human infection? For SARS-related CoVs, addressing this question amounts to identifying those animal CoVs that bind human ACE2 receptors. Structural bioinformatics approaches are helpful here, because even before the Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic> report [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], insights made 
 <italic>in silico</italic> accurately predicted that SARS-CoV-2 spikes bind human ACE2 [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Surveillance methods using cell culture models will further address this question, when testing human cell infection with SARS-related animal CoVs and paying close attention to those viruses isolated from wildlife in close proximity with humans. Which CoVs transmit human disease? Recent structural and biochemical analyses of SARS-CoV-2 S proteins [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] begin to address this question. The receptor-binding domains on the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins bind with high affinity to human ACE2 [
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], which may explain the facile transmissibility of this virus. However, additional host interactions may also correlate with transmission and disease, and Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic> noted unique features on a separate (N-terminal) domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S proteins that may confer binding to alternative host-cell receptors [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Alternative host cell interactions by these N-terminal domains warrant consideration, as it is known that analogous domains on several human CoVs have important auxiliary cell-binding functions [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 S proteins have also acquired several basic residues (RRAR/S), forming a furin protease cleavage site. Temporal progression of proteolytic scissions prime and then activate SARS-CoV S proteins to catalyze virus–cell membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Thus, the SARS-CoV-2 furin substrate site is likely to facilitate the priming cleavage step, which sensitizes S proteins to the subsequent activating cleavages occurring on susceptible target cells, and facilitates virus entry and infection, as depicted in 
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>. Consequently, the hypothesis that heightened protease sensitivities account, in part, for SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and disease certainly merits further exploration.
