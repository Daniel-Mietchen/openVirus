<p id="p0035">Quarantine measures are in place to limit the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic, but the risk of a global pandemic is real. The development of effective vaccines and antiviral drugs is a priority to reduce the burden of this virus. An immediate challenge is to construct SARS-CoV-2 S-based vaccines that display conserved epitopes and elicit broadly neutralizing antibodies as well as virus-specific T cell responses. Similar daunting tasks lie ahead in identifying safe and effective drugs that suppress SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication and in making recommendations for their clinical use. If given too late, they may not modify the disease course, even if virus loads are diminished. Committed research communities can and will build from the foundational knowledge that is now in place and respond appropriately to these challenges.</p>
