<p id="p0055">Angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) is the receptor for SARS CoV-2 as well as other coronaviruses and is expressed in type 2 alveolar epithelial cells and endothelium. The S-glycoprotein on the surface of coronavirus binds to ACE2. This leads to a conformational change in the S-glycoprotein and allows proteolytic digestion by host cell proteases (TMPRSS2) ultimately leading to internalization of the virion [
