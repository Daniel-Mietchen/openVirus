<p id="Par9">Currently, statistics related to the number of malaria deaths are lower than in previous decades, with a decrease of approximately 52% in the last 15 years (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>). However, malaria is still present in 108 countries, and in 2015, it was estimated that 212 million people were affected by the disease, with most of the cases concentrated in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and Amazon due to their tropical or subtropical climates that favor the survival and reproduction of 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. Also, countries with the highest number of malaria cases are in regions with poor sanitary conditions that also favor the reproduction and development of the malaria vector.
