<p id="Par3">The great navigations and the consequent territorial conquests were the perfect opportunity for malaria to spread to other regions of the planet, being considered one of the most devastating diseases of North American colonies between the XVI and the XVIII centuries (Duffy

 <italic>mal aire</italic>”—and that expression gave rise to the current name of the disease, malaria. In South America, this disease arrived through the ships that brought the slaves to work mainly in Brazil (Yalcindag et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2005</xref>). In 1820, Pierre Pelletier and Joseph Caventau isolated quinine from 
 <italic>Cinchona</italic> sp., proved its antimalarial effect, and in the next year, quinine and quinine sulfate were commercially available as the first antimalarial drugs (Cunico et al.

It was in 1880 that the French physician Charles Alphonse Laveran observed the malaria-causing protozoa in red blood cells of one of his patients. Between 1897 and 1899, Italian researchers Amico Bignami, Giuseppe Bastianelli, Battista Grassi, and the English physician Ronald Ross identified the female of the 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito as the transmitter of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> protozoan to the mammals and defined its life cycle, for which he was awarded Nobel Prizes in 1902 and 1907 (Keeble
