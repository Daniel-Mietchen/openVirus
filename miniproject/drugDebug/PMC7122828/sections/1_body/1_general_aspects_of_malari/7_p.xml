<p id="Par22">Despite a variety of drugs used in the treatment of malaria, 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species have become resistant to many compounds. Sibley and Ringwald (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2007</xref>) reported that the emergence of resistance to antimalarial drugs is directly related to an enormous amount of pathogenic populations and the short time of reproduction of the parasite. In addition, the indiscriminate and extensive use of antimalarial drugs also contributes to the process of resistance.
