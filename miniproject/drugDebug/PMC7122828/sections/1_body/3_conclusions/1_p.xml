<p id="Par55">The emergence of drug-resistant strains of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. led to an urgent need to develop more effective drugs, and metal-based drugs have been considered a promising strategy against new antiplasmodial agents. In this context, metalloantimalarials based on antimalarial drugs, metal chelators, and organometallic complexes were evaluated. Among all these compounds, ferroquine is the most successful representative, already being tested in phase II clinical trials. Studies on the physiology of the parasite allowed the understanding of the mechanisms of action of new drugs and stimulated the design of new more efficient drugs. With these studies, in the near future, it is expected that metallodrugs with low toxicity and high efficiency will be found for the treatment of neglected tropical diseases such as malaria. In addition, the production costs and the final product are extremely important factors, since this guarantees the accessibility of the population of poor countries affected by these diseases.
