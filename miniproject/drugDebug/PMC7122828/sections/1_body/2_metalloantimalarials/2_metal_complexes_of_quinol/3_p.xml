<p id="Par28">Historically, ruthenium CQ complexes were the first class of compounds investigated for this purpose. According to the literature, the binuclear complex of Ru(II) chloroquine [RuCQCl

 <sub>2</sub> (
 <bold>complex 1</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>) was five times more potent than standard chloroquine against 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> and 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic> strains. The mechanism of action of 
 <bold>complex 1</bold> was described as the posthydrolytic binding to hematin in solution inhibiting its aggregation to β-hematin. Results show that the presence of the metal resulted in significantly enhanced activity against CQ-resistant strains (Sanchez-Delgado et al.
