<p id="Par33">The literature also reported the antimalarial activities of iron, cobalt, and nickel complexes containing chloroquine (CQ) and Mefloquine (Mef) as ligands. The complexes of general formula [M(II)L
 <sub>1</sub>L
 <sub>2</sub>Cl
 <sub>2</sub>] and [M(III)(Mef)(CQ)Cl
 <sub>3</sub>)], where L
 <sub>1</sub> = Mefloquine, L
 <sub>2</sub> = chloroquine, M = Co
 <sup>2+</sup>, Ni
 <sup>2+</sup>, and Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>, were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated. The in vivo tests revealed that the mixed metal complexes of Mefloquine and chloroquine [Co(Mef)(CQ)Cl
 <sub>2</sub>] and [Fe(Mef)(CQ)Cl
 <sub>3</sub>)] exhibited higher antimalarial potential. Furthermore, toxicity studies showed that these complexes demonstrated less toxicity than the Ni(II) analogue (Adediji et al.

 <sup>2+</sup>(Amodiaquine)(Cl)
 <sub>2</sub>] and [Mn
 <sup>+</sup>(primaquine)
 <sub>2</sub>(X)

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1987</xref>). The antimalarial activity of platinum (II) complexes containing 4-aminoquinoline analogues was also considered (Souza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2011</xref>). All these results indicated that metal complexation to traditional antimalarial quinolones represents an attractive alternative to the development of new antimalarials agents.
