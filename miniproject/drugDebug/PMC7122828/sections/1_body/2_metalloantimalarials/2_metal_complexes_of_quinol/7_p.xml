<p id="Par32">In vitro tests showed that the gold complex [Au(PPh
 <sub>3</sub>)(CQ)]PF
 <sub>6</sub> (
 <bold>complex 5</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>) caused inhibition of two resistant strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 5 and 23 nM, and against a 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> strain. Studies on the elucidation of the possible mechanism of action of this complex include two targets, i.e., the inhibition of hemozoin (malarial pigment) and DNA interaction. Experiments with mice showed that treatment 1 mg/kg of AuCQ, and parallely with equivalent concentrations of CQDP, induced a reduction in parasite cells of 84 and 44%, respectively, when compared to the untreated control. These results suggest that the complexation of gold to CQ increased the in vivo susceptibility of 
 <italic>P. berghei</italic> to CQ (Navarro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1997</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2011</xref>) and lead to the search for novel gold–CQ complexes, which were synthesized, characterized, and evaluated against CQ-sentitive and CQ-resistant strains of 
 <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. In this perspective, changes in the molecular structure of the [Au(PPh
 <sub>3</sub>)(CQ)]PF
 <sub>6</sub> complex were performed, such as variation in the counter anion (
 <bold>complex 6</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>), in the phosphine ligand (
 <bold>complex 7</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>), and in gold oxidation state (Au (I) and Au (III)) (Navarro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1997</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2004</xref>).
