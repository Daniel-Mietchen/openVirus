<p id="Par36">Recently, Tapanelli et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2017</xref>) showed that Cu(I), Au(I), and Ag(I) phosphene complexes exhibited notable activity against the 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic> early sporogonic stages. The results showed that the metal complexes of general formula [M(L)
 <sub>4</sub>]PF
 <sub>6</sub> (M = Cu(I), Ag(I) and [Au(L)
 <sub>4</sub>]Cl with L = Thp (tris(hydroxymethyl) phosphene) or PTA (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) interfere with the early sporogonic stage of 
 <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> inhibiting the parasite establishment in the vector mosquito.
