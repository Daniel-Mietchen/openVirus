<p id="Par37"> All microorganisms need iron for their growth and replication (Crumbliss 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1990</xref>). Several metabolic processes of the erythrocytic malaria parasite are dependent on iron, such as heme synthesis, DNA synthesis, proteolysis of hemoglobin, glycolysis pentose phosphate shunt, mitochondrial electron transport, and CO
 <sub>2</sub> fixation. It is therefore an indication that capturing iron from the parasite may interfere negatively on its metabolism (Sharma
