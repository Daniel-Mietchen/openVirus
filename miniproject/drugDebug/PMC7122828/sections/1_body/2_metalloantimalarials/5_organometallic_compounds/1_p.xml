<p id="Par44">In organometallic compounds, a metal–carbon bond (σ or π) provides special features to classic compounds. Many of these complexes have electronic structures based in 18 valence electrons (Miessler and Tarr 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2004</xref>) and, due to their use in catalysis and other applications, are considerate potential therapy agents (Chavain and Biot
