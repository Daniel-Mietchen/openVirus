<p id="Par53">The binding of active pharmacophores through covalent linkages is an interesting strategy used for the design of new antimalarial agents, such as ferrocene dual conjugates. The advantage of this strategy is the fact that it causes an increase in the conjugated molecule bioavailability, which diminishes its resistance. Some ferrocene dual conjugates demonstrated good antiplasmodial activities (Meunier
