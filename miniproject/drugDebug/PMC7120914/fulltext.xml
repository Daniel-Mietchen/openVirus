Based on the number of isoprene units they have, they are classified as mono, di, tri, tetra, and sesquiterpenes. They are mostly found in plants and form the major constituent of essential oils from plants. Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea<italic>,</italic> thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use&#x02014;chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties. Curcumin has also become a recent trend in healthy foods and open doors for several medical researches. This chapter summarizes the various terpenes, their sources, medicinal properties, mechanism of action, and the recent studies that are underway for designing terpenes as a lead molecule in the modern medicine.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Terpenes</kwd><kwd>Essential oils</kwd><kwd>Antiplasmodial</kwd><kwd>Curcumin</kwd><kwd>Anti-cancer</kwd><kwd>Anti-diabetic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><sec id="Sec2"><title>What Are Terpenes?</title><p id="Par2">Terpenes, also known as isoprenoids are the largest and most diverse group of naturally occurring compounds that are mostly found in plants but larger classes of terpenes such as sterols and squalene can be found in animals.

An isoprene unit is a building block of terpenes that is a gaseous hydrocarbon that contains the molecular formula C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>8</sub> (see footnote 1). Terpenes and terpenoids are terms that are often used interchangeably but the two terms have slight differences; terpenes are an arrangement of isoprene units that are naturally occurring, volatile, unsaturated 5-carbon cyclic compounds that give off a scent or a taste to defend itself from organisms that feed off of certain types of plants (see footnote 1). Terpenes have many functions in plants such as a thermoprotectant, signaling functions, and not limited to, pigments, flavoring, and solvents but also have various medicinal uses (Yang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2012</xref>).

Terpene protects many living organisms like microorganisms, animals and plants from abiotic and biotic stresses (Gershenzon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). Terpene can ward off pathogens, predators, and competitors. Living organisms use terpene for multiple reasons like medicinal purposes and communications about food, mates, or enemies (Gershenzon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>). It is impressive how different organisms use terpene for common purposes even though terpene contain many forms and varieties (Gershenzon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par5">So far only a small percentage of terpene is investigated (Franklin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>).

This plant contains many medicinal properties like anticancer, antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antihyperglycemic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antiparasitic (Franklin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>). Terpene is also used to enhance skin penetration, prevent inflammatory diseases (Franklin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2001</xref>).

Tea tree oil has increased in popularity in recent years when it comes to alternative medicine (Perry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2000</xref>). Tea tree oil is a volatile essential oil and is famous for its antimicrobial properties, and acts as the active ingredient that is used to treat cutaneous infections (Carson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2006</xref>) Apart from the flavor that gives to food, essential oil contain antimicrobial properties (Bound et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). Thyme is one of plants that synthesize terpene alcohols and phenols which contain powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties (Bound et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2015</xref>). Terpene synthesized from cannabis also long served as medicines (Perry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2000</xref>).

Abscisic acid is not unique to plants, it has shown to be present in the central nervous system of other organisms such as pigs and may play a role in humans as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and stimulator of insulin release in the human pancreas (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Gossypol is a sesquiterpene that is found in cotton plants. It has anticancer properties and can potentially inhibit fertility in male humans which is why it must be removed from essential oils and various other products before human use or consumption. Avarol, a sesquiterpenoid that has shown to have antimicrobial and antifungal uses, is effective against the AIDS virus in humans (see footnote 3).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref></p><p id="Par23">The medicinal properties of sesquiterpenes typically come from flowering plants that are included in the Asteraceae family, which include, but not limited to sunflowers, marigolds, and daisies. This family of flowers is a significant resource for potent sesquiterpene lactones, which are usually found in the leaves and the flower portion of plants and are constantly being produced at high levels (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). The role of sesquiterpenes in these flowering plants are not solely made for human use but for the purpose of protecting the plant from predators and are produced de novo in response to microbial attack and ultraviolet ray protection (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Their bitter taste is a defense mechanism against herbivores from feeding on them but some have sweet tastes or tastes that are pleasant to certain organism for the purpose of spreading their seeds and being fertilized in different areas (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Sesquiterpenes have many uses in traditional, western medicine because they contain so many anticancer, antiplasmodial, and anti-inflammatory activities (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Sesquiterpenes lactones are able to reduce stomach ulcers in some people and are also present in powerful antimalarial drugs (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Artemisinin, a metabolite produced from <italic>Artemisia annua</italic>, which contains sesquiterpene lactone produced in the roots and shoots of the plants, is used in drugs to treat malaria (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). Other uses of this family of flowers is for treatment of bacterial infections, migraines, and to improve skin (Chadwick et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>).

Tanshinones have recently been extensively researched for their anticancer properties in vitro and in vivo (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Their potential use as an anticancer drug comes from their broad range of activities such as anti-proliferation and inhibiting adhesion, migration, and invasion (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). Analogues of tanshinone have been synthesized in many clinical trials because they have many anticancer attributes (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2015</xref>). This herb has been used in many Asian countries for preventative and therapeutic solutions to many diseases such as heart disease, vascular diseases, and arthritis (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>).

Triterpenes are produced by animals, plants, and fungi. They play a role as precursors to steroids in animal and plant organisms, and are derived from mevalonic acid (see footnote 1). Saponins come from the skins of many plants and have emulsion like properties that make them excellent detergents in the human digestive system (see footnote 1). Chemical structures of steroid saponins are similar to hormones that are produced in the human body (see footnote 1).</p><p id="Par29">The medicinal uses of triterpenes are not quite as recognized as other different types of terpenes but their uses are being continuously investigated by researchers. Their properties have been studied for anticancer, antioxidant, antiviral, and anti-atherosclerotic activities (Nazaruk and Borzym-Kluczyk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>). Some studies have shown that there is promising potential for the use of triterpenes for people with diabetes by aiming to reduce glucose levels and also by reducing sweetness inhibitors in sweet and high calorie foods (Nazaruk and Borzym-Kluczyk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015</xref>).

They are found in all different types of fungi, bacteria, and plants and mainly responsible for red, yellow, or orange fat-soluble plant and animal pigments (see footnote 6). One of the most crucial and common tetraterpene is beta-carotene that contributes to the yellow pigment in carrots.

When the temperature of the atmosphere continues to rise, the photophosphorylation system is not able to keep up with protons leaking, which causes the transmembrane gradient to drop and a reduction in ATP synthesis occurs (Singsaas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2001</xref>).

This pathway occurs in the chloroplasts and produce monoterpenes, specific sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and carotenoids (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2012</xref>). The vital application of this pathway is to develop antimicrobial agents to target diseases such as malaria and sexually transmitted diseases (Hunter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). Since this pathway does not occur in humans, it is a valuable resource to develop antibacterial and antiparasitic drugs (Seemann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2009</xref>).</p><p id="Par34">The first steps of this pathway involve pyruvate and <sc>d</sc>-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to produce DOXP which is catalyzed by 1-deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXS) (Hunter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). 1-Deoxy-<sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, otherwise known as IspC, coverts DOXP to MEP.

There are at least 80 compounds that come from the cannabis plant that are regarded as cannabinoids that cause psychotropic effects in the human brain due to CB<sub>1</sub> receptors (Klein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>). The main active ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, otherwise known as THC, is a psychoactive agent and is a focus for controversy in society because it binds to the human endocannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, which are responsible for memory, cognition and attention.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> How THC works is by taking the place of endocannabinoids, naturally occurring chemicals in the human body (see footnote 7). One of the most common and well known molecules that THC replaces in the human body is called anadamide (see footnote 7). To this day, scientists are researching to discover the exact role of this molecule in the human body.</p><p id="Par38">Cannabidiol, or CBD is also a common ingredient in cannabis but compared to THC, it is a non-psychoactive and it can potentially reduce the effects of THC (Klein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>). CBD does not bind to the same receptors as THC does in the human body and it works by inhibiting FAAH or the enzyme fatty acid amide hydroxyls (see footnote 7). This enzyme is responsible for degrading anadamide in the body and by inhibiting FAAH, CBD increases natural endocannabinoids already in the human system (Klein et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>).

With the rising malarial infections and drug resistance, terpenes have gained more attention towards it through antiplasmodial activity (Nogueira and Lopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2011</xref>). The interesting mechanism behind the terpene activity is that it binds to the hemin part of infected erythrocytes and kills the parasite just like the famous antimalarial drug chloroquine (Orjih et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">1981</xref>; Kayembe et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). Hemin is made of iron which is necessary for the plasmodium development in the erythrocytes. Though hemin breaking enzymes are not yet found in plasmodium, it could be one reason why hemin binding accounts for parasite lysis (Ginsburg and Demel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>). Another study suggests that drug-hemin complex binds to phospholipid layers thereby disrupting the respective membrane structure and causing cell lysis (Ginsburg and Demel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>). Moreover, it is also known that hemin can affect the carbohydrate metabolism of the parasites, which could lead to lysis of parasites (Rodriguez and Jungery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">1986</xref>). Thus, terpenes can be designed to be promising drugs for malaria.</p><p id="Par42">Different kinds of terpenes show different effects on the parasites. For instance, beta-myrcene the most common terpenes, is proven to have in vitro antiplasmodial activity (Kpoviessi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). Beta-myrcene from <italic>,</italic> the plant which is high in terpenes, does not show an anti plasmodial effect but extracts from stem, leaves, and seeds of clove basil showed a good antiplasmodial activity (Small <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2017</xref>; Kpoviessi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). Additionally, it was also reported to have antitrypanosomal activity when tested against (Habila et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). This data leads to the fact that terpenes are effective against pathogenic Protista.</p><p id="Par43">Limonene regarded as the second most commonly found terpene, also possesses antiplasmodial activity against . Limonene achieves its goal by targeting the intermediates of the active isoprenoid pathway of the parasite. Isoprenoid pathway plays a major role in parasite survival by mediating cell signaling, protein translation and several other biological processes (Jord&#x000e3;o et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2011</xref>). Specifically, the isoprenic products that are inhibited from being synthesized are dolichol and ubiquinone (Goulart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). The isoprenoid pathway of parasites is distinct from that found in mammals, which makes limonene a reliable constituent of antimalarial drug (Goulart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). Thus, the host cell pathway will not be affected by the administration of the drug.</p><p id="Par44">Pinene, commonly found monoterpene in pine trees is composed of two classes&#x02014;alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. Both the classes of pinene were reported to be effective against the W2 strain of , which is resistant to chloroquine (Boyom et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>). Of particular interest is the increase in antiplasmodial activity of pinene in cumin seed oil with increase in the distillation time. The study concluded that the optimal distillation time for increased antimalarial activity is 0&#x02013;5 and 5&#x02013;7.5 min (Zheljazkov et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2015</xref>). Further investigation is needed to ascertain if distillation time is just increasing the yield of pinenes in the oil or improving the bioactivity of pinenes.</p><p id="Par45">The next most abundant terpene, caryophyllene has the ability to both prevent and cure malaria. Caryophyllene is an active component of insect repellents especially for mosquitoes and other blood-feeding Diptera (Maia and Sarah <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2011</xref>). Recent studies ensured that silver nanoparticles synthesized from caryophyllene are highly effective against (Kamaraj et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>). Thus, terpenes could be a safer and a cost effective alternative for malarial treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Antiviral Activity</title><p id="Par46">The emerging viral diseases have necessitated the research for new effective antiviral agents such as terpenes . As a result, scientists evaluated various terpenes for their properties, among which monoterpenes showed a good result. Monoterpenes are terpene classes that possess two isoprene units. They form a major constituent of essential oils in plants which indicates monoterpenes play a major role in defense for plants (Grabmann <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). A 2005 study evaluated the in vitro antiviral activity of several essential oils extracted from South American plants (Duschatzky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). The oil extracts were tested against three major human viruses&#x02014;herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1), dengue virus type 2, and Junin virus. The oils that were proved to be virucidal were mainly composed of monoterpenes, namely, carvone, carveol limonene, alpha- and beta-pinene, caryophylene, camphor, beta-ocimene, and one sesquiterpene which is germacrene (Duschatzky et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). A similar study in 2008 analyzed the essential oils of seven plants from Lebanon for in vitro antiviral activity (Loizzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>). The viruses under investigation were HSV1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS CoV). The results were positive for antiviral effects, and the major constituents were alpha- and beta-pinene, beta-ocimene, and 1,8-cineole (Loizzo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>). Following this, a 2009 study on also had similar results which suggested 1,8-cineole, &#x003b1;-pinene, caryophyllene oxide, and sabinene to be the major components of virucidal oils (Alim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). Functional data from these studies reveal that a few monoterpenes are shared by various plants for antiviral properties (Alim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2009</xref>). These shared monoterpenes could be of importance as they are present universally.</p><p id="Par47">Of particular interest is the single main monoterpene that is contributing to the virucidal activity. This was studied by Astani et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>) using eucalyptus, tea tree, and thyme essential oil extracts (Astani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). They suggested that monoterpene hydrocarbons have a slightly higher virulent activity compared to the monoterpene alcohols against HSV-1. The monoterpenes with the highest virucidal activity were identified to be alpha-pinene and alpha-terpineol (Astani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). The mechanism behind the virucidal activity was suggested to be direct inactivation of free viral particles. However, the study concluded that more than isolated single monoterpenes, a mixture of monoterpenes are more effective and possessed lesser toxicity to host cells (Astani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>). This was further bolstered by another study which evidenced the virucidal property of a combination of monoterpenes obtained from (Zamora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>). The activity was tested against a human flavivirus West Nile virus. The results were positive both in vivo and in vitro. The underlying mechanism was predicted to be induced cell cycle arrest at G0 or G1 phase. This indicates that a mixture of monoterpenes could act as a better antiviral agent rather than a single monoterpene (Zamora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>). Recent studies have shown that triketone-terpene adducts also exert antiviral, antimicrobial and antitumor activity (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>). These adducts are obtained from Myrtaceae as secondary metabolites in the form of sesquiterpenes called myrtucomvalones A, B, and C. The terpene adducts successfully inhibited the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Chen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2017</xref>).</p><p id="Par48">The bioactive terpenes present in various plants have shown various results for antiviral property. It would therefore be important to look for various plant source rather than various monoterpenes for therapeutic purposes. Researchers are also focusing on synthesizing terpene hybrid from fungal sources as they are presumed to have antiviral and UV protective properties (Yuan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2017</xref>).

Terpenes are widely acclaimed for their anticancer activity too. An early 1997 study concluded that a combination of monoterpenes, diterpenes and sesquiterpenes can be effectively used to treat cancers that occur in colon, brain, prostate gland, and bones.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> It also claimed that administration of terpenes in humans inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells and sensitized the tumor in such a way it becomes susceptible to radiotherapy (see footnote 9). The major advantage of this treatment was that, the drug can be administered through several routes among which oral and topical were most preferred (see footnote 9).</p><p id="Par51">Among the different kinds of terpenes, limonene is well recognized as an anticancer agent. Limonene is a bioactive food component found in citrus peels, orange peels, and several other citrus fruits (Jirtle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>). Studies have reported limonene to exhibit strong cancer inhibition activity both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism behind limonene activity is still under investigation. A study by Jirtle et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>) reported that limonene acts through induction of transforming growth factor B-1 and mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptors (Jirtle et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1993</xref>). In contrast a study by Bishayee and Rabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>) suggested that limonene eliminates cancer cells by induction of apoptosis (Bishayee and Rabi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2009</xref>). Structural studies on limonene reported that they are lipophilic and have the tendency to be deposited in fatty tissues when administered orally. This indicates that limonene can act as an excellent chemopreventive drug for cancer as it can be deposited in the body (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2010</xref>). Another study in 2013 concluded that limonene acts by suppressing the expression of breast tumor cyclin D1 (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2013</xref>). This lead to cell cycle arrest and mitigated proliferation of cancer cells in women with early stages of breast cancer (Miller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2013</xref>). Recent study showed that limonene from pinecones can kill lung cancer cells in vitro by apoptotic mechanism that is activated through caspase-3 pathway (Lee et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2017</xref>). These findings indicate a novel application of limonene towards fighting and preventing cancer. Not just limonene, but also its metabolite perillyl alcohol is also said to exhibit antitumor activity in pancreatic cell lines through apoptotic mechanisms (Sobral et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2014</xref>; Dalessio et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par52">Apart from limonene, the terpene thymoquinone has all been widely studied for its chemoprotective and chemotherapeutic activity. Thymoquinone is found to be an active constituent of the volatile oils of an annual herbaceous plant called (black cumin) (Majdalawieh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). The pathways affected by thymoquinone to exert its antitumor properties are p53, PPAR&#x003b3;, MAPK, NF-&#x003ba;B, PI3K/AKT, and STAT3 signaling pathways (Majdalawieh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2017</xref>). Thymoquinone has been proved to be anticancerous against several cancers such as breast cancer, skin cancer, non&#x02013;small cell lung cancer, bile duct cancer, and brain cancer. The basic mechanisms underlying the cancer inhibition is apoptosis and cell cycle arrest (Sobral et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2014</xref>; Khader and Eckl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2014</xref>).

It is affecting both children and adults in both developing and developed nations (You and Henneberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2016</xref>; Narayan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2000</xref>). The social and economic burden of diabetes continues to grow and it is expected to rise rapidly in developing countries (Sarwar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2010</xref>). In USA, diabetes is one of the leading causes for visual impairment, limb amputation, renal diseases, heart diseases and death (Saddinne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1999</xref>). Diabetes can be of two types&#x02014;type 1 (where the immune system of the body acts against the insulin-producing organs) and type 2 (where the insulin produced cannot be used by the body or insulin is produced in low amounts).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref> Although there are several medications available, their use is limited due to their adverse effects. Some of the commonly found side-effects include low blood sugar, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, bloating, and weight gain.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref> This led to the research for natural products to be used as effective antidiabetic medication. Phytochemicals from the medicinal plants have been recommended for treating type 2 diabetes, of which terpene forms a major constituent (Jung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par57">Medicinal plants of Oriental Morocco were studied for their antidiabetic property in rats. The report showed that terpenes, terpene diols, and terpene diol glucosides form major components of the extracts of plants under study (Bnouham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2010</xref>). A similar study on medicinal plant and their natural products that were reported from 2001&#x02013;2005 was conducted by Jung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>. This study was focused on non&#x02013;insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 2), and it proved that terpenes along with few other secondary metabolites such as alkaloids and flavonoids exhibit antidiabetic potential (Jung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2006</xref>).</p><p id="Par58">The most promising terpene compound for treating diabetes is called andrographolide which is a diterpenoid lactone (Brahmachari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). This compound forms the major component of the leaves of the small herbaceous plant <italic>. A. paniculata</italic> is an Asian plant that has already been reported to be used in traditional medicines for its therapeutic nature (Brahmachari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). The terpenoid acts by reducing the plasma glucose and increasing the utilization of glucose by the body in diabetes mellitus rats (Gupta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2008</xref>). The actual mechanism by how it does this is it activates the alpha-adrenoreceptors to increase the release of an opioid peptide beta-endomorphin (Brahmachari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>) which is reported to be secreted in low amounts in diabetic rats (Forman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1985</xref>). This increased secretion in turn activates the opioid &#x003bc;-receptors. These receptors can effectively curb the hepatic gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis from non-carbohydrate precursors) and elevate the utilization of glucose by muscles. Finally, this results in a reduced plasma glucose concentration (Brahmachari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Andrographolide is also observed to prevent the secondary complications of diabetes such as diabetic retinopathy, a condition that will lead to blindness (Brahmachari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). It significantly weakens the retinal angiogenesis and inflammation during the development of the disease (Brahmachari <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2017</xref>). Moreover, it can also fix the impaired or extended estrous cycle in diabetic rats (Reyes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2006</xref>). Andrographolide was orally administered in all the above studies. This indicates its efficiency for being used as a lead molecule in the future drugs designed for treating diabetes mellitus.</p><p id="Par59">Another widely known terpene is curcumin obtained from which commonly called turmeric (Nabavi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>). It exhibits high antidiabetic property and acts by quashing the oxidative stress and inflammation. By regulating the polyol pathway, it can also reduce the plasma glucose and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (Nabavi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>). Moreover, curcumin is also reported to activate the enzymes present in the liver that are essential for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipid metabolism (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). Alike andrographolide, curcumin is also reported to reduce the complications of diabetes (Nabavi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>), for example, liver disorder which is a common manifestation of diabetes type 2 (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). Curcumin treats these disorders by reducing the liver weight and lipid peroxidation products. Further, it is also reported to normalize the levels of fetuin-A in serum that contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver in diabetic rats (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). Other complications that can be attenuated by curcumin include diabetes associated&#x02014;retinopathy, microangiopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). These findings confirm that curcumin is likely to be used in the future for diabetes treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Antidepressant</title><p id="Par60"> Depression has become a serious health concern by contributing to the emerging mental and emotional disorders throughout the world. It is hitting both the developed and developing countries. Depression can pave way to various health issues from alcoholism to heart diseases (Holden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2000</xref>). It is also said to increase the rate of mortality significantly in breast cancer patients (Hjerl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2003</xref>). Moreover, depression immobilizes its victims thereby leading to economic loss (Holden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2000</xref>). By analyzing the social and economic burdens caused by depression, researchers have stepped out towards finding novel stress-relieving drugs. Synthetic drugs have serious side-effects and unintended interactions with the body that negatively affects the treatment outcome (Jawaid et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2011</xref>). Hence this necessitated the need for natural drugs. Terpenes serves as one of the most relevant bioactive compound for treating depression and therefore can open doors for designing natural or synthetic antidepressant drugs (Bahramsoltani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2015</xref>).</p><p id="Par61">Twenty-five percentage of antidepressant drugs prescribed by doctors are obtained from herbs through various extracts (Saki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2014</xref>). To estimate the important compounds contributing to the antidepressant effect, Saki et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2014</xref>) performed an electronic database based study. The results revealed that terpenes formed a major part of the extracts of medicinal plants that exerted antidepressant effects (Saki et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2014</xref>). Thus, scientists focused on identifying the active principles of plant extracts contributing to the antistress effects. Different plant had different acting compounds.</p><p id="Par62">Among the several terpenes, linalool and beta-pinene are commonly found to be active principles (both Guzm&#x000e1;n-Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>; Guzm&#x000e1;n-Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). They were discovered from the extracts of medicinal plants and and flowers of lavender (Appleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>; Guzm&#x000e1;n-Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Guadarrama-Cruz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2008</xref>). These monoterpenes act by interacting with the 5HT1A receptors of the serotonergic pathway. Serotonins are important in the fact that their release and re-uptake levels can be altered to overcome stress (Chaouloff <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2000</xref>; Guzm&#x000e1;n-Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). They also interact with adrenergic receptors of the body that play a major role in stress-induced behavioral changes (Pandey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1995</xref>; Guzm&#x000e1;n-Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). Another interesting finding is the interaction of beta-pinene with dopaminergic receptors namely D1 receptors. This is the mechanism followed by most of the antidepressant drugs available in the market (Guzm&#x000e1;n-Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2015</xref>). A more interesting study would be to examine the beta-pinene and linalool efficiency through inhalation tests. This is because these monoterpenes are aromatic compounds that generally have an enhanced activity when inhaled as they can directly hit the central nervous system (Guzm&#x000e1;n Guti&#x000e9;rrez et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par63">Apart from monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes also exhibit antidepressant effects. One striking example is beta-caryophyllene which was proved to ameliorate the depressive symptoms in mice (Bahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). The underlying mechanism of this compound is binding to a receptor called CB2 and activating it. CB2 is found in the brain and immune cells and plays a major role in regulating depressive-related disorders (Bahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>). Thus beta-caryophyllene curbs depression by acting as a CB2 receptor agonist (Bahi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2014</xref>).</p><p id="Par64">Other terpenes that have effective antidepressant properties include hyperforin which is present in the extracts of (Subhan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2010</xref>)<italic>.</italic> It has been shown that the extracts of <italic>H. perforatum</italic> differ in their antidepressant potential with the difference in concentration of hyperforin present in the extract (Laakmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1999</xref>). Similar to many other antidepressants hyperforin acts by inhibiting the neuronal uptake of mood regulators such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. In addition, it also has its own unique mechanism of controlling depression by inhibiting the neurotransmitters GABA and <sc>l</sc>-glutamate uptake (M&#x000fc;ller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2001</xref>).</p><p id="Par65">Another fascinating antidepressant plant is <italic>,</italic> which is a short perennial herb. This plant not only reduces the stress and anxiety levels but also improves the symptoms of depression in humans (Bhattacharyya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). The major components of Valeriana extracts are terpenoids called maaliol, patchouli alcohol, and 8-acetoxypatchouli alcohol (Subhan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2010</xref>). The terpenoid-less extract of Valeriana was found to be devoid of antidepressant activity which indicates that terpenes are the active components involved in reducing the depression (Subhan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Uses in Folk Medicine</title><p id="Par66"> Folk medicine has always been an eye-opener for designing novel drugs for diseases. To be more specific, almost three-fourths of the plant-based drugs were created based on the knowledge of folk medicine (Table <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">15.4</xref>) (Efferth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Realizing this fact, western worlds are now turning back into old medicines and bioactive plant components to treat modern diseases (Efferth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). This has boosted the export rates of Chinese medicinal products (based on traditional Chinese medicine) from China to other developed nations. Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are being extensively studied for their secondary metabolites and their therapeutic properties (Efferth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>). One of the active principles of TCM products is terpenes (Liu and Jiang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2012</xref>). Due to their large availability and diversity, terpenes contribute the most to industrial and medicinal applications among all the secondary metabolites of plants (Zwenger and Basu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2008</xref>).<table-wrap id="Tab4"><label>Table 15.4</label><caption><p>Uses of different terpenes in folk medicine</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>No.</th><th>Scientific name</th><th>Common name</th><th>Abundant terpene</th><th>Uses in ayurveda</th><th>Uses in TCM</th><th>References</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1.</td><td><italic>Citrus limon</italic></td><td>Lemon</td><td>Limonene </td><td>Oral cavities, digestive problems, abdominal colic pain, and cough</td><td>Digestive problems and cleansing the body</td><td><sup>a,b</sup></td></tr><tr><td><bold>2.</bold></td><td><italic>Citrus reticulata</italic></td><td>Orange</td><td>Limonene</td><td>Digestive disorders, abdominal colic pain, and worm infestation</td><td>Stomach ache and cough</td><td><sup>c,d</sup></td></tr><tr><td><bold>3.</bold></td><td><italic>Juniperus communis</italic></td><td>Juniper</td><td>Limonene</td><td>Antiseptic, treat cellulite, pain and swelling</td><td>Treat cold and urinary problems</td><td><sup>e,f</sup></td></tr><tr><td><bold>4.</bold></td><td><italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic></td><td>Indian gooseberry</td><td>Phyllaembicilins</td><td><p>Boost immunity</p><p>Strengthen hair follicles</p><p>Cure acne and pimples</p><p>Improve circulatory system</p><p>Cure diarrhea</p></td><td>Treat diarrhea, jaundice and inflammation</td><td><p>Zhang et al.

The mechanism of anticancer activity is described as disruption of microtubules in the mitotic spindle, which will lead to incomplete chromosome separation thereby causing cell death (see footnote 13). In TCM and Ayurveda (herbal medicinal science mainly developed in India), healers used the twigs and barks of the tree to make a special kind of tea that can be given to patients suffering from cancer. However due to the slow growing nature of yew tree, paclitaxel nowadays is produced by coalescing the products of endophytic fungus that grows under the tree and the bark of the tree<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref><sup>,</sup><xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref> (Heinig et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par73">One more common terpene present in the drugs used in TCM is pinene (Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2008</xref>).

Studies are now trying to create curcumin analogues to improve the effects and activity of natural curcumin (Kocaadam and &#x0015e;anlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2017</xref>). Another popular example is clove which was used by both Ayurveda and TCM as a painkiller in dental cases. It was applied topically on cavities to relieve toothache and abdomen to treat digestive problems (Alqareer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). The essential oil of clove is mostly composed of eugenol, a bioactive terpene that is responsible for clove&#x02019;s aroma (Alqareer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). Eugenol by itself is said to enhance the blood circulation in the body and improve metabolism (see footnote 22). Thus, based on the above data we can conclude that various terpenes have been in use even before their discoveries by modern science, due to their amazing medicinal properties. A schematic summary of different terpenes and their medicinal uses, that we discussed, is provided below in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">15.1</xref>.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 15.1</label><caption><p>A brief representation of terpenes and their medicinal uses.
