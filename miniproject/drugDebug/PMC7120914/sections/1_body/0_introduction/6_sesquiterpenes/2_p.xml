 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>). It also plays a role in plants in response to various environmental stresses. It regulates the closure of the stoma by regulating ion channels and exchange of water across the plasma membrane (Giraudat

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>). Abscisic acid is not unique to plants, it has shown to be present in the central nervous system of other organisms such as pigs and may play a role in humans as a pro-inflammatory cytokine and stimulator of insulin release in the human pancreas (Chadwick et al.

It has anticancer properties and can potentially inhibit fertility in male humans which is why it must be removed from essential oils and various other products before human use or consumption. Avarol, a sesquiterpenoid that has shown to have antimicrobial and antifungal uses, is effective against the AIDS virus in humans (see footnote 3).
