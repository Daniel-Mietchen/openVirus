<p id="Par19"> Sesquiterpenes , containing the chemical formula C
 <sub>15</sub>H
 <sub>24</sub>, are much larger compounds than monoterpenes and are much more stable in comparison.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> They are isolated by distillation with steam or by extraction and purified by methods such as vacuum fractional distillation or gas chromatography (see footnote 1). Oxidation or rearrangement of isoprene units that are made to sesquiterpenes produce the corresponding sesquiterpenoids (see footnote 1). Sesquiterpenes are naturally occurring and found in plants , fungi, and insects and act as a defensive mechanism or attract mates with pheromones in insects (see footnote 1). Acyclic compounds of sesquiterpenes such as farnesans can be used as a natural pesticide for insects and also as pheromones for some insects and mammals such as elephants, to attract mates or to mark their territory (see footnote 1).
