<p id="Par23">The medicinal properties of sesquiterpenes typically come from flowering plants that are included in the Asteraceae family, which include, but not limited to sunflowers, marigolds, and daisies. This family of flowers is a significant resource for potent sesquiterpene lactones, which are usually found in the leaves and the flower portion of plants and are constantly being produced at high levels (Chadwick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2013</xref>). The role of sesquiterpenes in these flowering plants are not solely made for human use but for the purpose of protecting the plant from predators and are produced de novo in response to microbial attack and ultraviolet ray protection (Chadwick et al.

Their bitter taste is a defense mechanism against herbivores from feeding on them but some have sweet tastes or tastes that are pleasant to certain organism for the purpose of spreading their seeds and being fertilized in different areas (Chadwick et al.
