<p id="Par34">The first steps of this pathway involve pyruvate and 
 <sc>d</sc>-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to produce DOXP which is catalyzed by 1-deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXS) (Hunter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). 1-Deoxy-
 <sc>d</sc>-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase, otherwise known as IspC, coverts DOXP to MEP. From MEP, it reacts with CTP to create 4-diphosphocytidyl-2
 <italic>C</italic>-methyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-erythritol (Hunter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). A phosphate is released in this reaction and then reacts with ATP-dependent IspE to make 4-diphosphocytidyl-2
 <italic>C</italic>-methyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-erythritol 2-phosphate and ADP and then reacts with the enzyme IspF to create 2
 <italic>C</italic>-methyl-
 <sc>d</sc>-erythritol 2,4-cyclodophosphate (Hunter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). The enzyme requires metal cations. Then finally, in the least understood step of the reaction, the two enzymes, IspG and IspH make the two products, IPP and DMAPP by using a two-electron reduction (Hunter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>). The pathway is regulated by control of repression or activation of gene expression via feedback loops within the pathway or by effector molecules which target an enzyme or downstream activities (Hunter
