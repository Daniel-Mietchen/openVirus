<p id="Par13">Five different kinds of terpene can be isolated from , they are, the diterpenes, 14,15-dinor-13-oxo-8(17)-labden-19-oic acid and a mixture of labda-8(17),13E-dien-19-carboxy-15-yl oleate, palmitate and triterpene (Popova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2009</xref>). Spectroscopic analysis and chemical evidence has been used to establish the structures of the different compounds (Popova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2009</xref>). These compounds that were isolated from terpene was tested for its antimicrobial activity against bacteria like gram positive and gram negative (Popova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2009</xref>). It was all tested for human pathogenic fungi which has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity (Popova et al.
