<p id="Par36">The use of cannabis is increasing for medicinal uses that commonly treat pain, the side effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients such as nausea, anxiety and depression, and its uses and benefits are continuously being researched by scientists (Cathcart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>). There are at least 80 compounds that come from the cannabis plant that are regarded as cannabinoids that cause psychotropic effects in the human brain due to CB
 <sub>1</sub> receptors (Klein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>). The main active ingredient, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, otherwise known as THC, is a psychoactive agent and is a focus for controversy in society because it binds to the human endocannabinoid receptors in areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, which are responsible for memory, cognition and attention.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref> How THC works is by taking the place of endocannabinoids, naturally occurring chemicals in the human body (see footnote 7). One of the most common and well known molecules that THC replaces in the human body is called anadamide (see footnote 7). To this day, scientists are researching to discover the exact role of this molecule in the human body.
