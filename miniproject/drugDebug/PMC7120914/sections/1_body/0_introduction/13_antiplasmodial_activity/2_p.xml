 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2017</xref>; Kpoviessi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). Additionally, it was also reported to have antitrypanosomal activity when tested against (Habila et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). This data leads to the fact that terpenes are effective against pathogenic Protista.
