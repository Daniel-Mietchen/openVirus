<p id="Par43">Limonene regarded as the second most commonly found terpene, also possesses antiplasmodial activity against . Limonene achieves its goal by targeting the intermediates of the active isoprenoid pathway of the parasite. Isoprenoid pathway plays a major role in parasite survival by mediating cell signaling, protein translation and several other biological processes (Jord√£o et al.
