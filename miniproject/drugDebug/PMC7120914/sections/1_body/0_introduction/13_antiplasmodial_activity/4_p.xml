<p id="Par44">Pinene, commonly found monoterpene in pine trees is composed of two classes—alpha-pinene and beta-pinene. Both the classes of pinene were reported to be effective against the W2 strain of , which is resistant to chloroquine (Boyom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2010</xref>). Of particular interest is the increase in antiplasmodial activity of pinene in cumin seed oil with increase in the distillation time. The study concluded that the optimal distillation time for increased antimalarial activity is 0–5 and 5–7.5 min (Zheljazkov et al.
