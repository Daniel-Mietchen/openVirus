<p id="Par73">One more common terpene present in the drugs used in TCM is pinene (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2008</xref>). Pinene exhibits therapeutic properties such as anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, anticancer, and antibiotic properties.

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn18">18</xref> The source for pinene is Eucalyptus and other related coniferous trees (see footnote 17, Sartorelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2007</xref>) In olden days, the juice from the bark of eucalyptus was collected and mixed in water, milk or wine to be used as a drug (see footnote 17). Currently, they are extracted in the form of oil and sold in the form of syrups and lozenges.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref> As eucalyptus oil contains several monoterpenes, a study analyzed the different constituents of eucalyptus oil for its effectiveness against bacteria. Here it was concluded that alpha-pinene is the best monoterpene with the highest inhibitory activity (Sartorelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2007</xref>). Recently scientists are studying another primary terpene in eucalyptus called cineole. Cineole is reported to improve the memory power, cognitive performance and attenuate the symptoms of Alzheimerâ€™s disease in humans (see footnote 19; Moss and Oliver 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2012</xref>). In addition, studies also showed that cineole is capable of improving the health of bronchitis patients by reducing their cough (Fischer and Dethlefsen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2013</xref>). This is in agreement with the fact that eucalyptus oil was used as an expectorant in Ayurvedic medicine.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn20">20</xref> It is also known that local Brazilians used the Eucalyptus leaves to treat several human diseases such as cancer (Mathias et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2012</xref>). Further reports also suggest that eucalyptus oil has been involved in ancient Indian Ayurvedic and Greco-European medicine systems (see footnote 19).
