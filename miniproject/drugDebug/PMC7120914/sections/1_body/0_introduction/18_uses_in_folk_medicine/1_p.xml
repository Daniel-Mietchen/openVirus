<p id="Par66"> Folk medicine has always been an eye-opener for designing novel drugs for diseases. To be more specific, almost three-fourths of the plant-based drugs were created based on the knowledge of folk medicine (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">15.4</xref>) (Efferth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Realizing this fact, western worlds are now turning back into old medicines and bioactive plant components to treat modern diseases (Efferth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). This has boosted the export rates of Chinese medicinal products (based on traditional Chinese medicine) from China to other developed nations. Plants used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are being extensively studied for their secondary metabolites and their therapeutic properties (Efferth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2007</xref>). One of the active principles of TCM products is terpenes (Liu and Jiang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2012</xref>). Due to their large availability and diversity, terpenes contribute the most to industrial and medicinal applications among all the secondary metabolites of plants (Zwenger and Basu
