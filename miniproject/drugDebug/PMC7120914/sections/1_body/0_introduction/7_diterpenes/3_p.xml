<p id="Par26"> Cafestol and kahweol are diterpene alcohols that are found in the oil derived from coffee beans. These chemical structures are very similar but only differ by an extra double bond that is present in kahweolâ€™s chemical structure.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> Researchers have reported that coffee lowers the risk of depression in women, prostate cancer in men, stroke, diabetes, and some cancers (see footnote 5). It is thought that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of these particular diterpenes are responsible for such events (see footnote 5). Coffee benefits the liver as well by lowering liver enzymes that are in response to inflammation and damage and may offer some protection against liver cancer as well (see footnote 5). The adverse result of these diterpenes is that they raise cholesterol level, but it seems to be limited to coffee that has been unfiltered and has oily droplets of cafestol and kahweol (see footnote 5). Filtered coffee may not have much impact on cholesterol levels (see footnote 5).
