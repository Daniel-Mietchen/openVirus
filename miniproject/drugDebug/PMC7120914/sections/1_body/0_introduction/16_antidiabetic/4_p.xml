<p id="Par59">Another widely known terpene is curcumin obtained from which commonly called turmeric (Nabavi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>). It exhibits high antidiabetic property and acts by quashing the oxidative stress and inflammation. By regulating the polyol pathway, it can also reduce the plasma glucose and levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (Nabavi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>). Moreover, curcumin is also reported to activate the enzymes present in the liver that are essential for glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and lipid metabolism (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). Alike andrographolide, curcumin is also reported to reduce the complications of diabetes (Nabavi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2015</xref>), for example, liver disorder which is a common manifestation of diabetes type 2 (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). Curcumin treats these disorders by reducing the liver weight and lipid peroxidation products. Further, it is also reported to normalize the levels of fetuin-A in serum that contributes to insulin resistance and fatty liver in diabetic rats (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). Other complications that can be attenuated by curcumin include diabetes associatedâ€”retinopathy, microangiopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2013</xref>). These findings confirm that curcumin is likely to be used in the future for diabetes treatment.
