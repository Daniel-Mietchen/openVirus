<p id="Par16">What is thought to be one of the main purposes of monoterpenes is to attract pollinators or to serve the purpose of repelling other organisms from feeding off of plants. They also may be related to the flowering process of the plants (Loreto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2002</xref>). They are isolated from their plant sources by distillation with steam and have a boiling points in the range of 150 
 <bold>°</bold>C to 185 
 <bold>°</bold>C (see footnote 1). Monoterpenes are purified using fractional distillation at pressures that are reduced or use another process in order to form a crystalline derivative (see footnote 1).
