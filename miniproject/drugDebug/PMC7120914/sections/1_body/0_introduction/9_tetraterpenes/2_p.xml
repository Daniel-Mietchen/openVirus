<p id="Par32">Higher order terpenes have been shown to increase thermotolerance (Singsaas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2001</xref>). The permeability of the thylakoid membranes increase at higher temperatures and this happens by an increase in cyclic photophosphorylation around photosystem II (Singsaas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2001</xref>). When the temperature of the atmosphere continues to rise, the photophosphorylation system is not able to keep up with protons leaking, which causes the transmembrane gradient to drop and a reduction in ATP synthesis occurs (Singsaas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2001</xref>). All these events can potentially cause lowering in the Rubisco activation state due to an inhibition of RuBP regeneration (Singsaas
