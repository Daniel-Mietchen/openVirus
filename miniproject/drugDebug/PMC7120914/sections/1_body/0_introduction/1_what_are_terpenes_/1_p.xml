<p id="Par2">Terpenes, also known as isoprenoids are the largest and most diverse group of naturally occurring compounds that are mostly found in plants but larger classes of terpenes such as sterols and squalene can be found in animals. They are responsible for the fragrance, taste, and pigment of plants.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> Terpenes are classified on the basis of organization and number of isoprene units it contains (see footnote 1). An isoprene unit is a building block of terpenes that is a gaseous hydrocarbon that contains the molecular formula C
 <sub>5</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub> (see footnote 1). Terpenes and terpenoids are terms that are often used interchangeably but the two terms have slight differences; terpenes are an arrangement of isoprene units that are naturally occurring, volatile, unsaturated 5-carbon cyclic compounds that give off a scent or a taste to defend itself from organisms that feed off of certain types of plants (see footnote 1). Terpenes have many functions in plants such as a thermoprotectant, signaling functions, and not limited to, pigments, flavoring, and solvents but also have various medicinal uses (Yang et al.
