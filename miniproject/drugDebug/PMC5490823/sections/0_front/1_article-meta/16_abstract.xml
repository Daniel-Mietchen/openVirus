 <p>Adenovirus infections of immunocompromised patients can cause a severe multi-organ disease that often results in the patientsâ€™ death. Presently, there are no drugs specifically approved to treat adenovirus infections, and clinicians resort to the off-label use of antivirals that are approved to treat other DNA virus infections, most frequently cidofovir (CDV). CDV, however, has considerable nephrotoxicity, thus it is recommended only for the most severe cases of adenovirus infections. To facilitate the development of effective, non-toxic antivirals against adenovirus, we have developed a permissive animal model based on the Syrian hamster that can be used to test the efficacy of antiviral compounds. Here, we show that in the hamster model, HAdV-C6 is a more useful challenge virus than the previously described HAdV-C5, because it is filtered out by tissue macrophages to a lesser extent. HAdV-C6 has a 10-fold lower LD50 in hamsters than HAdV-C5 and the pathology is caused by virus replication to a larger extent. We show that valganciclovir (VGCV), a drug that was shown to be active against intravenous HAdV-C5 infection previously, is efficacious against HAdV-C6 when administered either prophylactically or therapeutically. Further, we show for the first time that VGCV, and to a lesser extent CDV, can be used to treat respiratory adenovirus infections in the hamster model. These results extend the utility of the hamster model, and demonstrate the efficacy of two drugs available for clinicians to treat adenovirus infections.</p>
