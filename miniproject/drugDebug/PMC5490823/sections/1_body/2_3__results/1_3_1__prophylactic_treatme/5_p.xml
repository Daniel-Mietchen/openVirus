<p>To quantify the effect of VGCV on liver damage with Ad6-infected hamsters, serum was collected at necropsy and analyzed for transaminase levels. The serum alanine transaminase (ALT) levels were very high for all the Ad5- and Ad6-infected vehicle-treated hamsters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00147-f001">Figure 1</xref>C) with the Ad6-infected animals exhibiting on average three times higher ALT levels than the Ad5-challenged ones. Notably, VGCV completely prevented liver pathology for the Ad6-infected animals; the serum ALT levels were normal for the Ad6-infected VGCV-treated hamsters (
