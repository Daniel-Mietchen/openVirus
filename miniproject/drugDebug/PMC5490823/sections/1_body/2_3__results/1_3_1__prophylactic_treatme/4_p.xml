<p>At necropsy at 5 days post challenge, three of the four Ad6-infected vehicle-treated hamsters and two of the four Ad5-infected vehicle-treated hamsters exhibited liver pathology. One Ad6-challenged animal had red, mottled lungs. No significant findings were noted for the Ad-infected VGCV-treated and uninfected animals. The hamsters sacrificed moribund showed severe liver lesions (yellow, mottled, friable liver; enlarged gall bladder). In addition to the liver lesions, about one-third of the Ad6-infected animals presented with pathology in their lungs (enlarged, firm lungs with dark red to black discoloration) and their kidneys (grossly enlarged, pale kidneys). No such pathology was noted for the Ad5-infected hamsters. At 14 days post challenge, no significant findings were noted for any of the surviving animals. Microscopically, the livers of the Ad-infected vehicle-treated hamsters sacrificed moribund exhibited moderate hepatocellular necrosis and a severe decrease in hepatocellular vacuolization. No such changes were noted for the Ad-infected VGCV-treated animals; for these hamsters, minimal acute inflammation was the only significant histopathological finding. </p>
