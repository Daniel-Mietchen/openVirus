 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00147-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). No body weight loss was seen in the drug-only control group. At the 3 days post challenge sacrifice time point, all five of the sacrificed animals in the Ad6-Vehicle group presented with lung pathology (red mottled discoloration), while only three of the five Ad6-infected VGCV-treated hamsters displayed such pathology. No significant lesions were noted in other organs. At 10 days post challenge, red mottled lungs were observed in six out of 10 Ad6-Vehicle hamsters and three out of 10 Ad6-VGCV-treated hamsters.
