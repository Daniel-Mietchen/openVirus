<p>Thus far, the available countermeasures are inadequate; currently, there is no specific FDA-approved drug available to treat Ad infections. Cidofovir (CDV), a drug approved to treat cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, is often used to treat serious cases of Ad infection. Animal experiments and case reports suggest that CDV is reasonably effective against the virus; however, CDV is kidney toxic, and thus its use is limited to the most serious cases [
