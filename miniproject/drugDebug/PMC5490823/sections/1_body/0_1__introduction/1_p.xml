<p>Adenoviruses (Ads) are viruses with a non-enveloped icosahedral capsid and a double-stranded DNA genome. Human Ads are classified into species A to G that consist of over 70 types (e.g., human species C type 5 adenovirus [HAdV-C5; referred to as Ad5 in this paper]) (for a review on Ad biology, see [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Ads are widespread and generally cause mild infections in immunocompetent adults that resolve without serious consequences (for a review of Ad epidemiology and pathology, see [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). The symptoms of Ad infection depend on the type that caused the infection; e.g., types belonging to species B, C, and E usually cause respiratory disease, species F Ads cause enteric infection, and some of the species D viruses are implicated in ocular illnesses. Infection with Ads usually happens in early childhood (ca. 60% of patients with Ad infection are 5 years old or younger [
