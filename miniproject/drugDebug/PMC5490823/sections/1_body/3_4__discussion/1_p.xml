<p>Previously, we demonstrated that VGCV was efficacious against i.v. challenge with Ad5 in the immunosuppressed hamster model. In this present work, we used Ad6 as the challenge virus. Ad6 is sequestered less in tissue macrophages than the closely related Ad5, and with i.v. challenge of hamsters; this decreased uptake by macrophages resulted in increased pathogenicity of Ad6 compared to Ad5 [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of Ad6 is ca. 10-fold lower than that of Ad5, i.e., a 10-fold lower challenge dose is required to elicit the same pathology [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; thus, it was expected to be efficacious against i.v. challenge as well. Indeed, after both prophylactic and therapeutic administration, it inhibited virus replication and prevented mortality and morbidity (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00147-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The differences observed in the pathology caused by the two species C Ads confirmed our previous findings. The kinetics of morbidity is also different; Ad5-infected hamsters lost more weight right after infection than Ad6-infected ones; however, morbidity and mortality was greater for the Ad6-infected animals at later time points (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00147-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). This observation suggests that while some of the pathogenicity by Ad5 might be caused by the input bolus of the virus, for Ad6 (which can be given at a lower dose), most of the pathogenicity is a result of ongoing virus replication. Ad6-infected hamsters developed lesions in the lungs and kidney besides the liver, which is the most prominent site of pathogenicity for Ad5 [
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Remarkably, VGCV treatment of Ad6-infected animals reduced pathology in the liver, lungs and kidney, and reduced the virus burden in these organs to undetectable levels (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-09-00147-f002">Figure 2</xref>). This finding opens the possibility of testing the efficacy of anti-Ad compounds in the lungs and the kidney, two additional organs (besides the liver) that are affected in immunocompromised patients with disseminated Ad infections.
