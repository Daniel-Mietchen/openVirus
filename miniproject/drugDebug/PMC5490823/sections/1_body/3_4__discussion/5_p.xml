<p>These data indicate that while both Ad5 and Ad6 replicate in Syrian hamsters, a 10-fold lower challenge dose of Ad6 than for Ad5 is required to induce the same pathology. This is likely due to the different tropism of Ad5 and Ad6 (lower Ad6 uptake by tissue macrophages). For Ad6, this results in a pathology elicited in large part by virus replication, while the host response to the larger input bolus is a significant part of Ad5 pathology. As most anti-adenoviral compounds are inhibitors of virus replication, we suggest that in the Syrian hamster model, Ad6 challenge is a better way of testing these drugs than Ad5. Further, these data confirm our previous finding that VGCV is very effective against disseminated Ad infection in the Syrian hamster model. Adding to this, we demonstrated that VGCV is efficacious against respiratory Ad infection of hamsters. In these studies, we chose to use VGCV over its parent drug, GCV, because of the less invasive administration route (oral versus intraperitoneal) afforded by the prodrug. We understand that for human patients, GCV is the drug of choice in situations when gastrointestinal co-morbidities preclude oral administration of drugs. We have reported previously that GCV was equally efficacious against HAdV-C5 infection in the hamster model [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-09-00147" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]; thus, we believe that our findings described here have a clinical relevance. These data suggest that GCV or VGCV can be used to treat human patients with severe Ad infections.
