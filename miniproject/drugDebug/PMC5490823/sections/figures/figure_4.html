 <caption> VGCV reverses Ad6-induced morbidity and decreases Ad6 virus burden in the lungs of immunosuppressed female Syrian hamsters. ( A) Body weight changes. Each symbol represents the group mean; the error bars depict the standard error of the mean. Ad6-Vehicle v. Ad6-VGCV p &lt; 0.0001 (two-way ANOVA); ( B) Virus burden in the lungs. Each symbol represents the value from an individual animal; the horizontal bar signifies the mean. Ad6-Vehicle v. Ad6-VGCV p = 0.0159 (for statistical calculation, a value of 1 × 10 3 PFU/g was assigned to the single “not detectable” sample). </caption>
