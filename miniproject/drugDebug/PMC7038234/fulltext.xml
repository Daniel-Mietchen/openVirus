Currently, there are no effective drugs approved for the treatment of JEV infection. Drug-repurposing screening is an alternative approach to discover potential antiviral agents. In this study, high-content screening (HCS) of a natural extracts library was performed, and two hit FDA-approved Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors, ouabain and digoxin, were identified as having robust efficiency against JEV infection with the selectivity indexes over 1,000. The results indicated that ouabain and digoxin blocked the JEV infection at the replication stage by targeting the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Furthermore, it was proven that ouabain significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by JEV in a BALB/c mouse model. This work demonstrated that Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase could serve as the target of treatment of JEV infection, and ouabain has the potential to be developed as an effective anti-JEV drug.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>KEYWORDS</title><kwd>high-content screening (HCS)</kwd><kwd>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV)</kwd><kwd>ouabain</kwd><kwd>digoxin</kwd><kwd>Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="award1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0507204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSF)</institution><institution-id>https://doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31670165</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><counts><count count="1" count-type="supplementary-material"/><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="0"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="35"/><page-count count="11"/><word-count count="5571"/></counts><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>cover-date</meta-name><meta-value>March 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a member of the genus <italic>Flavivirus</italic> in the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, containing a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 11&#x02009;kb in length, which encodes three structural proteins, including the capsid (C), membrane (prM and M), and envelope (E), and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>JEV has been a global health concern since it was first discovered in the late 19th century (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), with an estimated 68,000 clinical cases and 10,000 to 15,000 associated deaths per year (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).

Drug screening and repurposing has become a very useful approach for identifying antiviral drugs, as it explores novel molecular targets to study virus pathogenesis.</p><p>To address the urgent need for anti-JEV therapy, we presented a library of natural extracts to check for the ability to inhibit JEV infection. Our high-content screening assay design could identify compounds that inhibit JEV viral entry, translation, and RNA synthesis. In this study, eight hit compounds with SI indexes greater than 10 were found to exert inhibitory effects on JEV. Among these eight compounds, some were previously reported to possess a wide spectrum of pharmacological effects, including antiviral activity. Moreover, some compounds, such as lycorine, emodin, and procyanidin, have been proven to be effective in inhibiting flavivirus or HCV infections via different mechanisms (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). These results demonstrate that our HCS assay was effective and credible.</p><p>The top two compounds, FDA-approved Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase inhibitors ouabain and digoxin, are cardiac glycosides with similar chemical structures and have been used for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and hypotension for more than 200&#x02009;years. Recently, ouabain and digoxin have been proven to inhibit different kinds of viruses, including enveloped viruses such as coronaviruses, nonenveloped viruses such as reoviruses, DNA viruses such as human cytomegalovirus, positive-sense RNA viruses such as chikungunya virus, and negative-sense RNA viruses such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">&#x02013;</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Notably, we have tried to select drug-resistant variants by serial passaging of JEV using increasing concentrations of digoxin and ouabain, respectively. However, no adaptive mutant was found after 25 passages with either drug. This result suggested that both drugs might exert the antiviral effects by targeting the cellular protein other than the viral protein, making the barrier to resistance more difficult to overcome.</p><p>Cardiac glycoside acts via inhibiting the sodium-potassium ion pump, leading to changes in the intracellular concentration of sodium, potassium, and calcium, which have been shown to play essential roles in many cellular biosynthetic signaling and vesicular sorting pathways (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In this study, ouabain exhibited therapeutic effects on JEV infection in an adult mouse model by decreasing viral loads and alleviating pathological injuries in the brain, which significantly improved the survival rate of JEV-infected mice. We proposed two mechanisms that may contribute to the antiviral effect<italic>s</italic>. First, ouabain may block JEV infection by inducing the cellular stress response. Ouabain treatment in mammalian cells causes the interaction between the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor and Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase to induce calcium oscillations and further activate calcium-dependent transcription factors, such as the NF-&#x003ba;B and activator protein (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Some evidence suggested that cardiac glycosides mediate inflammatory processes via the activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and the Src/mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). These signaling pathways also cause the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. Many of the genes expressed were elicited by activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, including innate immune response, growth, and differentiation, which stimulate an antiviral state that might block JEV infection in the end (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Second, JEV could replicate in the central nervous system (CNS), and infections result in the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) along with an influx of inflammatory cells; the breakdown of BBB caused by JEV infection may have allowed BBB-nonpermissive ouabain to enter the brain, bind the murine ATPase &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 isoforms (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), and inhibit viral replication in neurons.</p><p>Together, these findings provide valuable information that may be used in future clinical trials examining the effects of ouabain on JEV infection. Moreover, our results indicate that ATPase is a promising pharmacological target in JEV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4.1"><title>Ethics statements and mice.</title><p>All animal experimental procedures were carried out according to ethical guidelines and were approved by the Animal Care Committee of the Wuhan Institute of Virology (permit number, WIVA25201705).</p></sec><sec id="s4.2"><title>Cells and viruses.</title><p>BHK-21, Vero, and Huh-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA).
