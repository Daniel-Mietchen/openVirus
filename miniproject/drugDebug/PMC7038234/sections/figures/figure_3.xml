  <p>Validation of the antiviral effects of ouabain and digoxin in different cell lines and virus strains. The antiviral effects of digoxin and ouabain against two JEV strains (AT31 and SA14) in Vero cells. (A and B) Immunofluorescence staining assay (IFA) images showing the viral protein (green) and nuclei (blue) are displayed. (C and E) The Vero cell culture supernatants were subjected to plaque assay. (D and F) The Vero cell lysates were assessed by qRT-PCR. (G to J) The antiviral effects of digoxin and ouabain against two JEV strains in Huh-7 cells and U251 cells, respectively. The cell culture supernatants were collected to perform the plaque assay. Data are represented as the means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. The scale bar indicates 1 mm. ***,
