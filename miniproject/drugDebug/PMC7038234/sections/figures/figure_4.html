 <caption> Time-of-addition experiment and JEV reporter replicon assay of the antiviral activities of ouabain and digoxin. (A) Schematic illustration of the time-of-addition experiment. (B) The inhibitory effects of digoxin and ouabain with the indicated concentration in each group, determined by plaque assay. (C) Huh-7 cells transfected with the JEV replicon were treated with digoxin and ouabain, respectively, and luciferase activities were determined as indicated. Data are represented as the means ± SDs from at least three independent experiments. ***, P &lt; 0.001; **, P &lt; 0.01; *, P &lt; 0.05. </caption>
