 <caption> Ouabain protected mice from JEV infection. BALB/c mice were infected with 1 × 10 6 PFU of JEV together with ouabain or vehicle by intraperitoneal route. (A) Survival of mice in each group was monitored for 21 days after inoculation of JEV by intraperitoneal injection. Data are shown as Kaplan-Meier survival curves ( n = 14 to 15 for each group). (B) The viral loads in mouse brains were measured by plaque assay on days 7, 10, and 21. (C) Ouabain treatment alleviated the histopathological changes in mice caused by JEV infection. Arrows indicate the histopathological changes such as meningitis, perivascular cuffing, and glial nodules. (D) The viral loads in brain, blood, and spleen were measured by qRT-PCR on days 1 and 3, respectively. Dashed lines indicate limit of detection. The scale bar indicates 200 μM. ***, P &lt; 0.001; **, P &lt; 0.01; *, P &lt; 0.05. </caption>
