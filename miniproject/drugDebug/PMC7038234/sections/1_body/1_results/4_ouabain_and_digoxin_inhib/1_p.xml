<p>To determine the cellular process that these drugs target, a time-of-addition experiment was performed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4B</xref>, neither digoxin nor ouabain showed suppression of JEV in virucidal treatments or pretreatments. However, ouabain showed a robust inhibition of JEV during treatment. Most importantly, when added posttreatment, both ouabain and digoxin exerted full inhibitory effects on JEV infection, suggesting that viral replication was the main stage at which these drugs showed inhibitory activity.
