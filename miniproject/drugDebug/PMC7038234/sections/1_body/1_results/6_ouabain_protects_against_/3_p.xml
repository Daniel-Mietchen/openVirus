<p>The viral loads of brain, blood, and spleen were also evaluated at the early stage of infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6D</xref>, on day 1 postinfection, viral titers in the brain were almost undetectable, and ouabain exhibited little effect on viral titers in the brain at the preclinical stage. Accordingly, ouabain had little effect on decreasing viral titers in the blood and spleen at the earlier time points, which was mostly due to that the detectable viral genome copy numbers were too low to be comparable. Notably, titers in the blood decreased sharply from day 1 to day 3 postinfection, which was in line with the characteristic viremia caused by JEV. These results indicate that ouabain could alleviate histopathological changes and reduce viral loads in the brain, thus protecting mice against JEV-induced lethality and confirming the curative effects of ouabain on viral encephalitis.
