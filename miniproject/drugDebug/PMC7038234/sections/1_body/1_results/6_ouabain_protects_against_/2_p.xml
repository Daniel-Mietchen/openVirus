<p>To further relate these protective effects to viral load and histopathological changes in mouse brains, the viral titer was determined and mouse brain sections were collected and assayed at days 7, 10, and 21 postinfection. The results indicated that, during the progression of the disease, ouabain treatment significantly reduced viral load in infected mice compared to untreated infected mice. Notably, no plaques formed in the ouabain-treated group on day 21 postinfection (

Similarly, apparent damage in the brain, including meningitis, perivascular cuffing, and vacuolar degeneration, was observed in the JEV-infected and vehicle-treated group on day 7 postinfection, while ouabain treatment remarkably alleviated these phenomena (
