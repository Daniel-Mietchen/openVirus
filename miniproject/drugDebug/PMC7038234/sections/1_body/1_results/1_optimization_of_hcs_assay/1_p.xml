<p>The HCS assay-optimized conditions contain cell density, infective dose, and assay endpoint. The assay conditions for HCS were optimized as follows: cell density of 10,000 cells per 96-well plate, a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.8, and an endpoint of 24 h postinfection. The signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio, coefficient of variation (CV), and Z factor were 2,177, 8.9%, and 0.72, respectively, which demonstrated that the assay was robust and reproductive for the large-scale screening of novel antiviral compounds against JEV infection.</p>
