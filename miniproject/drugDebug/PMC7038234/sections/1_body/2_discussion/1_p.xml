<p>JEV continues to spread in Asia and other parts of the world, causing severe clinical manifestations such as permanent neurological or psychiatric sequelae. Currently, there is no safe and effective treatment for JEV infection. Recently, Wang et al. performed a library screen of 1,018 FDA-approved compounds and reported that manidipine, a calcium blocker using in the treatment of hypertension, inhibited JEV infection
