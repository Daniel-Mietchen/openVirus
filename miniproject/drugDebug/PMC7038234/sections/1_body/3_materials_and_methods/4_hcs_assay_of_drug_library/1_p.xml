<p>A library of 1,034 compounds from natural extracts was purchased from Weikeqi Biotech (Sichuan, China). Compounds were stored as 10 mM stock solutions in DMSO at –80°C until use. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1A</xref>, Vero cells were dissociated and seeded at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells per well in 96-well plates. After overnight incubation, cell monolayers were treated in duplicate with the compounds at a final concentration of 50 μM for 1 h and infected with the JEV strain AT31 at an MOI of 0.8. After 1 h infection, the supernatant was replaced with a fresh medium, and compounds were added to the same wells. After an additional 23 h of incubation, infection was stopped by rinsing each well once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixing the cells with 4% paraformaldehyde. Cells were permeabilized using PBS with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 15 min and blocked with 5% FBS (Gibco), followed by treatment with the primary antibody anti-JEV prM (full-length prM was expressed in 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> BL21 cells using pET30a expression vectors, and purified protein was injected into rabbits to prepare polyclonal antibodies) overnight at 4°C. After six rinses with PBS, the cells were stained with DyLight 488-labeled antibody to rabbit IgG (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA). Nuclei were counterstained by DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA). Nine fields per well were imaged on an Operetta high-content imaging system (PerkinElmer), and the percentages of infected and DAPI-positive cells were calculated using the associated Harmony 3.5 software.
