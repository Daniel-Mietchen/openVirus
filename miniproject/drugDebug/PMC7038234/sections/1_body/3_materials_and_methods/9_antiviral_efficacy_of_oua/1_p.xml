<p>Adult male BALB/c mice (4 weeks) were randomly divided into three groups: the JEV-infected and vehicle (0.75% DMSO in normal saline)-treated group, the JEV-infected and ouabain-treated group, and the ouabain-treated group. For infection, mice were infected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with a dose of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> PFU JEV (AT31). The infected mice were i.p. administered with ouabain at 3 mg/kg of body weight or a vehicle control every day for 21 consecutive days. Mice were sacrificed at day 1, 3, 7, 10, or 21, depending on the experimental design. Blood, spleen, and brain samples were collected for plaque assay, qRT-PCR, and histopathology investigation (Vectra ss; PerkinElmer).
