<p>The viral burden was determined by plaque assay. The samples were weighed and homogenized in 300 μl of PBS. The homogenates were clarified by centrifugation (2,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> at 4°C) for 15 min and then diluted serially prior to infection of BHK-21 cells. The viral titer was adjusted for sample volume and tissue weight to calculate the titer as PFU/g.
