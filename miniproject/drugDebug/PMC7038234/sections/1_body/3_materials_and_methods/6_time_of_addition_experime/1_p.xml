<p>The time-of-addition experiment was performed as previously described (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4A</xref>). Vero cells were infected with JEV strain AT31 for 1 h (0 to 1 h). Ouabain (10 μM) and digoxin (10 μM) were incubated with the cells for 1 h or 23 h according to the following: preinfection (−1 to 0 h), during infection (0 to 1 h), and postinfection (1 to 24 h). To exclude a possible direct inactivating effect of the drugs, viruses were incubated with each drug (1 μM) at 37°C for 1 h, and the mixtures were diluted 100-fold before infection of Vero cells. Virus titers were determined by plaque assay 24 h later.
