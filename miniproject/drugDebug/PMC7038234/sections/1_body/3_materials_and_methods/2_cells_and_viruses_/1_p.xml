<p>BHK-21, Vero, and Huh-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) supplement with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA). U251 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium (MEM) (HyClone) supplement with 10% FBS. JEV AT31 and SA14 strains were generated by using the infectious clones of pMWJEAT-AT31 (kindly provided by T. Wakita, Tokyo Metropolitan Institute for Neuroscience) and pACYC-JEV-SA14 (GenBank accession no.
