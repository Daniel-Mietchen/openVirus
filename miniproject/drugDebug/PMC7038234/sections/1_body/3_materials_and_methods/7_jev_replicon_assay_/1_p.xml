 <italic>Rluc</italic>) gene was employed to quantitatively evaluate the inhibitory effects (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> transcripts were synthesized from linearized JEV replicon using a T7 mMessage mMachine kit (Albion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Huh-7 cells were electroporated with 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcripts in 800 μl of Gene Pulser Electroporation buffer (Bio-Rad) for electroporation cuvettes with a 4-mm electrode gap and a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) unit at settings of 250 V and 950 μF, pulsing 1 time. After electroporation, the cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, and compounds were added to the medium when specified. At the indicated times postelectroporation, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using the Rluc assay system (Promega, Madison, WI).
