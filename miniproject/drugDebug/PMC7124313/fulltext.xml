</p><p id="para0004">This rapidly growing pandemic has also affected many healthcare workers. A recent report from China classified an overall 14.8% of confirmed cases among health workers as severe or critical and 5 deaths were observed.<xref rid="bib0002" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para0005">Presently, the clinical spectrum of the disease is being defined including the potential for asymptomatic spread.<xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref> So far, no specific treatment and prevention strategies like targeted antiviral drugs and vaccines are available for COVID-19. Thus, we can only depend on the traditional public health outbreak response practices&#x02014;isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and community containment.<xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref>
</p><p id="para0006">Such times call for judicious and appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE)&#x02013;&#x02013;gloves, masks, face shields, and handrubs among healthcare workers. In populous countries like India, judicious use of PPE can be a game-changer. Thus, the Infection Control Team at the JPNA Trauma Center, AIIMS, New Delhi has the taken measures such as in-house production of the WHO-recommended handrubs on a large scale and indigenous face shields to be used by the healthcare workers in the hospital (<xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>
).<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>
<fig id="fig0001"><label>Fig 1</label><caption><p>(A) Indigenously prepared WHO-recommended alcohol based handrubs. (B) In-house low-cost face shields made in the laboratory using readily available raw materials.</p></caption><alt-text id="alt0001">Fig 1</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="para0007">The usefulness of both the in-house developed PPE has been tested by the treating clinicians at the Center. Both the formulations of handrubs&#x02013;&#x02013;ethanol &#x00026; isopropyl alcohol, have proved to be effective. The in-house made face shields were prepared using the readily available materials like foam, transparency sheets, and elastic bands. The cost of each face shield was just 15 Indian rupees INR. It took us approximately 2 minutes to make each face shields. The residents wore the face shield for almost 4 hours without discomfort. Such cost-effective measures towards preparedness to battle the pandemic could be taken by all healthcare facilities across the globe, to overcome the expected crises of PPE and halt the outbreak. With the expected shortage of masks, we are also looking at the option to make triple-layered masks using indigenous materials.</p></body><back><ref-list id="cebibl1"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0001"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>The Lancet Infectious Diseases</collab></person-group><article-title>Challenges of coronavirus disease 2019</article-title><source>Lancet Infect Dis [Internet]</source><volume>20</volume><year>2020</year><fpage>261</fpage><comment>Available at</comment><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309920300724" id="interref0001">https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1473309920300724</ext-link><comment>Accessed March 30, 2020</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib0002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other" id="othref0001">Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team.
