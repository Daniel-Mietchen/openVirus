<p id="para0007">The usefulness of both the in-house developed PPE has been tested by the treating clinicians at the Center. Both the formulations of handrubs––ethanol &amp; isopropyl alcohol, have proved to be effective. The in-house made face shields were prepared using the readily available materials like foam, transparency sheets, and elastic bands. The cost of each face shield was just 15 Indian rupees INR.

Such cost-effective measures towards preparedness to battle the pandemic could be taken by all healthcare facilities across the globe, to overcome the expected crises of PPE and halt the outbreak. With the expected shortage of masks, we are also looking at the option to make triple-layered masks using indigenous materials.</p>
