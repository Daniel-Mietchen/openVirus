<p>Around 1% of the world’s population is infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) [
 <xref rid="B1-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Hepatitis C is among the most widespread infectious diseases in the world and is associated with a high level of morbidity and an elevated risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Extrahepatic manifestations may also develop. Since the infection usually occurs with non-specific symptoms, it often remains undetected [
 <xref rid="B2-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the potentially serious course of the disease and the associated costs, a successful treatment is not only in the interest of those affected, but also in the interest of the social insurance institutions [
 <xref rid="B3-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Until 2011, dual therapy using pegylated interferon and ribavirin (PEG-IFN and RBV) was the standard course of treatment. Despite prolonged treatment periods and pronounced side effects, only approximately 40–50% of patients were cured [
 <xref rid="B4-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. “Cure” in this context refers to a sustained virologic response (SVR) reflected in the absence of any identifiable HCV ribonucleic acid (HCV-RNA) twelve weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12) [
 <xref rid="B5-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The introduction of first-generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in 2011 resulted in an improvement in the SVR12 rate. Triple therapy with the DAA telaprevir (TVR) or boceprevir (BOC) in combination with PEG-IFN and RBV resulted in SVR12 rates of up to 75% with HCV genotype 1 infections, but with the known side effects of PEG-IFN/RBV therapies [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The second-generation DAAs substantially improved treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. These DAAs, introduced in 2014, provided effective interferon-free therapy combinations for all genotypes. Publications report SVR12 rates of over 90% and above, including patients with therapy experience and with advanced stages of disease [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These orally administered drugs have shorter treatment periods (8, 12, or 24 weeks) and improved tolerance compared to interferon-based therapies. Due to these advantages the current guidelines regarding CHC treatment recommend a DAA therapy for all CHC patients in Germany—regardless of the stage of the disease and the cost of treatment [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Hepatitis C is among the most common infectious diseases to be recognised as an occupational disease by the Institution for Statutory Accident Insurance and Prevention in the Health and Welfare Services (BGW) [
 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Contact with infected patients during work elevates the risk of infection for health care personnel (HP). In particular, injuries with sharp or pointed objects, which are among the most frequently reported occupational accidents in Germany, increase the risk of infection [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The aim of the study is to determine the cost-effectiveness ratio of second-generation DAAs compared to interferon-based triple therapies based on data from the BGW. It examines the associated treatment results and costs and the impact of these in the case of HP. Modelling is used to simulate the impact of DAA treatment on future changes in outcomes and costs.
