<p>Sociodemographic characteristics of patients are presented in 
 <xref rid="ijerph-17-00440-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Of the DAA patients, 78% were women, and most were at least 50 years of age when treatment commenced. Among the DAA patients, the majority were employed in medical/nursing professions, with over 50% serving as nurses, 25% as medical assistants, and 15% as physicians. The largest share of insured HP worked in clinics (around 47%), in general human medicine (26%), and dental medicine (9%) and in nursing (9%). A documented RWA of ≥50% applied to 23% of the HP. The correlation coefficient between an RWA of ≥50% and cirrhosis was positive (
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.83, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). There was a large and statistically significant linear relationship between an RWA of ≥50% and the presence of cirrhosis in the DAA collective before treatment commenced. After DAA treatment, 93% of the insured persons reached SVR12. Taking into account the manually reviewed cost and outcomes of patients with missing information on the response rates, the SVR12 resulted in 97%. The benefit of DAA treatment was apparent in the high recovery rates, the low number of reports of adverse side effects in the study cohort, and improvement in the RWA (
