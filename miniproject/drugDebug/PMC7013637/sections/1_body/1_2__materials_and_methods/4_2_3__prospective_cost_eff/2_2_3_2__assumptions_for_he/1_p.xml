<p>Information on HP insured by the BGW was used to quantify the effect of DAA treatment on the future development of costs. The direct medical costs for the defined disease statuses were extrapolated over the year. Services for inpatient and outpatient treatments, diagnostic examinations, laboratory testing, drugs, and other therapeutic procedures were taken into account. The indirect costs caused by the RWA were recorded in the form of pension payments. The utilisation of health care services and the average cost points per patient were applied. Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] provided the reference results for determining the costs of the disease statuses “decompensated cirrhosis”, “hepatocellular carcinoma”, and “liver transplantation”. These cost parameters include drugs, diagnostic procedures, and treatment, including treatment of side effects [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The costs applied for diagnostic procedures are based on Stahmeyer et al. [
 <xref rid="B23-ijerph-17-00440" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The costs per disease statuses were derived from published literature [
