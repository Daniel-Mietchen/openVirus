<p>The occupational disease routine data analysis was based on insured HP for whom an occupational CHC infection was recognised in Germany between 2000 and 2017. The data records contain sociodemographic characteristics as well as information on compensation benefits and the degree of reduced work ability (RWA). To analyse the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DAA treatments compared to that of interferon-based therapy, additional treatment-related data such as the SVR12 rate and information on whether patients were treated with DAAs or not were taken into account. Based on standardised records, Westermann et al. [

To identify HP with DAA treatment, the data sets of the overall cohort and the DAA records were linked using the reference variables “reference ID” by a confidential records handler within BGW. HP with an application for DAA treatment and with information about SVR12, cirrhosis, and RWA were included in the DAA data set for performing the Markov model. The data protection concept was reviewed by the data protection officer of BGW. The external group of researchers in Hamburg performing the analysis received anonymised data from the occupational disease cases under study. In accordance with the Professional Code for Physicians in Hamburg (Art. 15, 1) and the Chamber of Legislation for Medical Professions in the Federal State of Hamburg (HmbKGH), the analysis of anonymised data is exempt from obtaining advice on questions of professional ethics and professional conduct from an ethics committee.
