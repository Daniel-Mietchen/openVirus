<p>Globally/Worldwide, approximately/about/ 185 million people are infected with the Hepatitis C virus (HCV).[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the United States, between 2.7 and 3.5 million people are believed to be infected with HCV.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Approximately 5.4% of veterans in the United States have chronic HCV, which is more than double the estimated prevalence of HCV in the general US population.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Untreated HCV is likely to progress to liver cirrhosis and is strongly associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] The risk of mortality among untreated veterans with chronic HCV is nearly 25 per 1000 person years.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Historically, pegylated-interferon (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) based combination therapy resulted in low cure rates (sustained virologic response [SVR]) of 30% to 45% in clinical trials.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] However, results of these trials did not translate to similar findings in the clinical setting where much lower SVR rates were observed.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Peg-IFN/RBV combination therapy was also associated with substantial hematological, dermatological, gastrointestinal side effects, in addition to other adverse reactions, thereby greatly increasing the risk of treatment discontinuations and dose reductions.[
