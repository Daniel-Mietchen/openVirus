<p>The first generation nonstructural 3/4A protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the treatment of HCV genotype 1 (GT1) infection.[

 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] When compared to SVR rates obtained with the standard treatment regimen of Peg-IFN with RBV (38â€“44%) in clinical trials, the addition of boceprevir or telaprevir demonstrated improved cure rates between 63% to 75% for GT1 patients.[

 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Following approval of these two direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), clinicians largely preferred telaprevir over boceprevir based on clinical judgment of data gathered from placebo controlled phase 2 and 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT).[

 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The decision to use telaprevir for some clinicians might have been influenced by its shorter treatment duration (12 weeks) vs. boceprevir (24/44 weeks). Alternatively, as direct head-to-head evidence comparing the tolerability and effectiveness of these two DAAs did not exist at that time to guide clinicians, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) decided to make boceprevir the formulary choice presumably based on an acquisition cost perspective.
