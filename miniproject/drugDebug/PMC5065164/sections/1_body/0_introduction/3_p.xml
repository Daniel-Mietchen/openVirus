<p>Pragmatic RCTs can play an important role in facilitating decisions in selection between seemingly comparable treatment choices. The primary objective of this RCT was to compare tolerability of boceprevir vs. telaprevir in HCV treatment in treatment naïve and treatment experienced veterans. The secondary objectives were: a) to evaluate the effectiveness of boceprevir vs. telaprevir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin; b) to examine comparative costs (drug acquisition cost plus cost of care, such as adverse effect management) per SVR achieved with the two triple therapy regimens in a Veterans’ Affairs (VA) hospital setting.</p>
