<p>The approval of two novel protease inhibitors in 2011 sparked an interest in hepatitis C treatment. Given the lack of evidence-based guidelines concerning hepatitis C treatment when these drugs were approved, clinicians preferred using telaprevir based triple therapy, presumably given its shorter treatment duration and a perceived better response rate since real-world treatment experience reports were lacking.[

Both treatment selection approaches should have been classified as preliminary as they either focused solely on viral cure and ignored the balance between benefits and harms or made drug utilization choices based on acquisition cost rather than comparative cost per cure.Observational data which subsequently emerged, such as those from the CUPIC study group in 2013, showed an increased incidence in SAEs including increased deaths with telaprevir when compared to boceprevir, despite higher cure rates with telaprevir.[
