<p>Pragmatic RCTs in the context of the newer generation of hepatitis C therapies merits discussion. These newer antiviral treatments achieve high SVR rates and are generally well tolerated in registration trials[

 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] although real life data on adverse events are sparse. Despite the universally high SVR rate (&gt;90%) of newer antiviral combination therapies (such as sofosbuvir/ledipasvir and ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir), small differences in tolerability or adverse events can significantly impact tolerance and thus SVR rates seen in real-life treatment results. These drugs typically cost between $63,000 to $94,500 for 8-12-week regimens.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] When treatment costs are high, comparative effectiveness data become important. While cost-simulation data can provide indirect estimates of cost-effectiveness,[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] they are limited in their use because of lack of real-world cost-effectiveness data. Non-randomized studies have also been performed, but these also suffer from the inability to provide real-time comparative effectiveness data and have their own inherent biases because of their observational design.[
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0163945.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Pragmatic RCTs can provide real-time, comparative effectiveness and resource use data. Particularly when treatment costs are high as in the case of these newer antiviral combination regimens, even small differences in treatment efficacy and/or adverse events leading to treatment discontinuation will lead to significant differences in cost per SVR achieved.
