<p>This was an open-label, parallel group, randomized controlled trial. A computer generated variable (4 to 6) block randomization sequence was utilized to allocate subjects to one of two treatment groups, boceprevir or telaprevir. Allocation was concealed using serially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Study subjects were stratified based on prior treatment experience and presence or absence of cirrhosis. There was blinded adjudication of key clinical outcomes. The adjudication committee was comprised of two hepatologists (YFY and MGS) who determined if adverse events (AE) leading to treatment discontinuation were related to the DAAs being studied. The committee also made decisions of treatment cessation due to virologic failure.</p>
