<p>Patients were recruited from the hepatitis C outpatient clinic. The trial was conducted as a “pragmatic RCT”, embedded into routine clinical care with inclusion/exclusion criteria identical to current clinical practice. Eligible patients were adult veterans (≥18 years) with HCV GT1 infection and evidence of chronic hepatitis. The presence of cirrhosis was confirmed by a liver biopsy completed within 3 years before enrollment in the study. If a liver biopsy was not available, a clinical assessment of cirrhosis risk was performed by the two independent hepatologists (YFY and MGS). Other inclusion criteria were: a platelet count ≥ 60,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>; hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL for females or ≥12 g/dL for males; serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL; patients needed to demonstrate adequately controlled diabetes mellitus and normal or adequately controlled TSH on prescription medication. Patients with compensated liver cirrhosis were eligible to participate in the study. Patients who were previously treated with Peg-IFN/RBV and were non-responders (NR), partial responders, or relapsers were also eligible.
