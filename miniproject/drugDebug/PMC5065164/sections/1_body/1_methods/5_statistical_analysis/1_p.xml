<p>This study was projected to enroll a total of 200 subjects (100:100) in groups 1 and 2 respectively. Using a power of 80% and confidence level of 95% with p-value of 0.05, to determine 20% difference in tolerability between both drugs, a sample size of 182 was determined. Accounting for losses to follow up, an increase of 10% to the sample size was projected.</p>
