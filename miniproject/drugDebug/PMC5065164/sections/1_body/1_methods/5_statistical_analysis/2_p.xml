<p>Primary and secondary endpoints were analyzed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. SVR response rates were calculated using relative risk (RR) differences using chi-square test. While interim analyses were not planned, the study was stopped early after a number of serious adverse events (in particular rash with telaprevir) were increasingly reported. Resource use was prospectively recorded in disaggregated form.</p>
