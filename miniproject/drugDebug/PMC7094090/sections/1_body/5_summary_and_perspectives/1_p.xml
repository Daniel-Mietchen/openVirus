<p>This report provides an overview of published information on global research and development of coronavirus-related therapeutic agents and preventive vaccines based on the extensive CAS content collection, with a focus on patents. It includes an overview of coronavirus morphology, biology, and pathogenesis with a particular focus on antiviral strategies involving small molecule drugs, as well as biologics targeting complex molecular interactions involved in coronavirus infection and replication. The drug-repurposing effort summarized in this report is focused primarily on agents currently known to be effective against other RNA viruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, influenza, HCV, and Ebola as well as anti-inflammatory drugs. The potential impact of biologics for treatment of coronavirus infections is promising and includes a wide variety of options including bioengineered and vectored antibodies, cytokines, and nucleic acid-based therapies targeting virus gene expression as well as various types of vaccines.</p>
