<p>The betacoronavirus genome encodes several structural proteins, including the glycosylated spike (S) protein that functions as a major inducer of host immune responses. This S protein mediates host cell invasion by both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 via binding to a receptor protein called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) located on the surface membrane of host cells.

 </sup> A recent study also revealed that this invasion process requires S protein priming which is facilitated by the host cell-produced serine protease TMPRSS211. In addition, the viral genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), coronavirus main protease (3CLpro), and papain-like protease (PLpro).

 </sup> Upon entrance to the host cells, the viral genome is released as a single-stranded positive RNA. Subsequently, it is translated into viral polyproteins using host cell protein translation machinery, which are then cleaved into effector proteins by viral proteinases 3CLpro and PLpro.

 </sup> PLpro also behaves as a deubiquitinase that may deubiquinate certain host cell proteins, including interferon factor 3 and NF-κB, resulting in immune suppression.

 </sup> RdRp synthesizes a full-length negative-strand RNA template to be used by RdRp to make more viral genomic RNA.
