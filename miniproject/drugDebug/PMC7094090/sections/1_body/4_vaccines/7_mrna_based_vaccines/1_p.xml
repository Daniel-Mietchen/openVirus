<p>The potential advantages of an mRNA approach to prophylactic vaccines include the ability to mimic natural infection to stimulate a more potent immune response as well as the ability to combine multiple mRNAs into a single vaccine. Patent application WO2017070626 by Moderna discloses mRNA vaccines composed of mRNAs encoding antigenic viral full-length S, S1, or S2 proteins from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV virus, formulated in cationic lipid nanoparticles. They show that mice vaccinated with mRNA encoding coronavirus full-length S protein generated much higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to mRNA encoding the S protein S2 subunit. New Zealand white rabbits immunized with MERS-CoV mRNA vaccine encoding the full-length S protein reduced more than 90% of the viral load in the lungs of the rabbits and induced a significant amount of neutralizing antibody against MERS-CoV. Moderna announced on February 24, 2020

 </sup> that it has released the first batch of mRNA-1273 against SARS-CoV-2 for use in humans, prepared using methods and strategies outlined in their previous patents. Vials of mRNA-1273 have been shipped to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to be used in the planned Phase 1 study in the United States. Moderna reports that mRNA-1273 is an mRNA vaccine targeting a

Manufacture of this batch was funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
