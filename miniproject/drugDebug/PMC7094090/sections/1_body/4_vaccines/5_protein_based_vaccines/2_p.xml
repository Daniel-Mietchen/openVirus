<p>Patent application US20070003577 discloses immunogenic compositions and vaccines associated with the S protein of SARS coronavirus. A TriSpike SARS coronavirus vaccine was prepared from a recombinant full-length trimeric S protein. The recombinant protein was shown to (1) exhibit native antigenicity as shown by reactivity with convalescent SARS patient sera; (2) exhibit specific binding to soluble ACE2 receptor; (3) promote antibody-dependent viral entry in otherwise refractory human Raji B cells; and (4) elicit protection against a challenge infection in an animal model.</p>
