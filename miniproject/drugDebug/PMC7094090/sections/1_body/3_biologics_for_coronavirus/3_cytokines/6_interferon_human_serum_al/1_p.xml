<p>Patents applications US20090053173 and CN101942026 both disclose long-lasting fusion proteins (HSA-IFN) with each of them being composed of an interferon fused with human serum albumin-binding peptide for treatment of a wide range of diseases, including SARS. Specific HSA-IFN fusion proteins were constructed using five different interferons (IFN-α1b, IFN-α2b, IFN-β, IFN-ω, IFN-γ) with corresponding CAS RNs 1122730-20-4, 1122730-23-7, 1122730-25-9, 1122730-27-1, and 1122730-29-3, respectively. These HSA-IFN fusion proteins significantly lengthened the plasma half-life of interferons (e.g., from 10 h to 12 days for HSA-IFN-α2b) due to slower free interferon release into the plasma and thus may prolong the effects of interferon for each injection.</p>
