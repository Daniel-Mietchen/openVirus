<p>The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 related to SARS and MERS viruses is causing serious and ongoing epidemiological problems around the world. Since there is limited clinical and basic research information at this time, treatment options for COVID-19 currently comprise investigational drugs and management of symptoms. As biologics have the potential to broaden the spectrum of the treatment options for coronavirus-induced diseases, leveraging prior knowledge and practices used to address the SARS and MERS outbreaks provides a practical strategy for developing new target-specific therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV-2. To this end, an analysis of biologics from patents contained in the CAS content collection was performed. The patent analysis included information related to therapeutic antibodies, cytokines, interfering and other therapeutic RNAs, and vaccines for potential treatment and/or prevention of SARS-related diseases from patents published from 2003 to the present.

 </xref> shows more than 500 patents that disclose the use of these four biologics classes to treat and prevent SARS and MERS. Of these patents, vaccine development was the largest class (363), followed by therapeutic antibodies (99), interfering RNAs (35), and cytokines (22). Given the indispensable role of vaccines in viral disease prevention, detailed analysis of vaccines will be presented in a later section.
