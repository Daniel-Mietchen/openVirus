<p>Ninety-nine patents containing information about antibodies with therapeutic and/or diagnostic potential for SARS and MERS were identified. Of these, 61 patents claimed preparation of SARS-specific antibodies (23), MERS-specific antibodies (17), or antibodies with diagnostic application (21). Similar to SARS-CoV, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 receptor in order to gain access into host cells.

 </sup> In viral infection, the S protein, but not the other structural proteins, M, E, and N in SARS-CoV, elicits an immune response.

 </xref> shows the target analysis of patents related to development of therapeutic antibodies for SARS. Over 90% of these antibodies are directed against S protein including its RBD. The data indicate that the S protein is a putative target for SARS-CoV-2 antibody development.
