<p>Patent application CN101173275 discloses two double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) designed to specifically target two separate regions of the SARS protein M mRNA. The siRNA-M1 sequences targeting the 220–241 region of protein M mRNA correspond to CAS RNs 1023405-01-7 and 1023405-02-8, while siRNA-M2 sequences targeting the 460–480 region correspond to CAS RNs 1023405-03-9 and 1023405-04-0. The interference efficiency of these two siRNAs on SARS M protein gene expression was greater than 70%.</p>
