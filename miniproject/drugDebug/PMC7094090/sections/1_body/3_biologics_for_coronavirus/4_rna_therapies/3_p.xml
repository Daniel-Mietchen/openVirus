<p>Since the discovery of RNAi in the late 1990s, it has become a well-known method for silencing/suppressing target genes associated with virulence and pathogenesis. Thirty-five patents in the CAS content collection disclose the use of RNAi in treating SARS, with 28 patents using siRNA molecules, three patents using antisense oligonucleotides, two patents using RNA aptamers, one patent using a ribozyme, and one patent using a microRNA inhibitor.
