<p>Antisense oligonucleotides have also been developed to reduce the severity of SARS virus infections and to prevent or treat SARS virus-associated disease, to detect the virus in human samples, and to diagnose SARS virus-associated diseases. Patent application WO2005023083 published by Ionis Pharmaceuticals describes hybrid DNA/RNA antisense oligonucleotides designed to disrupt the pseudoknot in the frameshift site of the SARS coronavirus RNA. In addition to directly targeting the virus, antisense oligonucleotides may be used to target disease-related proteins involved in the inflammatory process.</p>
