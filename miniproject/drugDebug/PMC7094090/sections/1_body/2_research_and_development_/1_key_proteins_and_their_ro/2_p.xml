<p>ACE2 involvement with coronavirus infection is of further interest since ACE2 is a potent negative regulator restraining overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) that may be involved in elicitation of inflammatory lung disease in addition to its well-known role in regulation of blood pressure and balance of body fluid and electrolytes.

 </sup> It catalyzes degradation of angiotensin II to angiotensin (1–7). The balance between angiotensin II and angiotensin (1–7) is critical since angiotensin II binds to angiotensin AT1 receptor to cause vasoconstriction, whereas angiotensin (1–7) elicits vasodilation mediated by AT2.

 </sup> Although the notion that ACE2 mediates coronavirus invasion is largely accepted, it remains unclear how the levels or activities of ACE2, AT1 receptors, and AT2 receptors are altered in coronavirus-induced diseases due to the limited number of studies.

 </sup> Therefore, it is yet to be determined whether some drugs or compounds that target any of these proteins (e.g., L-163491 as a partial antagonist of AT1 receptor and partial agonist of AT2 receptor) may alleviate coronavirus-induced lung injury.
