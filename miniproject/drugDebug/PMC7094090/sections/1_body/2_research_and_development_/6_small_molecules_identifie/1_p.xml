<p>Besides the aforementioned antiviral drugs, there may be additional small molecule compounds with therapeutic or pharmacological potential against viruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Compounds listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">Tables 
  <xref rid="tbl4" ref-type="other">4</xref>
 </xref> and 
 <xref rid="tbl6" ref-type="other">6</xref> were subjected to a Tanimoto similarity search in CAS REGISTRY using CAS proprietary fingerprints.
 <xref rid="fn1" ref-type="fn">a</xref> Those substances with at least 60% structural similarity match and meeting Lipinski’s rule of 5 were identified. 
 <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl7" ref-type="other">7</xref>
 </xref> lists selected compounds that were also identified to have a pharmacological activity or therapeutic usage role. Compound name and CAS RN are provided for each compound. The second column lists the number of compounds that met the structure similarity and Lipinski’s rule criteria. Although more work remains to be done in this regard, the methodology and results mentioned here point to a strategy that may help streamline the process of drug discovery for COVID-19.
