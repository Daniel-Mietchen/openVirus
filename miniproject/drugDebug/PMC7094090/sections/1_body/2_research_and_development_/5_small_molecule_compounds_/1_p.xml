<p>Besides various commercialized antiviral drugs, there are also small molecule compounds currently in research and development that have shown significant inhibitory effects on many key proteins from similar coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (

 </xref>). These drug candidates mostly inhibit viral enzymes including proteases and components for RdRp. Since 3CLpro protease has a high level of sequence homology between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, inhibitors against 3CLpro of SARS-CoV may also be applicable to SARS-CoV-2. Compounds, including benzopurpurin B, C-467929, C-473872, NSC-306711 and N-65828, which may inhibit the activity of viral NSP15, poly(U)-specific endoribonuclease, were tested for reduced SARS-CoV infectivity in cultured cells with IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.2–40 μM.

 </sup> Compound C-21 and CGP-42112A are two AT2 agonists, whereas L-163491 has dual functions as a partial agonist for AT2 receptor and a partial antagonist of AT1 receptor. Since AT1 and AT2 are important effectors in the RAS system to which ACE2 belongs, it has been speculated that these compounds may be used to adjust the balance between AT1 and AT2, which may be affected by coronavirus infection and to alleviate viral-induced lung injury during the infection.
