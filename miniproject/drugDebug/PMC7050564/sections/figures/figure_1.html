 <caption> HIV-1 replication cycle and antiviral therapy. (a) The HIV particle contains two genomic RNA copies. The Env protein exposed at the viral membrane mediates attachment to the CD4 receptor and CCR5 or CXCR4 co-receptor of target T cells. Upon membrane fusion and virus entry, the viral RNA genome is reverse transcribed into DNA with a complete LTR at both ends. Upon integration into the cellular genome, this proviral DNA can be transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase II transcription complex. RNA transcripts are processed by the cellular capping, polyadenylation and splicing machinery and subsequently translated. Genomic RNA dimers are packaged into new virus particles that assemble and bud at the cellular membrane. Antiviral drugs are grouped in six classes. Fusion inhibitors bind Env during the membrane fusion process, thus inhibiting virus entry. Entry inhibitors (CCR5 antagonists) bind CCR5 and inhibit entry of virus isolates that use the CCR5 co-receptor. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) inhibit the viral RT enzyme. Integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs) target the viral integrase enzyme that is essential for the integration of the proviral DNA copy into the cellular genome. Protease inhibitors (PIs) inhibit the viral protease enzyme required for the processing of the Gag and Pol precursor proteins into the mature structural and enzymatic proteins. CRISPR–Cas9 nuclease can target and cleave the dsDNA that is formed upon reverse transcription of the viral RNA, either before or after integration into the cellular DNA. (b) The HIV-1 proviral DNA with nine open reading frames and the 5′ and 3′ LTRs. HIV transcription is driven by the 5′ LTR promoter. The approximately 9-kb long primary transcript is polyadenylated in the 3′ LTR region. The unspliced RNA is used as mRNA for the production of the structural (Gag) and enzymatic (Pol) proteins, and as genomic RNA (gRNA) that is packaged into virus particles. Differential splicing of the RNA transcripts yields mRNAs encoding the regulatory (Tat and Rev), accessory (Nef, Vif, Vpr) and envelope (Env) proteins.
