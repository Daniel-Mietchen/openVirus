 <caption> Excision or mutation of the HIV DNA. CRISPR–Cas9 attack of the HIV DNA with two gRNAs that target different viral domains (or with a single gRNA that targets both the 5′ and 3′ LTR domain) can result in excision (left panel) or dual-site mutation (right panel) of the viral DNA. Simultaneous cleavage at both targets and subsequent ligation of the free DNA ends will result in excision of the intervening fragment. Otherwise, for example when a DNA break is repaired before the second target is cleaved, both targets will be mutated. Wang et al. [ 44 •• ] identified gRNA combinations targeting highly conserved essential sequences that durably blocked virus replication in infected T cell cultures. These gRNA combinations resulted in hypermutation of the viral DNA, that is, major indels and multiple-nucleotide substitutions at both targets increased over time at the expense of wild-type and point-mutated HIV sequences, which is likely due to repeated CRISPR–Cas9 attack on point-mutated targets (red diamond: mutation due to error-prone DNA repair). </caption>
