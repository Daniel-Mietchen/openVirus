 <caption> Cas9/gRNA attack of HIV DNA. Cas9 is directed to the HIV DNA by the gRNA and cleaves the target DNA at a position 3 nt from the PAM. The dsDNA break is repaired by the cellular DNA repair machinery (NHEJ and MMEJ) which results in nucleotide insertions, deletions and substitutions at the cleavage site. Most of these mutations will be deleterious and inactivate the virus, but some may be compatible with virus replication yet prevent gRNA recognition of the target site and thus lead to viral escape (PAM, protospacer adjacent motif; gRNA, guide RNA; * substituted or inserted nucleotides; Δ, deleted nucleotides).
