 <note>
  <p id="P29">This report shows that HIV-1 replication can be profoundly inhibited by harnessing T cells with Cas9 and antiviral gRNAs, but that the virus frequently escapes from this inhibition. This escape is due to mutations around the Cas9/gRNA cleavage site that are typical for the DNA repair that follows Cas9 cleavage. Cas9 cleavage thus not only inhibits virus replication, but also induces the generation of escape variants. When testing virus escape from different gRNAs, a strong correlation was observed between the time to escape and the evolutionary conservation of the viral target sequence rather than the cleavage activity of the gRNA.</p>
