 <p id="P1">Current antiretroviral drugs can efficiently block HIV replication and prevent transmission, but do not target the HIV provirus residing in cells that constitute the viral reservoir. Because drug therapy interruption will cause viral rebound from this reservoir, HIV-infected individuals face lifelong treatment. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are being investigated that aim to permanently inactivate the proviral DNA, which may lead to a cure. Multiple studies showed that CRISPRâ€“Cas9 genome editing can be used to attack HIV DNA. Here, we will focus on not only how this endonuclease attack can trigger HIV provirus inactivation, but also how virus escape occurs and this can be prevented.</p>
