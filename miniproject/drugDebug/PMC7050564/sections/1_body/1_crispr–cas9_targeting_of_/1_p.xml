<p id="P5">The CRISPR–Cas9 system can be used to modify host cells in such a way that they are no longer susceptible to HIV infection. Inspired by the successful cure of the ‘Berlin patient’, who underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation with donor cells lacking the CCR5 co-receptor, several studies focused on targeting the CCR5 gene [

 </xref>]. However, CCR5 inactivation may trigger envelope mutations that shift viral receptor usage from CCR5 to CXCR4 [
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,
 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. CRISPR–Cas9 can also target CXCR4 [
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] or other cellular factors involved in HIV replication [
 <xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], but this may have undesirable side effects on cell physiology.
