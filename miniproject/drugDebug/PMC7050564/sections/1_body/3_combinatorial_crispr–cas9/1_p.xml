<p id="P10">These studies demonstrate that single gRNA/Cas9 targeting of HIV-1 can potently inhibit virus replication, but subsequent DNA repair facilitates virus escape. As previously shown when treating patients with antiviral drugs and when testing RNAi antivirals in cell culture experiments [
 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], combining antivirals does not only increase the magnitude of virus inhibition (because of additive or possibly even synergistic antiviral effects), but also the genetic threshold for development of resistance, as multiple mutations at different positions in the viral genome will be required.
