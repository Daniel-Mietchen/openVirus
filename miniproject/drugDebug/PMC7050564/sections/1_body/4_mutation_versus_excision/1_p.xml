<p id="P12">It has previously been suggested to excise integrated HIV proviruses with CRISPR–Cas9 and two gRNAs or a single gRNA targeting both LTRs (

 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Excision will require simultaneous cleavage of both targets, followed by ‘ligation’ of the ends. As the cleavage kinetics may differ for different Cas9 targets, this timing requirement may be more easily fulfilled with a single gRNA targeting the identical sequence in the 5′ and 3′ LTR, although the chromosomal environment will differ and possibly influence the cleavage and repair processes. Several studies suggested efficient excision of the proviral genome [

 <xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49
  <sup>•</sup>
 </xref>,
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. However, the PCR-based strategy used to detect excision strongly favors detection of the short excision product over the longer non-excised product. In fact, some studies did also detect a non-excised product, which may represent inactivated genomes with mutated target sites, but could also correspond to wild-type genomes. Unfortunately, the experimental systems used in these studies did not support massive HIV replication and did not allow testing for complete and permanent virus inactivation or virus escape. Such necessary assay conditions were met in our study and although we could also detect a low level of provirus excision, we demonstrated that complete virus inactivation coincided with mutation at both target sites (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, hypermutation seems a major mechanism for HIV inactivation, which is in agreement with the high frequency of dual-site mutations observed upon dual-gRNA cleavage in genome editing studies [

 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23
  <sup>•</sup>
 </xref>]. Fragment inversion, detected at a low frequency in these genome editing studies, may also contribute to HIV inactivation.
