<p id="P18">CRISPR–Cas9 can be combined with other anti-HIV therapeutics such as antiviral drugs or RNAi molecules. The combinatorial approach will further reduce the level of virus replication, but also increase the genetic threshold for virus escape to occur. A combined CRISPR–Cas9 and RNAi attack on HIV, targeting both the viral DNA and RNA, did indeed inhibit HIV replication more durably than the corresponding monotherapies [

 <italic>et al</italic>. recently demonstrated that sequential treatment of HIV-infected humanized mice with ‘long-acting slow-effective release’ (LASER) ART using fatty-acid modified drugs and CRISPR–Cas9 using an AAV dual-gRNA saCas9 vector resulted in viral clearance and prevented viral rebound in ~40% of the treated animals, whereas viral rebound was observed in all animals that received monotherapy [
