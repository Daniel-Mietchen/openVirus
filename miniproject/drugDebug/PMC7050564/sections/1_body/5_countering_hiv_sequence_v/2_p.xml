 <italic>et al</italic>. used such an algorithm to calculate the activity of published gRNAs against diverse HIV isolates [
 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and to design personalized and broad-spectrum gRNA combinations based on within-patient sequence variants and consensus sequences from multiple patients, respectively [
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. This 
 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis, for example, suggested that the gRNAs in our sterilizing dual-gRNA combinations were effective against 82–95% of all HIV-1 subtype B variants [
 <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. However, this estimation uses an arbitrary level of cleavage activity required for virus inactivation and the algorithm is based on experimental data from single-nt mismatches only and assumes that dual-nt mutations have a multiplicative effect. Roychoudhury 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that there was only a ‘trend to weak positive correlation’ between the 
 <italic>in silico</italic> predicted and experimentally measured activity of gRNAs, when testing the knockdown activity of 59 LTR-targeting gRNAs in an LTR-GFP reporter assay [
 <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. By modeling the reservoir depletion during CRISPR–Cas9 therapy, these authors illustrate that reduced gRNA activity and limited coverage of the patient’s viral quasispecies will reduce the efficacy of the CRISPR–Cas9 therapy. However, our long-term virus escape experiments demonstrated that durable virus inhibition does not correlate with gRNA/Cas9 cleavage activity but rather with sequence conservation of the target sequence, which correlates inversely with the mutational escape options for the virus [
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34
  <sup>••</sup>
 </xref>]. In the CRISPR–Cas9 therapy, escape variants can be instantly produced due to Cas9 cleavage and subsequent DNA repair at the gRNA target site. Although continuation of ART treatment during CRISPR–Cas9 therapy will block virus replication and prevent reverse transcription-driven evolution, it will not prevent the generation of Cas9-induced mutations and thereby the possible formation of gRNA/Cas9-resistant variants. Such escape variants may lead to virus rebound upon discontinuation of ART. It is thus critically important that the gRNAs used in the CRISPR–Cas9 therapy do not only inactivate most, preferably all, replication-competent proviral genomes in the latent reservoir, but also that the genetic threshold to escape is high. Combination of gRNAs that simultaneously target multiple highly conserved sequences seems the best strategy.
