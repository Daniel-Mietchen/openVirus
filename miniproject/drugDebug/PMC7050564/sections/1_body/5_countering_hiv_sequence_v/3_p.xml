<p id="P15">We recently evaluated the impact of HIV genetic diversity on CRISPR–Cas9 antiviral activity and viral escape by testing the most effective dual-gRNA combinations against distinct HIV-1 isolates, including different subtypes [

 </xref>]. Despite the fact that the gRNAs were designed to target highly conserved viral sequences, these sites could mismatch at 1 or 2 nt-positions. Replication of nearly all isolates could be prevented by at least one gRNA combination, which caused inactivation of the proviral genomes and the gradual loss of replication-competent virus over time. Inspection of the gRNA targets in viruses that can be blocked versus those that cannot did shed light on the sequence requirements for an effective gRNA attack. Most 1-nt mismatches did not significantly affect gRNA/Cas9 inhibition, but the gRNA lost activity when the mismatch was positioned at the Cas9 cleavage site. In contrast, two mismatches — independent of the position in the target — significantly reduced the antiviral effect. Inclusion of such a non-effective gRNA turned the dual-gRNA therapy essentially into a single gRNA therapy from which the virus was able to escape. This study demonstrates that even minor sequence variation in conserved viral targets can affect the efficacy of the combinatorial CRISPR–Cas9 therapy. Unfortunately, the
