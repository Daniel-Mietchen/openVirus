<p id="P13">HIV demonstrates considerable genetic variation, with four phylogenetic groups (M, N, O, and P), multiple subtypes and much inter and intra-patient sequence diversity. Sequence variation in the gRNA target site may affect the Cas9 cleavage efficiency and thereby compromise the antiviral strategy. Single nucleotide mismatches between the gRNA and DNA target, in particular mismatches in the PAM-proximal region and non-consensus PAM nucleotides, did indeed reduce Cas9 cleavage activity in studies that yielded algorithms to predict the activity of mismatching gRNAs [
