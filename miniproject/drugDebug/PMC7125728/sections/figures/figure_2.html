 <caption> PET imaging of HSV infection, in which the virus is used as an experimental anti-tumor agent. The probe is [ 18F]-2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-1-b- d-β-arabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil ( 18F-FEAU), which is phosphorylated by the viral TK, but is not a substrate for the corresponding host cell enzyme. A and B show background uptake of the probe in the gut and bladder of uninfected control mice. C shows additional uptake of probe in virus-infected tumor metastases in inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes. From Brader et al. (2009), with permission. </caption>
