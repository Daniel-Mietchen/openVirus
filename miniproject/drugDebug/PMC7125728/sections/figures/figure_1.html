 <caption> SPECT and PET imaging are based on the selective retention of radiolabeled tracers at sites of interest. An antibody or peptide that is too large or too highly charged to diffuse through the cell membrane can be used to target an antigen or receptor on the cell surface. A small molecule that is transported or diffuses across the cell membrane may be retained in the cytoplasm or nucleus if it binds to a receptor or other target. Alternatively, the probe may undergo phosphorylation by a cellular (e.g. hexokinase) or viral (HSV-TK) enzyme, so that it cannot diffuse out of the cell. (Figure by Fabian De Kok-Mercado) </caption>
