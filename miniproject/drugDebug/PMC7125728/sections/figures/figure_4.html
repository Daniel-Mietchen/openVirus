 <caption> Detection of signals for SPECT and PET imaging. A. The single gamma rays emitted by the decay of SPECT isotopes trigger a light signal in a crystal that is amplified by a photomultiplier tube, converted to an electical signal and converted to an image by a computer. Gamma rays originating outside the area of interest are blocked by a collimator. B. Decay of a PET isotope releases a positron that collides with an electron in tissues, generating a pair of gamma rays that travel in opposite directions. Only simultaneously detected gamma rays are registered by the detector. (Figure by Fabian De Kok-Mercado) </caption>
