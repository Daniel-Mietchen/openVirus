 <caption> Potential targets for virus-specific imaging probes in the replication cycle of hepatitis C virus. 1. Binding of a peptide inhibitor to a fusion sequence in the viral envelope glycoprotein. 2. Binding of an inhibitor to the active site of the viral NS3 protease. 3. Binding of a non-nucleoside inhibitor to the RNA replication complex. 4. Binding of an antibody or aptamer to the viral E1â€“E2 protein on the cell surface.
