  <p>PET imaging of HSV infection, in which the virus is used as an experimental anti-tumor agent. The probe is [
   <sup>18</sup>F]-2′-fluoro-2′-deoxy-1-b-
   <sc>d</sc>-β-arabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil (
   <sup>18</sup>F-FEAU), which is phosphorylated by the viral TK, but is not a substrate for the corresponding host cell enzyme. A and B show background uptake of the probe in the gut and bladder of uninfected control mice. C shows additional uptake of probe in virus-infected tumor metastases in inguinal and popliteal lymph nodes. From
