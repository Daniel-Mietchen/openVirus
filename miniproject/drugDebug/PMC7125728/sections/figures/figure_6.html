 <caption> 18FDG-PET/CT scan of the thorax of a patient with severe swine-origin H1N1 influenza. A. CT scan shows patchy infiltrates and areas of apparently normal aeration. B. The PET image shows elevated tracer retention, principally in areas that contain infiltrates, but also in some apparently well-aerated regions. Red indicates the highest and blue the lowest level of activity. Previously unpublished images from Bellani et al. (2010), courtesy of Giacomo Bellani. </caption>
