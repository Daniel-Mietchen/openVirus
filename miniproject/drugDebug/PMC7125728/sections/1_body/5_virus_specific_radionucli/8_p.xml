<p id="par0215">Because the HSV-1 TK gene is comparatively small, it should be possible to insert it into the genome of other viruses, to provide a reporter for radionuclide imaging. For example, recombinant HIV and simian immunodeficiency (SIV) viruses encoding the HSV-1 TK has been constructed by using parental viruses lacking the nef gene, which both attenuates them and creates space for additional genomic material (
