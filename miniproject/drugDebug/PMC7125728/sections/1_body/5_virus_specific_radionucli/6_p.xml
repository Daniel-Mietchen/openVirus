<p id="par0205">In contrast to those discouraging results, success in PET imaging of HSV infections has recently been reported in a different area of research: the use of viruses for experimental cancer therapy. Herpesviruses are one of a number of agents that are being explored for their capacity to infect and kill tumor cells. The fact that they naturally encode a TK means that their replication in laboratory animals can readily be monitored by radionuclide imaging. Viral replication in tumors has been virualized using several different radiolabeled deoxythymidine analogues: [

 <sc>d</sc>-β-arabinofuranosyl-5-ethyluracil (FEAU) (

 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Brader et al., 2009</xref>); 
 <sup>124</sup>I-5-iodo-2′-fluoro-1-β-d-arabinofuranosyl-uracil (FIAU) (
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Jacobs et al., 2001</xref>); or 9-(4-[
 <sup>18</sup>F]-fluoro-3-[hydroxymethyl]butyl)-guanine (FHBG) (
 <xref rid="bib0335" ref-type="bibr">Kuruppu et al., 2007</xref>). This work thus represents the first success in imaging viral replication in a living animal by targeting a naturally occurring virus-encoded reporter with a radiolabeled probe.
