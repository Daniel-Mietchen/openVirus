<p id="par0230">In an interesting parallel to viral infections, many genera of bacteria encode a type I TK, making them susceptible to antiherpesviral drugs. Imaging researchers have taken advantage of this property to visualize musculoskeletal infections, both in mice and in human patients. For example, a recent study employed 
 <sup>124</sup>I-FIAU as a PET probe to detect staphylococcal infections following joint surgery (

 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> in animals, even though the organism lacks its own TK. By introducing the gene for the 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> TK into a mycobacterial strain, researchers were able to use 
 <sup>125</sup>I-FIAU to visualize sites of infection by SPECT (
