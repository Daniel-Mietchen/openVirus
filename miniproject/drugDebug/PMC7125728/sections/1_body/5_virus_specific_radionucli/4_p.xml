<p id="par0195">The second class of TKs consists of homodimeric enzymes that are able to phosphorylate a range of substrates, including a variety of nucleoside analogues (
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Eriksson et al., 2002</xref>). This group includes a second human enzyme, TK2, that is found at low concentrations in mitochondria. It also includes the TK encoded by the alpha-herpesviruses, of which HSV is the best-known member. The broad substrate specificity of the HSV TK is the basis of antiviral therapy with acyclovir and other nucleoside analogues. Acyclovir enters cells from the bloodstream by diffusion or active transport across the cell membrane. In uninfected cells, the drug is not modified by TK1, and only a minimal amount is phosphorylated by the mitochondrial TK2, so that almost all of it diffuses back into the bloodstream and is eliminated by the kidneys. In HSV-infected cells, however, the viral TK converts acyclovir to its monophosphate, which is then converted by cellular kinases to the triphosphate. Because acycylovir triphosphate has a 20- to 100-fold greater affinity for the HSV DNA polymerase than for the host enzyme, it is preferentially incorporated into replicating viral genomes, causing chain termination (
