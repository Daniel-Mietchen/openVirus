<p id="par0190">All multicellular organisms and bacteria possess a TK, and the enzyme is also encoded by large DNA viruses (
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">Gentry, 1992</xref>). Two families of TK enzymes are recognized, based their chemical structure and substrate specificity (
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">Deville-Bonne et al., 2010</xref>). The first group includes the TK1 enzyme found in the cytoplasm of human cells, a tetrameric molecule which phosphorylates only dT and deoxyuridine, using ATP as the phosphate donor (
 <xref rid="bib0500" ref-type="bibr">Welin et al., 2004</xref>). TK1 is expressed during the S-phase of the cell cycle, and it is therefore present in significant quantity only in dividing cells. Labeled deoxythymidine analogues such as 
 <sup>18</sup>F-3′-deoxy-3′-fluorothymidine (FLT) can therefore be used as probes to selectively image tumors by PET (
 <xref rid="bib0345" ref-type="bibr">Langen et al., 1969</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0480" ref-type="bibr">Shields, 2006</xref>). Other members of this enzyme family include the poxviral TK, which has a similarly narrow range of substrate specificity (
