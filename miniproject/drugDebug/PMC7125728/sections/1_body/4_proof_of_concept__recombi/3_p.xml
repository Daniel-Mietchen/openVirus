<p id="par0180">The strategy of introducing a gene encoding an imaging reporter into a viral genome provides proof of concept for the notion of employing a naturally occurring virus-encoded molecule as a target for a radiolabeled imaging probe. The approach described above, however, has a significant limitation that would not be seen using an unmodified virus: the introduction of an additional gene may interfere significantly with viral replication. This problem was observed, for example, when a gene encoding green fluorescent protein was introduced into Ebola Zaire virus; although the modified agent replicated normally in cell culture, it was attenuated for mice (
