   <p id="par0415">The HIV fusion inhibitor, T-20, is a polypeptide that binds to the hydrophobic fusion region of the viral GP41, preventing it from undergoing the conformational change required for fusion with the cell membrane. A labeled version of this peptide might therefore be an effective tracer to identify sites of HIV replication.</p>

   <p id="par0420">Non-nucleoside inhibitors of the HIV reverse transcriptase (RT) interfere directly with its activity by binding to loci other than the active site. A number of such compounds are now licensed for the treatment of HIV infection (
