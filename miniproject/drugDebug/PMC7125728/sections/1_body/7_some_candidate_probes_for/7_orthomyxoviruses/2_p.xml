   <p id="par0345">The prototypes of drugs that bind directly to virions to inhibit their replication are the adamantanes, amantadine and rimantidine, which block the M2 ion channel, preventing core acidification that is required for virion disassembly in the endosome (
    <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Beigel and Bray, 2008</xref>). The specific nature of this interaction suggests that small doses of radiolabeled amantadine or rimantadine could be used to localize an influenza virus infection and track it's spread, both in laboratory animals and in humans.

   <p id="par0350">Two licensed drugs, oseltamivir and zanamivir, inhibit the cell-to-cell spread of influenza A and B viruses by binding to the neuraminidase active site (
