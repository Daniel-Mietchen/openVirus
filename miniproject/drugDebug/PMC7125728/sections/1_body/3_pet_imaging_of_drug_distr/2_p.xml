<p id="par0145">Whole-body PET imaging has been used to supplement traditional methods of measuring the uptake, distribution and excretion of antiviral drugs in laboratory animals. For example, PET was used to study the pharmacokinetics of the tenofovir analogue 
 <sup>18</sup>F-PMPA in rats, revealing increased concentrations in the renal cortex that appear to correspond to the drug's occasional nephrotoxicity for humans (

 <sup>11</sup>C-labeled drug in the brains of mice (

 <sup>11</sup>C-labeled stavudine in rats was based on measuring radioactivity in excised tissues, the authors noted that the same questions could have been answered by
