 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Such surface markers, which make infected cells vulnerable to the immune system through the binding of specific antibodies and subsequent cell-mediated destruction, could also be targets for probes such as radiolabeled antibodies. Interestingly, certain tumors induced by viral infection, such as EBV-associated lymphomas, hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis B and C and cervical carcinomas induced by papillomaviruses, express viral antigens, making them vulnerable to destruction by antibodies tagged with high-energy alpha emitters (
