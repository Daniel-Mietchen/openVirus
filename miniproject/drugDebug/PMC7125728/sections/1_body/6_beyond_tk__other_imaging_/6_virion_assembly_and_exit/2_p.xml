<p id="par0265">Once nucleocapsids and other virion structural components have been generated, they are carried by endogenous transport pathways to the inner surface of the cell membrane, where assembly and release of viral particles takes place. Efforts to develop specific inhibitors of this process are under way, but no drugs have yet been shown to have protective activity
