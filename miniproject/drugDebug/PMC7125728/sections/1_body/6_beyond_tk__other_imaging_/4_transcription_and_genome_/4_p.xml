<p id="par0255">While transcription is taking place, viral mRNA must be modified to ensure its efficient translation, through the formation of a methylated 5â€² cap. The methylation process is proving to be a fruitful target for antiviral therapy. However, although compounds that inhibit methylation by blocking the host cell enzyme, S-adenosylhomocyteine hydrolase, have potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity, they would not be suitable as virus-specific probes, because they do not bind to a viral target. In contrast, compounds that specifically block a virus-encoded methyltransferase, such as the flavivirus NS5 protein, might make good tracers for radionuclide imaging (
