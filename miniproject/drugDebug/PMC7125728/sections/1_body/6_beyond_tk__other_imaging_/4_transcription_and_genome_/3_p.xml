<p id="par0250">Another potential target for pathogen-specific tracers is the virus-encoded helicase, which separates the strands of double-stranded DNA or RNA molecules (or, in the case of retroviruses, DNA/RNA molecules) during the course of transcription and genome replication. Specific inhibitors of the helicase of a number of viruses are being developed as candidate drugs, and they may also have potential as imaging probes.</p>
