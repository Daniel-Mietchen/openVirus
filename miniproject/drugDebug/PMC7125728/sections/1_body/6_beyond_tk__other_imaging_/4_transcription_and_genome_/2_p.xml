<p id="par0245">Once the viral genome has been delivered into the cytoplasm, gene transcription and genome production depend upon a ready supply of nucleotides and deoxynucleotides for the synthesis of new RNA, for all types of viruses, and DNA (for DNA viruses). A major antiviral strategy is therefore the design of analogues that are accepted as substrates by the viral RNA or DNA polymerase, resulting either in chain termination or their incorporation into polynucleotides, impairing their subsequent function. Because most drugs that inhibit the viral polymerase are converted to their monophosphate by a cellular kinase, and are therefore trapped within both infected and uninfected cells, they would not be suitable as virus-specific imaging probes. An alternative approach, which has been successful for HIV therapy, and is now being used to target hepatitis C and other viruses, is to identify non-nucleoside molecules that bind to a locus on the surface of the viral polymerase, rather than to its active site, inducing a conformational change that blocks its enzymatic activity (
