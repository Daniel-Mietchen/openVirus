<p id="par0240">To infect a cell, a virus must first bind to its surface (usually to a specific receptor), then undergo a process of fusion with the cell membrane that leads to the disassembly of the capsid and the release of its contents into the cytoplasm. During the fusion process, virion surface proteins undergo specific conformational changes that expose hydrophobic peptide sequences that interact with the lipid bilayer (

While some agents, such as retroviruses, enter directly from the cell surface, for others membrane fusion takes place within endosomes, and is triggered by acidification. In both cases, peptides and other inhibitors have been identified for a wide range of viruses that specifically block the entry process.
