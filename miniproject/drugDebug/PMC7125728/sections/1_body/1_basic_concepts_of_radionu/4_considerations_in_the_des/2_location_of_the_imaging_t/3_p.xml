<p id="par0045">Target location and the chemical properties of the tracer, also affect the timing required to obtain suitable high-contrast images. Because high molecular weight probes are cleared more slowly from non-target tissues than smaller molecules, it may be necessary to label them with a radionuclide with a longer half-life. As discussed in greater detail below, such pharmacokinetic considerations affect image contrast and the SNR, by determining how long it takes for the tracer to be cleared from areas other than the site of interest. In the case of licensed medications that are being considered for use as radiolabeled probes, such clearance data may already have been obtained in pharmacokinetic studies.</p>
