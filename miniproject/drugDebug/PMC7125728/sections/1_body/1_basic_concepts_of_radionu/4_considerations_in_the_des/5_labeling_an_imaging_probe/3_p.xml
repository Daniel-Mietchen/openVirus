<p id="par0125">No matter how labeling is performed, the criteria for success are the same. Most importantly, addition of the radionuclide should not interfere with the high-affinity binding of the tracer to its target. Labeling also should not reduce the lipophilicity of a probe that must pass through cell membranes or cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier to reach its target, and should not prevent its interaction with a specific transporter system. Finally, attachment of the radionuclide to the probe should be sufficiently stable to ensure that it remains in place while it is carried through the bloodstream to the target.</p>
