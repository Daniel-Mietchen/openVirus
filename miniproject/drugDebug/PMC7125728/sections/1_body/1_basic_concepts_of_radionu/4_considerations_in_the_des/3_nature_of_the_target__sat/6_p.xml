<p id="par0070">Because of the signal amplification inherent in the use of a non-saturable target, the specific activity of the probe and the number of target sites are less critical considerations in the acquisition of a useful image. In practical terms, this makes it possible for a tracer such as 
 <sup>18</sup>F-FDG to be stored longer between synthesis and administration to subjects because one can compensate for the diminished radioactivity of the probe by giving a larger dose. For a saturable target, in contrast, such a delay could impair image acquisition, because tracer molecules that have undergone radioactive decay will compete with the labeled probe for available binding sites.
