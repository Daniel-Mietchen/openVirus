<p id="par0050">The interactions of drugs and probes with their targets can be divided into two different types: those that reach a maximum level of activity (“become saturated”) as the concentration of drug or probe increases, and those that continue to display greater activity as the concentration increases (non-saturable targets). Saturable targets in antiviral therapy are generally those in which the therapeutic molecule occupies a target site, and only a limited number of sites are available for binding. Examples include the binding of pleconaril within a cleft in the capsid of some picornaviruses, the blocking of the influenza M2 ion channel by amantadine, and the binding of a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor to a locus on the HIV RT, distinct from its active site. For radionuclide imaging, examples of saturable targets include beta-adrenergic, muscarinic and estrogen receptors, which bind labeled analogues (
