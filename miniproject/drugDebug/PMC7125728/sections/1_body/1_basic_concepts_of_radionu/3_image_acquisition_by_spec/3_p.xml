<p id="par0035">In contrast to the registration of single photons over a range of energies by SPECT, PET detects the pair of 511 kEV photons that are released in opposite directions when a positron emitted by the probe within body tissues collides with an electron (
 <xref rid="fig0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B). PET instruments are therefore configured as a ring of detectors surrounding the subject. By registering a signal only when two photons of the correct energy strike opposite sides of the ring simultaneously, the SNR is markedly increased. This intrinsic mechanism allows PET to provide better spatial resolution than SPECT (approximately 4 mm for clinical imaging and 1–2 mm for animal microPET systems), and facilitates the accurate quantitation of radioactive decay within a region of interest. Such quantitative data lend themselves to statistical analysis of pathologic abnormalities and assessment of response to treatment, and are especially useful for monitoring cancer therapy.
