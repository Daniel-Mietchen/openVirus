<p id="par0030">SPECT and PET imaging are based on the use of radiolabeled probes that are selectively retained at the site of a specific physiological process. Photons emitted from the probe are registered by a detector and the signals are translated by a computer into a visible image. In SPECT imaging, photons in the energy range of 80–400 kEV impact on sodium iodide crystal detectors within camera heads that revolve around the subject, enabling the assembly of a three-dimensional image (

Photons from outside the region of interest and nonspecific scatter arising within the subject are blocked by collimators (perforated metal blocks) placed in front of the detectors, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Because the SPECT cameras can determine the direction of a gamma ray source more accurately than its depth within the body, the method's spatial resolution is in the order of 7.5–10 mm.
