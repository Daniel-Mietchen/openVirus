<p id="par0005">The radionuclide imaging techniques of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) employ short-lived radiolabeled tracers to visualize biochemical processes in animals and humans. The selective retention of an imaging probe at a site of interest is based either on its high-affinity binding to a specific target, such as a hormone receptor, or on the occurrence of a specific chemical modification, such as phosphorylation, that traps it within a cell (

When applied to virology research, SPECT and PET have been used almost exclusively to image host responses to infection, rather than to visualize viral replication. The only instance in which a pathogen-specific tracer has been employed to detect and track a virus has been the use of a radiolabeled thymidine analogue to image herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, based on phosphorylation of the probe by the viral thymidine kinase (TK), which traps it within infected cells (
