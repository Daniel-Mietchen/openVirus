<p id="par0440">At the same time that 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies are being performed, investigators can carry out 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, in which 
 <sup>14</sup>C- or 
 <sup>3</sup>H-labeled drug is administered to infected and uninfected animals (preferably small rodents). After an appropriate delay, the animals are killed, organs of interest are removed, samples are collected for determination of viral titer by plaque titration and of probe concentration by scintillation counting or autoradiography, and sections are prepared for immunohistologic study. If sites of maximum viral replication also show the highest levels of radioactivity, and much lower signals are detected in uninfected tissues, this would suggest that the drug has potential as a virus-specific probe. As in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies, the specificity of binding can be further evaluated by administering various amounts of unlabeled drug along with the labeled probe, to see if competition takes place.
