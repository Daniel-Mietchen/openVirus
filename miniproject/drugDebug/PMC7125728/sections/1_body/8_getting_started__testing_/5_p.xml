<p id="par0445">If initial testing of the 
 <sup>14</sup>C- or 
 <sup>3</sup>H-labeled drug confirms its potential as an imaging probe, the next step will be to work with a radiochemist to determine the necessary precursors and methods for synthesis of a SPECT or PET tracer. Once that synthesis has been carried out, evaluation of the new radiolabeled probe should include

 <italic>ex vivo</italic> studies to ensure that it has retained its biological activity. At the same time, imaging specialists should be consulted to design initial studies in an appropriate animal model of viral infection.
