<p id="par0430">To assess whether a drug or antibody has promise as an imaging probe, it is not necessary to label it with one of the isotopes listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> and attempt to image an infected animal by PET or SPECT. Instead, a preliminary evaluation can be performed using the 
 <sup>14</sup>C- or 
 <sup>3</sup>H-labeled compound, which is often synthesized for pharmacokinetic studies and is therefore available for other types of research. Three types of experiments can be performed. The first is an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay, in which the labeled drug is added to the liquid medium of a number of flasks or wells of virus-infected and uninfected cells. At various time points, the supernatant is removed, the cells are rinsed and harvested, scintillation counting is performed, and the amount of radioactivity retained by infected and uninfected cells is compared. The accumulation of a significantly larger quantity of radiolabeled drug in virus-infected than uninfected cells indicates that it may also be preferentially retained at sites of infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additional studies would include testing the specificity of binding, by adding a large excess of unlabeled drug; determination of the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> of the labeled drug, the concentration of binding sites (
 <italic>B</italic>
 <sub>max</sub>) and the kinetics of binding; and competition studies with other unlabeled analogues (
