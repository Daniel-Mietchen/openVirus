<p>NARTIs are the most widely used antiviral compounds in both human and veterinary medicine. NARTIs are molecules that are similar to the “true” nucleosides and require intracellular phosphorylation for activation. Due to their structural similarities, they can bind to the active center of enzymes (e.g., RT, other polymerases) and block enzyme activity. Many of these analogues are also integrated into growing DNA or RNA strands, but because of small differences in the molecular structure, chain termination results or nonfunctional nucleic acids are produced [
