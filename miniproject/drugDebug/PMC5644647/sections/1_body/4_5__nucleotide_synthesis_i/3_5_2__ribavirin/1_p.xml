<p>Ribavirin (1-Î²-
 <sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyl-1 H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide, RTCA) has marked 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B71-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Systemic administration of ribavirin is limited in cats because of side effects [
 <xref rid="B72-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Sequestration of ribavirin within erythrocytes results in hemolysis, even when low doses of the drug are used [

 <xref rid="B74-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In addition, there is a dose-related toxic effect on bone marrow, primarily on megakaryocytes, resulting in thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage. With prolonged ribavirin treatment or at higher doses, the production of erythrocytes and neutrophils also is suppressed. Ribavirin also can induce hepatic toxicity. An attempt to decrease the toxicity of ribavirin by incorporating it into lecithin-containing liposomes and administering it at lower doses was not successful [
