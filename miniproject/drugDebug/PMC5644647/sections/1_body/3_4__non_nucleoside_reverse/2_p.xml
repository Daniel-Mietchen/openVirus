<p>Three of the FDA-approved NNRTIs (nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz) have been shown not to be effective against FIV

 <xref rid="B57-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have not been performed, presumably because of the lack of

 <xref rid="B57-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Only one old NNRTI, suramin, with a broad antiviral spectrum has been used in veterinary medicine. A major breakthrough in the treatment of FIV would be the discovery of more NNRTIs with activity against FIV RT.
