<p>Suramin (1-(3-benzamido-4-methylbenzamido)-naphthalene 4,6,8-trisulfonic acid sym-3â€²-urea sodium salt), a sulfated naphthylamine and trypan red derivative, is one of the oldest known antimicrobial agents. It has been used as an antitrypanosomal agent and for the treatment of some tumors, such as prostate cancer [

 <xref rid="B59-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Suramin inhibits RT by interacting with the template-primer binding site of the enzyme. Thus, it competitively binds to the primer binding site (without being a nucleoside analogue) and inhibits the template-primer binding that is necessary for DNA elongation. Suramin can therefore be classified as an NNRTI [
