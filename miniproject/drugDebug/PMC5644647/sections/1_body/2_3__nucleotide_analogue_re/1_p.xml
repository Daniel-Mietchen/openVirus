<p>Similar to NARTIs, NtARTIs also interact with the catalytic site of RT and are incorporated into the elongating proviral DNA strand, causing chain termination [

However, in contrast to NARTIs, NtARTIs already contain one phosphate group and thus need only two intracellular phosphorylation steps for conversion to their active forms because the first and often rate-limiting phosphorylation step is unnecessary [
