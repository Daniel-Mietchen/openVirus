<p>IFN-ω inhibits FIV replication

 <xref rid="B105-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. One placebo-controlled, multicenter study that investigated the effect of parenteral rFeIFN-ω against FIV infection in 62 naturally FIV-infected cats (treated with 10
 <sup>6</sup> U/kg SC q 24 h on five consecutive days) did not find a difference in the survival rate in treated cats. However, some improvement in clinical scores, including eight categories of clinical signs (rectal temperature, behavior, appetite, thirst, dehydration, mucous membrane appearance, stomatitis, and death) as well as improvement in laboratory abnormalities (leukopenia, leukocytosis, and anemia) occured [

 <sup>6</sup> U/kg SC q 24 h on FIVe consecutive days for three cycles), but this study lacked a placebo control. In that same study, hematologic values remained within reference intervals, and there were no biochemical abnormalities associated with rFeIFN-ω treatment [
