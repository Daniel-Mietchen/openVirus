<p>Use of oral rHuIFN-α in 24 ill, naturally FIV-infected cats (50 U/kg applied to the oral mucosa daily for seven days on alternating weeks for six months, followed by a two-month break, and then repetition of the six-month treatment) resulted in improvement of clinical signs (e.g., fever, lymphadenopathy, opportunistic infections) in a placebo-controlled, double-blinded study [
 <xref rid="B106-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. However, proviral and viral loads were not monitored during thiat study and therefore it is impossible to conclude whether treatment with rHuIFN- α had indeed an effect on FIV, or rather on secondary infections.
