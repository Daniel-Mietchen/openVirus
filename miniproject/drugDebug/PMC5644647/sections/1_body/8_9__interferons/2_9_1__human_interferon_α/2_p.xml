<p>Human IFN-α becomes ineffective after three to seven weeks of parenteral use in cats because of the production of neutralizing antibodies [
 <xref rid="B100-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Anti-IFN-α antibody production does not occur with oral administration of IFN-α and therefore this route allows for a longer period of treatment. IFN-α is inactivated by gastric acid and destroyed by trypsin and other proteolytic enzymes in the duodenum [
 <xref rid="B101-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], which means that direct antiviral effects are unlikely after oral application. However, oral IFN-α appears to have immuno-modulatory activity, because it can stimulate local lymphoid tissue. The release of cytokines by lymphatic cells in the oropharyngeal area triggers a cascade of immunologic responses with systemic effects [
