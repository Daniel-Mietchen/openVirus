 <xref rid="B82-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. In a placebo-controlled double-blinded clinical trial, treatment of naturally FIV-infected cats with plerixafor resulted in a significant decrease in proviral load in treated cats when compared to the placebo group. There was a concomitant decrease in serum magnesium levels, which did not produce any clinical consequences. Development of resistance of FIV isolates to plerixafor did not occur during treatment [
 <xref rid="B53-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In cats, plerixafor is administered at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg every 12 h. Monitoring of magnesium and calcium levels should be performed at regular intervals during treatment [
 <xref rid="B53-vetsci-02-00456" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Further studies investigating the potential of this promising drug are needed.
