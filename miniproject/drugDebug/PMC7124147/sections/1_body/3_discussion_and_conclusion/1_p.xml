<p>From the above discussion on the available literature associated with the identified compounds, we can conclude that it remains unclear which compounds are responsible for the observed in vitro activity and the claimed in vivo activity. The chlorogenic acid family does have some potential role to play in this observed activity, while the coumarins appear to have no direct role to play. The melilotosides have not yet been tested, while some of the flavonoids were tested but did not show a high level of activity against HIV. The concentration of the flavonoids in the tea infusion was also found to be rather low, which furthermore decreases the possibility that this class of compounds are responsible for the activity. If the flavonoids have any role to play, it will be in the form of a prodrug, as Tao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>) reported on the strong anti-HIV activity of the sodium–rutin–sulphate complex. Artemisinin has been tested against HIV using various bioassays, and the reported activity is somewhat contradictory. It therefore appears that none of the compounds identified thus far can be seen as the main anti-HIV compound. The logical next steps to take would be to perform a full chemical investigation into the tea infusion including the chemical reactions that can take place during the preparation of the tea with various chemicals present in water. It will also be important that the in vitro anti-HIV activity of the tea infusion be confirmed by an independent laboratory in order to decrease the possibility that this result might be a false positive. If the activity can be confirmed, the active compounds should be identified with the normal bioguided fractionation processes. Here, we have to keep in mind that fractionation can lead to the loss of activity and this effect, combined with the difficulties we face with in vitro bioassays, can make this task more difficult than what it appears (Schmidt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>; Wagner and Ulrich-Merzenich 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2009</xref>; and Gertsch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2011</xref>). To give us a potential lead and to narrow down the possibilities, we can again take a reverse approach. If we look at the chemical structures of existing HIV drugs that are currently being developed or used, is there any similar structure to those compounds identified in the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion? There is one HIV drug, Bevirimat, based on the structure of betulinic acid, a triterpenoid. The Asteraceae family of plants is known to contain a wide variety of terpenoids with various biological activities associated with this group of compounds. 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> has been reported to contain oleanolic acid and other tritepenoids which is structurally similar to Bevirimat. As of yet, none of these compounds have been identified in the tea infusion, but it appears that focussing on the identification of terpenoids in the tea infusion might be a good starting point.
