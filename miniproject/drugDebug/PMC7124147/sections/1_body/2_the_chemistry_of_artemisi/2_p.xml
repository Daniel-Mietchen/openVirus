<p>Based on this limited data, the main conclusion was drawn that the tea infusion is ineffective and should not be used (Mueller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2000</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2004</xref>; Rath et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2004</xref>; Jansen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; and van der Kooy and Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). This view is unfortunately too simplistic. If we take a closer look at traditional medicines, we have to realise that the chemistry of any traditional formulation consists of two parts (1) the chemistry of the medicinal plant and (2) the chemical influence that the preparation method has on the final formulation. The first aspect has been studied in some detail, and over the years, more than 600 secondary metabolites have been identified and reported for 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> (Brown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). In contrast to this, only 37 compounds have been identified in tea infusions or cold water extracts, mainly consisting of caffeic acid derivatives, flavonoids, coumarins and artemisinin (van der Kooy and Sullivan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). The influence of the preparation method on the chemistry of the final formulation has not been studied at all. To put this into perspective, we all know that a raw potato tastes different than a cooked potato, indicating that the preparation method has changed the chemistry. What effect will the preparation method have on the chemistry of the final formulation of the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion? The chemical changes that can occur are not only due to the high temperatures involved but also due to water chemistry. Under field conditions, people will use any water available to them to prepare their tea infusions, and we know that water contains a large and variable amount of salts and elements. Any of these salts or elements can react to any organic molecule extracted from 
 <italic>A. annua</italic>. The implications of this have been discussed by Van der Kooy and Sullivan (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2013</xref>). These chemical changes can possibly have a large effect on the overall activity of the tea infusion. Here, we also have to clearly state that it can potentially have the opposite effect as wellâ€”the infusion might become less effective.
