 <italic>Flavonoids</italic>: Vitexin, chrysoeriol and cirsilineol were tested by Wu et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2001</xref>) against HIV replication and were found to be inactive. Piccinelli et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) also tested vitixin and isovitixin against HIV and reported weak activity. Patuletin glycoside has not yet been studied against HIV, while luteolin-7-O-glucoside and rutin were tested by Lee-Huang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2003</xref>) and were found to be inactive. Jaceidin, chrysosplenol D and chrysosplenetin have also not yet been tested against HIV. None off the flavonoids identified thus far in the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion show strong activity against HIV in any in vitro HIV bioassay used. We have to keep in mind that in vitro bioassays will exclude identification of any prodrugs. To put this into perspective, Tao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>) reported on the strong anti-HIV activity of the sodium–rutin–sulphate complex. This highlights the possibility that salts and elements in water can “activate” common compounds which might otherwise be inactive.
