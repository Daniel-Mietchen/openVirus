 <italic>Chlorogenic acid derivatives</italic>: This group of compounds are widely distributed in the plant kingdom. This fact also makes their biological activity and especially their anti-HIV activity controversial. Almost all plants contain chlorogenic acid and its derivatives, and it would therefore be odd if these compounds are also the main active constituents. Or is this maybe proof for “you are what you eat”, indicating that a good balanced diet consisting of fruits and vegetables will fend off disease? Nevertheless, this class of compounds are thought to exhibit good anti-HIV activity with patents covering their use as anti-HIV treatments (Harding et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2011</xref>; Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2008</xref>). Cos et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2004</xref>) have also reported that 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid does indeed show good activity against HIV integrase, although controversy remains around its potency and activity in vivo. However, our latest finding based on the positive reports from African communities using the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion for the treatment of HIV indicates that there is indeed strong anti-HIV activity in the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion (Lubbe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) and that this activity can therefore partly be ascribed to the chlorogenic acid class of compounds.
