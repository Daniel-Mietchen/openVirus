<p>The first step in the reverse pharmacology approach is relatively simple. We have identified a medicinal plant that has been used by thousands of people all around the world without any reports of toxicity. The second step is somewhat more difficult in that we now have to use in vitro bioassays in order to identify which compounds are responsible for the activity. As it stands, we do not yet know which compound(s) in 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> or 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> is responsible for its observed in vitro anti-HIV activity. Due to the reasons discussed in the introduction, research into the chemistry of the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion will not be supported in any Western country. It is therefore interesting to note that very little chemical work has been done on the traditional tea infusion prepared from this plant. Due to this limited data, we can only report on what is currently known on the few identified compounds in the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion regarding their possible anti-HIV activity.
