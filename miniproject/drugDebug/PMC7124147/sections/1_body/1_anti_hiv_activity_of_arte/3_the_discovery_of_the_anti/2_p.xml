<p>Two questions needed to be answered. Does the 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> tea infusion exhibit any in vitro anti-HIV activity? And if so, is this activity caused by artemisinin? In order to test if artemisinin was responsible for the reported in vivo anti-HIV activity, we therefore had to include a chemically similar plant which does not contain any artemisinin. Previous work conducted on 
 <italic>Artemisia afra</italic> Jacq. ex Wild. (Asteraceae) revealed it to be chemically similar to 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> but, importantly, it does not contain artemisinin (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; van der Kooy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2008</xref>). The inclusion of 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> was done in order to determine whether artemisinin was responsible for any observed anti-HIV activity, or whether a combination of artemisinin and other components can explain any observed activity (synergism). Furthermore, we could not find any literature reports that 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> was tested against HIV (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>) except one report where HIV-infected patients were given 
 <italic>A. afra</italic> together with standard HIV treatments in order to boost their immune systems (Mulholland and Drewes, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>).
