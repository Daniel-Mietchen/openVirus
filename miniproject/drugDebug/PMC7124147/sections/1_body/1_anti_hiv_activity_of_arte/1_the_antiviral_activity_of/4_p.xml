<p>The pure compound artemisinin also showed significant activity towards the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) (Romero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2006</xref>). BVDV is classed as a pestivirus, under the 
 <italic>flaviviridae</italic> family, and in this study, bovine epithelial cells were infected with the BVDV virus and treated with artemisinin. It was found that artemisinin is an inhibitor of 
 <italic>flaviviridae</italic> viruses, with a possible application to the treatment of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is very similar to HIV in that they are both RNA viruses; however, HIV is a retrovirus and integrates itself into the hosts DNA. Paeshuyse et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>) confirmed this by testing artemisinin against HCV and found it to be active at levels of 78 ± 21 μM. This activity was potentiated by hemin at concentrations that had no effect on the host cells, indicating a pronounced synergistic antiviral activity when artemisinin and hemin were combined. A further understanding of how 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> extracts, and not just artemisinin, interact and inhibit viruses could enable future investigations to discover and develop practical and inexpensive treatments for viruses of a similar nature, like that of HIV. Romero et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2005</xref>) studied the activity of artemisinin against hepatitis B virus (HBV), noting IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 55 and &gt;100 μM for the inhibition of hepatitis B envelope protein surface antigen and HBV-DNA release, respectively. Interestingly, artemisinin proved to be a more effective antiviral than its commonly used derivative, artesunate, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 2.3 and 0.5 μM, respectively.
