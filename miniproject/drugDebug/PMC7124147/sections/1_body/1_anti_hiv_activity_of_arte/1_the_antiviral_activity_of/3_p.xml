 <italic>A. annua</italic> has been shown to possess a wide variety of antiviral effects, notably against herpes simplex virus, Type 1 (HSV1). Karamoddini (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>) conducted in vitro tests on methanolic extracts of homogenised plant material of various 
 <italic>Artemisia</italic> species, where 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> showed the highest antiherpetic activity. 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> was also tested with the common antiviral drug acyclovir, where it showed higher anti-HSV1 activity than the commercial drug (Karamoddini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). It is possible that the noted antiherpetic effects could be caused by artemisinin; however, synergism or other active compounds has yet to be tested in relation to HSV1. 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> has been shown to be active against the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, a highly deadly and contagious disease (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>). Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2005</xref>) tested ethanolic extracts of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and three other plant species against the virus, determining 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> to have an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 34.5 ± 2.6 μg/mL. Abid Ali Khan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1991</xref>) studied the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> against the tobamoviruses, where plant samples were extracted with 
 <italic>n</italic>-hexane and evaluated against tobamovirus virus cultures, with 75 % inhibition noted. Abid Ali Khan et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1991</xref>) then fractionated the extract, collecting the active fraction and determined the active compound/s to be sterols. The outcome of this study is important to note as artemisinin was not identified as the virus inhibitor.
