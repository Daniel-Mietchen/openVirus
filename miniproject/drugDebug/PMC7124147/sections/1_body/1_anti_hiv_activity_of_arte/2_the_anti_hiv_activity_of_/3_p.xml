<p>The first report on artemisinin derivatives being used as anti-HIV agents was published by Jung and Schinazi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1994</xref>) who embarked on a study of artemisinin trioxane derivatives. They concluded that anti-HIV activity was common in artemisinin trioxane derivatives and, given their results, further evaluation was needed for a potential anti-HIV treatment to be produced. Lubbe et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2012</xref>) investigated the traditional infusion of both 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and 
 <italic>A. afra</italic>, compared to pure artemisinin, in relation to anti-HIV activity, noting that both infusions exhibited potent inhibition with 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> having an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 2.0 μg/mL, whereas pure artemisinin showed no inhibition even at 25 μg/mL. 
 <italic>Artemisia afra</italic> which does not contain artemisinin showed a similar level of activity against HIV, indicating that the active compounds are probably not artemisinin. Given the surveys completed by Willcox et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>) and Noumi and Manga (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>), a clear relationship between plant and disorder can be seen. The implementation of reverse pharmacology in cases like this would enable researchers to possibly develop effective treatments for various viruses (specifically HIV) and diseases, given their socio-historical validation.
