<p>In vivo activity: A 2011 survey completed by Willcox et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2011</xref>) in Kenya and Uganda reported that 51 % (
 <italic>n</italic> = 20) of respondents were using 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> infusions for diseases other than malaria, where 28 % (
 <italic>n</italic> = 11) were using the infusions for the treatment of HIV. Furthermore, a survey completed by Noumi and Manga (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2011</xref>) in Cameroon also noted that 13.8 % of respondents were using 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> in relation to HIV/AIDS. Abu-Raddad et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>) hypothesised that the spread of the malaria parasite may be enabling the spread of the HIV virus throughout Africa, due to tainted blood used for transfusions. This hypothesis gives reason to the further study of current malaria treatments in relation to HIV, like that of 
 <italic>A. annua</italic> and other commonly used medicinal plants.
