<p>The main issue is however the problem of false positives and false negatives. The false positives are compounds that are deemed “active” in a specific bioassay after which a large amount of time and effort will be spent on their identification. Fortunately, false positives eventually always reveal themselves but, unfortunately, at a cost of time and funds. False negatives are a far more serious problem in that they do not react with a specific enzyme in the bioassay used and are therefore deemed inactive. They may even degrade in the “foreign” media used in the bioassay. The main problem here is that false negatives never reveal itself. For example, if it is published that medicinal plant X show no activity against disease X, very few people will go and reinvestigate, if any. Unfortunately, this problem is also important when using in vitro bioassays to test for the toxicity of lead compounds or active extracts. Here, again we find the occurrence of false positives and negatives. False positives are again compounds reacting with specific cells, leading to cell death and the conclusion is made that this compound or extract is toxic. A good example of this was that we recently tested English tea (
 <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>) as negative control on a specific cell line. Due to toxicity in that specific cell line, our experiments could not continue, and we could not use normal tea as a negative control (unpublished results). Many millions of people are drinking tea every day without any short- or long-term toxicity reported thus far. To put this into perspective, if this was a medicinal plant, we would have concluded that it is far too toxic and we would not have continued our investigations. A false negative in toxicity bioassays speaks for itself. There are countless examples of lead compounds that were deemed safe after in vitro and even in vivo animal studies that turned out to be toxic in people.
