<p>Combined effect of HCV-796 (an NNI of HCV NS5B) and boceprevir SCH 503034 (an inhibitor of NS3 serine protease) was tested to check their competence for producing resistant replicon variants. Conclusively, substantial antiviral efficiency was assessed in combinational treatment along with low emergence rate of viral variants with reduced propensity. This study offers a basis for the clinical estimation of three-part combination of PEG IFN-Î±, boceprevir and HCV-796 [
