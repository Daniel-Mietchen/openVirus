<p>PF-00868554, an NNI of HCV RdRp, has demonstrated both specificity and capability for 1a and 1b genotypes including clinical and laboratory isolates. During 
 <italic>in-vitro </italic>resistance study of PF-00868554, amino acid (AA) changes were recognized at the allosteric site of the polymerase, comprising M423T/V/I, M426T, and I482T, but switching at M423 resulted in relatively much resistance than others. Notably, replicons enclosing these resistance changes have found no cross-resistance with IFN and other polymerase inhibitors, sustaining the make use of PF-00868554 in combination therapies [
