<p>Debio 025, a non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine (Cs) analogue, is found to exhibit novel inhibition of HCV replication when used alone or in combination with STAT-C inhibitors. To date, Debio 025 was pooled with RBV, VX-950 a protease inhibitor, 2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-Methylcytidine (2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-MeCyt) a NI and JT-16 a NNI. All these amalgamations produced additive antiviral effects showing the lack of interference with biological activity of each other which may either, resulted in synergistic or antagonistic effect. Combinations of low dose of Debio 025 with specific STAT-C inhibitors also prevent the progress of STAT-C inhibitor-resistant variant; hence, it may prove to be a striking antiviral agent for the treatment of HCV infection [

In phase II study of clinical trials, it is being found that Debio 025 is a novel HCV inhibitor by binding to cyclophilin A (CyP) in domain II of NS5A which is crucial for replication. Resistance outline of Debio 025 presents a distinctive selection in treating chronic HCV infection, both as the backbone of forthcoming combination therapy with other compounds for treatment and as save therapy for patients anchoraging resistance mutations to other anti-HCV agents [
