<p>Novel sulfonamide P4-capped ketoamide second generation inhibitors of hepatitis C virus NS3 serine protease have been discovered. Discovery of one of them, showing potent anti HCV activity, is contributed by introducing the sulphonamide moiety and optimization of P1 residue. This potent inhibitor of HCV subgenomic replication reveals improved cellular potencies and good oral exposure in rat, dogs and monkey [
