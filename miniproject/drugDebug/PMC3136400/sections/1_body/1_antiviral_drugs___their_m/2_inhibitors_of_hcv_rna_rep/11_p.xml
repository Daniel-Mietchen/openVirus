<p>Cyclosporine A (CsA), an immunosuppressant for transplanted patients, has currently come forward as a forthcoming antiviral compound against HCV. It is evaluated that CsA persuasively inhibits HCV replication by illustrating the various HCV derived replicons with variable levels of CsA resistance due to mutations in NS5B. Transformed HCV replicons integrated with these mutations proved the resistance to CsA. Increased ability of mutant NS5B is associated with the enhanced binding to RNA in the presence of CsA and intramolecular interactions between the residues of thumb and C-terminal domains are crucial for HCV replicase function [
