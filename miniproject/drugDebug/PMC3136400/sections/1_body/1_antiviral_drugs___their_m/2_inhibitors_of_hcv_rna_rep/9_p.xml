<p>Nitazoxanide (NTZ) was originally ascertained for intestinal protozoan infection; later on its antiviral characteristics were established. NTZ, and its metabolite, tizoxanide (TIZ), exhibit constancy with resistance in HCV replicon containing cell line bestowed by the changes in the host, not by mutagenesis in virus. Inhibition of HCV RNA replication was observed by subjecting HCV replicon containing cell line to G418 and different concentrations of compound [
