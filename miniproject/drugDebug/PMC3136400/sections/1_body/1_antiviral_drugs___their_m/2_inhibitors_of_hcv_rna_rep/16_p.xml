<p>SCY-635 is a potent non-immunosuppressive disubstituted analogue of CsA showing evidence of antiviral activity against HCV by operating at host CyP, which is imperative for HCV RNA replication. SCY-635 stalled the peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity of CyP at nanomolar concentrations by testing in HCV replicon cell line. Further clinical trials of SCY-635 may prove to be beneficial in drug development for HCV in future [
