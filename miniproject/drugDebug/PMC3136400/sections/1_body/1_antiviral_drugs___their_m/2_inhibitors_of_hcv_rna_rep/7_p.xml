<p>Antiviral activity of 7-deazaneplanocin A (7-DNPA) is reported against HCV with low cell toxicity in HCV RNA replicon system in Huh-7 cell line. Anti-HCV activity of 7-DNPA is comparable to the 2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-cytosine (2'-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me- C) or 2'-F-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-cytosine (2'-F-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-C) which were used as positive controls, by quantifying through real time RT-PCR. Various derivatives of 7-DNPA are synthesized by replacing different functional groups at 7-position of DNPA, of which some are devoid of anti-HCV activity while others such as 7-carboxamide derivative exhibiting significant antiviral activity against HCV [
