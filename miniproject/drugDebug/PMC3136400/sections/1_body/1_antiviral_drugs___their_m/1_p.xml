<p>Mainly, an array of attempts has been focused especially on these targets: NS3-4A serine protease, RNA helicase activity of NS3, NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), agents that enhance immunomodulatory activity by developing HCV replicon system. Likewise, the HCV replicon system illustrated an exclusive drug-screening system for antiviral compounds exhibiting the potency to hamper the viral enzymes and HCV RNA replication process in cellular environment. However, antiviral compound-resistant mutations are credibly arising in viral genome due to high heterogeneity while developing the specific HCV protease and polymerase inhibitors [
