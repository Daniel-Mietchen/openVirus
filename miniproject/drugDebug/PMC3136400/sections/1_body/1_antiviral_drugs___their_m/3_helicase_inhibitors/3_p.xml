<p>A new series of compounds, acridone derivatives, were tested to measure inhibitory effects of derivatives against NS3 helicase activity of HCV in sub-genomic replicon assay. These substituted compounds were also investigated for transcription inhibition 
 <italic>in-vitro </italic>based on the DNA-dependent T7 RNA polymerase. The majority of compounds were displayed as transcription inhibitors. Two compounds, 
 <italic>N</italic>-(pyridin-4-yl)-amide and 
 <italic>N</italic>-(pyridin-2-yl)-amide of acridone-4-carboxylic acid are competent RNA replication inhibitors verifying that the acridone derivatives may be deemed as impending antiviral mediator [
