<p>Another HCV helicase inhibitor, QU663, illustrated discriminating inhibition without disturbing NS3 helicase hydrolysis potential. QU663 might function as a potent inhibitor with respect to nucleic acid substrate by lessening the likeness of the enzyme for the substrate. QU663 blocks NS3 unwinding activity, thus making it a potential competitor for antiviral drugs against HCV [
