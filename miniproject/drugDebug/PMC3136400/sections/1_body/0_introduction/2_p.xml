<p>HCV infection is generally going to be clinically imperceptible after 3-12 weeks of incubation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Currently, it is estimated that 50-80% of patients have successively infected with chronic infection and 2-5% have developed hepatocellular carcinoma per annum. HCV has the capacity to stimulate immunopathological effects, engendering reactive oxygen species (ROS) impend indirectly fibrogenetic effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] leading to steatosis and cirrhosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. HCV infection commences while interaction of virions instigate with various cellular receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. After internalization of virions by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], HCV RNA is being released into cytosol followed by translation and progression to viral proteins. A large number of viral progeny particles are released through the secretory pathway after assemblage of new genomic RNA and structural proteins.
