 <caption> HCV structure : HCV enclosing a single stranded RNA of 9.6 kb. The genome carries a single long open reading frame (ORF) which on processing forms a polyprotein that is proteolytically cleaved into distinctive products. The HCV polyprotein is cleaved co- and post-translationally by cellular and viral proteinases into 10 different products, with the structural proteins located in the amino- terminal one-third and the nonstructural (NS) replicative proteins in the rest.
