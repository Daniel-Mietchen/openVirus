 <p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major worldwide problem causes acute and chronic HCV infection. Current treatment of HCV includes pegylated interferon-α (PEG IFN- α) plus ribavirin (RBV) which has significant side effects depending upon the type of genotype. Currently, there is a need to develop antiviral agents, both from synthetic chemistry and Herbal sources. In the last decade, various novel HCV replication, helicase and entry inhibitors have been synthesized and some of which have been entered in different phases of clinical trials. Successful results have been acquired by executing combinational therapy of compounds with standard regime in different HCV replicons. Even though, diverse groups of compounds have been described as antiviral targets against HCV via Specifically Targeted Antiviral Therapy for hepatitis C (STAT-C) approach (in which compounds are designed to directly block HCV or host proteins concerned in HCV replication), still there is a need to improve the properties of existing antiviral compounds. In this review, we sum up potent antiviral compounds against entry, unwinding and replication of HCV and discussed their activity in combination with standard therapy. Conclusively, further innovative research on chemical compounds will lead to consistent standard therapy with fewer side effects.</p>
