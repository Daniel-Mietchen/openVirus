  <p>Effects of eltrombopag on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) late antigen (LA) expression in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representative dose–response curves showing the effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression and HFF viability (as determined after 120 h of incubation). Eltrombopag concentrations that reduce HCMV LA expression by 50% (inhibitory concentration (IC)
   <sub>50</sub>) or 90% (IC
   <sub>90</sub>) and cell viability by 50% (cytotoxicity concentration (CC)
   <sub>50</sub>) relative to untreated controls are also provided. Eltrombopag was continuously present from the time of virus infection. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representative photographs and Western blots demonstrating the effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression. In (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>), HFFs were infected with HCMV strain Hi91 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.02). HCMV LA expression was detected 120 h post infection. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Representative dose–response curves and IC
   <sub>50</sub> values indicating effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression in HFFs infected with different MOIs of HCMV strain Hi91 as detected 120 h post infection.
