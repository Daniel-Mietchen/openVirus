 <caption> Effects of eltrombopag on HCMV replication and at different stages of the viral replication cycle. HFFs were infected with HCMV strain Hi91 (MOI 0.02). HCMV LA expression and virus titres were detected 120 h post infection. ( A) Virus titres in the absence or presence of eltrombopag. ( B) Representative doseâ€“response curves and IC 50 values indicating the effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression after 24 h of pre-treatment, after treatment during the 1-h adsorption period, after drug addition post infection following the 1-h virus adsorption period, after drug addition 24 h post infection, and after drug addition 48 h post infection. * p &lt; 0.05 </caption>
