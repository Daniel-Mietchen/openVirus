 <caption> Antiviral effects of eltrombopag determined in different cell types infected by different HCMV strains and clinical isolates. HFFs were infected at an MOI of 0.02 and adipose-derived adult mesenchymal stem cells (ASCs) at an MOI of 5. HCMV LA expression was determined 120 h post infection. ( A) Eltrombopag concentrations that reduce HCMV LA expression by 50% (IC 50). Numerical values are provided in Table S3. The eltrombopag concentration that reduced ASC viability by 50% (CC 50) was 17,872 Â± 1302 nM. ( B) Representative growth curve indicating the effects of equimolar concentrations of Fe(III)Cl 3 on the anti-HCMV effects of eltrombopag as indicated by HCMV LA expression in U1 (MOI 0.02)-infected HFFs 120 h post infection. </caption>
