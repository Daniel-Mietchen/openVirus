 <caption> Effects of eltrombopag on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) late antigen (LA) expression in primary human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs). ( A) Representative dose–response curves showing the effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression and HFF viability (as determined after 120 h of incubation). Eltrombopag concentrations that reduce HCMV LA expression by 50% (inhibitory concentration (IC) 50) or 90% (IC 90) and cell viability by 50% (cytotoxicity concentration (CC) 50) relative to untreated controls are also provided. Eltrombopag was continuously present from the time of virus infection. ( B) Representative photographs and Western blots demonstrating the effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression. In ( A, B), HFFs were infected with HCMV strain Hi91 (multiplicity of infection (MOI) 0.02). HCMV LA expression was detected 120 h post infection. ( C) Representative dose–response curves and IC 50 values indicating effects of eltrombopag on HCMV LA expression in HFFs infected with different MOIs of HCMV strain Hi91 as detected 120 h post infection. </caption>
