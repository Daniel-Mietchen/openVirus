 <caption> Eltrombopag inhibits HCMV infection by iron depletion. ( A) Representative doseâ€“response curve indicating the effects of eltrombopag on cytopathogenic effect (CPE) formation (detected 120 h post infection), in murine cytomegalovirus (MOI 1)-infected murine, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, and eltrombopag concentration that reduces CPE formation by 50% (IC 50), relative to untreated control. The findings indicate that eltrombopag interferes with cytomegalovirus replication by thrombopoietin-receptor-independent effects, since eltrombopag does not activate the murine thrombopoietin receptor. The investigated eltrombopag concentrations did not affect NIH/3T3 cell viability. ( B) Representative growth curve indicating the effects of equimolar concentrations of Fe(III)Cl 3 on the anti-HCMV effects of eltrombopag, as indicated by HCMV LA expression in HCMV Hi91 (MOI 0.02)-infected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) 120 h post infection. Equimolar Fe(III)Cl 3 concentrations circumvent the anti-HCMV effects exerted by eltrombopag. </caption>
