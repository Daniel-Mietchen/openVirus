  <p>Eltrombopag inhibits HCMV infection by iron depletion. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representative doseâ€“response curve indicating the effects of eltrombopag on cytopathogenic effect (CPE) formation (detected 120 h post infection), in murine cytomegalovirus (MOI 1)-infected murine, NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, and eltrombopag concentration that reduces CPE formation by 50% (IC
   <sub>50</sub>), relative to untreated control. The findings indicate that eltrombopag interferes with cytomegalovirus replication by thrombopoietin-receptor-independent effects, since eltrombopag does not activate the murine thrombopoietin receptor. The investigated eltrombopag concentrations did not affect NIH/3T3 cell viability. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Representative growth curve indicating the effects of equimolar concentrations of Fe(III)Cl
   <sub>3</sub> on the anti-HCMV effects of eltrombopag, as indicated by HCMV LA expression in HCMV Hi91 (MOI 0.02)-infected human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) 120 h post infection. Equimolar Fe(III)Cl
   <sub>3</sub> concentrations circumvent the anti-HCMV effects exerted by eltrombopag.
