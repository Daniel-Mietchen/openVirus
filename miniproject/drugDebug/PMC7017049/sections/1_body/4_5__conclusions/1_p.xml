<p>Therapeutic eltrombopag concentrations inhibit HCMV replication via chelation of Fe
 <sup>3+</sup> ions. Eltrombopag is effective against drug-resistant viruses and synergistically increases the effects of the mainstay anti-HCMV drug ganciclovir. The anti-HCMV activity of eltrombopag may be of particular interest for its use for the treatment of cytopenias after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as HCMV reactivation and disease is a major reason for transplantation failure.
