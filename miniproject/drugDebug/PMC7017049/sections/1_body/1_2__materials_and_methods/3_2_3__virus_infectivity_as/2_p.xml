<p>As described previously [
 <xref rid="B18-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], cells producing HCMV-specific antigens were detected 24 h post infection by immunoperoxidase staining, using monoclonal antibodies directed against the UL123-coded 72 kDa immediate early antigen 1 (IEA1) (Mouse Anti CMV IEA, MAB8131, Millipore, Temecula, CA, USA), and 120 h post infection by immunoperoxidase staining, using monoclonal antibodies directed against UL55-encoded late antigen (LA) gB, (kindly provided by K. Radsak, Institut f√ºr Virologie, Marburg, Germany), as previously described. Drug concentrations that reduced HCMV antigen expression by 50%, inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>), were calculated using Calcusyn (Biosoft, Cambridge, UK).
