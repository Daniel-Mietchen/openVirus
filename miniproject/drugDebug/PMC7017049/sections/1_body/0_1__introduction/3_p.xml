<p>A case report described the use of eltrombopag in an immunocompetent patient who suffered from human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)-associated thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Immunosuppressive treatment for thrombocytopenia (prednisone, intravenous immunoglobulin, dapsone), in combination with antiviral therapy (ganciclovir/valganciclovir, HCMV hyperimmune globulin), only resulted in a temporary platelet response with subsequent relapse. A change to eltrombopag, intended to increase platelet counts without immunosuppressive therapy, resulted in a durable increase in platelet levels, no evidence of HCMV viraemia, and the resolution of symptoms [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The observed effects were attributed to eltrombopag overcoming HCMV-induced suppression of platelet production [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, we hypothesized that direct antiviral effects may also have contributed to the beneficial outcome in the case report of the patient with HCMV-associated thrombocytopenia [
 <xref rid="B17-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Indeed, we found that eltrombopag exerts anti-HCMV effects via iron chelation.
