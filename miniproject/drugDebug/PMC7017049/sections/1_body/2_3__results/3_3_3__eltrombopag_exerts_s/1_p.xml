<p>Next, we tested eltrombopag in combination with ganciclovir, the mainstay of anti-HCMV therapies [
 <xref rid="B13-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The combination of equimolar eltrombopag and ganciclovir concentrations resulted in synergistic anti-HCMV effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f004">Figure 4</xref>), which is illustrated by a weighted average combination index (CI
 <sub>WT</sub>) of 0.17 ± 0.03, as determined by the method of Chou and Talalay [
 <xref rid="B24-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. According to this method, combined effects are considered to be synergistic at a CI
 <sub>WT</sub> of ≤0.7 [
