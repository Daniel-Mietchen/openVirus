<p>To better define which phases of the viral replication cycle are affected by eltrombopag, the drug was added at different time points (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-09-00031">Table S1</xref>). Pre-incubation and drug addition during the 1-h virus adsorption period did not, or only modestly, affect virus replication. This shows that eltrombopag does not primarily interfere with virus binding to host cells and virus internalization, but needs to be present during virus replication to exert its anti-HCMV effects. Drug addition 1-h or 24 h post infection was sufficient to achieve maximum inhibition of HCMV LA expression (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-09-00031">Table S1</xref>). This, together with the observed lack of inhibition of HCMV immediate early antigen (IEA) expression, indicates that eltrombopag inhibits the late stages of the HCMV replication cycle characterized by LA expression. Drug addition 48 h post infection resulted in reduced effects compared to drug addition 1-h or 24 h post infection (
