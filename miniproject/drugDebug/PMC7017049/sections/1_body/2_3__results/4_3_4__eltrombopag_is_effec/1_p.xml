<p>Finally, we investigated the effects of eltrombopag against a broader range of laboratory virus strains and clinical isolates in HFFs, and primary-adipose-derived ASCs, another cell type that supports HCMV replication [
 <xref rid="B39-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The laboratory HCMV strains included Davis [
 <xref rid="B40-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] and Towne [
 <xref rid="B41-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] in addition to Hi91. The clinical isolates U1, U59, and U75 were isolated from the urine of patients, as previously described [
 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. U1 and U59 harbor an A987G mutation in the HCMV DNA polymerase UL54 (
 <xref rid="cells-09-00031-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is known to confer combined ganciclovir and cidofovir resistance [
 <xref rid="B42-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="B43-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. U1 also displays a C607Y mutation in the HCMV kinase UL97 (
 <xref rid="cells-09-00031-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which is associated with ganciclovir resistance [
 <xref rid="B44-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="B45-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In agreement, U1 and U59 were characterized by high ganciclovir and cidofovir IC
 <sub>50</sub>s (
 <xref rid="cells-09-00031-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), which are typically considered to indicate resistance [
 <xref rid="B46-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,
 <xref rid="B47-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,
 <xref rid="B48-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. U75 also displayed resistance to ganciclovir and cidofovir, although it does not harbor known resistance mutations (data not shown).
