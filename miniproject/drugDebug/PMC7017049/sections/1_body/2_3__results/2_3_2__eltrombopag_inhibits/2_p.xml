 <sup>3+</sup> concentrations was shown to inhibit pharmacological action of eltrombopag that are caused via iron chelation [
 <xref rid="B31-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Hence, we investigated eltrombopag in combination with equimolar Fe(III)Cl
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations to investigate whether iron chelation is the mechanism by which eltrombopag exerts its anti-HCMV effects (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). Equimolar Fe(III)Cl
 <sub>3</sub> concentrations prevented the anti-HCMV effects of eltrombopag (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00031-f003">Figure 3</xref>B). This suggests that iron chelation is the main mechanism of eltrombopagâ€™s anti-HCMV activity. In agreement, eltrombopag exerted antagonistic effects in combination with the iron chelator deferasirox (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-cells-09-00031">Table S2</xref>), which may indicate that both compounds share the same antiviral mechanism.
