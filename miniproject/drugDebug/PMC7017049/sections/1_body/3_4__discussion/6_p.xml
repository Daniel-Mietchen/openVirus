<p>Due to its effects on platelet counts and hematopoietic stem cells [
 <xref rid="B2-cells-09-00031" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], however, the anti-HCMV effects of eltrombopag are primarily of relevance for anemia patients at risk of HCMV disease, for whom eltrombopag is indicated. Eltrombopag has been suggested for the treatment of cytopenias after hematopoietic stem cell transplantations and case reports support its safety and efficacy [

Notably, eltrombopag was effective against resistant clinical HCMV isolates, and resistance formation to the approved drugs is a major challenge after stem cell transplantation [
