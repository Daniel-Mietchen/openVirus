Abstract</div> <p>The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) is caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first detected at the end of December 2019. The epidemic has affected various regions of China in different degrees. As the situations evolve, the COVID-19 had been confirmed in many countries, and made a assessment that it can be characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients. Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients.</p> <p>According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care. During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply. So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists' confidence in fighting the epidemic. For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19. Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally. The hospital pharmacy department timely adjusted the work mode, and the formed management practices is a powerful guarantee for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. This paper summarized the details and practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical services management to provide experience for the people who involving in COVID-19 prevention and contain in other abroad epidemic areas.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0010">An outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) began in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019.<a href="#bib1"><sup>1</sup></a>According to the <i>Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases Law of P.R. China</i>, COVID-19 was classified as class B infectious disease, and measures had been taken according to the prevention and control standards of class A infectious disease. COVID-19 was also managed in accordance with <i>Frontier Health and Quarantine Law of P.R. China</i>.<a href="#bib2"><sup>2</sup></a></p> <p id="p0015">The Third Hospital of Jilin University (THJU) is managed by China National Health Commission (CNHC) which is a large-scale Grade III-A hospital, with an annual outpatient service of about 1.84 million patients. The hospital was specified as the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province.<a href="#bib3"><sup>3</sup></a> During COVID-19 outbreak-period, the pressure of medical service has increased. Efficient pharmaceutical practices could provide support for responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.<a href="#bib4"><sup>4</sup></a> The Pharmaceutical Department of THJU has carried out a series of work in terms of drug supply and pharmaceutical service, which has provided effective support for prevention, control and treatments of COVID-19. As of March 31,2020, the mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 in THJU was 0%, the number of infected medical staff was nil.</p> <p id="p0020">The epidemic attracted the attention of the international communities and was declared the coronavirus a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. As of April 1,2020, a total of 823,626 confirmed cases had been reported in 202 countries outside China, including 40,598 deaths.<a href="#bib5"><sup>5</sup></a> It is necessary to share practices and experience about epidemic prevention and control. This paper summarized the practices of preventing and controlling COVID-19 in the pharmacy department of THJU to provide reference for those who are facing the same situation.</p> </div> <div class="practice1:man-management" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Practice1: man-management</div> <p id="p0025">In the global fight against the outbreak of COVID-19, countries(areas) are facing with medical staff management challenges:(1)insufficient medical staff, (2)physical and mental health,(3)limited COVID - 19 prevention and control training. </p><ul> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">(1)</span><p id="p0030">Emergency human resource mechanisms could ensure work quality and improve management efficiency.<a href="#bib6"><sup>6</sup></a> The Department of Pharmacy have developed a pharmaceutical personnel echelons system to guarantee sufficient personnel resource. The first team was composed of pharmacists with experiences in fighting against SARS, floods, earthquakes and other emergencies. The second team consisted of clinical pharmacists and laboratory pharmacists who had been responsible for drug supply and dispensing. The first team members were charged with the key responsibilities of advising and educating patients, maintaining a stable supply of pharmaceuticals, and guide suspected cases to fever clinic for screening as required. The second team members received epidemic prevention and control training, under the leadership of the first team members to carry out the work. Otherwise, the pharmaceutical department have selected pharmacists with rich working experience and strong professional abilities as candidates of Wuhan Medical Team.</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">(2)</span><p id="p0035">Physical and mental health</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="p0040">The COVID-19 outbroke during the Spring Festival---the Chinese traditional festival. Many pharmacists travelled and returned hometown at that time. The pharmacy department designated a pharmacist to take charge of focusing on the staffs' health status. Pharmacists initiatively reported their status every day, including travelled destinations, transportations, temperature, cough symptoms. If anyone came back from suspected epidemic areas was recommended to stay at home 14 days for observation. During an epidemic, false information and rumors can generate serious negative effects to staffs’ mental health, similar to the community prevention and control grid member measures,<a href="#bib7"><sup>7</sup></a> pharmacy department appointed grid emotion managers. Each grid member was responsible for providing emotional management advice and help them: a. Understand COVID-19 correctly; b. Accept the reality of the epidemic; c. Encourage the expression of emotions, guide pharmacists through reading, listening to music, sports and other ways to transfer emotions, to overcome depression, anxiety, insomnia, and distress. </p><ul> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">(3)</span><p id="p0045">Carrying out training.</p> </li> </ul> <p /> <p id="p0050">The training mode was mainly online learning, the contents included three aspects: a. Hospital isolation rules training, including: transfer routes, transfer vehicles and dedicated elevators for COVID-19 patients, as well as related medical waste signs. Drugs, patients and pharmacists should move along the designated routes, which help to reduce the risk of nosocomial infection and ensure the supply of drugs.<a href="#bib8"><sup>8</sup></a> b. Prevention training. Pharmacists must learn how to protect themselves from getting infected. A Systematic nosocomial infection prevention and control training have been provided for pharmacists, such as process of use and destruct hats, masks, protective clothing correctly. c. COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plans training. From January to now, the COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plans have been updated seven times and several diagnosis and treatment plans webinars have been organized. Through the training, pharmacists can master the isolation system, personal safety protection operation and latest treatment plans. Scientific human resource mechanisms, adequate personal protection and timely training can help employees stabilize the mood and enhance confidence in fighting against the epidemic.</p> <p id="p0055">By implementing the man-management guarantee practice, the pharmacology department of THJU has resolve the problem of insufficient medical staff, ensuring the physical and mental health of pharmacists and deepen understanding COVID - 19 prevention and control plans.</p> </div> <div class="practice2:drugsupplymanagement" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">3</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
