<p>The ECV 5 is a rare enterovirus strain as causative aseptic meningitis and its sequence information is not common in the previous publication, including genbank database. This report describes the first complete nucleotide sequence for an ECV 5 isolated in Korea. Previous work has shown that sequence identity between different ECV serotypes is relatively high for the 5'NCR sequence, moderate for the P2 and P3 regions, and lowest for the P1 region [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This was not the pattern that emerged when we compared the Korean ECV 5 isolate and the Noyce strain; rather, the 5'NCR and P2 regions had relatively low nucleotide sequence identities (&lt;81.8%), while the identities of the P1 and P3 regions were relatively high (&gt;84.5%). Amino acid sequences for the protein coding regions had much higher sequence identities (&gt;96.9%). Cleavage site variations have often been reported for VP2/VP3, VP3/VP1, and VP1/2A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, we were not surprised to find that, though conservation was observed at most sites, there had been a substitution (TY/GAâ†’TR/GA) at VP1/2A. There was about 20% genetic difference between prototype and the current widespread strain, and its difference was found at the cleavage site. Therefore, development and screening of antiviral drugs have to be focused on the object of the current epidemic strain.
