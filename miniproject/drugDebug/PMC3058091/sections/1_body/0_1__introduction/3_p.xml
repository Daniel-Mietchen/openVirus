<p>The ECV 5 genome contains approximately 7,500 nucleotide-long single-stranded RNA molecules with polarity and carries a small viral peptide (VPg) covalently attached to its 5' end. The 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the RNA is approximately 700 nt in length and is unusually long compared with the homologous region of cellular mRNA. The internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) was discovered in the 5' UTR of the HEVs. In these viruses, the IRES can fold to be a functional secondary RNA structure and drive translation initiation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The coding region encompasses a single open reading frame that encodes a polyprotein divided into three sub-regions, P1, P2, and P3. The P1 region encodes the genetic information of four structural proteins, VP4, VP2, VP3, and VP1. The non-structural proteins are encoded in the P2 (2A-2C) and P3 (3A-3D) regions. A short 3' UTR of approximately 100 nt separates the coding region from the poly (A) tail [
