<p>In this study, the molecular biological characteristics and genetic diversity of Korean ECV 5 that do not exist the using antiviral agents for it but widespread currently were analyzed through the complete nucleotide sequencing and compared with ECV 5 prototype strain (Noyce). We also selected 5 kinds of antiviral drugs (azidothymidine, acyclovir, amantadine, lamivudine, and ribavirin) that were used as inhibitors of other viruses and examined for anti-viral activity for Korean ECV 5.</p>
