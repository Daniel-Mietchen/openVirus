<p>Human enteroviruses (HEV) are RNA viruses from the Picornaviridae family. The 80 immunologically-distinct serotypes that are known to cause infections in humans can be grouped as follows: polioviruses (PV), echoviruses (ECV), coxsackieviruses A (CVA), coxsackieviruses B (CVB), and enterovirus (EV) types 68-71. These viruses are also classified genetically into five species (HEV-A to HEV-D and PVs). HEV-B group containing ECV 5 are CBV 1 to 6, CVA9, ECV 1 to ECV 7, ECV 9, ECV 11 to ECV 21, ECV 24 to ECV 27, ECV 29 to 33, EV 69, EV 73 [
