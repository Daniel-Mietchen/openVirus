<p>Vero cells were seeded into a 96-well culture plate at a concentration of 2 × 10
 <sup>4 </sup>cells per well. Next day, the medium was removed and the 96-well plates were replaced with media containing the serially diluted compounds, and the cells were further incubated for 48 hrs. The culture medium was removed and washed with 1 × PBS. The next step was conducted by antiviral activity assay described above. To calculate the CC
 <sub>50 </sub>values, the results were transformed to percentage of controls and the CC
 <sub>50 </sub>values were graphically obtained from the dose-response curves.
