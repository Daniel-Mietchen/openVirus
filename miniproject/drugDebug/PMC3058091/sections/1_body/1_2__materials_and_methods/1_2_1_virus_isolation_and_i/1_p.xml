<p>The Korean ECV 5 strain was isolated from cerebrospinal fluid sampled from a male patient with aseptic meningitis who had been admitted to the Department of Pediatrics at the Soonchunhyang University Cheonan Hospital, Korea, in June 2006. The sample was inoculated into Vero cells and then incubated at 37Â°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2 </sub>until the appearance of cytopathic effects (CPE) took place. The identification of the Korean isolate was verified by a Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) search in VP1 sequences; that is, the VP1 sequences of Korean isolate had the highest nucleotide similarity with ECV5 serotype strains [
