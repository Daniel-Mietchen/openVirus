<p>No signs of cytotoxicity were observed in Vero cells treated with any of the five antiviral drugs at a CC
 <sub>50 </sub>value &gt;100 μg/mL. Amantadine and ribavirin exhibited antiviral activity against the Korean ECV 5 strain, though azidothymidine, acyclovir, and lamivudine did not. The amantadine possessed an IC
 <sub>50 </sub>value of 1 ± 0.42 μg/mL and a TI value of 100, while the ribavirin possessed an IC
 <sub>50 </sub>value of 22 ± 1.36 μg/mL and a TI value of 4.55 (Table
