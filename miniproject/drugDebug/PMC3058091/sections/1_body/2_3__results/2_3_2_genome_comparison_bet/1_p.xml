<p>The Korean ECV 5 isolate genome was divided into five regions (5'NCR, P1, P2, P3, and 3'NCR) and aligned with the Noyce strain using Megalign (DNASTAR). The P1 region (85.3%) had the highest level of nucleotide identity, followed by the P3 region (84.8%), the 3'NCR (84.5%), the 5'NCR (81.8%), and the P2 region (80.0%). The P3 region (98.0%) had the highest level of amino acid identity, followed by the P1 region (97.7%), and the P2 region (96.9%).</p>
