<p>Direct acting antivirals cure hepatitis C in &gt;90% of all patients. People who inject drugs (PWIDs) represent a relevant at-risk population for hepatitis C infection and transmission, yet treatment efficacy is often limited by poor adherence to clinical visits and drug intake. Our real world results showed that PWIDs with high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy receiving their hepatitis C medication together with opioid substitution under the direct supervision of medical staff achieve excellent HCV cure rates.</p>
