<p>In conclusion, our results underline the safety and the excellent efficacy of G/P in a large real world cohort of PWIDs with mostly ongoing IDU. The concept of tailored HCV therapy using DOT with DAA alongside OST may represent a key measure in order to contribute to the HCV elimination target in difficult-to-treat PWIDs on OST with a high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy.</p>
