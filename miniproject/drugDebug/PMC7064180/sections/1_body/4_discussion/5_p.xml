<p>We present results of a monocenter study including part of the Austrian PWIDs population: n = 74 PWIDs with suspected poor compliance out of about 6.500 PWIDs who live in Vienna and are included in the nationwide OST program were treated according to the DOT-concept. The outcome of these patients was compared to a cohort of patients with presumed excellent compliance (including 11 patients on OST) who were treated according to the SS of HCV care. The specific characterization of the real-world treatment outcome of G/P in difficult-to-treat PWIDs with and without ongoing IDU using the setting of DAA-DOT alongside OST represents the major strength of this study. Yet, the assignment of PWIDs to either DAA self-administration or to DOT with G/P at an OST distribution facility was based on subjective assessment of presumed compliance by the study physicians and therefore poses a potential limitation. Another limitation is that some patients did not attend their OST distribution facility on a daily basis but only once, twice or thrice a week and received their corresponding OST and DAA doses for interim self-administration, according to the subjective estimation of the study staff assessing the patientsâ€™ individual risk for non-adherence to therapy. Overall, this study focuses on PWIDs with an unfavorable prognosis assumed by ongoing IDU, previous imprisonment and unstable socioeconomic factors. The inclusion in an OST program was considered a positive prognostic factor and was used as a connecting point for HCV treatment. Aside from this PWIDs population that is already linked to care, a relevant number of PWIDs in Vienna perform IDU and are not included in an OST program, most of whom would not show compliant behavior concerning medical treatment. HCV infected patients belonging to this subgroup of "chaotic PWIDs" currently cannot be treated because a regular ingestion of drugs cannot be achieved.</p>
