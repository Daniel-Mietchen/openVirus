<p>In the DOT-group SVR12 was achieved in 70 of 74 patients, resulting in an SVR12 rate of 94.6% (95% CI: 86.7–98.5%) according to ITT analysis. Two patients were lost to FU. One patient died 16 weeks after end of therapy for reasons not related to treatment after showing a negative HCV-RNA PCR result three weeks after end of therapy. However, the patient had missed the visit 12 weeks after cessation of therapy. One patient with GT3 infection and fibrosis stage F0/F1 who was treated for eight weeks did not respond to therapy: In fact the HCV-RNA levels of this patient did not significantly change during therapy. This patient showed up at the assigned pharmacy on a daily basis, yet we assume that the oral OST (as well as the antiviral medication) was not swallowed in order for the OST to be injected intravenously outside the pharmacy later. Unfortunately, due to very poor compliance to clinical visits HCV resistance testing could not be performed. All four patients without SVR12 reported ongoing IDU. After exclusion of the two patients lost to FU and the patient who died, SVR12 rate according to mITT analysis was 98.6% (95% CI: 92.4–100.0%) (
