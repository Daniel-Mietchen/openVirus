<p>So far, in the DOT-group, after a median FU (IQR) of 26.0 (34.0) weeks, one reinfection was recorded 71 weeks after end of therapy. The presumed mode of infection was needle sharing with a friend. Yet, 28 patients did not show up at the 24 weeks follow-up visit, therefore we cannot exclude that some reinfections were missed.</p>
