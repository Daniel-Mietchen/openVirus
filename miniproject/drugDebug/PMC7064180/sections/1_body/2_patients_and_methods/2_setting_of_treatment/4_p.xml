<p>The assignment to the different treatment groups (SS vs. DOT) was made by an interdisciplinary team consisting of an experienced hepatologist (M.G.), three addiction medicine specialists and the head nurse of the institution. The decision was based on the assumed likelihood of each individual patient to remain adherent to DAA-therapy if a monthly supply was handed to them for self-administration at home, as perceived by each member of the team. Every patient was seen by the entire team and the assignment to either of the treatment groups was made following a discussion among all team members. The frequency of visits to the drug distributing facility (daily vs. once, twice or three times a week) was based on the preceding frequency of OST dispensation: In order to maintain the previously well-established setting of directly observed OST-distribution, no changes were made in the preexisting drug distribution settings. The rationale behind this approach was that patients would not forget the ingestion of their OST, which is why simultaneous DAA and OST administration might ensure DAA adherence and hence HCV cure.</p>
