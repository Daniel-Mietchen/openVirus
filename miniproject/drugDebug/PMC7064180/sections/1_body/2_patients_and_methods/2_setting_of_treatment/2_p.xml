<p>In a high percentage of PWIDs on OST, especially in those with ongoing intravenous drug use, the team of physicians considered it to be unlikely for the patients to regularly ingest their HCV medication if a package for one month was handed to them for self-administration at home. To optimize adherence, this subgroup of PWIDs was treated according to our concept of “directly observed therapy” (DOT): Patients received their antiviral therapy together with OST under direct observation of a pharmacist, physician or nurse at a pharmacy or at the Ambulatorium Suchthilfe Wien on a once-daily basis (i.e. from Monday to Saturday and only the doses for Sunday were handed to the patient for self-administration at home) or, in a few cases, on a once-weekly, twice-weekly or thrice-weekly basis (“directly observed therapy group”).</p>
