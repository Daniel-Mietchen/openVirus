<p>The primary endpoint of this study was SVR as defined by an HCV-RNA level &lt;15 IU/ml 12 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR12). SVR12 rates were calculated for the intention-to-treat (ITT) population (including all patients who received at least one dose of antiviral medication) as well as for the modified ITT (mITT) population, defined as the ITT population excluding patients who did not achieve SVR12 for reasons other than virological failure; i.e. patients lost to FU and patients who died for reasons not related to therapy prior to SVR12. However, patients with poor compliance, who missed ingestion of their antiviral therapy on one or more days but were not lost to FU were included in the mITT analysis.</p>
