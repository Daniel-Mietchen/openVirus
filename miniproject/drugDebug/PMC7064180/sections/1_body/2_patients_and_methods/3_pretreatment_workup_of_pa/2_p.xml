<p>Serum HCV-RNA was measured using the COBAS TaqMan HCV Quantitative Test, version 2.0 (Roche), with a lower limit of quantification of 15 IU/mL. The HCV GT and subtype were determined by use of the VERSANT HCV Genotype 2.0 Assay (Siemens). Prior to treatment, fibrosis stage was assessed by transient elastography using the Fibroscan
 <sup>®</sup> 502 Touch device with the M-probe (Echosens, Paris, France) and classified according to the METAVIR scoring system (F0 = no fibrosis; F1 = portal fibrosis without septa; F2 = portal fibrosis and few septa; F3 = numerous septa without cirrhosis; F4 = cirrhosis). Cut-off values for liver stiffness (LS) were defined as 7.1 kPa for F ≥ 2, 9.5 kPa for F ≥ 3 and 12.5 kPa for F = 4[
