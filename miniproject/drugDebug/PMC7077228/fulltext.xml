New and effective anti-IAV drugs, especially for highly pathogenic influenza, with different modes of action, are urgently needed. The influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) plays critical roles in the early stage of virus infection, including receptor binding and membrane fusion, making it a potential target for the development of anti-influenza drugs. In this study, we show that OA-10, a newly synthesized triterpene out of 11 oleanane-type derivatives, exhibited significant antiviral activity against four different subtypes of IAV (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 and H3N2) replications in A549 cell cultures with EC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 6.7 to 19.6 &#x003bc;M and a negligible cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e; 640 &#x003bc;M). It inhibited acid-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 26 &#x000b5;M, and had a weak inhibition on the adsorption of H5 HA to chicken erythrocytes at higher concentrations (&#x02265;40 &#x000b5;M). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that OA-10 interacted with HA in a dose-dependent manner with the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of the interaction of 2.98 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> M. Computer-aided molecular docking analysis suggested that OA-10 might bind to the cavity in HA stem region which is known to undergo significant rearrangement during membrane fusion. Our results demonstrate that OA-10 inhibits H5N1 IAV replication mainly by blocking the conformational changes of HA2 subunit required for virus fusion with endosomal membrane. These findings suggest that OA-10 could serve as a lead for further development of novel virus entry inhibitors to prevent and treat IAV infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>oleanane-type derivatives</kwd><kwd>influenza A virus (IAV)</kwd><kwd>virus entry inhibitors</kwd><kwd>hemagglutinin (HA)</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-viruses-12-00225"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV), the causative agent of influenza, is a major pathogen that causes public health problem and socioeconomic burden world-wide. With waterfowl as the primary reservoir, the virus is able to infect a wide variety of birds and mammals, including humans. Due to this trait, zoonotic spillovers occur occasionally and can lead to pandemics with severe consequences for the human population [<xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The avian-origin H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes of influenza viruses are recent examples of animal viruses that acquired the potential to infect and cause disease in humans. H5N1 IAV are often highly pathogenic (HP) avian influenza viruses. In 1997 in Hongkong, six people died out of 18 confirmed human cases with HP H5N1 virus infection [<xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. In 2003, novel H5N1 IAV genetic variants circulated in Southeast Asian countries, which led innumerable poultry to death and caused sporadic human infections in the following years. By the end of 2017, 860 laboratory confirmed cases of H5N1 IAV infection from 16 different countries, resulting in 454 deaths, had been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Influenza A viruses mutate easily because of their segmented RNA genome, making it difficult to produce a timely and sufficiently effective vaccine to prevent the potential epidemic outbreaks. Therefore, using anti-influenza agents could be a more efficient approach for prevention and treatment at the beginning of outbreak. To date, two types of anti-influenza drugs have been approved. One type pertains to the M2 ion channel inhibitors, including amantadine and rimantadine, which block the release of viral RNA into the cytoplasm [<xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The others are neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, including zanamivir, oseltamivir and peramivir, which prevent progeny virus from being released by their host cells [<xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, it has been reported that most of the circulating IAV strains are resistant to M2 inhibitors and may rapidly develop resistance to NA inhibitors, which limits the use of those licensed drugs [<xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is urgently required to develop novel anti-influenza agents preferentially with novel mechanisms of action to combat influenza, especially the HP influenza.</p><p>The first and most critical step of IAV infection is viral entry mediated by the interaction of viral envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) and its receptor on host cell surface [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HA forms a trimer including three HA1 and three HA2 subunits. Each HA2 contains a fusion peptide, a soluble ectodomain (SE) and a transmembrane domain [<xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After binding to receptor through HA1, IAV is endocytosed. Within the endosome, increasing acidity, pH 5&#x02013;6, induces HA2 to undergo an irreversible conformational change, leading to the fusion peptide extruding toward the endosomal membrane, and ultimately fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes [<xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HA2, as a major component of the stem region of HA, is a highly conserved subunit. Consequently, blocking HA2&#x02032;s conformational change could abolish viral membrane fusion and infection. Hence, HA2 is considered an attractive antiviral target [<xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The first discovered compound of this class was tertiary butylhydroquinone [<xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Later, several compounds that act in a similar way were described: BMY-27709, CL-385319, stachyflin and 4c [<xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, these small molecular compounds were reported to display inhibitory effects on H1, H2 and H3 IAV subtypes rather than H5 subtype. Recently, guided by structural knowledge on the interactions of HA and anti-stem broadly neutralizing antibodies, Maria and colleagues successfully developed a small molecule JNJ4796 with the ability to inhibit HA-mediated fusion and protect mice against lethal and sublethal influenza challenges [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The potent anti-IAV activity of JNJ4796 further reinforces that HA2 could be a promising drug target for blocking IAV infection.</p><p>Pentacyclic triterpenoids (PTs), an abundant natural product in plants, have received considerable attention due to their wide spectrum of antiviral activities against various viruses, such as HIV, IAV and HCV [<xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and some are already marketed as therapeutic agents or dietary supplements. For example, glycyrrhizin (glycyrrhizic acid) has been used for treating chronic hepatic diseases for over 40 years in China and Japan clinically.</p><p>Oleanane acid (OA) triterpene is probably the most well-known member of PTs with noticeable antiviral activities. Echinocystic acid (EA), an oleanane-type triterpene, was reported to have substantial inhibitory activity on HCV entry with EC<sub>50</sub> at nanomolar range [<xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Zhou reported that a different chemical modification to the C-17-COOH of OA led to Y3 (an OA-acetyl galactose conjugate), which showed strong antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV infections in vitro [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Further study indicated that Y3 was able to bind tightly to HA protein, thereby disrupting the interaction of HA with its sialic acid receptor [<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our previous study, we used an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system to screen a semisynthetic saponin library, and discovered that OA saponins with <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-chacotriosyl residue at the C-3-OH of OA exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against H5N1 IAV entry [<xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on this finding, we further designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of 3-O-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-chacotriosyl oleanolic acid analogs as H5N1 IAV entry inhibitors. We found that the introduction of a disubstituted amide structure at the 17-COOH of OA could significantly improve the selective index while maintaining their antiviral activities in vitro [<xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, as the previous antiviral evaluation of 3-O-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-chacotriosyl oleanolic acid analogs was based on a pseudotyping system, their inhibitory effects on IAV and mechanisms of action are unconfirmed. In the present study, antiviral activities of OA and its eleven analogs, including four newly synthesized derivatives, against H5N1 virus in A549 cells, were investigated, and their mechanisms of action and antiviral activities against other IAV subtypes based on a representative novel compound OA-10 were further investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first report on anti H5N1 IAV activity of OA derivatives.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-viruses-12-00225"><title>2.

Oleanolic acid was purchased from Chengdu Gelipu Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Chengdu, China).

Hydrogenolysis of the above oleanolic acid benzyl ester saponins over palladium/carbon in THF-MeOH led to OA-9 and 3-O-<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-chacotriosyl oleanolic acid, was carried out to furnish OA-10 or OA-11 by four consecutive acetylation, acyl chlorination, amide condensation reaction and alkaline hydrolysis, respectively. The purities of all oleanane-type triterpenoids were &#x02265;98% by HPLC analysis. Ribavirin hydrochloride was purchased from Guangdong Starlake Bioscience Co. Ltd.

OA-10 Interferes with Virus Entry</title><p>To identify the OA-10 affected stage(s) during an influenza infection cycle, we first performed a virus binding (attachment) assay by coculture A549 cells with IAV at 4 &#x000b0;C to permit attachment yet avoid viral entry in the presence or absence of OA-10. The co-incubation of 80 &#x003bc;M OA-10 with H5N1 IAV at 4 &#x000b0;C for 1 h followed by removal of excess virus and 37 &#x000b0;C culture did not affect IAV infection (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S3</xref>), indicating that OA-10 does not affect IVA binding to cells and also does not directly inactivate IAV particles. We next performed time course studies for the inhibitory effects of OA-10. A549 cells were treated with OA-10 for 2 h prior to virus infection (pre-treatment), or for 1 h during the viral infection (co-treatment), or for 24 h after 1 h virus infection and removal (post-treatment), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>A. Results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;D show that pre-treatment of 80 &#x003bc;M OA-10 did not reduce progeny virus yield and viral NP production. This result indicates that OA-10 does not impair the susceptibility of A549 cells to IAV infection. When cells were incubated with H5N1 IAV in the presence of 80 &#x003bc;M OA-10 for 1 h (co-treatment), a mild but significant reduction in progeny virus yield as well as NP protein expression was observed. This result indicates that OA-10 likely interacts with the virus early during the infection cycle. When cells were treated with 80 &#x003bc;M OA-10 for 24 h post H5N1 IAV infection (post-treatment), one log reduction in progeny virus yield was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>B), which was also reflected by decreased NP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). This result is consistent with the above results and further indicates that OA-10 likely exerts its antiviral effects during virus entry. In these assays, 15 &#x003bc;M peramivir exhibited more significant inhibition on H5N1 IAV&#x02019;s replication in both co-treatment and post-treatment modes, while 30 &#x003bc;M ribavirin exhibited inhibition only in the post-treatment mode, and its inhibition was significantly weaker than that of peramivir. In addition, the combination of 40 &#x003bc;M OA-10 and 15 &#x003bc;M ribavirin treatment showed a synergistic effect on reducing progeny virus titer and NP production, suggesting their complimentary inhibiting mechanisms against IAV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>B&#x02013;D).</p><p>It was estimated that from IAV entering into a cell to producing its progeny takes on average 6&#x02013;8 h, depending on cell type [<xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To identify the exact stage(s) affected by OA-10 during such a IAV replication cycle, we treated the infected cells with OA-10 at four separate 2 h time intervals (0&#x02013;2, 2&#x02013;4, 4&#x02013;6 or 6&#x02013;8, and 0&#x02013;8 h as a control) and monitored viral NP RNA and protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>B, a more significant inhibition of viral replication, as represented by decreased viral NP RNA level, was observed when OA-10 was added to the A549 cells during 0&#x02013;2 and 2&#x02013;4 hpi. A similar profile was also observed in viral NP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). These results again indicate that OA-10 exerts its effect during the early stages of IAV infection; i.e., virus internalization, endosome fusion, RNA release and replication. Ribavirin inhibits viral RNA synthesis. As expected, it exerted better IAV inhibition when added to the infected A549 cells before 4 hpi and showed no inhibition when added after 4 hpi. On the other hand, peramivir blocks progeny virus release from infected cells, and did not exhibit any inhibition of either viral RNA synthesis or NP protein expression during a single infection cycle in this assay, although its antiviral activity was the most remarkable, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>, when multiple infection cycles were studied.</p></sec><sec id="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00225"><title>3.3.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the modeled structure of HA complexed with OA-10 indicated that C2-OH and C3-OH of the L-rhamnose moiety linked to C2-OH of D-glucose were positioned within appropriate distance (2.46 &#x000c5;, 1.99 &#x000c5; and 2.18 &#x000c5;) to make three strong hydrogen bonds with Gly20 and Val18 in HA2, respectively.

Discussion</title><p>In the present study, OA-10, a newly synthesized oleanane-type triterpene, exhibits significant antiviral activity against highly pathogenic H5N1 IAV replication with an EC<sub>50</sub> of 14.0 &#x003bc;M in A549 cell cultures. The in vitro cytotoxicity of OA-10 is quite low, with a CC<sub>50</sub> of more than 640 &#x003bc;M and a selective index of more than 45. OA-10 also exhibits similar inhibitory effect on other IAV subtypes including PR8, H3N2 and H9N2, with EC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 6.7 to 19.6 &#x003bc;M. The time course inhibition study indicates that OA-10 exerts its antiviral effect during early stages of viral infection post binding to cell surface receptors. SPR analyses demonstrate that OA-10 interacts with HA protein strongly. The inhibition of OA-10 on H5N1 IAV induced hemolysis of chicken RBCs at low pH confirms interaction of OA-10 with HA subunit HA2. Furthermore, computer-aided molecular docking analysis suggested that OA-10 might bind to the interface of HA1 and HA2 in the HA stem region, which was known to undergo significant rearrangement during membrane fusion [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>One IAV replication cycle is orderly composed of virus binding, internalization, RNA replication and viral protein synthesis, assembly, budding and release from infected cells [<xref rid="B38-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Through the time course inhibition experiments, we found that OA-10 inhibited IAV replication in the co- and post-treatment modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>), but was unable to block IAV binding to A549 cells (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S3</xref>). To identify the exact stage(s) of IAV replication cycle affected by OA-10, we investigated the time course inhibition within one IAV lifecycle and found that OA-10 exerted its effect during the early stages of IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>). During this stage, IAV attachment to target cells is mediated by HA1 via sialic acid-receptor binding, and subsequent virus-endosome membrane fusion is mediated by rearrangement of HA2 at low pH. Our results showed that OA-10 did not block IAV binding to cells at 4 &#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S3</xref>). In addition, OA-10 did not inhibit IAV adsorption to chicken RBCs at concentrations of 10 and 20 &#x000b5;M, in spite of the fact that non-classical hemagglutination inhibitions of OA-10 at 40 and 80 &#x000b5;M were observed. These results suggest that the HA1 receptor binding domain is likely not a main target. Given that OA-10 exhibited antiviral activity during early stage(s) of IAV infection cycle, we speculated that OA-10 might target the membrane fusion step mediated by the more conserved hemagglutinin transmembrane subunit HA2. This hypothesis was confirmed by the activity of blocking hemolysis of OA-10 in a low pH environment in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f005">Figure 5</xref>C), as hemolysis is mediated by HA2 rather than HA1 [<xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the binding intensity of OA-10 with HA, SPR analyses were conducted. SPR data showed that OA-10 interacted with HA strongly with KD of 2.98 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup> M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f005">Figure 5</xref>B), which was consistent with its potent hemolysis inhibition at low pH. To study the possible binding site, docking simulation analyses were performed, by which a highly conserved hydrophobic cavity at the HA1-HA2 interface in the HA stem region was identified as the possible binding site of OA-10. The binding cavity is formed by residues of the two HA subunits, including Gly20, Val18, Trp21, Lys38 and Ile45 in HA2, and His38 in HA1, which was previously reported to be one of the critical regions responsible for the conformational changes in HA2 at low pH [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, this region is recognized by an antibody with a broad-spectrum neutralizing ability to avian and human influenza A viruses [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; thus, it could serve as a potential drug target for developing IAV entry inhibitors. Indeed, our data indicated that OA-10 might bind to this cavity through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interaction.</p><p>Influenza A viruses have been classified into 18 hemagglutinin subtypes (H1 to H18), which can be divided phylogenetically into two groups (1 and 2). H1, H5 and H9 belong to Group 1 HA of IAV, while H3 belongs to Group 2 HA of IAV [<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is known that the amino acid sequence identities of the HA2 portion between different HA subtypes are much higher than those of the full-length HA proteins [<xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which makes HA2 an attractive target for developing broad-spectrum therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs. In fact, several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against IAV conserved HA stem have been developed, and their broad protection against IAV infection has been demonstrated in clinical trials. One such examples is the antibody CR6261 for most group 1 IAV subtypes [<xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, guided by structural knowledge on the interactions of HA and anti-stem bnAb CR6261, a small molecule JNJ4796 that mimics the bnAb functionality with the ability to inhibit HA-mediated fusion was successfully developed. Importantly, this compound demonstrated potent antiviral activities against H1 and H5 strains in vitro and in vivo [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but not group 2 IAVs such as H3 and H7 subtypes [<xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An OA derivative Y3 was reported to have significant antiviral activity in vitro against H3 and H1, suggesting broad-spectrum inhibitions of OA derivatives against both Group 1 and Group 2 IAVs.[<xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Further, HR2 in influenza HA2 was recently shown to be the target domain for Y3 [<xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the present study, we show that OA-10 has promising antiviral activities against four IAV subtypes, including H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 (Group 1 IAVs) and H3N2 (Group 2 IAV), further demonstrating the potential of OA derivatives as broad-spectrum IAV entry inhibitors. To our knowledge, this is the first reported antiviral activity of OA derivatives against H5N1 IAV infection. Further in vivo studies will be carried out to clarify the efficacy of OA-10 as an IAV entry inhibitor in animals.</p><p>Another potential advantage of OA-10&#x02032;s antiviral activity is its synergistic inhibition on viral replication when used together with ribavirin, a broad-spectrum virus RNA polymerase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Such synergy was likely the result of the simultaneous disruption of HA-mediated viral entry by OA-10 (earlier step) and polymerase-mediated RNA replication by ribavirin (later step). It is expected that using an inhibitor like OA-10 together with ribavirin or NA inhibitors would not only enhance antiviral effects against IAV infection, but also prevent or significantly delay drug resistance.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that OA-10, a novel synthesized oleanane-type triterpenoid, inhibits four different IAV subtypes, including Group 1 H1N1 (PR8), H5N1 and H9N2, and Group 2 H3N2 infections with potent activity and negligible cytotoxicity in A549 cells. Mechanically, OA-10 blocks the conformational changes of the HA2 subunit at the low pH required for IAV to fuse with an endosomal membrane. These effects are attributed to a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the HA stem region as the likely binding site of OA-10. It could serve as a lead for optimization in order to design novel compounds with improved antiviral potency. OA-10 and its derivatives hold promise to be developed as broad-spectrum anti-influenza drugs.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="app1-viruses-12-00225"><title>Supplementary Materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="viruses-12-00225-s001"><media xlink:href="viruses-12-00225-s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><p>The following are available online at <uri xlink:href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/2/225/s1">https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/12/2/225/s1</uri>: Figure S1: Chemical structures of oleanane acid (OA-0) and its 11 derivatives.
