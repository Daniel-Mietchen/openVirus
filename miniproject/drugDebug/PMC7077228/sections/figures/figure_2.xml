  <p>OA-10 inhibited H5N1 IAV infection in A549 cells. A549 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with H5N1 IAV (0.1 MOI) for 1 h, and then cultured in fresh medium containing various concentrations of OA-10 or 15 µM peramivir. At 48 hpi (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) or indicated time-points post infection (
   <bold>C</bold>,
   <bold>D</bold>), cells and supernatants of each well were mixed and subjected to viral titer or RT-PCR analysis. H5N1 IAV expression of GAPDH was used as a loading control, and a DMSO-treated sample (H5N1 IAV infected and non-drug treated) at 48 hpi was used as treatment control (set as 1). Data are presented as means ± SDs of results from three independent experiments. *
