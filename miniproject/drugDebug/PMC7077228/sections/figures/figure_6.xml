 <caption>
  <p>Structural model of OA-10 binding site in H5 HA. (
   <bold>A</bold>) CR6261 antibody binding site surface. The modeling was based on the published crystal structure of the A/Vietnam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (PDB: 6CFG). HA1 and HA2 regions are highlighted in green and blue, respectively. Compound OA-10 is shown as yellow sticks. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Modeled structure of HA complexed with OA-10. Green lines represent hydrogen bond interaction, with the distances indicated; and pink lines represent hydrophobic interaction between OA-10 and HA.
