 <caption> OA-10 exhibited inhibition on H5N1 IAV replication in co- and post-treatment modes. A549 cells grown in 24-well plates were treated with indicated compounds for 2 h prior to virus infection (pre-treatment), or for 1 h during viral infection (co-treatment), or for 24 h after 1 h virus infection and removal (post-treatment) ( A). For three treatment models, 0.1 MOI of H5N1 IAV was used for infecting cells for 1 h. At 24 hpi, supernatants were collected for determining virus titer using the end point dilution assay ( B), and the cells were subjected to viral NP protein analysis using IFA ( C, D). Results shown in ( D) are normalized NP protein levels based on the fluorescence optical densities (OD) of the images from three independent experiments. Software Image J was used to digitize image OD. Results from OA-10 or peramivir or ribavirin treated samples were compared to those from corresponding DMSO-treated control groups (set as 100%) ( D). Representative IFA images of the three independent experiments are shown in C. Scale bar: 250 Âµm. * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01 and *** P &lt; 0.001 compared to the respective virus (DMSO-treated) control. </caption>
