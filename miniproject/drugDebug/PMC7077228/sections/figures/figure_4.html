 <caption> OA-10 inhibits H5N1 IAV replication by targeting the earlier stage(s) of the viral infection cycle. A549 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with 1.0 MOI of H5N1 IAV for 1 h. After two washes with PBS, OA-10 or ribavirin or peramivir was added at the indicated time points and removed after 2 h or 8 h. After each incubation period, the cells were incubated in fresh medium, harvested at 8 hpi and NP mRNA and protein analyzed by RT-PCR and IFA, respectively. ( A) The experimental design of time-of-addition assay. ( B) Relative virus NP mRNA level. ( C, D) Viral NP protein expression, representative IFA images ( C) and digitized NP expression ( D) from three independent experiments. Scale bar: 250 Âµm. * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01 and *** P &lt; 0.001 compared to the respective virus control. </caption>
