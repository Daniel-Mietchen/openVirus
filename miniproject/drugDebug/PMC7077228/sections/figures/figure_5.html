 <caption> HA is a potential target of OA-10. ( A) Comparisons of the behaviors of OA-10 vs. antisera against H5 HA in inhibition of H5N1 IAV-induced aggregation of chicken RBCs. OA-10 partially blocked H5N1 virus adsorption to chicken RBCs at concentrations ≥40 µM. ( B) Characterization of the affinity between OA-10 and HA protein using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. ( C) Inhibition of OA-10 on HA-mediated chicken RBCs hemolysis using arbidol as the positive control. </caption>
