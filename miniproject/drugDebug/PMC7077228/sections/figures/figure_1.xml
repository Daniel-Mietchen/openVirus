  <p>OA-10 inhibited H5N1 IAV replication in A549 cells with minimal cytotoxicity. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of OA-10. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Antiviral activity of OA-10 against H5N1 IAV infection. Confluent A549 cells grown in 96-well plates were infected with H5N1 IAV (0.1 MOI) for 1 h at 37 °C and then cultured in fresh medium containing various concentrations of OA-10 or 15 µM peramivir (Per). At 24 hpi, the cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde and the viral NP expression was detected by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Representative IFA images from three independent experiments are shown. Scale bar: 250 µm. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Cytotoxicity of OA-10 in A549 cells. The results are expressed as percentages (%) of mock treated cells.
