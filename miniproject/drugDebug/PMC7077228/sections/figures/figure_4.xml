  <p>OA-10 inhibits H5N1 IAV replication by targeting the earlier stage(s) of the viral infection cycle. A549 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with 1.0 MOI of H5N1 IAV for 1 h. After two washes with PBS, OA-10 or ribavirin or peramivir was added at the indicated time points and removed after 2 h or 8 h. After each incubation period, the cells were incubated in fresh medium, harvested at 8 hpi and NP mRNA and protein analyzed by RT-PCR and IFA, respectively. (
