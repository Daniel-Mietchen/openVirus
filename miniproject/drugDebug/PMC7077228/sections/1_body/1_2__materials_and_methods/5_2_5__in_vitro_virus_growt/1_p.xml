<p>A549 monolayers were infected with the virus for 1 h. Supernatants were removed, and cells were then incubated with DMEM containing serial concentrations of test compound. Cells and supernatants were collected at indicated time points post-infection and in total subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles at −80 °C and 4 °C to ensure maximal release of cellular virions [
