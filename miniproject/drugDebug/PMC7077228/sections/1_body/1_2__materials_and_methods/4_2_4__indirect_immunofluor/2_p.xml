<p>Relative NP protein level (%) of each image was calculated based on the fluorescence optical density (OD) using Software Image J. Results from compound-treated samples were compared to those from corresponding DMSO-treated control groups (set as 100%). The EC
 <sub>50</sub> value (the concentration required to protect 50% cells from IAV infection) was determined by plotting the relative NP protein level as a function of compound concentration and calculated using GraphPad Prism 7.0 software (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
