<p>To estimate the influence of OA-10 on the IAV replication cycle, A549 cells were grown in 24-well plates to confluence and then infected with H5N1 IAV (0.1 MOI) for 1 h at 37 °C. OA-10 or ribavirin or peramivir was added before, during or after IAV infection. For pretreatment, cells were incubated with the indicated compound for 2 h at 37 °C, followed by three washes with PBS and then infected with H5N1 IAV for 1 h. For co-treatment, cells were simultaneously incubated with H5N1 IAV and the compound. After 1 h, the virus–drug mixture was removed, and the cells were washed three times with PBS before fresh medium was added. For post-treatment, cells were first infected with H5N1 IAV for 1 h followed by three washes with PBS and then incubated in the fresh medium containing the compound. At 24 hpi, progeny viruses in the supernatants were determined by an end point dilution assay and the extent of virus infection in the cells was assessed by IFA for NP protein, respectively.</p>
