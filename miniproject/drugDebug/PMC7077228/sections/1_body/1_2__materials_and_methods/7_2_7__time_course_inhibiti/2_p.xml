<p>To determine the specific stage(s) of the viral life cycle affected by OA-10, a time-of-addition assay was performed as described by Luo et al. [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, confluent monolayers of A549 cells grown in 24-well plates were infected with H5N1 IAV (1.0 MOI) for 1 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed three times with PBS to remove unbound viruses and incubated in fresh medium. In total, 80 µM of OA-10 or ribavirin or peramivir was then added for 0 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 6, 6 to 8 h or 0 to 8 hpi. After each incubation period, the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with fresh medium at 37 °C. At 8 hpi, the cells were subjected to viral NP protein analysis using IFA and viral mRNA analysis using RT-PCR, respectively.
