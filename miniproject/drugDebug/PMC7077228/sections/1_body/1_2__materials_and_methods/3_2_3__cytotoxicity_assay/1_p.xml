<p>The cytotoxicity of tested compounds was evaluated using a MTT assay as described previously by Luo [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, cells were grown in 96-well plates for 24 h. The medium was replaced with fresh one containing serially diluted compounds and the cells were further incubated for 24 h, 48 h or 72 h. The culture medium was removed and replaced with 100 µL 3-(4,5-dimethylthiozol-2-yl)-3,5-dipheryl tetrazolium bromide (MTT; Sigma-Aldrich, MA, USA) solution (1 mg/mL in PBS) and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. After removal of the supernatant, 150 µL of DMSO was added to all of the wells to dissolve the formazan crystals for 10 min at 37 °C. Cell viability was then measured as the absorbance at 490 nm with a microplate reader (Thermo fisher scientific, MA, USA) and expressed as a percentage of the control level. The mean optical density (OD) values from six replicated wells per treatment were used as the cell viability index. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated by GraphPad Prism 7.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA).
