<p>Total RNA was extracted from cells or mixtures of cells and supernatants using the total RNA rapid extraction kit (Fastagen, Shanghai, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA was reverse-transcribed into first-strand cDNA using a reverse transcription kit (TaKaRa, Japan). PCR amplification was performed using 1 μL of reverse-transcribed product with primers designed for IAV-NP and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, used as the endogenous control). The primers used for PCR amplification are listed in
