<p>The first and most critical step of IAV infection is viral entry mediated by the interaction of viral envelope protein hemagglutinin (HA) and its receptor on host cell surface [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HA forms a trimer including three HA1 and three HA2 subunits. Each HA2 contains a fusion peptide, a soluble ectodomain (SE) and a transmembrane domain [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. After binding to receptor through HA1, IAV is endocytosed. Within the endosome, increasing acidity, pH 5–6, induces HA2 to undergo an irreversible conformational change, leading to the fusion peptide extruding toward the endosomal membrane, and ultimately fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. HA2, as a major component of the stem region of HA, is a highly conserved subunit. Consequently, blocking HA2′s conformational change could abolish viral membrane fusion and infection. Hence, HA2 is considered an attractive antiviral target [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The first discovered compound of this class was tertiary butylhydroquinone [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Later, several compounds that act in a similar way were described: BMY-27709, CL-385319, stachyflin and 4c [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, these small molecular compounds were reported to display inhibitory effects on H1, H2 and H3 IAV subtypes rather than H5 subtype. Recently, guided by structural knowledge on the interactions of HA and anti-stem broadly neutralizing antibodies, Maria and colleagues successfully developed a small molecule JNJ4796 with the ability to inhibit HA-mediated fusion and protect mice against lethal and sublethal influenza challenges [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The potent anti-IAV activity of JNJ4796 further reinforces that HA2 could be a promising drug target for blocking IAV infection.
