<p>Oleanane acid (OA) triterpene is probably the most well-known member of PTs with noticeable antiviral activities. Echinocystic acid (EA), an oleanane-type triterpene, was reported to have substantial inhibitory activity on HCV entry with EC
 <sub>50</sub> at nanomolar range [

 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Zhou reported that a different chemical modification to the C-17-COOH of OA led to Y3 (an OA-acetyl galactose conjugate), which showed strong antiviral activity against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV infections in vitro [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Further study indicated that Y3 was able to bind tightly to HA protein, thereby disrupting the interaction of HA with its sialic acid receptor [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our previous study, we used an efficient HIV-based pseudotyping system to screen a semisynthetic saponin library, and discovered that OA saponins with 
 <italic>β</italic>-chacotriosyl residue at the C-3-OH of OA exhibited excellent inhibitory activity against H5N1 IAV entry [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Based on this finding, we further designed, synthesized and evaluated a series of 3-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-chacotriosyl oleanolic acid analogs as H5N1 IAV entry inhibitors. We found that the introduction of a disubstituted amide structure at the 17-COOH of OA could significantly improve the selective index while maintaining their antiviral activities in vitro [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, as the previous antiviral evaluation of 3-O-
 <italic>β</italic>-chacotriosyl oleanolic acid analogs was based on a pseudotyping system, their inhibitory effects on IAV and mechanisms of action are unconfirmed. In the present study, antiviral activities of OA and its eleven analogs, including four newly synthesized derivatives, against H5N1 virus in A549 cells, were investigated, and their mechanisms of action and antiviral activities against other IAV subtypes based on a representative novel compound OA-10 were further investigated. To our knowledge, this is the first report on anti H5N1 IAV activity of OA derivatives.
