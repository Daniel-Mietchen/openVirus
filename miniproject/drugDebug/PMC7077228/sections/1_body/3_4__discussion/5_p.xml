<p>Another potential advantage of OA-10â€²s antiviral activity is its synergistic inhibition on viral replication when used together with ribavirin, a broad-spectrum virus RNA polymerase inhibitor (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Such synergy was likely the result of the simultaneous disruption of HA-mediated viral entry by OA-10 (earlier step) and polymerase-mediated RNA replication by ribavirin (later step). It is expected that using an inhibitor like OA-10 together with ribavirin or NA inhibitors would not only enhance antiviral effects against IAV infection, but also prevent or significantly delay drug resistance.
