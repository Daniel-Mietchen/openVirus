<p>Influenza A viruses have been classified into 18 hemagglutinin subtypes (H1 to H18), which can be divided phylogenetically into two groups (1 and 2). H1, H5 and H9 belong to Group 1 HA of IAV, while H3 belongs to Group 2 HA of IAV [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. It is known that the amino acid sequence identities of the HA2 portion between different HA subtypes are much higher than those of the full-length HA proteins [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], which makes HA2 an attractive target for developing broad-spectrum therapeutic antibodies and antiviral drugs. In fact, several broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) against IAV conserved HA stem have been developed, and their broad protection against IAV infection has been demonstrated in clinical trials. One such examples is the antibody CR6261 for most group 1 IAV subtypes [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Recently, guided by structural knowledge on the interactions of HA and anti-stem bnAb CR6261, a small molecule JNJ4796 that mimics the bnAb functionality with the ability to inhibit HA-mediated fusion was successfully developed. Importantly, this compound demonstrated potent antiviral activities against H1 and H5 strains in vitro and in vivo [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], but not group 2 IAVs such as H3 and H7 subtypes [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. An OA derivative Y3 was reported to have significant antiviral activity in vitro against H3 and H1, suggesting broad-spectrum inhibitions of OA derivatives against both Group 1 and Group 2 IAVs.[
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Further, HR2 in influenza HA2 was recently shown to be the target domain for Y3 [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. In the present study, we show that OA-10 has promising antiviral activities against four IAV subtypes, including H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 (Group 1 IAVs) and H3N2 (Group 2 IAV), further demonstrating the potential of OA derivatives as broad-spectrum IAV entry inhibitors. To our knowledge, this is the first reported antiviral activity of OA derivatives against H5N1 IAV infection. Further in vivo studies will be carried out to clarify the efficacy of OA-10 as an IAV entry inhibitor in animals.
