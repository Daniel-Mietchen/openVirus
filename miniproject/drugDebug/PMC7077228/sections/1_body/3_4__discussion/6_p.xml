<p>In summary, we demonstrate that OA-10, a novel synthesized oleanane-type triterpenoid, inhibits four different IAV subtypes, including Group 1 H1N1 (PR8), H5N1 and H9N2, and Group 2 H3N2 infections with potent activity and negligible cytotoxicity in A549 cells. Mechanically, OA-10 blocks the conformational changes of the HA2 subunit at the low pH required for IAV to fuse with an endosomal membrane. These effects are attributed to a conserved hydrophobic cavity in the HA stem region as the likely binding site of OA-10. It could serve as a lead for optimization in order to design novel compounds with improved antiviral potency. OA-10 and its derivatives hold promise to be developed as broad-spectrum anti-influenza drugs.</p>
