<p>In order to further understand the molecular basis of OA-10 interacting with HA, we performed docking experiments using CDOCKER protocol to predict the binding modes of OA-10 into the CR6261 antibody binding site which is a highly conserved hydrophobic groove at the HA1-HA2 interface in the HA stem region [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The docked conformation of OA-10 was determined based on the minimum CDOCKER interaction energy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f006">Figure 6</xref>, the modeled structure of HA complexed with OA-10 indicated that C2-OH and C3-OH of the L-rhamnose moiety linked to C2-OH of D-glucose were positioned within appropriate distance (2.46 Å, 1.99 Å and 2.18 Å) to make three strong hydrogen bonds with Gly20 and Val18 in HA2, respectively. Furthermore, C3-OH of D-glucose and the C2-OH of the L-rhamnose moiety linked to C4-OH of D-glucose formed hydrogen bonds with Asp19 and Gln42 with the distances 2.69 Å and 2.78 Å, respectively. In addition, oleanane scaffold also form numerous hydrophobic contacts with the HA1 residue (His38) and HA2 residues (Trp21, Lys38 and Ile45). According to docked conformation of OA-10, 3-O-
