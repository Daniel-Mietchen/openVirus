<p>To more accurately assess OA-10′s inhibitory role, we further examined its antiviral effects against H5N1 IAV infection using virus titration and RT-PCR at 48 hpi. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f002">Figure 2</xref>A, treatment with OA-10 resulted in a significant reduction of progeny virus titer in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with 80 μM of OA-10 led to a 1.8 log reduction in progeny virus production compared to that in DMSO-treated control. In fact, OA-10 at concentrations from 20 to 80 μM significantly inhibited H5N1 IAV NP RNA levels in A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f002">Figure 2</xref>B). We further studied the viral inhibition kinetics by OA-10 at 80 μM. In the H5N1 IAV-infected control, the levels of virus titer and virus mRNA expression increased continuously from 24 to 72 hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D). The addition of 80 μM OA-10 significantly reduced progeny virus titers and viral RNA levels at all time-points, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f002">Figure 2</xref>C,D. Simultaneously, treatment with OA-10 also reduced progeny virus titer on PR8, H9N2 and H3N2 infection, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner at 48 hpi, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S2B</xref>. Peramivir, a well-known neuraminidase inhibitor, was used as a positive antiviral drug control in this study. Our results showed that 15 μM of peramivir exhibited a significant inhibition on IAV infections in the same assays.
