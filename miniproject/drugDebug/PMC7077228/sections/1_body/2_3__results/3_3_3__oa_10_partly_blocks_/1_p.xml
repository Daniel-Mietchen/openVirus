<p>IAV is able to adsorb to chicken RBC, resulting in hemagglutination through the interaction of the receptor-binding domain in viral HA1 subunits with the sialic acid receptors on RBC membrane. To see whether HA is the potential target of OA-10, we questioned whether OA-10 could inhibit hemagglutination by interfering with H5 HA adsorption to RBC. OA-10 did not inhibit HA adsorption to chicken RBCs at concentrations of 10 and 20 µM. At the concentrations of OA-10 ≥ 40 µM, it was observed that a portion of RBCs settled to the bottom of the wells but the settled RBCs were not able to flow, as shown in

Meanwhile, OA-10 treatment did not affect RBC properties in the absence of H5 virus, and the positive control antisera against H5 hemagglutinin (Anti-H5) could effectively inhibit H5 HA adsorption to chicken RBCs with a titer at 1:16, and the settled RBCs could move when the plate was tilted (
