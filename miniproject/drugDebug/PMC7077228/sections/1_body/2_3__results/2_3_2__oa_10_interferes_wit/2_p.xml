<p>It was estimated that from IAV entering into a cell to producing its progeny takes on average 6–8 h, depending on cell type [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00225" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. To identify the exact stage(s) affected by OA-10 during such a IAV replication cycle, we treated the infected cells with OA-10 at four separate 2 h time intervals (0–2, 2–4, 4–6 or 6–8, and 0–8 h as a control) and monitored viral NP RNA and protein expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>A). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>B, a more significant inhibition of viral replication, as represented by decreased viral NP RNA level, was observed when OA-10 was added to the A549 cells during 0–2 and 2–4 hpi. A similar profile was also observed in viral NP expression (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f004">Figure 4</xref>C,D). These results again indicate that OA-10 exerts its effect during the early stages of IAV infection; i.e., virus internalization, endosome fusion, RNA release and replication. Ribavirin inhibits viral RNA synthesis. As expected, it exerted better IAV inhibition when added to the infected A549 cells before 4 hpi and showed no inhibition when added after 4 hpi. On the other hand, peramivir blocks progeny virus release from infected cells, and did not exhibit any inhibition of either viral RNA synthesis or NP protein expression during a single infection cycle in this assay, although its antiviral activity was the most remarkable, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>, when multiple infection cycles were studied.
