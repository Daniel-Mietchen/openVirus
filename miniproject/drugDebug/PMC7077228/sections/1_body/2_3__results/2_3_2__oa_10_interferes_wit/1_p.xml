<p>To identify the OA-10 affected stage(s) during an influenza infection cycle, we first performed a virus binding (attachment) assay by coculture A549 cells with IAV at 4 °C to permit attachment yet avoid viral entry in the presence or absence of OA-10. The co-incubation of 80 μM OA-10 with H5N1 IAV at 4 °C for 1 h followed by removal of excess virus and 37 °C culture did not affect IAV infection (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00225">Figure S3</xref>), indicating that OA-10 does not affect IVA binding to cells and also does not directly inactivate IAV particles. We next performed time course studies for the inhibitory effects of OA-10. A549 cells were treated with OA-10 for 2 h prior to virus infection (pre-treatment), or for 1 h during the viral infection (co-treatment), or for 24 h after 1 h virus infection and removal (post-treatment), as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>A. Results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>B–D show that pre-treatment of 80 μM OA-10 did not reduce progeny virus yield and viral NP production. This result indicates that OA-10 does not impair the susceptibility of A549 cells to IAV infection. When cells were incubated with H5N1 IAV in the presence of 80 μM OA-10 for 1 h (co-treatment), a mild but significant reduction in progeny virus yield as well as NP protein expression was observed. This result indicates that OA-10 likely interacts with the virus early during the infection cycle. When cells were treated with 80 μM OA-10 for 24 h post H5N1 IAV infection (post-treatment), one log reduction in progeny virus yield was observed (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00225-f003">Figure 3</xref>C,D). This result is consistent with the above results and further indicates that OA-10 likely exerts its antiviral effects during virus entry. In these assays, 15 μM peramivir exhibited more significant inhibition on H5N1 IAV’s replication in both co-treatment and post-treatment modes, while 30 μM ribavirin exhibited inhibition only in the post-treatment mode, and its inhibition was significantly weaker than that of peramivir. In addition, the combination of 40 μM OA-10 and 15 μM ribavirin treatment showed a synergistic effect on reducing progeny virus titer and NP production, suggesting their complimentary inhibiting mechanisms against IAV replication (
