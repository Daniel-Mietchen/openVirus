<p id="par0035">The Vero E6 cell monolayers were grown in 96-well plates and inoculated with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of coronavirus strains at 37 Â°C for 2 h. The inoculum was removed, and the cells were subsequently incubated with indicated concentrations of LH or the positive control remdesivir. Following the 72 h of incubation, the infected cells shown 100 % CPE under the microscope. The percentage of CPE in LH-treated cells were recorded. The 50 % inhibition concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of the virus-induced CPE by LH was calculated by the Reed-Muench method [
