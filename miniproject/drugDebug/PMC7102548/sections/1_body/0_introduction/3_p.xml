<p id="par0010">Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by zoonotic transmission likely from bats and spreads rapidly among humans [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The basic reproduction number (R0) of person-to-person spread is about at 2.6, which means that the SARS-CoV-2 infected cases grow at an exponential rate. As of February 07, 2020, 57,620 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, including 26,359 suspected cases, and a sustained increase is predictable. The initial patient cluster with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported Wuhan pneumonia with unknown aetiology, which bore some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Moreover, High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of patients requiring ICU admission, such as GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFÎ±, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A retrospective clinical study indicated the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases at 4.3 % in single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients [
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the infection fatality risk could be below 1% or even below 0.1 % in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, It is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences with the information available so far. Since no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, supportive cares, including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most critical therapeutic regimens, especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome [
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the control of SARS-CoV-2 still presents multiple challenges in the short term, more potent antiviral drugs are urgent to be developed [
