In addition to six known strains of coronaviruses that are infectious to humans, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected recently in Wuhan, China [<xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Like the other two highly pathogenic coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also caused severe respiratory illness and even death. Moreover, the population's susceptibility to these highly pathogenic coronaviruses has contributed to large outbreaks and evolved into the public health events, highlighting the necessity to prepare for future reemergence or the novel emerging viruses [<xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="par0010">Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is initiated by zoonotic transmission likely from bats and spreads rapidly among humans [<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The basic reproduction number (R0) of person-to-person spread is about at 2.6, which means that the SARS-CoV-2 infected cases grow at an exponential rate. As of February 07, 2020, 57,620 cases of the SARS-CoV-2 have been reported in China, including 26,359 suspected cases, and a sustained increase is predictable. The initial patient cluster with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported Wuhan pneumonia with unknown aetiology, which bore some resemblance to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections and was associated with ICU admission and high mortality. Moreover, High concentrations of cytokines were recorded in plasma of patients requiring ICU admission, such as GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF&#x003b1;, suggesting that the cytokine storm was associated with disease severity [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. A retrospective clinical study indicated the risk of fatality among hospitalized cases at 4.3 % in single-center case series of 138 hospitalized patients [<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the infection fatality risk could be below 1% or even below 0.1 % in a large number of undetected relatively mild infections [<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, It is challenging to judge the severity and predict the consequences with the information available so far. Since no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19 is currently available, supportive cares, including symptomatic controls and prevention of complications remain the most critical therapeutic regimens, especially in preventing acute respiratory distress syndrome [<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although the control of SARS-CoV-2 still presents multiple challenges in the short term, more potent antiviral drugs are urgent to be developed [<xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p id="par0015">At present, some drugs are effective in eliminating SARS-CoV-2 and improving symptoms. The most promising antiviral drug for SARS-CoV-2 is remdesivir that is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus infection [<xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, the efficacy and safety of remdesivir for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia patients need to be assessed by further clinical trials. In addition, in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, Tranditonal Chinese medicines have received broad adoption, especially in treating cases of mild symptoms [<xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Lianhuaqingwen (LH), a Chinese patent medicine composed of 13 herbs, has played a positive role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. A retrospective analysis of clinical records was conducted in the SARS-CoV-2 infected patients at Wuhan Ninth Hospital and CR &#x00026; WISCO General Hospital. LH combination could significantly relieve cardinal symptoms and reduce the course of the COVID-19 [<xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], making it successively included in the <italic>Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia (On Trials, the Fourth/Fifth/Sixth/Seventh Edition</italic>) issued by National Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China and also recommended by 20 provincial health commissions including Hubei, Beijing, and Shanghai as well as National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of COVID-19. Moreover, LH exerted broad-spectrum effects on a series of influenza viruses by inhibiting viral propagation and regulating immune function and achieved similar therapeutic effectiveness with Oseltamivir in reducing the course of H1N1 virus infection [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Notably, the anti-influenza activity of LH in infected mice might depend on the regulation of cytokines, particularly in cytokine storm associated cytokines, such as IP-10, MCP-1, MIP1A, and TNF-&#x003b1; [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>].

After the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, LH as a representative TCM prescription was recommended again in the latest Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Pneumonia issued by National Health Commission of the People&#x02019;s Republic of China The purpose of this study was to demonstrate whether the therapeutic effects of LH on the COVID-19 targeting virus replication and immunological regulation as it did on the infection caused by influenza viruses.</p><p id="par0085">Our previous study showed that LH exhibited in vitro anti-influenza activity with IC<sub>50</sub> ranging from 200 to 2000 &#x003bc;g/mL [<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Here we demonstrated that LH also has a comparable antiviral potency against the SARS-CoV-2 virus with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 411.2 &#x003bc;g/mL (<xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been a potent tool to observe virus entry, virus particle assembly, viral ultrastructure, and budding from the plasma membrane [<xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. To understand the antiviral details of LH, EM pictures were taken from each group. Abundant virus particles assembled at the surface of membrane, cytoplasm, and plasma vesicles in the SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, decreased in the treatment of LH at 600ug/mL. Notably, slight deformation of virus particles was seen in the LH treatment, which required us to make further studies.</p><p id="par0090">Highly pathogenic coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause fatal pneumonia, which is mainly associated with rapid virus replication, massive inflammatory cell infiltration and elevated proinflammatory cytokine/chemokine responses. Although the pathophysiology of fatal pneumonia caused by highly pathogenic coronaviruses has not been completely understood, accumulating evidence suggests that the cytokine storm plays a crucial role in causing fatal pneumonia [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Excessive amounts of proinflammatory cytokines were reported (e.g., IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-&#x003b3;, IP-10, and MCP-1) in the serum of SARS patients [<xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], similar in the serum of MERS patients [<xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Chaolin Huang et al. confirmed the occurrence of the cytokine storm in the COVID-19 patients in ICU rather than those in non-ICU patients [<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Based on the excessive cytokines responses, Suxin Wan et al. claimed that IL-6 and IL-10 levels could be used as one of the bases for predicting the outcome and prognosis of the COVID-2019 [<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, host cells infected with HCoV-229E and SARS-COV-2 increased the cytokine release such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1, and CXCL-10/IP-10, which was suppressed by LH in a dose-dependent manner. The change of cytokine profiles suggested that LH might have a potential effect on the inhibition of cytokine storm induced by SARS-COV-2, which also needed to be validated <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="sec0075"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p id="par0095">Since the launch of LH, it has been widely used as a broad spectrum of antiviral agent in the clinical practice, especially for various respiratory virus infections. Previous studies have shown that LH a broad spectrum of effects on a series of influenza viruses by interfering with both viral and host reactions. Although LH significantly relieved the clinical symptoms of the COVID-19, the underlying mechanism of antiviral effects on coronavirus, especially in the SARS-COV-2, was still elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that LH exerted its anti-coronavirus activity by inhibiting virus replication and reducing the cytokine release from host cells, which supported the clinical application of LH in combination with existing therapies to treat COVID-2019.</p></sec><sec sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Declaration of Competing Interest</title><p id="par0100">The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibl0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib0005"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref0005"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ding</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Chinese prescription lianhuaqingwen capsule exerts anti-influenza activity through the inhibition of viral propagation and impacts immune function</article-title><source>BMC Complement.
