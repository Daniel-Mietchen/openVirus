<p>Acyclovir (ACV) was shown in 1982 to check replication of the virus with essentially no toxicity [
 <xref rid="B2-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] because it selectively inhibited viral but not cellular replication. Its antiviral effective dose (ED
 <sub>50</sub>) was established as 0.3 μM with a cellular effect of 250 µM resulting in a highly favorable therapeutic index of 850 [
 <xref rid="B3-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The antiviral effect of acyclovir is the result of ACV-triphosphate’s interaction with the EBV DNA polymerase with much higher affinity than for the cellular polymerase alpha. Acyclovir triphosphate is incorporated into the viral DNA where it forms a tight dead-end complex that stops irreversibly its chain elongation. Ganciclovir’s (DHPG) effect is even greater, but it is more toxic which may preclude its use in otherwise normal persons. It however can be valuable when used selectively.
