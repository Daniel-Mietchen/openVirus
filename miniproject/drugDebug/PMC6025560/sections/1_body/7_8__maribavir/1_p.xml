<p>Maribavir (MBV) is an investigational oral benzimidazole L-riboside with significant activity against both HCMV and EBV but not other herpesviruses [

 <xref rid="B20-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Maribavir has more specific antiviral properties and fewer adverse side effects compared with currently approved anti-HCMV drugs. Unlike nucleoside and nucleotide analogs, MBV does not target the viral DNA polymerase. Its inhibitory effects are mainly produced through inhibition of the HCMV and EBV protein kinases (PK) [

 <xref rid="B22-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This compound selectively inhibits the HCMV PK UL97 as point mutations in the UL97 gene confer MBV resistance in HCMV [
 <xref rid="B23-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The first studies on GCV and MBV resistance showed that in vitro and in vivo UL97 mutations selected under GCV and MBV were distinct and conferred no cross-resistance [

 <xref rid="B25-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], while there was partial cross-resistance between GCV and cyclopropavir (CPV). However, later investigations indicated that a single p-loop UL97 mutation can confer significant cross-resistance to the three drugs.
