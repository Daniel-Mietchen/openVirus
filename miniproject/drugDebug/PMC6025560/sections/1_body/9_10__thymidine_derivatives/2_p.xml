<p>Two novel thiothymidine derivatives, KAY-2-41 and KAH-39-149, were particularly active against EBV in addition to their inhibitory effects against HSV and VZV [
 <xref rid="B33-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Their antiviral activity proved to be dependent on phosphorylation by viral TK and by cytosolic TK1. The efficacy of both thionucleosides in mice against MHV-68 acute infection was mostly promising for KAH-39-149, which showed similar in vivo potency as cidofovir.
