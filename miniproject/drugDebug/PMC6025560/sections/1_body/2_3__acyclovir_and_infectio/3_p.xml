<p>ACV does reduce EBV shedding in the oropharynx during IM, but is not accompanied by discernible clinical benefit. Diagnostically, IM is characterized by atypical T-cell lymphocytosis that results from the massive cell-mediated immune response against EBV-infected B-lymphocytes. Thus, it has been suggested that antivirals in combination with immunomodulatory drugs (such as corticosteroids, used empirically by physicians to treat IM) might be beneficial. However, in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, prednisolone administered with ACV for treatment of IM inhibited oropharyngeal EBV replication without affecting the duration of clinical symptoms or development of EBV-specific cellular immunity [
