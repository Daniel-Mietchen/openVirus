<p>In a retrospective cohort study, the impact of antiviral prophylaxis (given to prevent human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) disease) in 73 EBV-seronegative adult kidney recipients on early and late PTLD onset was analyzed [
 <xref rid="B16-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Thirty-seven patients received VACV or VGCV for 3–6 months and 36 received no-prophylaxis. Epstein–Barr virus PCR monitoring revealed that prophylaxis delayed primary infection at 100 days, but early PTLD incidence was not different between groups. However, regarding late events, EBV-related neoplasia incidence was significantly lower in treated patients among whom no cases were observed versus six cases reported in the no-prophylaxis group. Despite a weak level of evidence, this study suggests that antiviral prophylaxis could prevent late onset PTLD.
