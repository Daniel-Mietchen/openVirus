<p>The carbocyclic nucleoside analog H2G, (
 <italic>R</italic>)-9-[4-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)butyl]guanine, omaciclovir, has potent activity against different herpesviruses, being particularly active against VZV [
 <xref rid="B17-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Its mode of action is similar to that of ACV but omaciclovir has less selectivity as a substrate for thymidine kinase (TK). Resistance to H2G has been mapped in the VZV TK [
 <xref rid="B18-cancers-10-00197" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Unlike ACV, H2G is not an obligate chain terminator, although incorporation of its triphosphate form (H2G-TP) results in limited chain elongation. Also, H2G-TP has a longer intracellular half-life than ACV-TP.
