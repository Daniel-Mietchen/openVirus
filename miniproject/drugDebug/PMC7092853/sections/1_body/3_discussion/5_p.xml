<p id="p0145">Previous studies demonstrated that HT and HHT inhibit replication of CHIKV, VZV [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the Sindbis virus (SINV) [
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. HHT has further been shown to exert antiviral effects against coronavirus (CoV) [
 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and HBV [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Both HT and HHT are able to inhibit the replication of both RNA and DNA viruses, which indicates that their antiviral activities are most likely due to cellular rather than viral factors and that cellular factors are essential for viral replication. CET esters have been shown to interfere with RNA translation by blocking the binding of aminoacyl-tRNA to acceptor sites on the large ribosomal subunit, thereby also blocking the subsequent formation of a peptide bond [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Moreover, HT has been found to limit the replication of CHIKV by inhibiting large ribosomal subunits and subsequently down-regulating the translation of viral proteins [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Similar to previous studies, results of our time of addition assay showed that CET affected the late stage of ZIKV infection (
