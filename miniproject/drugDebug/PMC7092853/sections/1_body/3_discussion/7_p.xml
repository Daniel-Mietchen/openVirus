<p id="p0155">In virology, RNA levels are indicative of virus replication (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C), and FFU levels are indicative of virus release (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>D). In the current study, for the post-treatment group (i.e., the Vero cells that received CET after ZIKV-infection), the decreases we observed in viral replication and viral release were the same, which suggest that the primary mechanism by which CET inhibited ZIKV involved viral replication, not virus release. However, the time of addition assay showed that the viral yield of the full-duration treatment group was lower than that of the post-treatment group (by approximately 0.5 logs, 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). This finding suggests that not only can CET disrupt viral replication, but it may also possess other anti-ZIKV activities. To determine this, we performed a virucidal assay of CET, the results of which confirmed that CET decreased viral stability, thereby reducing viral yield (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>E). In summary, our data indicate that CET is able to inhibit ZIKV infection by affecting both viral replication and viral stability.
