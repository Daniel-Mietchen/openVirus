<p id="p0135">CET and its derived ester compounds (such as HT and HHT) have all been found to possess activity against leukemic cells [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The anti-tumor ability of these compounds is believed to arise from their inhibitory effects on protein synthesis [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Previous research also determined that CET and its ester derivatives have inhibitory effects against HBV [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], VZV and CHIKV [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. However, this is the first study to demonstrate that CET inhibits ZIKV infection. Specifically, results of IFA revealed that CET treatment reduced viral infection in both Vero and A549 cells (
