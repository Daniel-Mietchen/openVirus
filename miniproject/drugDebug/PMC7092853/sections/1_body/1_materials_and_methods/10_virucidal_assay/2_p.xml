<p id="p0085">The cell-free anti-ZIKV activity of CET was investigated by incubating ZIKV suspensions containing 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU with indicated concentrations of CET at 37 °C for 4 h. The treated supernatants were then diluted in DMEM and added to the confluent Vero cells. Viral titers were determined by counting viral fluorescence foci using the previously described IFA method [
