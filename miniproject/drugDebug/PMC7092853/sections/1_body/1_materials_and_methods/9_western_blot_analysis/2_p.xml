<p id="p0080">Intracellular viral envelope protein levels were measured by Western blot. Briefly, infected cell lysates treated with different concentrations of CET were harvested after 48 h of infection. Immunoblotting was performed using anti-flavivirus envelope antibodies 4G2 ascites (1:1000, produced in-house) and anti-β-actin (1:4000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) as primary antibodies as well as anti-mouse or anti-human horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies as secondary antibodies. Target proteins were detected using an ECL reagent, and images were obtained using a UVP chemiluminescence machine.</p>
