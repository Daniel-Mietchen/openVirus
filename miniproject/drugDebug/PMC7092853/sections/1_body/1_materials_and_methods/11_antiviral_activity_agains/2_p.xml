<p id="p0090">The antiviral effects of CET were further evaluated against DENV1 (Hawaii strain), DENV2 (16,681 strain), DENV3 (H87 strain), and DENV4 (H241 strain). Briefly, confluent Vero cells seeded in 12-well microplates were infected with FFUs of DENV1, DENV2, DENV3, or DENV4 and then incubated with indicated concentrations of CET for 48Â h. Following this, dose-dependent viral RNA reduction assays were performed using qRT-PCR to determine whether CET was effective in inhibiting viral replication [
