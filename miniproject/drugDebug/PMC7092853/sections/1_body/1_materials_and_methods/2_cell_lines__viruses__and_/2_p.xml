<p id="p0045">This study used Vero (African green monkey kidney cells; ATCC® CRL-1586TM) and A549 (Human lung carcinoma epithelial cells; ATCC® CCL-185™) cells, as these cells are more permissive to ZIKV (PRAVABC59, ATCC® VR-1843™) replication. Both Vero and A549 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Virus stock was determined using fluorescent focus unit assays and then stored at −80 °C until use. CET (purity ≥ 98%), purchased from a natural product manufacturer (ChemFaces, Wuhan Economic and Technological Development Zone, China), was dissolved in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a 20 mM stock solution and stored at −20 °C until use. At the time of use, the stock solution was diluted in DMEM until the desired working concentration was reached. Moreover, the volume of DMSO in each working concentration was adjusted so that the concentration of DMSO was the same for every solution, in order to avoid solvent interference among groups.
