<p id="p0110">To verify the anti-ZIKV ability and inhibition level of CET, qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and FFU assays were performed. For this, Vero cells were seeded in 12-well plates overnight, infected with 400 FFU ZIKV per well, and incubated with indicated concentrations of CET for 48 h before qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and FFU assays were employed. Results of qRT-PCR showed that CET inhibited ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B). In particular, a concentration of 100 μM CET was found to suppress approximately 98% of ZIKV RNA production. Furthermore, Vero cells infected with 1000 FFU ZIKV per well under indicated dosages of CET for 48 h incubation.
