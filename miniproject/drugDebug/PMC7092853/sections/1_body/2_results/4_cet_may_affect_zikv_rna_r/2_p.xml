<p id="p0120">Our data indicated that CET is able to inhibit ZIKV infection by decreasing viral RNA, protein, and progeny yield. Therefore, to further investigate the mechanism which underlies the ability of CET to inhibit ZIKV, we performed a time of addition assay. For this, 60 μM CET was added to Vero cells in pre-treatment, co-treatment, post-treatment, and full-duration treatment groups. (Cells in all groups were infected with 8000 FFU ZIKV per well for 1 h) Following the end of the infection period, cells were washed two times and the medium was replaced. After 24 h incubation, cells were lysed for RNA analysis, and the supernatant was collected for FFU assays. Results of this analysis revealed that CET likely affects the late stage of ZIKV infection (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and B), which means that the inhibitory effects of CET likely occur after virus entry. To investigate CET inhibition after ZIKV entry, Vero cells were infected with ZIKV, washed with PBS to remove viruses that had not infected the cells, and then treated with indicated concentrations of CET. Cell lysates and supernatants were collected after 24 h incubation for further analysis. Results showed that administering CET after the initial infection (i.e., the post-treatment group) suppressed viral RNA replication. In particular, when cells in the post-treatment group were administered 40 or 80 μM CET, ZIKV RNA levels were significantly reduced (

FFU assays, in which cells were incubated with supernatant containing 50,000 FFU ZIKV with or without 40 μM CET at room temperature for 6 h prior to detection, revealed that CET decreased the virus level after a 6 h incubation (
