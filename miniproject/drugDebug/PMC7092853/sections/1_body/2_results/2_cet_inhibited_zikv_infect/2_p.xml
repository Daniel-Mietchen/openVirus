<p id="p0100">Earlier research found that CET was able to inhibit HBV infection [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; however, the anti-viral effects of CET against other viruses have not been previously investigated. In this study, we first used Vero and A549 cells to investigate the anti-ZIKV ability of CET. For this, Vero cells and A549 cells were seeded in 12-well plates overnight and were then infected with ZIKV at 1500 FFU per well. After 48 h of incubation with ZIKV and indicated concentrations of CET, cells were fixed and stained by 4G2 antibodies, which react to all flaviviruses. Following quantification of our results, we demonstrated that CET from 20 to 100 μM significantly inhibited ZIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner (
