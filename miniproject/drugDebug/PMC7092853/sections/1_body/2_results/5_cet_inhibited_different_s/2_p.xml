<p id="p0125">We further assessed the ability of CET to inhibit the dengue virus. For this, Vero cells were seeded in 12-well plates overnight and then inoculated with indicated concentrations of CET and 30,000 FFU DENV1 per well, 4000 FFU DENV2 per well, 10,000 FFU DENV3 per well, or 20,000 FFU DENV4 per well. After 48 h incubation, the RNA of treated cells was extracted and analyzed by qRT-PCR. Our results revealed that 20 μM–80 μM CET inhibited these four serotypes of dengue viruses in a dose-dependent manner (
