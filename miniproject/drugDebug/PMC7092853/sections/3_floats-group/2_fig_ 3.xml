   <bold>Time of addition assay to investigate the effects of treating ZIKV-infected Vero cells with 60 μM CET.</bold> (A) RNA levels and (B) virus progeny production. The effects of administering CET after ZIKV infection (i.e., the post-treatment group) as revealed by (C) qRT-PCR and (D) FFU assay. (E) Results of a virucidal assay which assessed the effects of treatment with 40 μM CET. The data shown here represent the mean and SD of triplicate experiments. Statistical significance was determined via a 
   <italic>t</italic>-test compared with the ZIKV group: * indicates p &lt; 0.05, ** indicates p &lt; 0.01, *** indicates p &lt; 0.001.
