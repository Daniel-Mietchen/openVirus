   <bold>Dose-dependent anti-ZIKV production of CET.</bold> (A) The viability of CET-treated Vero cells was determined by CCK-8 assays. (B–D) The anti-ZIKV ability of CET was verified by measuring viral RNA levels, protein expression, and viral titers. (B) ZIKV RNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (C) ZIKV protein expression was detected by Western blotting. (D) Virus titers were assessed by FFU. The data shown here represent the mean and SD of triplicate experiments. Statistical significance was determined via a 
   <italic>t</italic>-test compared with the ZIKV group: * indicates p &lt; 0.05; ** indicates p &lt; 0.01; and *** indicates p &lt; 0.001.
