<p>The framework for treating HCV infection is changing rapidly. New short-course oral direct-acting antiviral (DAA) drugs act directly on the HCV lifecycle and have very dramatic antiviral effects. Unlike interferon (IFN), DAA regimens has few contraindications and adverse reactions (
 <xref rid="t1-kjp-2019-01116" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Since 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency have approved DAA regimens for the treatment of adults with chronic HCV infection. Both agencies approved DAA therapy (sofosbuvir or ledipasvir/sofosbuvir) for children (aged ≥12 years) in 2017. In 2019, both DAA were approved by FDA in pediatric patients aged 3 to less than 12 years. In June 2019, 12-week treatment with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir for any genotype was approved for Korean children (aged ≥12 years). Pediatric studies showed that DAA combination therapy is far superior to IFN-based therapies regardless of HCV genotype. In pediatric studies using the DAA regimen, the sustained virologic response at 12 weeks after treatment was 98%–100% in cases of approved DAA or currently in clinical trials [

Compared to studies of DAA in children with chronic HCV infection, the therapeutic efficacy of pegylated interferon (PegIFN) and ribavirin, measured by sustained virologic response at 24 weeks after treatment was 93% in patients with genotype 2 or 3, 80% in patients with genotype 4, and only 53% in those with genotype 1 [
