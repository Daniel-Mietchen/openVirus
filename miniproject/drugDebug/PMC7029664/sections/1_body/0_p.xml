<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission occurs by the parenteral route [

In the early 1990s, after the commercialization of the anti-HCV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay third-generation test, cases of HCV-infected children are rarely reported in Korea. The prevalence of HCV immunoglobulin G (IgG) positivity among Korean adolescents (age, 10–18 years) was 0.1% (2012–2014) according to the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [

Furthermore, eyebrow tattoos are becoming popular; thus, pregnant women who opt for this procedure could become infected with HCV. Education about prevention is needed, especially regarding the routes of HCV transmission such as sharing of toothbrushes, razors, cutters, nail clippers, and unsterilized needles. There is currently no protective vaccine against HCV.
