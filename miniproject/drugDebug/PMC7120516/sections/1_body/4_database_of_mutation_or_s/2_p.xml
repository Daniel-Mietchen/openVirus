<p>Before exploring the applications of pharmacogenomics on HIV, it is important to understand the underlying biological principles. Genetic variation in the human genome occurs predominantly as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) where single nucleotides differ between humans. An individual’s DNA contains as many as ten million SNPs, which are responsible for the diversity of human phenotypes, as well as susceptibility to drugs and diseases (Twyman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2004</xref>). Scientists approach the problem of identifying, cataloging, and characterizing SNPs from two different angles – a genomic approach and a functional approach. The genomic approach involves scientists comparing the genomes of numerous individuals to study differences and recording their results in forums such as the dbSNP short genetic variation database hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). This method of SNP characterization requires a large amount of computer-powered data analysis unlike the functional approach where scientists focus on select genes known to be associated with a particular process or disease, and then they examine them across a population (Perelson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">1996</xref>). In pharmacogenomics, such genetic variation with respect to drug response is studied and used to guide patient care. The primary bioinformatics resource for pharmacogenomics is the PharmGKB database developed by Stanford University that is studying the impact of genetic variation on drug response and focuses on clinical interpretation of variants, drug dosing guidelines, genetic tests, and other information that is practically applicable for actors in the health sector. Even without expanding the numbers of drugs available, however, pharmacogenomics is still incredibly impactful because doses and preferences for existing drugs can be employed for patient care. In fact, some major innovations have already occurred in resistance testing technologies and in HIV treatment selection based on genomics. Genotyping and phenotyping are two established methods for identifying antiretroviral resistance in patients on therapy. In HIV genotyping, a discrete sequence of reverse transcriptase and protease genes in extracted RNA specimens is amplified to generate cDNA amplicon, which then undergoes sequencing. A software system called OpenGene then aligns the sequences, reports mutations, and produces an interpretive report. The interpretation does not provide any insight though with regard to the degree of resistance to a drug because the output has either (1) no evidence of resistance, (2) possible resistance, (3) resistance, or (4) insufficient evidence. HIV drug resistance databases also play a key role by providing advanced information to clinicians. Important databases often used in HIV genetic research are the Los Alamos HIV Drug Resistance database and the Stanford HIV RT and Protease Sequence Database. The former collects all sequences and focuses on annotation and data analysis. A recent study prepared the database that contains a compilation of nearly all published HIV reverse transcriptase and protease sequences, which are linked to data about the source of the sequence sample and the antiretroviral drug treatment history of the individual from whom the isolate was obtained (Shafer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2003</xref>). Another group developed the HIVbase software solution that helps researchers effectively manage DNA/amino acid sequences and related genetic/clinical data using storage and query capabilities (Salemi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2004</xref>). Storing genotypic resistance data and linking to other clinical information is an important tool for successful disease management. Examples of such systems that identify mutation patterns associated with resistance are Virodec (Roche Diagnostics) and ViroScore (ABL) published on their diagnostic website. Virodec HIV is an online application engineered to upload, analyze, interpret, deliver, and store genetic sequence data from genotyping assays. ViroScore is an HIV resistance sequence management system with a sequence database that is used by analysis tools/algorithms for resistance interpretation. Despite these advanced technologies, interpretation is still the limitation with all resistance testing, and the systematic approaches developed to predict phenotypes based on mutational patterns are complicated by the complex mutation patterns for resistance.
