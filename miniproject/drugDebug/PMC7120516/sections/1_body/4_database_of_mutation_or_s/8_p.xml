<p>An individualâ€™s response to a drug is the complex interaction of both genetic and nongenetic factors. Genetic variants in the drug target itself, disease pathway genes, or drug-metabolizing enzymes can all be used as predictors of drug efficacy or toxicity. More than one million SNPs are now available for genotyping and phenotyping studies (Durbin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2010</xref>). Novel genotyping strategies are emerging on a regular basis using a variety of techniques designed to increase the rate of data generation and analysis. A high-resolution SNP map recently developed by the SNP Consortium (

In virology, the SNP technology has focused on detecting the predisposition for predicting toxic responses to drugs and selecting the best individual and combinations of antiretroviral drugs.
