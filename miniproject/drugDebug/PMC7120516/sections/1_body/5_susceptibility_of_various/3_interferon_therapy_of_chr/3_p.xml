<p>In the human body, humoral IFNs serve as the first lines of cellular defense in the control of viral infection. These IFN-induced molecules all lead to effective control of viral expansion, either by inhibiting viral replication or by promoting infected cells to undergo apoptosis. Supposedly, a combination of these molecules in each person will determine the individualâ€™s varying degree of response to IFN treatment. However, the genes encoding these molecules are conserved in humans with only certain genetic polymorphisms.</p>
