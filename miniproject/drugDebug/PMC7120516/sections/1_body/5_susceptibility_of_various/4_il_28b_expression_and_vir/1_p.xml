<p>The recent GWAS articles linking the IL28B genotype to IFN-alpha therapeutic response have triggered intensive research to establish underlying mechanisms for the association (Liapakis and Jacobson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2010</xref>). At this point, there are very few possible explanations and few strong, mechanistic clues (Thio and Thomas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2010</xref>). It is speculated that these variants correlate with the regulation of the cytokine IL28B transcription, because these SNPs are located upstream of the IL28B gene (Thio and Thomas 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2010</xref>). The observations cited earlier by Suppiah and colleagues and Tanaka and colleagues strongly suggest that the identified SNPs do indeed alter the expression of the IL28B and, perhaps, IL28A genes (Suppiah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2009</xref>; Tanaka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2009</xref>). These two studies found that those who carried the G risk allele at the SNP rs8099917 had lower mRNA expression of the cytokine IL28B in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (Suppiah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2009</xref>; Tanaka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2009</xref>). On the other hand, Ge and colleagues reported no difference in cytokine IL28B expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 80 HCV-uninfected persons homozygous for a proxy allele for the SNP rs12979860, using the SNPExpress database (Ge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2009</xref>). Thus, various SNPs showed their variation during response; Table 
 <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">28.9</xref> shows the most significant predictors of drug response.
