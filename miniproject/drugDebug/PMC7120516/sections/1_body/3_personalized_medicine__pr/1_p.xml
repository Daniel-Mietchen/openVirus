<p>The ultimate goal of personalized medicine is to take advantage of a molecular understanding of disease both to optimize drug development and direct preventive resources and therapeutic agents at the right population of people while they are still well. The goals of personalized medicine in drug development include (1) the selection of optimal drug targets; (2) the selection of optimal drug dosage; (3) the selection and monitoring of patients for shorter, less-expensive advanced clinical trials; (4) the ability to predict which individuals will respond to drugs at high rates and who will be less likely to suffer toxic side effects; (5) reducing the overall cost of drug development and increasing drug value; and (6) to ultimately improve and provide more effective healthcare for all individuals whether they are well or suffering from the early or late stages of illness. Genetic variants can be used to predict the predisposition of an individual for future disease development. By applying the principles of personalized medicine, it is possible to significantly enhance the productivity of drug discovery and development, so that the identification of the target gene and the appropriate pathways of the suitable drug can be developed which will definitely help in combating the viral diseases.</p>
