<p>The major difference between these assays is the requirement of specific equipment rather than their sensitivity or specificity. Therefore, the resources of the various settings remain the determinant factor for choosing the PCR-based, hybridization-based, or isothermal amplification-based HIV detection assays. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- or rt-PCR-based assay is the most frequently used technology in molecular biology and molecular diagnostics. PCR-based assays can be used for either the qualitative or quantitative analysis of HIV. As HIV is a retrovirus, both PCR and rt-PCR are used as qualitative assays of viral infection targeting the integrated form of provirus or the free HIV themselves, respectively. The rt-PCR is however specifically required in HIV viral load assay. The amplified products from PCR or rt-PCR can be visualized by a variety of methods, such as agarose gel electrophoresis, real-time visualization, and enzymatic reaction. One commercial kit, Amplicor, uses enzymatic reaction for product visualization with microplate platform (Murphy et al.

Considering the complicated procedure for the Amplicor assay as the post-amplification hybridization and enzymatic reaction for visualization involves multiple steps and many types of reagents, real-time visualization is advantageous in the development of new rt-PCR-based assays for HIV viral load analysis (Stevens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">2007</xref>). The simplicity and shorter time required for finishing the test make the rt-PCR-based HIV viral load assay to be more competitive among all available kits and possibly to be one of the focus in future kits under development.
