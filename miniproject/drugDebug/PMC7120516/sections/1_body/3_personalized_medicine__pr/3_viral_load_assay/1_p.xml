<p>The quantitative analysis of HIV-1 is based on viral load assay. Viral load assay is expressed by the copy number in a given unit of plasma, usually using copies/ml. An alternative expression is the international unit suggested by WHO (IU/ml). Based on the interlaboratory standardization using the three FDA-approved HIV-1 viral load kits, the exchange relationship between the copies/ml and the IU/ml is between 1:0.92 and 1:1 (

Viral load is a dynamic and relative parameter. Its value changes depending on methods used and it can fluctuate even on a daily basis. The variances between repeated tests using the same kit are usually smaller than those determined with different methods. Thus, a dynamic comparison of viral load values using the same assay method over time is strongly suggested. HIV viral load has multiple clinical implications (Report on the global AIDS epidemic 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">2007</xref>; Torti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2007</xref>). Firstly, it currently serves as a complementary diagnosis of HIV infection and may become one of the diagnosis standards in the near future. For qualitative determination of HIV infection, the higher the viral load value is measured, the more confident a diagnosis of HIV infection can be drawn. For example, if the viral load is higher than 3,000 copies/ml, the probability of HIV infection of the individual from whom the sample is taken is significantly high, particularly if high viral load is repeatable with another sample taken from the same individual at a different time. Secondly, viral load is helpful for early diagnosis of HIV infection. It is reported that there is a viral burst in blood in the early stage of HIV infection. The viral load in the early stage is sometimes even higher than that in the disease stage of AIDS. The viral load assay can also be used in the complementary diagnosis of HIV infection for neonates from HIV-infected mothers. Although the antibody-based HIV assay is the diagnosis standard in clinical practice, it is useless during its window period in the early stage of infection and has no diagnostic value for infants from HIV-infected mothers as discussed earlier. Thirdly, the analysis of the viral load is an efficient parameter in assessing antiviral therapy. The effective standard is the viral load decreased at least by 0.5 log after 4-week or 1 log after an 8-week antiviral therapy or the viral load reduced to 1,000 copies/ml after a 16–24-week therapy. Finally, the viral load has some values in predicting the progress of AIDS. For example, the viral load can predict the probability (
 <italic>p</italic> value) of becoming AIDS in 6 years for patients with normal CD4+ counts. The 
 <italic>p</italic> value is 0.054 when the viral load is less than 500 copies/ml and the 
 <italic>p</italic> value dramatically increased to 0.8 when the viral load is more than 30,000 copies/ml. When CD4+ counts are less than 200/μl, the viral load can be used to predict a shorter progress of AIDS. The probability of turning to AIDS within 3–6 months from viral carrier is proportionally associated with the viral load values. A similar conclusion was drawn from a recent clinical trial including 751 HIV-infected patients with b200 CD4+/mm
 <sup>3</sup> before HAART (Torti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">2007</xref>). Patients with higher CD4+ T-cell counts following the treatment appeared to have survived after month 3, whereas those with increasing HIV RNA N400 copies/ml did not. The three methods currently employed in commercial kits for HIV-1 viral load assays are rt-PCR-, b DNA-, and NASBA-based assays. Table
