<p>Recent emergence and progress in molecular biological techniques make the route easier to select the right target by various traditional and modern genomic approaches nowadays in practices. Thus, one of the major challenges is to identify and characterize the target which is essential for the virus to survive, but which is absent, or significantly divergent, in their mammalian host may sort out in drug discovery. For viral diseases, the small genome and relatively few viral proteins make this process fairly straightforward. The modern molecular techniques like real-time PCR, microarray, and next-gen sequencing approach are currently giving the most precise and specific results; thus they are helping in progressing the newer therapeutic approach. Table
