<p>Protease inhibitors have been designed to bind the protease with maximal affinity and tend to occupy more space inside the active site cavity than do natural substrates. Unlike the inhibitors, the natural substrates of the protease have a variable, but generally less tight, interaction with the catalytic site, a phenomenon that promotes the ordered sequential cleavage of the polyproteins required for proper assembly of the viral particle. Resistance mutations in the protease, which result in an overall enlargement of the catalytic site of the enzyme, would thus be predicted to have a greater effect on the binding of inhibitors than the natural templates. Some mutations are selected for only by certain protease inhibitors (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">28.12</xref>), reflecting particularities in the chemical structure of the inhibitors that influence their interaction with the substrate-binding domain of the enzyme. However, there is considerable overlap between the combinations of mutations in HIV strains that develop resistance to protease inhibitors. This overlap explains the wide cross-resistance that is generally observed within this drug class (Schapiro et al.
