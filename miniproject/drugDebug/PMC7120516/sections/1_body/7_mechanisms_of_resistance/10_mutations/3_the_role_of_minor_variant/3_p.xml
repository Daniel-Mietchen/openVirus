<p>Not surprisingly, the ACTG 398 investigators reported that NNRTI-naive patients had significantly better responses than NNRTI-experienced patients: 84 % of NNRTI-experienced patients, compared to 57 % of the NNRTI-naive patients, failed to achieve an undetectable viral load after 24 weeks of follow-up. Of interest, though, is an analysis of the NNRTI-experienced patients. After 24 weeks, however, the difference in response rates between these two groups became insignificant and eventually converged.</p>
