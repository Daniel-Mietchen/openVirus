<p>Perhaps the most widely cited case in point regarding the dangers of K65R is GlaxoSmithKline’s ESS3000009 trial (Gallant et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2003</xref>). In this study, 345 patients were randomized to receive either tenofovir or efavirenz, combined with a fixed-dose combination tablet containing 600 mg abacavir and 300 mg lamivudine, all to be taken once a day. Patients were naïve to antiretroviral therapy prior to starting the study and had an average baseline viral load of 4.63 log10 copies/ml and a baseline CD4+ cell count of 260 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>. Because of a glaringly high number of treatment failures being documented in the triple-NRTI group, the study investigators conducted an unplanned analysis involving the first 194 patients who completed 8 weeks of follow-up. Approximately 49 % of patients in the triple-NRTI group met the definition of virologic failure, compared to only 5.4 % patients in the efavirenz-based arm. Tenofovir, abacavir, and lamivudine can all select for the K65R mutation. Among 21 patients who had viral loads that were high enough to test for drug resistance, 10 (48 %) had the K65R mutation. Tenofovir, abacavir, and lamivudine all exert concerted pressure on the 65 locus, and, with the emergence of that single mutation, it is able to abrogate the efficacy of the regimen with a single stroke.
