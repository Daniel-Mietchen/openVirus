<p>Of interest are data from six recent clinical trials evaluating all reverse transcriptase inhibitor regimens containing tenofovir, either with or without zidovudine. Among patients initiating therapy for the first time, tenofovir-inclusive regimens not involving zidovudine were much more likely to fail in association with development of the K65R mutation. Conversely, tenofovir- and zidovudine-inclusive regimens were much more likely to fail in association with the development of TAMs.</p>
