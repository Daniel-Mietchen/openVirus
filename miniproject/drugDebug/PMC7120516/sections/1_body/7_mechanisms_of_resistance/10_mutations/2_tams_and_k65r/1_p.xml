<p>NRTIs exert a blocking effect by plugging a non-extendable nucleoside analogue monophosphate to the 3â€² end of the growing proviral DNA chain. This effectively terminates chain extension and, ultimately, inhibits replication of the virus. However, this process can be reversed by a reverse transcriptase reaction that removes the chain-terminating residue and reinstates an extendable primer. This reverse reaction of DNA polymerization, termed pyrophosphorolysis, enables reverse transcription and DNA synthesis to resume. Pyrophosphorolysis can be enhanced by key mutations, often referred to as thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs). While pyrophosphorolysis is believed to be the primary mechanism of resistance to zidovudine and stavudine, the process is not drug specific in the way that discriminatory mutations tend to be. Consequently, these pyrophosphorolysis-enhancing mutations can confer reduced susceptibility to all of the NRTIs.</p>
