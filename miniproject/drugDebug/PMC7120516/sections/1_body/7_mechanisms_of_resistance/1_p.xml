<p>Considerable progress has been made in identifying mutations associated with drug resistance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">28.12</xref>) and in understanding the mechanisms through which they confer resistance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">28.13</xref>). A variety of mechanisms have been identified that differ both for different classes of drugs and for drugs of a given class.
