<p>However, recent data of CATCH and the US-based studies suggested that transmitted drug-resistant HIV can remain the dominant population in peripheral blood for an extended period of time. Furthermore, a study analyzed the baseline nucleotide sequences among 11 subjects with primary HIV infection who showed variation against antiretroviral therapy (Little et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2004</xref>). The patients had been infected for approximately 65 days and had at least one major drug resistance mutation. Longitudinal samples were collected for a median of 225 days after infection and analyzed for persistence of transmitted drug-resistant variants. Seven patients had evidence of NNRTI resistance, two patients had resistance to both NRTIs and PIs, and one patient had triple-class resistance. The average time to reversion of the K103N variants to mixed 103 N/K populations in the seven patients with NNRTI resistance was 196 days following the estimated date of infection. In the four patients with mutations conferring resistance to protease inhibitors, no reversion to wild type was detected at 64, 191, 327, and 342 days after infection. Complete reversion of genotypic resistance was observed in only one patient at 1,019 days after infection. Dr. Kuritzkes concluded the data presented at the 11th CROI by a team of investigators at Gilead Sciences (Borroto-Esoda et al.

Study FTC-301A compared once-daily emtricitabine (Emtriva) to once-daily stavudine (Zerit), both combined with didanosine (Videx) and efavirenz (Sustiva), in 571 treatment-na√Øve patients from North America, Latin America, and Europe. Overall, 90/546 (16 %) evaluable patients entered the study with HIV mutations at positions associated with resistance to NNRTIs. There were no differences in the prevalence or type of mutations between the groups. For subjects with wild-type virus at baseline, the incidence of virologic failure was 12 % in the stavudine group and 5 % in the emtricitabine group. Among patients with drug-resistant virus at baseline, virologic failure occurred in 32 % of the stavudine group and 13 % of the emtricitabine group.
