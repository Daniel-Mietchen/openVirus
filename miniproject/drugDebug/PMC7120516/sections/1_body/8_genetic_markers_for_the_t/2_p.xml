<p>An example is the nucleotide variation at position 3,435 of the human P-glycoprotein (MDR-1) gene; the number of patients in each genotype group (3,435 C/C, C/T, and T/T) still experiencing virological suppression at 24 months was 55/112, 72/125, and 74/133, respectively (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2003</xref>). Greater than 80 % of these patients were on a regimen of 2 NRTIs plus a PI. This was a small effect, though significant, for a slower time to immunological and virological failure for the C/C genotype.
