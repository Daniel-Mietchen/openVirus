<p>Another major hurdle is to achieve the balanced immune response against vaccine candidates. It is likely that epitopes that are less well conserved between clades but conserved within a clade are capable of eliciting clade-specific, rather than cross-reactive, NAbs. HIV-1 clade C viruses seem to be more sensitive to neutralization than HIV-1 variants from other clades (Van Gils et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2010</xref>). HIV-1 clade C infection was most prevalent among elite neutralizers (Simek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2009</xref>). Vaccine candidates using Env as the immunogen have not been able to produce bNAbs. bNAbs with long HCDR3 regions seem to be polyreactive for non-HIV antigens. Lack of bNAb generation has been attributed to autoreactivity of bNAbs directed toward Env. Autoreactivity of anti-Env bNAbs induces central tolerance mechanisms and results in removal of B cells producing antibody with the same epitope specificity. The heavy chain of 2F5 bNAb was cloned in B cells in mice models and resulted in the loss of B cells expressing mature 2F5 IgM in mice (Verkoczy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">2010</xref>). Another hypothesis emphasizes that bNAbs are not immunogenic enough to induce proliferation in B cells followed by fine-tuning of the B-cell receptor (antibody coding) through somatic hypermutation. The fine-tuning of the B-cell receptor gene is necessary to maximize the specificity of antibody to its antigen (Harro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>). This raises concerns about the approach of using conserved Env epitopes as HIV-1 vaccine candidates for bNAb generation.
