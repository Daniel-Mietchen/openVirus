<p>Drug resistance is also a major obstacle in the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV). The essential HCV NS3/4A protease is an attractive therapeutic target responsible for cleaving at least four sites along the viral polyprotein. Many protease inhibitors are currently in clinical trials; however, multidrug resistance is widespread and arises very quickly. Certain studies clearly compared the co-crystal structures of substrate with co-crystal structures of inhibitor complexes and show that, as in the case of HIV-1 protease (Chellappan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007</xref>; Altman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>), primary drug resistance occurs in HCV NS3/4A where the inhibitors protrude away from the substrate envelope. Similarly prolonged therapy against HBV with lamivudine is associated with an increased incidence of viral resistance. The low efficacy, undesirable side effects, and occurrence of resistance to HBV mutations remain the major obstacles in their clinical application in treating HBV infection (Lau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1997</xref>; Hoofnagle and di Bisceglie 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1997</xref>). The need for alternative therapeutic approaches has provided the impetus to develop novel therapeutic reagents for inhibiting HBV replication.
