<p>Natural infection with HIV does not result in virus clearance by the host immune system and the development of natural immunity to reinfection. In spite of intense and sustained immune responses by both the humoral and cell-mediated defenses, HIV is able to resist eradication and continues depleting CD4+ T cells, which eventually leads to clinical progression to AIDS. There even is evidence that superinfection with a second HIV isolate can readily occur in HIV-infected persons, leading to the emergence of recombinant virus variants and generating increased virus diversity (Mc Cutchan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2005</xref>). HIV-1 integrates itself as latent proviral DNA into the genome of long-lived memory CD4+ T cells, which provide a persistent reservoir of the virus that escapes immune surveillance (Peterlin and Trono 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2003</xref>). It has been calculated that it would take up to 60 years to eradicate a reservoir of as few as 1 × 10E5 latently infected cells. The window of opportunity for an HIV vaccine is therefore narrowly limited to the very early stages of infection, before the virus can seed the lymphoid organs in mucosal tissues (Gallo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>). HIV also has developed multiple mechanisms to circumvent the host immune responses including its ability to downregulate the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and by doing so to minimize its recognition by CTL, as well as its high genetic evolution rates, which allows it to evade immune responses through the emergence of viral CTL (Feeney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2005</xref>), and neutralizing antibody escape variants. Another difficulty with the development of an effective HIV vaccine stems from the fact that the virus envelope glycoprotein conceals its conserved receptor- and co-receptor-binding sites in crypts that are masked by the hypervariable loops of the molecule and by glycan residues (Wei et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2003</xref>). Neutralizing antibodies induced in response to gp120 are primarily targeted to the hypervariable loops of the molecule, and only rarely do they recognize the receptor-binding sites, which makes it hard to generate broadly cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies against primary virus isolates from patients (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2004</xref>). Lack in efficacy of antibody responses raised by monomeric gp120 vaccines in protection against HIV infection has been proven beyond any doubt in the world’s first two phase III clinical trials of AIDS vaccines (Mascola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">1996</xref>), although neutralizing antibodies administered passively to nonhuman primates can provide protection against experimental SHIV infection (Ferrantelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2002</xref>). However, contrary to laboratory-adapted virus strains, which use CXCR-4 as a co-receptor (“X4” strains), and against which protection in chimpanzees could readily be achieved by inducing neutralizing antibodies targeted to the hypervariable V3 loop (Girard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1995</xref>), primary virus isolates, which use CCR-5 as a co-receptor (“R5” strains), are difficult to neutralize, which casts doubt on the possibility for a vaccine to elicit protection against infection by the induction of neutralizing antibodies alone. In view of all these problems, recent vaccine approaches have focused on the induction of cellular immune responses (McMichael and Hanke 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2002</xref>). The induction of a cellular immune response against HIV, especially a CD8+ CTL response, although not being able to provide sterilizing immunity and protection from infection, should hopefully enable vaccines to control virus replication following infection, reduce their virus load, slow down their progression toward disease, and reduce the probability of secondary transmission of the virus. However, some viruses, for some reasons, are not fully amenable to this approach, such as influenza, retroviruses, herpes viruses, the slow viruses, rhinoviruses, and arboviruses. Obstacles to the use of vaccines include (1) multiplicity of serotypes, e.g., rhinoviruses and togaviruses; (2) antigenic change, e.g., influenza and retroviruses; and (3) latent infections.
