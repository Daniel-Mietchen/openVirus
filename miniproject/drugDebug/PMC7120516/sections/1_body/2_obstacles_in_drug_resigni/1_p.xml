<p>Viral diseases affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide, resulting in a devastating toll on human health and socioeconomic development. Along with the emergence of newly recognized human pathogens (the SARS corona virus, the recent influenza viruses H5N1 and H1N1), the ever-increasing incidence of chronic viral infections caused by HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses continues to increase the global burden of infectious diseases (Haagmans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2009</xref>; De Clercq 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>). Vaccines have been developed for some of the most important viral pathogens. Although vaccines against HIV (Rerks-Ngarm et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2009</xref>) and hepatitis C virus (Wedemeyer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2009</xref>) are in clinical phases III and II, respectively, there is still little prospect of effective vaccines against these agents. Enormous burden and death due to these viral diseases compel the scientists/virologists to think forcefully to overcome such mortality globally.
