<p>The biggest challenge is to deal with the variations among HIV-1 clades. HIV-1 is capable of establishing latent infection in the early phases of infection (Mehandru et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2004</xref>). HIV-1 can also escape from CTL sequestration of infected cells in the central nervous system owing to infrequent access of T cells in the CNS (McMichael and Rowland-Jones 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2001</xref>). Increased susceptibility of vaccinated individuals might be owing to vector-specific immune responses, which make T cells more prone to HIV infection. However, recent reports demonstrate no role of vector-specific CD4+ T cells in an increasing susceptibility to HIV infection (Hutnick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2010</xref>). The mechanism of T-cell exhaustion and antiviral control would be important to assess in vaccine studies to ensure the generation and maintenance of memory T cells (Trautmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2006</xref>). It has been reported that HIV-specific CD4+ T cells are induced during acute HIV infection, but their helper function gets compromised (Malhotra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2001</xref>). The large sequence diversity of envelope glycoprotein is another barrier in the development of an HIV-1 vaccine.
