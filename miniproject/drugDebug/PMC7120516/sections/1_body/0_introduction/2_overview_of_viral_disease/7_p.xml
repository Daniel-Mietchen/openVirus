<p>About 500,000 cases of cervical cancer are estimated to occur each year, over 80 % of which occur in developing countries, where neither population-based routine screening (e.g., Papanicolaou smear test) nor optimal treatment is available. The highest estimated incidence rates of cervical cancer occur in Africa, Central and South America, and Asia. Epidemiological studies in the USA have reported that 75 % of the 15â€“50-year-old population is infected with genital HPV over their lifetime, 60 % with transient infection, 10 % with persistent infection (confirmed by detection of HPV DNA in genital samples), 4 % with mild cytological signs, and 1 % with clinical lesions.</p>
