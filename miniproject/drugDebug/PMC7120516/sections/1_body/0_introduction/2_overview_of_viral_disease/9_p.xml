<p>Prophylactic HPV vaccine candidates are based on recombinant capsid protein L1 and aim to elicit neutralizing antiviral antibodies to protect against infection, while therapeutic vaccine candidates are based on viral oncogenic proteins E6 and E7, with or without L1, and aim to induce cell-mediated immune responses to eliminate the transformed tumor cells. The most advanced and promising approach for a prophylactic vaccine involves the use of noninfectious recombinant virus-like particles (VLPs) which self-assemble spontaneously from pentamers of the L1 capsid protein. Two prophylactic vaccine candidates are at the level of phase III clinical evaluation and the companies have filed for licensure. GSK is focusing on a bivalent HPV-16, HPV-18 VLP vaccine candidate and Merck is developing a tetravalent vaccine based on VLPs from HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18. Both showed very high efficacy in proof-of-principle studies and the manufacturers have announced results showing almost 100 % protection against high-grade cervical cancer precursors caused by HPV types 16 and 18 in women aged 16â€“25 years.</p>
