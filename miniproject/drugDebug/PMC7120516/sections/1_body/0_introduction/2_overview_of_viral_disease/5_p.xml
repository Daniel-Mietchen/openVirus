<p>Countries with the highest reported prevalence rates are located in Africa and Asia; areas with lower prevalence include the industrialized nations in North America, Northern and Western Europe, and Australia. Populous nations in the developed world with relatively low rates of HCV seroprevalence include Germany (0.6 %) (Palitzsch et al.
