<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes cervical cancer, the second biggest cause of female cancer mortality worldwide. Estimates of the number of cervical cancer deaths are around 250,000 per year. The prevalence of genital HPV infection in the world is around 440 million. There are over 100 genotypes of HPV, 40 of which infect human mucosal areas of the upper digestive tract and genital tract. The majority of adenocarcinomas of the cervix and of squamous cell cancers (SCC) of the vulva, vagina, penis, and anus are caused by HPV-16 and HPV-18 (together accounting for about 70 % of cases globally), the remaining 30 % being due to other high-risk HPV types (such as HPV-31, HPV-33, HPV-35, HPV-39, HPV-45, HPV-51, HPV-66). The relative importance of different high-risk types varies between countries and regions, but type 16 has the greatest contribution to cervical cancer in all regions. HPV is also associated with other cancers of the anus, head and neck, and rarely, recurrent respiratory papillomatosis in children.</p>
