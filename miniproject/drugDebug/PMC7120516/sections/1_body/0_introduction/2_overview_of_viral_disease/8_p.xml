<p>HPV belongs to the family Papovaviridae. These are small nonenveloped icosahedral viruses with an 8 kbp long double-stranded circular DNA genome. The papillomavirus genome comprises early and late genes that encode early proteins E1–E7 and late proteins L1–L2. The early proteins are nonstructural proteins involved in replication and transcription of the genome (E1–E5) or in host cell tumoral transformation (E6 and E7), whereas L1 and L2 are the structural capsid proteins of the virion. The low-grade cervical dysplasias correspond to productively infected cells that actively shed virus, whereas high-grade dysplasias and cancers do not produce virions: viral gene expression in these cells is limited to the E6 and E7 oncogenes that are transcribed from randomly integrated viral DNA. The E7 protein is thought to induce cell proliferation and disrupt the cell cycle regulation by inactivation of the Rb family proteins, whereas E6 blocks cell apoptosis by directing the p53 tumor suppressor protein to the proteasome.</p>
