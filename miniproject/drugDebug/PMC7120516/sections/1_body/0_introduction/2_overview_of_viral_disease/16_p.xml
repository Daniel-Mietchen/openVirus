<p>HIV is the human immunodeficiency virus. It is the virus that can lead to acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. CDC estimates that about 56,000 people in the United States contracted HIV in 2006. There are two types of HIV, HIV-1 and HIV-2. In the USA, unless otherwise noted, the term “HIV” primarily refers to HIV-1. Both types of HIV damages a person’s body by destroying specific blood cells, called CD4+ T cells, which are crucial to helping the body immune defense. AIDS is the late stage of HIV infection, when a person’s immune system gets severely damaged and feels difficulty in fighting against diseases and certain cancers. Before the development of certain medications, people with HIV could progress to AIDS in just a few years. At this time, there is no cure for HIV infection. Despite major advances in diagnosing and treating HIV infection, in 2007, 35,962 cases of AIDS were diagnosed and 14,110 deaths among people living with HIV were reported in the USA. The above-discussed diseases are continuously threatening the whole world and insisting to search and explore new medicine concept so that management would be possible and people may live long disease-free and free from economical burden.</p>
