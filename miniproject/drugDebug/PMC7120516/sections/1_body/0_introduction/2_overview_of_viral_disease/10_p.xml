<p>Most HPV infections in young females are temporary and have little long-term significance. Seventy percent of infections are gone in 1 year and 90 % in 2 years. However, when the infection persists – in 5–10 % of infected women – there is high risk of developing precancerous lesions of the cervix, which can progress to invasive cervical cancer. This process usually takes 10–15 years, providing many opportunities for detection and treatment of the precancerous lesion. Progression to invasive cancer can be almost always prevented when standard prevention strategies are applied, but the lesions still cause considerable burden necessitating preventive surgeries, which do in many cases involve loss of fertility.</p>
