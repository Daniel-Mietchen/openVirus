<p>The mutation frequency profile is superimposed at the bottom of the graph, and this analysis clearly identifies those aminoacyl side chains that mutate with a high frequency and are in close proximity to the bound drug, those that are proximal and stable, those that are distal and mutate, and those that are distal and are stable. The Variome™ structural pharmacogenomics technology has broad applications in the rational design of highly effective infectious disease therapies – bacteria as well as viruses, drugs as well as vaccines – that offer the prospect of stable efficacy in the face of drug selection pressure. In addition to naturally occurring infectious agents, it is clear that there is significant value in biodefense-related applications in rational drug and vaccine design and in threat assessment and prediction. Understanding and managing the adverse effects of antiretroviral therapy highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has changed the landscape of HIV disease in a way that seemed unthinkable a decade ago. The first HAART regimens worked in suppressing virus but were encumbered by a variety of short-term and long-term side effects. More recent regimens became simpler, easier to take, and with fewer adverse events. Knowledge of both the short- and long-term adverse events associated with HAART is essential for providers and for patients. For new drugs to be acceptable in the current field, they will have to pass a litmus test of tolerability. Since adverse events are often remarkably idiosyncratic, pharmacogenomics may offer a way of predicting side effects and their severity from a particular drug or drug class in individual patients.</p>
