<p>The sensitivity and specificity for predicting drug resistance phenotypes on a patient-by-patient basis for various Food and Drug Administration (FDA; 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fda.gov" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.fda.gov</ext-link>)-approved drugs, based upon the computed relative energy (∆
 <italic>E bind</italic>) of interaction of each drug with each patient’s unique drug-target polymorphism structure. The numbers appear to be quite good in comparison to what is achievable in the laboratory at present. However, perhaps what is most important, with respect to increased efficiency and speed in drug design, is that answers can be generated overnight rather than in 3–6 weeks (the typical timeframe for laboratory drug resistance phenotyping). Another way of looking at the interaction of putative drugs or drug leads with a set of drug-target polymorphisms is to dock the molecules to the individual polymorphisms and measure the distance of the drug to each residue within the protein. Such an analysis for five different protease inhibitors is shown in Table
