  <p>Mutations are designated according to the letter of the wild-type amino acid that is subject to substitution, followed in turn by the position of that amino acid in the reverse transcriptase or protease sequence and by the letter of the mutant amino acid. For example, M184V indicates that methionine at position 184 is replaced by a valine.
