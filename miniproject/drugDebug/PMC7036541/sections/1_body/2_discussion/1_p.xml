<p>Previous studies evaluating the role of HCV in the development of drug eruptions have not included serial measurements of HCV RNA assessed in relation to the clinical course of the disease. However, fixed drug eruption (FDE) may be useful for assessing HCV viral loads, because the process of the evolution of individual lesions can be assessed. Our longitudinal evaluation of HCV RNA levels in sera from this patient demonstrated a close inverse correlation between HCV viral load in sera obtained at multiple time points and the presence of clinical symptoms of FDE: low levels of HCV RNA were temporarily associated with clinical symptoms of the disease. If these factors are associated, one might expect that patients with chronic HCV infection who show FDE may have low-titer HCV RNA. Although flare-ups of these lesions might be considered virally mediated, they may represent an HCV-specific immune response. In support of this possibility, positive lymphocyte transformation test reactions were only observed during periods when HCV RNA levels were relatively low. Due to the development of FDE 3 months after PEG-IFNα-2b therapy, IFN would represent a triggering factor that can stimulate otherwise latent antiviral immune responses. A report of multiple FDE triggered by IFN + ribavirin in a patient with HCV infection supports this argument [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our case, the eruptions were eventually diagnosed as FDE despite lack of common clinical features of hyperpigmentation. Guin and Baker [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] reported a case of chronic FDE caused by acetaminophen that simulated parapsoriasis en plaque. Interestingly, the lesions recurred at the same sites following administration of chemically unrelated medications, a finding referred to as polysensitivity [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Immune reactions to more than two chemically distinct drugs are referred to as polysensitivity [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and polysensitivity in FDE lesions had been previously reported [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Since mycoplasms or viral infection can increase the risk of multiple drug hypersensitivity [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], polysensitivity in this case was more likely attributed to virus-specific CD8
