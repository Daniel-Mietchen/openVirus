<p>A few days before the start of taking atenolol, she consented to retake amlodipine besilate. Within 24 h, a small oval erythematous plaque had reappeared at the previously affected site on the breasts (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The recurrent lesion resolved within 3 days without any pigmentary change. Lymphocyte transformation tests with several drugs were performed on a number of occasions, and the results are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Instances of recurrence were noted frequently over the next 3 years, during which time HCV RNA levels remained low. All skin lesions healed completely, while serum HCV RNA levels dramatically increased. Atenolol was continued after HCV RNA levels increased, but her blood pressure control was poor, so candesartan cilexetil was added again in June 2012. Oral challenge tests of atenolol were performed with no observed recurrences in January 2013. The patient was followed up for another year, during which time she remained free of eruptions.
