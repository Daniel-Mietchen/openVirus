<p>Laboratory results at her initial presentation included: leukocyte count 5,400/mm
 <sup>3</sup> (normal range: 3,900–9,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>); hemoglobin, 14.9 g/dL; platelet count, 21.4 × 10
 <sup>4</sup>/µL; ALT, 147 IU/mL; aspartate aminotransferase, 63 IU/mL; rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody test findings were negative. She showed negative results in IgM anti-HAV antibody, IgM anti-HBc antibody, HAV antigen and HBsAg antigen tests, but positive results in anti-HCV antibody tests. She has HCV genotype 1b, which is more common in Japan and Southeast Asia, and causes more severe hepatitis and higher levels of viremia. Findings from a liver biopsy showed moderate chronic active hepatitis. Quantitation of serum HCV RNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction, and serum HCV RNA level was 7.4 × 10
 <sup>2</sup> Eq/mL. Four weeks of treatment by topical application of corticosteroids did not ameliorate the skin lesions. Meanwhile, following PEG-IFNα-2b plus ribavirin therapy, her ALT level decreased but remained above normal, whereas discontinuation of PEG-IFNα-2b plus ribavirin resulted in an increase in the HCV RNA level. Because the patient refused further PEG-IFN-α-2b plus ribavirin therapy complaining of fatigue and headache, she stopped taking all medications except ursodeoxycholic acid, 900 mg daily. Gradual improvement in skin lesions was noted over the next 2 months, but her skin lesions were not completely resolved by June 2011.
