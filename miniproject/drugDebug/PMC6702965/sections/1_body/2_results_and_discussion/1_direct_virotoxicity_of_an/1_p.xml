<p>Direct virucidal effect of the AVs selected for this study in ASFV or FMDV infections was assayed by incubation of virus samples for 1 h at room temperature with increasing concentrations (from 0 to 300 Î¼M for LG and CRL, or 0 to 300 mM for VPA) of the drugs. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>, no direct toxicity was observed in ASFV or FMDV samples when incubated with the compounds in the range of concentrations analyzed.
