<p>We assessed the inhibitory effect of VPA and CRL on ASFV infection. ASFV inhibitor LG (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>) was included in these experiments for comparative purposes. We first assayed the cytotoxicity of LG, VPA, and CRL in different cell lines. Cultures of Vero, COS, BHK21, or IBRS-2 cells were incubated for 24 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of the AVs and the CC
 <sub>50</sub> values were determined (
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The concentrations selected to determine the potential inhibition exerted by these compounds were: 1–20 μM LG, 5–30 mM VPA, and 10–50 μM CRL. Virus yield was reduced about 3 log.u. when Vero (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 1 μM) or COS (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 0.4 μM) cell monolayers were infected with the non-pathogenic ASFV isolate Ba71V in the presence of LG (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>), as expected from previous results (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>). A similar reduction of ASFV production was observed in the presence of non-toxic concentrations of VPA (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 2.5–3 mM), and of CRL (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 9 μM). Moreover, the virulent ASFV isolate E70 was also inhibited in COS cells infected in the presence of similar concentrations of the three drugs (IC
 <sub>50</sub>: 2 μM for LG, 2.5 mM for VPA, and 3 μM for CRL).
