<p>To confirm the antiviral effect of CRL and VPA in ASFV infection, we analyzed the expression of virus proteins induced in Vero cells at late times of infection (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). No late ASFV proteins (like p17 or p12) and a very low expression of the early virus protein p32 were detected in cultures infected in the presence of CRL or VPA, as reported in LG-treated ASFV-infected Vero cells (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>). This decrease in protein synthesis was consistent with the inhibition observed in infective virus yield. The low levels of p32 detected, mainly at late times (24 h.p.i), are likely due to the accumulation of residual virus particles less sensitive to the AVs. Late ASFV protein P72 could not be quantified because of its co-migration with similar molecular weight-unspecific proteins, even detectable in mock samples.
