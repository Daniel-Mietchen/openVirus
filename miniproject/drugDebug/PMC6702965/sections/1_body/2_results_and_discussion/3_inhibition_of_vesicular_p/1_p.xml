<p>We next analyzed the effect of LG in cells infected by different vesicular porcine viruses: FMDV, VSV, and SVDV. VPA was not included in this study since, as we previously reported, VSV is susceptible to this drug while FMDV and SVDV infections are not affected (

 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref>, a consistent decrease of at least 1 log.u. in the production of both FMDV isolates from serotypes C (C-S8) and O (0-UKG 11/2001, named O-UK) in BHK21 or IBRS-2 cells at different M.O.I.s was observed in the presence of 10 μM LG (IC
