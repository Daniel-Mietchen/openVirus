<p>To determine a possible direct virucidal effect of the AVs on virus particles, suspensions of either ASFV or FMDV (10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu) in 0.9 ml of culture medium were incubated with 0.1 ml of LG, VPA, or CRL solutions (from 0 to 300 Î¼M for LG and CRL, or 0 to 300 mM for VPA); controls with viruses incubated in 2% ethanol in the absence of the drug were included. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, samples were diluted (1:1000) and titrated by plaque assay on virus-sensitive cell monolayers (COS for ASFV and BHK for FMDV samples). Virus titers were compared in duplicate samples with those obtained in virus samples incubated in the absence of the drug (
