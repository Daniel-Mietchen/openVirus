<p>BHK21 cells were pre-treated with LG for 1 h and infected with FMDV C-S8 isolate (M.O.I. of 1 pfu/cell) in the presence of 10 Î¼M LG. Virus inoculum was removed and infected cultures were further incubated with LG in fresh medium. At 0, 1, 2, 3, and 8 h.p.i, cultures were collected and total (intracellular and extracellular) RNA was extracted using Tri-Reagent (Sigma). cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and qPCR was performed using LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I (Roche) containing 10 pmol each of forward and reverse primers that amplified a conserved 290-bp region in the 3D gene (
