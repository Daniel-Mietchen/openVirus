<p>Vero cells were pre-treated before virus infection with 20 mM VPA or 25 μM CRL for 1 h and then infected with the ASFV isolate Ba71V (M.O.I. of 2 pfu/cell) in the presence of the AV. Virus inoculum was removed and cells were further incubated with the AV in fresh medium. At 0, 4, and 24 h.p.i., cell cultures were collected and lysed in TNT buffer (20 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.2 M NaCl, 1% Triton X100) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). Total intracellular proteins (20–30 μg) were separated by 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and electroblotted. After incubation with rabbit antiserum specific for ASFV proteins induced late in the infection, membranes were exposed to horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antirabbit antibody (Amersham) and revealed by ECL autoradiography.</p>
