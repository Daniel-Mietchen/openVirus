<p>In the case of FMDV-specific proteins, BHK21 cells were pre-treated with 10 μM LG for 1 h and infected with C-S8 isolate (M.O.I. of 1 pfu/cell) in the presence of 10 μM LG as indicated above. Cell extracts were collected and the blotted proteins incubated with MABs SD6 or 2D2 (specific for VP1 and 3C FMDV proteins, respectively) (
