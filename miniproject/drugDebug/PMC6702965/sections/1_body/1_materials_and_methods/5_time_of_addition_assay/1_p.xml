<p>To address the step in the virus cycle targeted by each AV, susceptible cell monolayers (Vero for ASFV or BHK and IBRS2 for FMDV) were infected with virus at a M.O.I. of 2 (ASFV) or 0.1, 1, or 5 (FMDV) pfu/cell. After adsorption, the inoculum was removed and cells were further incubated. At different times (from 3 h before infection to 24 h after infection), AVs were added to duplicate wells at the selected inhibitory concentration (10 μM LG, 20 mM VPA, or 25 μM CRL), and the cultures were further incubated until 24 h post-infection (h.p.i.), collected, and the total virus productivity evaluated by plaque assay.</p>
