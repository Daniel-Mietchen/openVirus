<p>Cell viability determinations were performed by the MTT assay, as described (
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">Hurtado et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, cell monolayers were grown on 96-well plates before the addition of the AV (six wells for each dose). After 24 h of incubation, MTT-containing culture medium was added and cells were incubated for 2 h and lysed with SDS-containing lysis solution. Absorbance at 550 nm was determined after 15 min of incubation, and average values (from six wells) obtained were subtracted from the background levels (in the absence of cells) and compared with the data scored in the absence of drug (100% viability). CC
 <sub>50</sub> values (concentration of AV yielding a 50% of cell viability) shown in 
 <xref rid="tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> were determined from the viability curves of each cell line with each AV (
