<p>Conventional antiviral drugs (AVs) that interfere with viral proteins or functions have been developed against a number of different animal viral diseases, but these compounds often lead to selection of drug resistance in virus populations evolving under selective pressures (

An alternative approach is the identification of compounds targeted against cellular functions required for viruses to complete their multiplication cycle. Hence, an efficient non-conventional cell-targeted antiviral would inhibit viral entry and/or replication at a non-toxic concentration for the cell and, ideally, it would help to control a wide variety of viral diseases and virus strains. Following this approach, we have focused our studies on three compounds: lauryl gallate (LG), valproic acid (VPA), and cerulenin (CRL) (
