  <p>Inhibition of vesicular porcine viruses production by LG. BHK21 or IBRS-2 cell monolayers were incubated for 1 h with LG (0–40 μM) and then infected with FMDV C-S8 or O-UK isolates, VSV Indiana strain or SVDV SP93 isolate in medium containing the same LG concentrations. Total virus produced at 24 h.p.i. was titrated by plaque assay on BHK21 (for FMDV C-S8 and VSV) or IBRS-2 (for FMDV O-UK and SVDV) cell monolayers in duplicate samples, and represented as relative virus yield (%). The viability of non-infected BHK21 or IBRS-2 cells incubated in the same conditions, assayed by MTT, is also represented as cell viability (%).</p>
