 <caption> In vivo model for FMDV inhibition by LG. (A) Survival curves of C57 mice ( n = 10) injected i.p. with a dose of 100 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg of LG once daily for 3 (group 0) or 4 (group −1) consecutive days. Mice were challenged with 1,000 pfu of FMDV C-S8 following 1 h (groups 0) or 24 h (group −1) after administration of LG, and were monitored daily for survival rate and clinical score. (B) RNA quantification. At day 2 p.i., three mice from the two groups that were inoculated or not, 24 h previous to infection (−1) with 100 mg/ml of LG, were bled and euthanized. RNA was extracted from blood, spleen, thymus, heart, and lung and quantified by RT-qPCR. Statistically significant differences in the number of VRC (viral RNA copies) per ml of blood or per mg of tissue between control and LG-treated animals are indicated by asterisks (Student’s t-test, * p &lt; 0.05). Detection limit is indicated as a discontinuous line. </caption>
