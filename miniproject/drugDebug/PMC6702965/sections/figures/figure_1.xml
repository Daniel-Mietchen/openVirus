  <p>Inhibition of ASFV production by different AVs. Vero or COS cell monolayers were incubated for 1 h with LG (0–40 μM), VPA (0–50 mM), or CRL (0–50 μM) and then infected with ASFV Ba71V or E70 strains, in medium containing the same AV concentration. Total virus produced at 24 h.p.i. was titrated by plaque assay on Vero or COS cell monolayers in duplicate samples and represented as virus yield (%). The viability of non-infected Vero or COS cells incubated in the same conditions, assayed by MTT, is also represented as cell viability (%).</p>
