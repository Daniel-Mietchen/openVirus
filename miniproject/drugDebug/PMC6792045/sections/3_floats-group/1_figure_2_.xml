  <p>Histopathological and immunohistochemical examination (200×). After the 3-day-old neonatal mice were i.m. challenged with a lethal dose of YT226R. Tissue samples from the lungs (A), hind limb muscle (B), spinal muscle (C) and heart (D) were subjected to pathology analysis. No obvious histological changes (E–H) were observed in each tissue of the negative control group. The IHC analysis indicated that the viral antigen was differentially distributed in affected tissues: hind limb muscle (I), spine muscle (J) and brain (K), but not in intestine (L). Results for noninfected mice were employed as a negative control (M–P).</p>
