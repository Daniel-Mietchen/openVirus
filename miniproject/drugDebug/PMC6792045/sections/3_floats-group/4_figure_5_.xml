  <p>Anti-CVA4 effects of ribavirin and cytokines 
   <italic>in vitro</italic>. One hour after the RD cells were challenged with YT226R, ribavirin and different cytokines were added, respectively. CCK8 and qRT-PCR were employed to determine the inhibition rates of ribavirin and different cytokines on CVA4 replication (A), and the viral loads between 8 and 48â€…hpi (B), respectively.
