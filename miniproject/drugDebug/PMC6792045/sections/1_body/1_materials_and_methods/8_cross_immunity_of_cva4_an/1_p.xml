<p>YT226R (3.98 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) was inactivated by adding 37% formaldehyde (Sinopharm Group, Beijing, China) to viral suspensions to a final concentration of 250 μg/mL for 5 d at 37°C before mixing (1:1) with aluminium hydroxide gel (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA) to prepare the inactivated CVA4 whole-virus vaccine. A total of 150 µL of inactivated CVA4 vaccine (corresponding to 7.9 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse) was inoculated into 6-week-old adult mice (randomly selected), boosted once after two weeks, and the serum was collected after another two weeks. The CVA4 antiserum was heat-inactivated at 56°C for 30 min. The antibody titre of the antiserum was determined by microneutralization assay (geometric mean titre [GMT], 3444.32). The RD cells were placed in a 96-well plate (5000 cells/well) and cultured for 24 h. The antiserum was diluted 512-fold with MEM, and then added to RD cells, which were incubated for 2 h, before 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of CVA4, EVA71, CVA16 and CVA6 were added (MOI = 0.01), respectively. The supernatant was collected at 24, 48, and 72 hpi, respectively, 10-fold diluted and inoculated to RD cells in 96-well plates. The RD cells were observed for development of CPE, and the virus titre of each experimental group was calculated by the Reed-Muench method[
