<p>The 3-day-old neonatal mice were infected with 100 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of YT226R. After infection, the mice with clinical scores of 1–2 were selected for early treatment and the neonatal mice with clinical scores ≥3 were selected for late treatment. The CVA4 antiserum (GMT = 3444.32) was mixed with MEM at a ratio of 1:1, 1:10, 1:100 and 1:1000, respectively. The neonatal mice in each group were i.m. injected with 50 μL of serum. The antisera were injected again after 48 h. The body weights, clinical scores and survival rates of the neonatal mice in each group were recorded daily until 12 days post treatment (dpt). A 50% passive immunoprotective dose (ED
 <sub>50</sub>) of the CVA4 antiserum was calculated.
