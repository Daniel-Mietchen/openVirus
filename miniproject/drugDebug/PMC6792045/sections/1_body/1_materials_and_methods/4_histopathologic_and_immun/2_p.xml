<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed using an avidin–biotin–immunoperoxidase technique. Briefly, tissue sections were dewaxed, dehydrated, and microwaved for 20 min at 99°C in a citrate buffer. Polyclonal mouse anti-CVA10 antibody (1:100 dilution; Genecreate, Wuhan, China) was applied for 2 h at 37°C. A secondary biotinylated goat anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (1:1000 dilution; Beyotime, Shanghai, China) antibody was added, followed by avidin–biotin–peroxidase complex and 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride chromogen. Tissues were counterstained with haematoxylin.</p>
