<p>The 3-day-old neonatal mice were i.m. challenged with 100 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of YT226R. Ribavirin (100 μg), IL-1β (2000 U), IL-6 (1000 U), IFN-λ1 (1125 U), IFN-γ (833.25 U) and IFN-α2a (666.75 U) were injected 1 h after infection. At 1 dpi, the same amount of ribavirin and cytokines were re-injected. The body weights, clinical scores and survival rates of the neonatal mice were recorded daily until 13 dpi.
