<p>The 3-day-old neonatal mice were inoculated with 100 LD
 <sub>50</sub> of YT226R. Between 1 and 5 days post infection (dpi), following euthanization, the lungs, hind limb muscles, spine muscles, blood, intestine, brain and heart tissues of the mice were collected every 24 h. Total RNA was extracted from individual tissues of infected mice with TRIzol reagent (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) and reverse transcribed with random hexamers and Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) to generate cDNA in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The CVA4 load was detected by qRT-PCR using the primers 5′-GGCCTCACTCAGAGACATCTAACC-3′ and 5′-GTCTAGGGACCCATGCCCTCACT-3′. The fluorescent probe was FAM-TGGACAGCCCACCACCGCAAGTGT-BHQ1. The qRT-PCR reaction conditions were set up based on a previously published detection method for EVs [
 <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. A standard curve was established: 
 <italic>Y</italic>=−3.2995
 <italic>X</italic> + 30.96, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2 </sup>= 0.99, and the detection limit was 3.96 copies/µL.
