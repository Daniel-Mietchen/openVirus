<p>At present, there are no specific drugs for the clinical treatment of HFMD. HFMD is currently treated with broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, such as ribavirin [
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] and glucocorticoids [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which can cause damage to the innate immune system [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and lead to haematopoietic system disorders [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Prophylactic approaches employing vaccination to prevent EV transmission now exist [
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and are being combined with existing non-EV vaccines to simplify childhood vaccination regimes [
 <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Antiviral research on EVs is lacking and the establishment of CVA4 infection models for drug development and the examination of the immunogenicity of inactivated CVA4 vaccines is urgently needed. With the wide application of the inactivated EVA71 vaccine among children under five in China [
 <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], it is conceivable that the EV-associated HFMD pathogens will alter in the future as the immune protection can last for &gt;5 years [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Incidence rates of other EVs will likely increase gradually, therefore it is imperative to study the pathogenic mechanisms of other EVs, such as CVA4, and to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines accordingly. In the present study, a CVA4 neonatal murine model was established to analyse viral tissue tropism and pathology and to better elucidate the pathogenicity associated with CVA4 infection. Employing this infection model, we have evaluated the antiviral effects of immune sera and the protective effects of cytokines and maternal antibodies against CVA4.
