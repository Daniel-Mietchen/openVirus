<p>RD cells were first i.m. inoculated with 10
 <sup>2.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of YT226R at an MOI of 0.01, and then treated with ribavirin and a cytokine panel 48 hpi. The maximum inhibition rates of ribavirin and different cytokines on CVA4 replication were detected by the CCK8 method. The inhibition rates of ribavirin, IFN-α2a, IFN-γ, IL-1β, IFN-λ1 and IL-6 were found to be 93.03%, 92.37%, 91.03%, 48.38%, 66.60% and 72.19% (
 <xref rid="F0005" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>(A)), respectively. At the same time, the viral loads in the supernatants from each group were determined, which demonstrated that the viral copy numbers in the cells treated with IFN-λ1, IL-6 and IL-1β were significantly higher than those in the cells treated by ribavirin, IFN-α2a and IFN-γ (
