<p>Neonatal mice were challenged with a lethal dose of YT226R, and therapeutic doses of ribavirin, IFN-α2a and IL-1β were injected twice (1 h and 2 dpi) via the i.m. route. By 13 dpi, the survival rates of the mice were 80%, 82%, 50%, and the clinical scores were 1.25, 1.47, and 2.50, respectively, and the body weight showed a significant upward trend for the groups treated with ribavirin, IFN-α2a, and IL-1β (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The mice treated by IFN-γ, IFN-λ1 and IL-6 showed severe clinical symptoms and all died before 13 dpi. Therefore, compared with ribavirin, IFN-α2a could also inhibit the replication of CVA4
