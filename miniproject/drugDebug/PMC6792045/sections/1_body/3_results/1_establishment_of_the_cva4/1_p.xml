<p>In order to optimize the challenge dose, the 3-day-old neonatal mice were administered 10-fold serial dilutions (10
 <sup>7.0</sup>-10
 <sup>3.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/ml) of the CVA4 strain YT226R (D2 genotype, see Figure S1 in the supplemental material) via the i.m. route. The group with challenge doses ≥10
 <sup>5.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse began to exhibit clinical symptoms ≤2 dpi, while the group with a challenge dose of 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse began to show symptoms at 3–4 dpi and all animals died by 8 dpi (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(A–C)). Compared with the other groups, the group with the challenge dose of 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse had milder clinical symptoms with a longer duration of illness. The symptoms included a moribund state, ataxia, nerve and single or double hind limb paralysis. Hence, the titre of 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse was chosen as the optimal challenge dose. The 3-day-old neonatal mice were next challenged with 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse via the i.m., i.p. and i.c. routes, respectively. The mice in the i.m. group began to exhibit neurological symptoms at 3 dpi and all died by 8 dpi. The mice in both the i.p. and i.c. groups died ≥10 dpi (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(D–F)). Hence, the i.m. route was chosen as the neonatal mice were more susceptible to CVA4 via this route. In order to optimize the age of the neonatal mice, 1-, 3-, 7- and 9-day-old neonatal mice were challenged with a dose of 10
 <sup>4.0</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mouse via the i.m. route. All 3-day-old neonatal mice died by 8 dpi, while the 7- and 9-day-old neonatal mice had mortality rates ≤50% at 12 dpi with clinical scores ≤3 (
 <xref rid="F0001" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>(G–I)). Furthermore, due to the large variance and uneven distribution of the data for the 1-day-old neonatal mice, the 3-day-old neonatal mice were selected for the infection model.
