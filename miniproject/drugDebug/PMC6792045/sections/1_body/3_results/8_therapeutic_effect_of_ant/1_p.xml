<p>After challenge with a lethal dose of YT226R, 3-day-old neonatal mice with a clinical score of ≤2 were twice injected with CVA4 antiserum treatment (GMT = 3444.32) with dilution ratios of 1:1, 1:10, 1:100, and 1:1000, respectively. At 12 dpt, the clinical scores were 0, 0, 0.63, and 3.75, and the survival rates were 100%, 100%, 85%, and 25%, respectively (
 <xref rid="F0009" ref-type="fig">Figure 9</xref>), and the calculated ED
 <sub>50</sub> was 199.05. Although the clinical symptoms of the neonatal mice were delayed after late treatment of antiserum (clinical score ≥3), the mice treated with 1:1, 1:10, and 1:100 dilutions of sera died by 10, 9 and 7 dpt, respectively. The results suggested that antibody treatment should be administered in the early stages of viral infection to mitigate development of severe disease.
