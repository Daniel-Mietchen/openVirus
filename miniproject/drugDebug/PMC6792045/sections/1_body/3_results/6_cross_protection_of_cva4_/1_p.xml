<p>In order to test whether anti-CVA4 antiserum can neutralize CVA4, CVA6, CVA16 and EVA71 infection, a 512-fold dilution of antiserum (GMT = 3444.32) was incubated with these EVs following inoculation in RD cells for 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively and the viral titre in cell supernatants was determined by assessment of CPE. Antiserum was found to significantly neutralize the infectivity of CVA4: CPE was not observed at 24, 48 and 72 h after CVA4 was co-incubated with antiserum. However, the CVA4 antiserum did not neutralize CVA6, CVA16 and EVA71 (
