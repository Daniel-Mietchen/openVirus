<p>In order to monitor the changes of CVA4 viral loads in different organs by qRT-PCR, the lungs, hind limb muscles, spine muscles, blood, intestine, brain and heart tissues were separated between 1 and 5 dpi after the mice were i.m. administered with a lethal dose of YT226R. The results showed that the viral copy number in each organ was low at 1 dpi. The viral load in the blood was the highest, leading to viremia. At later time points, the virus spread and replicated rapidly, and the copy number peaked and stabilized at 3 dpi (
 <xref rid="F0003" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Among the organs, the hind limb muscle had the highest viral loads with copy numbers of 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mg from 3 to 5 dpi, which was &gt;2–3 log
 <sub>10</sub> greater than those in other organs over the same period. CVA4 in the intestine showed a relatively low level of replication (27.267–429.256 copies/mg). The CVA4 copy number in the brain increased significantly after 2 dpi, reaching 1167.851 copies/mg, showing a high level of replication during 2–7 dpi. The results indicate that CVA4 has a pronounced tropism for muscle tissue and the rapid replication of the virus in the hind limb musculature causes rupture and hind limb paralysis.
