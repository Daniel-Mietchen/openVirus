<p>In order to detect the changes in expression of cytokines during CVA4 infection, cytokines in PB of the neonatal mice at different time points (1–7 dpi) were detected by ELISA. The results showed that the expression levels of IFN-γ and IL-6 were low in the early stages of infection (1 dpi), and then increased to peaks of 4800 and 1020 pg/mL, respectively, by 3 dpi which were significantly higher than those of the negative control group (

There were no significant changes in the expression of IL-10 in the infected neonatal mice between 1 and 7 dpi compared with those of the negative control group (
