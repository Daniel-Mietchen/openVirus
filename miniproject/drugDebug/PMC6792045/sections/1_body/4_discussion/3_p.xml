<p>Ribavirin is a hypoxanthine nucleoside analog which acts as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug inducing lethal mutations during viral RNA replication [
 <xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Ribavirin inhibits EVA71 replication and reduces paralysis and mortality rates in EVA71-infected mice [
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. It has been clinically applied in the treatment of HFMD and has anti-CVA4 effect 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, these nucleoside drugs have side effects with long-term administration leading to haematopoietic dysfunction and allergic reactions in children [
 <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Surprisingly, IFN-α2a had strong anti-CVA4 effects (comparable to ribavirin), which significantly reduced the copy number of CVA4. Our 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments showed that IFN-α2a could inhibit CVA4 replication and increase the survival rates of neonatal mice. It is important to note that the protective effect of cytokines is closely related to the time of administration [
 <xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The antiviral effects of cytokines (such as IFN-γ and IL-6) mainly functioned in the early stage of viral infection and when administered in the later stages, the cytokines did not alleviate symptoms but instead, led to further deterioration of the disease, which may be due to aggravated immunopathology [
