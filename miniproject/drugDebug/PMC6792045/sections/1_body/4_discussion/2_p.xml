<p>In the present study, we found that CVA4 had a copy number of up to 10
 <sup>6</sup> copies/mg tissue in the musculature, which was associated with rupture and necrosis of muscle fibres and muscle bundles. Despite the relatively low viral load in the lungs (10
 <sup>3</sup> copies/mg), the mice showed severe diffuse alveolar damage and moderate inflammatory infiltration. EV infections can induce the expression of proinflammatory cytokines as part of the innate immune response and immune regulation to eliminate viruses. However, it is thought that the overwhelming viral replication combined with increased levels of cytokines is one of the key factors inducing severe HFMD [

 <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41–43</xref>.] In this study, the expression levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IFN-γ were abnormally high after the lethal dose of CVA4 was administered to neonatal mice. This phenomenon is similar to that observed in children infected with EVA71, in which the expression of IL-6 and IFN-γ in serum was significantly elevated [
 <xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Some researchers have proposed that sustained high levels of IL-6 alone can cause severe tissue damage. In support of this, anti-IL-6 treatments significantly reduce tissue damage and enhance immune cell activity [
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Similarly, we found that mice challenged with CVA4 had higher clinical scores after treatment with exogenous IL-6 which accelerated the death of the neonatal mice. In addition, after EV infection in human neuronal cells, the expression levels of IFN-γ secreted by Th1 cells is increased, inhibiting the secretion of IL-4 by Th2 cells and resulting in an imbalance of the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio. While the infected cells were rapidly cleared, contemporaneously, excessive inflammatory reactions and cellular immune responses were also produced [
 <xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The expression level of IL-4 was significantly lower in the CVA4-infected mice than that in the control group (mean value: 73.5 vs 165.4 pg/mL) in this study. Therefore, we consider that the CVA4-induced high levels of IL-6 and an imbalance of the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio are likely correlated with severe pathological damages.
