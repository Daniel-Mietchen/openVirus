<p>With the increasing incidence of CVA4, inoculation with an inactivated CVA4 vaccine may be the most effective measure to prevent infections. A previous study found that human antibodies against EVA71 and CVA16 infections were detected in the serum after 35 weeks of pregnancy [

The inactivated CVA4 vaccine developed in this study also induced protective antibodies in adult female mice and could be passed on to offspring to protect the pups from the lethal dose of CVA4 challenge. Importantly, the protection rate of pups challenged with both homologous and heterologous CVA4 strains was 100%. However, it did not have neutralizing ability against CVA16, EVA71 and CVA6 strains. Therefore, developing multivalent vaccines using different antigens which elicit balanced immunological responses and afford equivalent protection to each target are urgently needed.
