 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. Its antiviral activity mode was studies in a few cases. Its ability to inhibit HCV by limiting the activity of some heat shock proteins (HSPs) produced by cells in response to exposure to stress which were involved in NS5A (nonstructural protein 5A)-mediated viral IRES (internal ribosome entry site) translation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] is one well-known mechanism. Another mechanism involved the inhibition of HCV NS3 protease and HCV replication in a sub-genomic HCV RNA replicon cell system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. Quercetin also inhibits various steps of the rhinoviruses pathogenesis, i.e., endocytosis, viral genome transcription, and protein synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. In another case, quercetin was shown to have a more specific mode of action, reducing the replication of dengue virus type-2, but not the processes of viral attachment and entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>].
