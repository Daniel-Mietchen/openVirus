<p id="Par12">Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] tried to increase the oral bioavailability of the low solubility flavonoid apigenin. Different water-in-oil-in-water emulsions of apigenin were studied for their physical characteristics, as well as digestibility using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> digestion model and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> pharmacokinetics in rats. An emulsion of soybean oil-Tween 80 was chosen for pharmacokinetic tests in animal model after proving better stability in terms of particle size and zeta potential. Plasma concentrations of apigenin in the water-in-oil emulsion were markedly higher at different time points and maximal concentration was 9-fold higher compared to apigenin suspension [
