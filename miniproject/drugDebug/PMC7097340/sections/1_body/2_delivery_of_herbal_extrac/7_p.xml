<p id="Par17">Andrographolide is sparingly soluble in water, unstable in very acidic and basic conditions, poorly absorbed, and has low oral bioavailability. PLGA (poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)) was used to form andrographolide loaded microspheres to overcome these limitations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> andrographolide-microsphere formulation exhibited sustained release profile over 9 days, with just 14% andrographolide release over the first 8 h, because of low drug density at the surface of the delivery system, which also allowed a relatively high oral bioavailability of 67.5%. Lastly, fine correlation was obtained between 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> drug release and 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> absorption, indicating that the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay may be a good predictor of drug absorption
