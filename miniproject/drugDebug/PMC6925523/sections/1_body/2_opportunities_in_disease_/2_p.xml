<p>There exists a range of disorders which could potentially benefit from (i) therapeutic-targeting of dysfunctional mitochondria, (ii) modulation of mitochondrial metabolism or (iii) the delivery of antioxidants to reduce oxidative stress-induced damage [

The treatments of epilepsy and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) deficiency are good examples of the therapeutic benefits of modulating mitochondrial metabolism, where dietary alterations to a ketogenic diet cause increased fatty acid utilization and alleviation of symptoms [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> where two drugs bithionol and meclizine are added to Ewings sarcoma cancer cell lines. This is an effect we observed with many drugs emphasizing the potential of increasing mitochondrial function at low drug doses. At each glucose condition tested, bithionol and meclizine at higher doses inhibit oxygen consumption (i.e. little change in fluorescence lifetime over time). However, at low drug doses, respiration can be enhanced and the response is shown to vary with both glucose level and cell type. This is an effect we observed with many drugs emphasizing the potential of increasing mitochondrial function at low drug doses. In agreement with this data, meclizine inhibits mitochondrial respiration
