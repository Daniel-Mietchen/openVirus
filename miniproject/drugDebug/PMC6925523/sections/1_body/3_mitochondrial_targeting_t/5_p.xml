<p>Epigenetic dysregulation is a feature of almost all human cancers [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], and while ROS is a well-known genotoxin at excess levels, other mitochondrial metabolites have also proved to be oncogenic [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. The tricarboxylic acid cycle metabolites such as succinate, fumarate and 2-hydroxyglutarate all inhibit Î±-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes and interfere with their control over epigenetic regulation. Importantly, the result of this interference leads to post-translational protein modifications and the activation of oncogenic transcription factors. These include Jumonji domain histone lysine demethylases, stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor A and succination of kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 activating the oncogenic nuclear factor erythroid 2-related protein 2 [

Efficient mitochondrial function is dependent on optimal mitochondrial ribosomal translation and assembly of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Topoisomerases, which are required for efficient DNA replication and RNA transcription, also play a crucial role in the tumorigenic process. Mitochondrial topoisomerase IB (TOP1MT) is a nuclear encoded, exclusively mitochondrial localized enzyme which is found overexpressed in some tumour types. Baechler et al. [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] showed that HCT116 colon cancer cells had decreased tumour growth and cell proliferation in TOP1MT knockout models, therefore providing further proof of the importance of mitochondrial function in cancer progression.
