<p>Oxidative stress is a hallmark of cancer cells as elevated ROS activates signalling pathways such as the epidermal growth factor receptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase which promote cell growth and proliferation [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>]. Antioxidant systems in cells, such as the thioredoxin and glutathione system, allow cells to cope with excessive ROS production in both malignant and healthy cells [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. Elevated ROS in cancer cells is what differentiates malignant cells from healthy cells. Thus, it is thought that the inhibition of antioxidant systems in cancer cells would cause an overload of ROS-induced damage leading to apoptosis in cancer cells only. NSC130362, a small molecule glutathione inhibitor, is one such treatment developed to test this hypothesis. NSC130362 suppressed growth of cancer cell lines and hindered tumour growth

 <italic>ex vivo</italic> leukaemia cells to other anticancer drugs and potentiated their cytotoxic effects [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. These results suggest that the induction of additional oxidative stress in tumour cells may provide a therapeutic benefit. Furthermore, using potent antivirals or antibiotics which possess off-target ROS-producing effects in the mitochondria, for example doxorubicin, may cause the accumulation of ROS beyond the antioxidant capacity of malignant cells and result in apoptosis [

 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. These drugs will induce oxidative stress in healthy cells also; however, the malignant cells already have elevated ROS such that the additional levels will exceed a critical threshold, while healthy cells will survive as oxidative stress is low.
