     <bold>Importance of the field:</bold> Understanding the mechanisms of drug-induced mitochondrial toxicity is a highly important field for the development of new therapeutic agents with lower toxicity, as this is vital for patient safety and the development of successful therapeutics. Exploring opportunities of the off-target effects of current drugs is just as vital. Advancements in disease treatment in the last century have left few new drug targets available; therefore, rethinking new uses for the current drugs available is crucial.

     <bold>Current thinking:</bold> Overall, we believe that there is considerable evidence that current drugs carrying black box warnings of mitochondrial toxicity are a growing opportunity. Drugs indirectly affecting mitochondria have been recently used as a main mode of action to treat diseases such as type 2 diabetes and cancer, as well as up-regulating the immune system to clear infection with promising success; however, considerable caution must be taken when inducing mitochondrial dysfunction for disease treatment because of the vital dependency normal cells have on mitochondrial function.

     <bold>Future direction:</bold> Presently, most drug therapy literature rightfully keys in on adverse side effects and the avoidance of mitochondrial toxicity. It is important going forward that we better understand the role and function of mitochondria in both health and the disease states in order to better take advantage of opportunities and potential therapeutic benefits of mitochondrial and metabolic manipulation
