<p>Mitochondrial off-target effects are also observed with anti-psychotic drugs. Anti-psychotic drugs became the standard of care for psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and mood disorders in the 1950s with the development of chlorpromazine, the first anti-psychotic. However, adverse effects originating from the mitochondria soon became apparent as metabolic disturbances caused by mitochondrial membrane depolarization and swelling were observed [
