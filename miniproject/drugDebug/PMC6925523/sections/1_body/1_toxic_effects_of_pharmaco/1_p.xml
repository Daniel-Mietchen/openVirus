<p>Drug therapy has clear beneficial effects by causing remission of many diseases and improvement in symptom management; however, as patient life expectancy increases, long-term side effects of treatments have emerged. Mitochondrial dysfunction can result from different drug types through a variety of mechanisms, summarized in 
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757TB1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. Antiviral therapy using nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) can successfully control virus levels, and the development of this antiviral therapy approach proved to be a major cornerstone in reducing the morbidity and mortality of various viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there is a risk of NRTI-induced inhibition of human DNA polymerases due to structural conservation between human and viral polymerases and the disruption of dNTP pools [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Polymerase inhibition has led to the well-supported ‘DNA pol-γ hypothesis’ of mitochondrial dysfunction, where NRTI treatment inhibits DNA pol-γ in mitochondria and results in mtDNA depletion [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. It was found that early HIV treatments had substantial levels of toxicity, such that 25% of patients discontinued their antiviral regime due to the toxicity or from non-compliance [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Other HIV treatments have been withdrawn completely due to associated mitochondrial toxicity, the antiretroviral drug zalcitibine being a key example [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The clinical development of new antiviral agents to treat viral infection produced compounds such as tenofovir, which has minimal mitochondrial toxicity compared with zalcitabine and didanosine [
 <xref rid="BST-47-1757C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Tenofovir is used in combination with other NRTI antivirals such as abacavir and lamivudine in modern HIV therapy, all of which report lower mitochondrial toxicity than previous NRTIs [
