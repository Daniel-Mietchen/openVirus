  <title>Key features of mitochondrial structure and function of the ETC.</title>
  <p>Key structures of the mitochondrion are represented in (
   <bold>A</bold>), while (
   <bold>B</bold>) depicts the structure of the OXPHOS system and its functioning. Oxidative phosphorylation complexes represent reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) dehydrogenase (I), succinate dehydrogenase (II), cytochrome 
   <italic>c</italic> reductase (III), cytochrome 
   <italic>c</italic> oxidase (IV) and ATP synthase (V) where Q represents coenzyme Q and cyt 
   <italic>c</italic> represents cytochrome 
   <italic>c</italic>. In (
   <bold>B</bold>), black arrows show the transfer of electrons between complexes while red arrows show the transfer of protons throughout the chain for the eventual production of ATP and H
   <sub>2</sub>O. Features are not to scale.
