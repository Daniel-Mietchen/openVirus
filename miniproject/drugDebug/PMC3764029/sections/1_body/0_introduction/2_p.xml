<p>The standard therapy for the treatment of chronically HCV infected patients consists of a combination of pegylated interferon alpha and ribavirin

Given the side effects associated with injections of interferon, an interferon-free regimen for the treatment of HCV infections is highly desirable. Recent studies have shown that ribavirin in combination with other antiviral drugs, without interferon, can be efficacious

 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Zeuzem2" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, suggesting that an interferon-free therapy containing ribavirin could be adopted in the near future. However, generation of drug resistant mutants and cross resistance to different drugs could impair the efficacy of the treatment. In addition, the anti HCV mechanism of action of ribavirin is not completely elucidated. Several mechanisms of action of ribavirin against HCV were proposed including a direct effect against the HCV RNA dependent RNA polymerase (NS5b); induction of misincorporation of nucleotides leading to lethal mutagenesis; depletion of intracellular guanosine triphosphate pools; alteration in the cytokine balance from a Th2 profile to a Th1 profile; and up-regulation of genes involved in interferon signaling
