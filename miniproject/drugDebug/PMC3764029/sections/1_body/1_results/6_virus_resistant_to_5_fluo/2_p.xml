<p>We analyzed each of the ten positions where nucleotide substitutions leading to amino-acid changes were found in HCV-5FU-1-P6 by sequencing viruses recovered after passage 1, 2, 3, and 4 of HCV-RR2 in 2.5 Âµg/ml 5-Fluorouracil, and by sequencing HCV-5FU-1 (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074027-t002">Table 2</xref>). All the mutations found in HCV-5FU-1-P6 were already found in HCV-5FU-1, with the exception of T2080T/A and Y2293Y/H. Some of the mutations found in HCV-5FU-1 (and HCV-5FU-1-P6) were present at early passages of HCV-RR2 in 5-Fluorouracil, as L133F in the core protein, M405R in E2, and P2268L and G2397R in NS5a. Mutation T2715A in NS5b appeared after passage 3.
