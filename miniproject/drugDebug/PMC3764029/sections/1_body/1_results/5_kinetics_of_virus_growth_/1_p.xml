<p>We also studied the kinetics of the growth of J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 in concentrations of 0, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 µM of 2′-C-Methylcytidine for one week as described in the material and methods section. Similar growth curves were observed for J6/FH1 and HCV-RR2 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The result indicates that both viruses have a similar sensitivity to 2′-C-Methylcytidine by passage one. At later passages, J6/JFH1 seems to have a slight advantage over HCV-RR2 (
