<p>The enhanced growth of HCV-RR2 in 5-Fluorouracil (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g001">Figure 1</xref>) prompted us to obtain a 5-Fluorouracil HCV resistant virus. To that end, we subjected HCV-RR2 to six passages of 7 days each in Huh7D cells treated with 2.5 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil followed by a) one passage of 7 days in medium containing no 5-Fluorouracil to obtain HCV-5FU-1 or b) two passages (of 3 and 7 days) in medium containing no 5-Fluorouracil to obtain HCV-5FU-2. These last passages in medium containing no drug were performed in order to increase the titer of the viruses. Viruses were titrated to 2.2×10
 <sup>3</sup> ffu/ml and 2.5×10
 <sup>3</sup> ffu/ml respectively. In order to test whether the HCV-5FU obtained viruses were truly resistant to 5-Fluorouracil, J6/JFH1, HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU-1 and HCV-5FU-2 were grown in 0, 1.5, 2 and 2.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil by serially passaging the viruses every 7 days in naïve Huh7D cells as described for the experiment shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Virus growth was assessed by immunofluorescence (not shown) and by titration of the supernatants from each passage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g003">Figure 3</xref>). All viruses grew in medium containing 0 or 1.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil. HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU-1 and HCV-5FU-2 grew in 2 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil, while J6/JFH1 was extinct by passage 4. Only HCV-5FU-1 and HCV-5FU-2 grew in 2.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil. This result indicates that viruses recovered from 5-Fluorouracil treated cells were more resistant to 5-Fluorouracil than parental HCV-RR2.
