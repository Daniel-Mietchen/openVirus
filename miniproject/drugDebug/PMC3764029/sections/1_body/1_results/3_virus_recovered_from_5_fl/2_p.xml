<p>HCV-5FU-1 and HCV-5FU-2 that were passed six times in 2.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil in the experiment shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g003">Figure 3</xref> (designated HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6) were further tested for their resistance to 2.5 µg/ml and 3 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil in Huh7D cells. All viruses grew in the absence of 5-Fluorouracil. As seen for HCV-5FU-1 and HCV-5FU-2, HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6 grew in 2.5 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil achieving titers higher than 10
 <sup>3</sup> ffu/ml, while J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 did not grow. Furthermore, HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6 grew in 3 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil achieving titers higher than 10
 <sup>2</sup> and 10
 <sup>3</sup> ffu/ml respectively, while J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 did not grow (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We conclude that we isolated viruses that are resistant to concentrations as high as 3 µg/ml 5-Fluorouracil. HCV-5FU viruses grow to at least parental (J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2) levels in the absence of the drug (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and are still resistant to ribavirin (not shown).
