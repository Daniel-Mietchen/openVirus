<p>In order to test the sensitivity of an HCV ribavirin resistant mutant to 5-Fluorouracil, parental J6/JFH1 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Lindenbach2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref> and J6/JFH1 derived HCV-RR2 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> were grown in zero, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil by serially passaging the viruses every 7 days in naïve Huh7D cells 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> as described in the materials and methods section. Virus growth was assessed by immunfluorscence (not shown) and by titration of virus present in the supernatants from each passage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0074027-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Both viruses grew similarly in medium containing no 5-Fluorouracil. HCV-RR2 grew to higher titers than J6/JFH1 in medium containing 0.5, 1, and 2 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil. Neither virus survived a concentration of 5 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil. The experiment was repeated several times and similar results were obtained. The result indicates that HCV-RR2 is more resistant to 5-Fluorouracil than parental J6/JFH1.
