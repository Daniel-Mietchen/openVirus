<p>We studied the 5-Fluorouracil resistant phenotype of HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6 by determining the kinetics of the growth of J6/JFH1, HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6 in a concentration of 0, 2, and 3 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil for one week as described in the material and methods section. By days 5 and 7, HCV-5FU-1-P6 and HCV-5FU-2-P6 reached titers that were more than 1 log higher than J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 in medium containing concentrations of 2 and 3 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil (
