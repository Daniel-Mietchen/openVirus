<p>We isolated an HCV mutant resistant to 5-Fluorouracil (HCV-5FU). To our knowledge, no 5-Fluorouracil resistant viruses, including HCV, have been previously reported. When compared to its parental HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU acquired 33 mutations in the coding region, 10 of which encoded amino-acid changes. Of note, all the 38 mutations acquired by HCV-RR2 when compared to its parental J6/JFH1 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref> were maintained in HCV-5FU even after several passages for selection (see above, results, and 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074027-t001">Table 1</xref>). We don’t know which mutation/s confer resistance to 5-Fluorouracil. Six of the ten non-synonymous mutations acquired by HCV-5FU are located in non-structural proteins NS5a and NS5b (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0074027-t001">Table 1</xref>). Mutation A8483G encodes a change from threonine to alanine at amino-acid 273 of NS5b, which, according to its crystal structure, is located in the finger domain

 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Biswal1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. HCV-RR2 acquired mutation G7710A which encodes a mutation at amino-acid 15 of NS5b, also located in the finger domain 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Feigelstock1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Mutations in the finger domain have been identified in ribavirin resistant mutants of poliovirus

 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Vignuzzi1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. Five other non-synonymous mutations observed in HCV-5FU are located in positions corresponding to domains I (one mutation), II (three mutations) and III (one mutation) of NS5a 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Tellinghuisen1" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. Although the role of NS5a has not been completely elucidated, it is known that NS5a is essential for HCV replication, interacts with other HCV and cellular proteins forming multiprotein replication complexes

 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Enomoto1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Therefore, NS5a mutations carried by HCV-5FU may alter its interaction with other viral proteins as NS5b, critical for viral replication.
