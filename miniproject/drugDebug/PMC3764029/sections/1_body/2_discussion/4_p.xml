<p>In FMDV, a single point mutation (M296I) confers resistance to ribavirin 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Sierra1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. This mutant was as sensitive as wild type FMDV to 5-fluorouracil when administered in combination with guanidine hydrochloride, indicating that mutation M296I did not confer a significant cross-resistance to 5-fluorouracil 
 <xref rid="pone.0074027-Perales1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. These and our results indicate that different viruses evolve to generate phenotypicaly different mutants to escape the action of antiviral drugs. Of note, the concentrations of ribavirin (5 mM) and 5-Fluorouracil (200 or 500 Âµg/ml) for the treatment of BHK-21 cells used by Perales and colleagues are between 1 and 3 orders of magnitude higher than those used in our study.
