<p>We found that HCV-RR2 was more resistant to the mutagen 5-Fluorouracil than its parental J6/JFH1. This indicates that determinants conferring resistance to ribavirin also confer resistance to 5-Fluorouracil and could confer resistance to other antiviral drugs. Cross resistance in HCV has been observed by other investigators. As an example, in the replicon system, an HCV mutant resistant to 2′-C-Methylcytidine showed cross-resistance to the nucleoside analog 2′-C-Methyladenosine but not to the nucleoside analog 4′-Azidocytidine (R1479), interferon α-2a, or to non-nucleoside HCV polymerase inhibitors

Given the observed efficacy of the inclusion of ribavirin in interferon free regimens in the treatment of chronic HCV, cross resistance of HCV to ribavirin and to other antiviral drugs could be of major importance.
