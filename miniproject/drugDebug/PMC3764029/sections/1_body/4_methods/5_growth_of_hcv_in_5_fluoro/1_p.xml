<p>Huh7D cells grown in a 12 well plate were mock infected or infected with J6/JFH1, HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU-1-P6, or HCV-5FU-2-P6 at a moi of 0.01. At 6 hours post infection, cells were washed three times with medium. After final wash, medium was replaced with 1.5 ml of medium containing a final concentration of zero, 2, or 3 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil or 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, or 10 µM concentration of 2′-C-Methylcytidine. At different days post infection, supernatants were taken from each well and stored at −70°C. Wells were supplemented with medium containing corresponding concentration of 5-Fluorouracil or 2′-C-Methylcytidine. Virus from each time point was titered as described below.</p>
