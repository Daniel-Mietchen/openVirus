 <caption> Growth of HCV in 2 and 3 µg/ml concentration of 5-Fluorouracil for one week. Huh7D cells were mock infected or infected with J6/JFH1, HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU-1-P6, and HCV-5FU-2-P6 at a m.o.i. of 0.01. After 6 hours, cells were washed with growth medium three times and left in a concentration of zero, 2, or 3 µg/ml of 5-Fluorouracil. 300 µl of each supernatant were collected at the indicated time points and frozen at −70°C. Wells were supplemented with 300 ul of medium containing corresponding concentration of 5-Fluorouracil. Virus was titered as described in the text. Titers are expressed as the mean number of foci of each of four replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation. </caption>
