  <title>Growth of HCV in different concentrations of 2′-C-Methylcytidine for one week.</title>
  <p>Huh7D cells were mock infected or infected with J6/JFH1 and HCV-RR2 at a m.o.i. of 0.01. After 6 hours, cells were washed with growth medium three times and left in a concentration of zero, 0.625, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and or 10 µM of 2′-C-Methylcytidine. 150 µl of each supernatant were collected at the indicated time points and frozen at −70°C. Wells were supplemented with 150 ul of medium containing corresponding concentration of 2′-C-Methylcytidine. Virus was titered as described in the text. Titers are expressed as the mean number of foci of each of four replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation.</p>
