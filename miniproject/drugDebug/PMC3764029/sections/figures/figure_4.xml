  <title>Further passage of HCV in 5-Fluorouracil yields viruses resistant to 3 Âµg/ml concentration of 5-Fluorouracil.</title>
  <p>J6/JFH1, HCV-RR2, HCV-5FU-1-P6, and HCV-5FU-2-P6 were serially passaged in Huh7D cells in medium containing the indicated concentration of 5-Fluorouracil. At each passage HCV titers were obtained as described in the text. Titers are expressed as the mean number of foci of each of four replicates. Error bars represent the standard deviation.</p>
