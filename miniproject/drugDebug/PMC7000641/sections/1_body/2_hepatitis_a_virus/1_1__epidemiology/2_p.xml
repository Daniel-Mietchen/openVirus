<p>HAV infection is prevalent around the world, but it shows various epidemiological patterns that depend on socioeconomic conditions [

Thus, to adopt appropriate vaccination policies, epidemiologists must ascertain the age-specific antiHAV seroprevalence rates in each country. In highly endemic areas, such as parts of Africa and Asia, the vaccine is not widely used as most adults acquire natural immunity. In areas of intermediate endemicity (such as Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and parts of Asia), childhood transmission is less frequent, while adolescents and adults are more frequently infected, and outbreaks are common. These countries with intermediate endemicity would benefit most from universal immunization of children. In areas of low endemicity (such as the United States and Western Europe), infection is less frequent, but the disease does occur among people in high-risk groups and as communitywide outbreaks. These countries with low endemicity may consider vaccinating high-risk adults.
