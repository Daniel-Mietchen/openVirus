 <p>Patients with IBD should be tested for HAV (IgG anti-HAV antibody) when they have no history of HAV vaccination or HAV hepatitis, or when the history of HAV vaccination is uncertain. In patients with IBD who are negative for the IgG anti-HAV antibody, vaccination should be administered (strong recommendation, very low level of evidence).</p>
