<p>In HAV, IgG antibodies appear early in the infection phase and remain throughout the patientâ€™s life, preventing disease. The decision to pursue prevaccination serological testing in adults should be based on the expected prevalence of immunity within the given population, as well as on the cost of vaccination compared with the cost of testing. According to rapid economic development in Korea, a rapid epidemiological shift in HAV infection has occurred [

 <xref rid="b23-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Most adults had immunity to HAV because of childhood exposure in 1980, but people in their teens or twenties had less than 10% of anti-HAV IgG in 2010 [
 <xref rid="b23-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Thus, the number of adult infected with acute hepatitis A has increased rapidly over the past decade. Since May 2015, HAV vaccination has been recommended for all children between 12 and 23 months in Korea, with high-risk groups being prioritized. Considering the age differences in anti-HAV seroprevalence, the cost of testing, and vaccine prices, those under 30 years of age, who have low HAV antibody rates, are recommended to receive the vaccine without prevaccination serological testing, while those over 40 years of age should undergo a prevaccination serological test and receive the vaccine if the antibody is absent [
