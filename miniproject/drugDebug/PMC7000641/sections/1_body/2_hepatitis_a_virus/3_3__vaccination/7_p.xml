<p>In general, routine anti-HAV IgG testing is not necessary after vaccination, since the seroconversion rate is very high after the standard 2-dose vaccinations. However, as described above, antibody production after vaccines may be reduced in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapies, thus measurement of anti-HAV IgG in such patients could be considered 4â€“6 weeks after a primary course of vaccinations [
