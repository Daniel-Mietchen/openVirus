<p>Immunosuppressive therapy can lower the antibody response rate of a vaccination. One study including 419 patients with IBD investigated the immunogenicity of the HAV vaccine [
 <xref rid="b34-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Patients were given the HAV vaccine at 0 and 6–12 months, and IgG anti-HAV antibody was measured 1 to 3 months after the second dose [
 <xref rid="b34-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The overall seroconversion rate was 97.6%, but it was significantly lower in patients treated with the antiTNF monoclonal antibody than in those not treated (92.4% vs. 99.1%, respectively; P= 0.001). Furthermore, the seroconversion rate was significantly lower in patients treated with ≥ 2 than with, &lt; 2 immunosuppresants (92.6% vs. 98.4%, P= 0.03). No significant differences in seroconversion rates were seen between patients treated with anti-TNF alone and those treated with anti-TNF plus other immunomodulators (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.2–5.6) [
 <xref rid="b34-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Therefore, the optimal timing to vaccinate patients with IBD against HAV may be at IBD diagnosis, and the vaccine is recommended to be administered prior to immunosuppressive therapy. If HAV vaccines were not available prior to immunosuppressive therapy, it also is recommended to be administered to patients with treated immunosuppression [
