<p>The risk of HBV reactivation depends on host factors, virological factors, and type and degree of immunosuppression [
 <xref rid="b83-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The host factors include male sex, older age, cirrhosis, and comorbidity requiring immunosuppressive therapy, such as malignancy and IBD [
 <xref rid="b84-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>,
 <xref rid="b85-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. Virological factors comprise high baseline HBV DNA level, HBeAg positivity [

 <xref rid="b88-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], and possibly HBV genotype [

 <xref rid="b91-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Clinicians should consider assessing host and virological risk factors to decide whether antiviral prophylaxis should be initiated before starting immunosuppressive therapy. Immunosuppression induces HBV reactivation in up to 50% of patients undergoing organ transplantations or anticancer chemotherapy if antiviral therapy is not administered [
 <xref rid="b2-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. HBV reactivation has been also reported in patients with rheumatological diseases or IBD who are receiving anti-TNF, such as infliximab, etanercept, or adalimumab [
 <xref rid="b86-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,

 <xref rid="b96-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. In two large, retrospective cohort studies, liver dysfunction occurred in 25%â€“36% of HBsAg-positive patients with IBD receiving immunosuppressive agents, including corticosteroids, immunomodulators, and anti-TNF, and more than 50% of patients who experienced HBV reactivation had liver failure [

 <xref rid="b97-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Importantly, most cases of HBV reactivation developed in patients receiving 2 or more immunosuppressive agents for a long period who were positive for HBV DNA and/or had not undergone antiviral prophylaxis. In contrast, HBV reactivation seems to be extremely rare in HBsAg-negative and anti-HBc-positive patients with IBD [
