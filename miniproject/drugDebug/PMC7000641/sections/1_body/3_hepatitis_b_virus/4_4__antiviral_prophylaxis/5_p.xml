<p>Long-term moderate-to-high dose corticosteroid therapy (oral prednisone â‰¥ 10 mg/day over 4 weeks) increases the risk of HBV reactivation in patients who are HBsAg-positive, or HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc positive [
 <xref rid="b98-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Long-term, low-dose corticosteroid therapy (oral prednisone of less than 10 mg/day over 4 weeks) may also increase the risk of reactivation up to 10% in patients who are HBsAg-positive [
 <xref rid="b99-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], which necessitates antiviral prophylaxis. In contrast, patients receiving shortterm oral prednisone over 1 week are at low risk of reactivation and do not need antiviral prophylaxis [
