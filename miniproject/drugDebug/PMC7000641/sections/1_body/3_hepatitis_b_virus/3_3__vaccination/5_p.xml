<p>The standard course of hepatitis B vaccination consists of 3 doses administered at 0, 1, and 6 months, and antibodies are usually produced in more than 90% of general population who vaccinated [

In previous study involving 148 patients, 41% of those receiving standard cycle of the commercial hepatitis B vaccine at 0, 1, and 6 months attained anti-HBs titers &gt; 10 IU/L, compared with 75% of patients receiving an accelerated double-dose protocol at 0, 1, and 2 months [
 <xref rid="b64-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. A study reported that the receiving accelerated double-dose at 0, 1, 2 months followed by revaccination (0, 1, and 2 months) at a double-dose if no adequate response is achieved has demonstrated a higher efficacy than the standard schedule [
