<p>Generally, immune response to vaccination in patients on immunomodulator monotherapy are not different from controls [

 <xref rid="b67-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. In patients receiving monotherapy with anti-TNF, some but not all studies have demonstrated a decreased immune response compared with controls or patients on 5-ASAs. The immunogenicity of inactivated vaccines may be preserved when administered on the same day as infusion of the anti-TNF, but it may be reduced when the full immunosuppressive effect of the inhibitor has developed after several weeks. This was observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but patients with ankylosing spondylitis revealed good antibody responses, regardless of the time of infliximab infusion [
 <xref rid="b68-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. In patients prescribed both an immunomodulator and anti-TNF agent, the immune response to vaccines is lower than in those on monotherapy with an immunomodulator, anti-TNF, or 5-ASAs [
 <xref rid="b69-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. In contrast, vedolizumab which shows gut-selective mechanism does not influence the response to parenterally administered HBV vaccine, but did reduce the response to oral cholera vaccine [
