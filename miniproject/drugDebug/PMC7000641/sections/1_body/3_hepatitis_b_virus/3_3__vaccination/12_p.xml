<p>Immunocompromised patients with IBD who have loss of seroprotection during follow-up should be advisable given a single booster dose, and clinicians should consider administering another vaccination series at the regular dose if antiHBs titers fail to rise sufficiently. A booster dose is an extra administration of a vaccine after an earlier (prime) vaccination, which differ from revaccination that requires an entire additional cycle (0, 1, and 6 months) of vaccination. T and B cell immune response to the vaccine booster dose is better preserved than that to primary vaccination, because more memory T and B cells are present, having been induced by the previous dose [
