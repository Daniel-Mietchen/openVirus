<p>To the patients in countries with moderate to high prevalence, test for HBV before starting immunosuppressive therapy is recommended [

 <xref rid="b44-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Moreover, reactivation of HBV infection, with serious consequences, has been reported in immunosuppressed patients with IBD [
 <xref rid="b45-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Therefore, all patients with IBD should be assessed for HBV infection (HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc) or immunization status. Patients who are positive for HBsAg, HBeAg, anti-HBe, and HBV DNA should also be evaluated [
 <xref rid="b2-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], as should HBV infection. Vaccination of the unimmunized patients is recommended, especially before biologic treatments are started [
 <xref rid="b2-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="b12-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The risk of HBV reactivation can be increased in patients who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy (including biologics) and are (1) HBsAg-positive or (2) HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc positive [
 <xref rid="b42-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. In one study, the rate of HBV reactivation during biologic treatments for patients with a rheumatic disease was 12.3% in HBsAg-positive plus anti-HBc positive patients [
 <xref rid="b46-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], while in another it was 1.7% in HBsAg-positive plus anti-HBc positive and HBsAg-negative plus anti-HBc positive patients [
 <xref rid="b47-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Therefore, both HBsAg and anti-HBc (IgG or total) should be tested. HBV DNA should be quantified in patients scheduled to start immunosuppressive therapy who are either HBsAg-positive or anti-HBc-positive at diagnosis [
 <xref rid="b3-ir-2019-09155" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].
