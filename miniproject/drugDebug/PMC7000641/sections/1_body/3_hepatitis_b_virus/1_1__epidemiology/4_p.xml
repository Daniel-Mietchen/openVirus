At younger ages, the positive rate of HBsAg was 2.2% in 1998, 1.9% in 2001, and 0.3% in 2016. In IBD patients, the prevalence of chronic HBV infection (positive HBsAg, positive anti-HBc, and negative anti-HBs) was 3.8% and past infection (negative HBsAg, positive anti-HBc, and positive or negative anti-HBs) was 26.2% [
