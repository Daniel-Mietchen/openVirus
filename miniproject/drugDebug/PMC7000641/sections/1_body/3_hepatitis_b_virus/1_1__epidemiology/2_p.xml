<p>HBV can be clinically classified as acute and chronic. In the acute phase, the virus may manifest as subacute, non-icteric hepatitis, icteric hepatitis, and sometimes fulminant hepatitis. The chronic phase can be an asymptomatic carrier phase, but it may also manifest as chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Both acute and chronic HBV infection may be accompanied by extrahepatic symptoms.</p>
