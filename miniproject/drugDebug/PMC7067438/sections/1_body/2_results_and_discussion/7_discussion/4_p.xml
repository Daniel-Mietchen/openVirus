<p>Our work extends prior work on antiviral treatment for RSV. Pretreatment and early treatment with antiviral drugs decreases clinical findings and lung histopathology. Treatment benefit decreases with time from inoculation initiated treatment on first detection of viral shedding by PCR again making antivirals of limited practical clinical use.[

 <italic>et al</italic> found decreased clinical scores with FPI monotherapy at one and three days post inoculation in a bovine model as measured by, however viral shedding was minimally decreased when treatment was started on day 3 post-inoculation.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Our results for FPI started as monotherapy at 5 days post inoculation were disappointingâ€”FPI alone performed similarly to NSAID alone and NSAIDS are much less expensive.
