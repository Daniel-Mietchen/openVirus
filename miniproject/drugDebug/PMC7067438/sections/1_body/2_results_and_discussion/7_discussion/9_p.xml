<p>Attempts to correlate the amount of RSV shedding with clinical disease severity have had mixed results.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Prior authors have shown that viral shedding can be effectively eliminated with the early use of monoclonal antibodies but that this does not necessarily translate into better clinical outcomes such as mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, need for supplemental oxygen, or pulmonary function testing.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Steroids and NSAIDs increase viral shedding but have either null or beneficial effects on various clinical outcomes such as mortality, need for hospitalization, respiratory distress, and subsequent recurrent wheezing.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] We observed that NSAIDs and FPI when started on day 5 as monotherapy had almost identical clinical scores despite diverging viral loads, +174, (95% CI -303, +651) in ibuprofen monotherapy started on day 5 group) and -146, (95% CI -631, +340) in FPI monotherapy started on day 5 group.
