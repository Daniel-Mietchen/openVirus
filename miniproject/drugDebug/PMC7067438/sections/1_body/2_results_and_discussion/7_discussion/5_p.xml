<p>In clinical practice NSAIDs are widely given in combination with antibiotics to animals with bovine respiratory disease complex.[

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In this case the primary benefits being sought are anti-inflammatory and antipyretic in the context of bacterial lung infection that frequently complicates bovine RSV.[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Similarly, the combination of doxycycline, an antibiotic, with ketoprofen, an NSAID, in the drinking water of piglets decreases the severity of porcine respiratory disease complex. Bacterial super infection complicates human RSV in at least 40% of those infants ill enough to require intubation. [

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Infants who are less ill are generally assumed to have only the virus and antibiotics are generally withheld; because such children are not intubated comparable data regarding bacteria in the lung are not available. Practical application of our results in bovines could potentially decrease antibiotic use if the diagnosis of bovine RSV can be made early enough to initiate treatment, and FPI manufacturers could be persuaded to make the FPI inexpensive enough for agricultural use. Equally, one could also imagine clinical reasoning resulting in combined NSAID, antiviral, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy, all being co-administered at the earliest clinical signs of respiratory infection.
