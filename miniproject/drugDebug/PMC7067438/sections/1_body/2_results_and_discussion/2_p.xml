 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0230245.g003">Fig 3</xref> shows the same scores after excluding the fever component from the clinical score. Our treatment arm analysis showed greater benefit in clinical scores and respiratory rate when treatment was initiated earlier, and the combination of ibuprofen and FPI was better than either drug alone. The benefit of ibuprofen treatment demonstrated by decreased clinical scores in the ibuprofen only groups extends beyond what would be explained by fever reduction. These are detailed in
