<p>Limitations of the study include the inherent variability of the immune response of outbred animals. This makes it harder to detect treatment differences when present. More nuanced and complex outcomes, for example where NSAIDS might cause excessive harm to the sickest individuals but benefit less sick animals will be difficult or impossible to deduce without very large samples. The advantage of outbred animals is improved generalizability. Calves are expensive as experimental subjects and consequently our sample size is relatively small.</p>
