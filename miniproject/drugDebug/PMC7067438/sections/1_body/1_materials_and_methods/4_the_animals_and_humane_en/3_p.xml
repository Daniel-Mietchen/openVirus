<p>Humane endpoints for infection with bovine RSV were established prior to initiation of the studies. Since the disease causes fever, increased respiratory rate, cough, and dyspnea and these clinical signs are important for assessment of the efficacy of treatment, it was necessary to allow some signs of the disease to occur. Our criteria for early euthanasia were temperature over 40°C (104°F) (normal range from 37.8 to 39.2°C (100 to 102°F) with depression, dyspnea causing open mouth breathing, inability to stand, and inability to drink from a bottle. We examined each calf every morning and recorded a detailed structured clinical examination. We measured rectal temperatures twice daily and assessed each animal’s wellbeing at that time. Euthanasia (either when indicated or as planned on day 10 after infection) was performed by a veterinarian and consisted of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital administered through the jugular vein. Two of the 36 calves required early euthanasia. The longest duration between reaching a humane endpoint and euthanasia was one hour. None of the calves died without euthanasia and the cause of death for all animals was sodium pentobarbital overdose.</p>
