<p>Five to six-week-old outbred pre-ruminant bottle-fed Holstein bull calves were purchased from a commercial dairy. Prior to purchase the calves were screened by the investigators for evidence of illness, nasal swabs were taken to test for bovine RSV and blood samples were obtained to measure maternal anti-bovine RSV antibodies. Thirty-six healthy asymptomatic calves with negative swabs for bovine RSV were transported to our research barns in acid washed trucks and observed for five to 10 days prior to the study. On arrival they received a ceftiofur (Zoetis Services LLC, Parsippany, NJ) once daily for three days to prevent stress induced bacterial pneumonia. Calves were housed in climate controlled barns and fed milk replacer for the duration of the study.</p>
