<p>We randomized using minimization based first on animal weight and then maternal anti-RSV titers (measured by indirect immunofluorescence).[
 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The study was conducted using three replicates of 12 animals each. These replicates were performed separately between 5/October /2017 and 28/November 2018. For each replicate the day of inoculation with virus was staggered by one day thereby dividing each replicate into an ‘A’ and ‘B’ group. Each drug treatment arm contained a group A and a group B calf. Infection days (study day 0) were one calendar day apart to ensure a maximum of six animals would need to be necropsied on any Study day 10. This was necessary because of workload and necropsy laboratory space considerations.[
