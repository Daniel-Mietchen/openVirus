<p>We also estimated the hazard ratio using the Andersen-Gill variance-corrected extension of Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the hazard ratio for potentially repeatedly being in the top quartile of clinical scores. We graphed the hazard ratio for time to each treatment group to first the top quartile of clinical score using Cox proportional hazard regression. We started the risk period at day 0 for each treatment group to avoid immortal time bias.</p>
