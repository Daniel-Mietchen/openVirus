<p>The spline (modelling time) and drug interacted models produce coefficients that are virtually un-interpretable, so we also estimated the un-interacted models to provide interpretable coefficients for drug effects on clinical scores. Both time*drug interacted and un-interacted models produce the same predicted results when the model estimates are graphed. We present un-interacted estimates of the effect of each treatment arm on the clinical score to facilitate interpretation. We compared full versus reduced models using likelihood ratio tests.</p>
