<p>Calves were randomized to receive either ibuprofen, FPI, both FPI and ibuprofen, or placebo. Placebo was used to ensure blinding of the humans performing the study and to control for any effect of the carrier solutions on parameters measured. The animals were randomized to one of six treatment arms with varying start times for first dose of ibuprofen, FPI or both. Since previous studies had demonstrated efficacy of each drug singly administered beginning on the day following experimental bovine RSV infection and beginning on day 3 after infection for FPI, [

 <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] we did not include drug initiation on day 1 for either drug or a day 3 start for FPI. Ibuprofen was administered at 10 mg/kg three times daily and 600mg (regardless of weight) of FPI was given in a total volume of 30 ml by oral dose syringe once daily in the morning. Ibuprofen was mixed with First Street Snow Cone Syrup (Amerifoods Inc, Los Angeles, CA) and the placebo had identical appearance and smell as the ibuprofen. FPI was prepared in propylene glycol and the placebo for this drug was simply the propylene glycol without the FPI. Both drugs were administered orally using a 30-ml catheter tipped syringe. The assignment scheme is shown in
