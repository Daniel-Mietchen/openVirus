<p>The calf is a natural host of bovine RSV (bRSV) and is thus an excellent and relevant model to study RSV infection, much better than the mouse model. In this work, the authors have investigated the protective effects of the RSV fusion inhibitor GS-561937 and ibuprofen on RSV replication and clinical symptoms in the calf model. In two previous publications, the same authors studied the benefit effects of a fusion inhibitor and ibuprofen independently on calves infected with bRSV. In this work, they used again these compounds and compared their protective effects when used alone or in combination and show that there was a clear benefit when the two compounds were administered together, both for clinical signs and virus shedding. The protective effect was stronger when treatment was started on day 3 compared with day 5 postinfection.</p>
