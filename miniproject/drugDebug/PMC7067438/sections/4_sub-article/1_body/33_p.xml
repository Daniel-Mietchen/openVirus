<p>Pretreatment and very early treatment with anti-RSV antibodies, modestly decreases clinical findings and lung histopathology in a cotton rat model of RSV. Palivizumab an anti-RSV antibody that binds both pre- and post-fusion forms of the RSV F protein is highly effective as prophylaxis against RSV in human infants [13]but is ineffective as antiviral treatment once infection has occurred.[14] Experiments in a cotton rat model of RSV bronchiolitis demonstrated that a combination of anti-RSV antibodies and immunomodulation with NSAIDs or steroids did improve clinical outcomes following infection in a way that monotherapy did not.
