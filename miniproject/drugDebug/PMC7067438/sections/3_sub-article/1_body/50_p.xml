<p>Bovine and human RSV are very closely related viruses and causing similar symptoms in both species. There are currently no efficient treatments available against these viruses: there is no vaccine for humans, bovine vaccines seem poorly efficient, and monoclonal antibodies can only be used as preventive treatments for babies at risk and are very expensive. Nowadays there are no antiviral compounds commercialized against RSV, although several are under development (such as fusion inhibitors used in this study).</p>
