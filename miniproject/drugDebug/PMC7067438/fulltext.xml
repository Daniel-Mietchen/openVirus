Vaccinations are currently not available for children and bovine vaccines are variably effective. Bovine calves are a good model for human RSV. The clinical and immunological manifestations are similar, natural infection fails to induce immunity in both species, and enhanced natural disease following a specific formalin inactivated vaccine for humans has been replicated in bovine calves.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Prostaglandin E surges have been noted at 6 hours, 1 to 2 days, and 5 days following RSV inoculation in a cotton rat (<italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic>) model.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In vitro studies on bovine turbinate cells infected with bovine RSV have demonstrated significantly enhanced prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> expression by microarray analysis at 12, 24, and 48 hours post-infection compared to uninfected control cells (unpublished data, Gershwin Lab). COX-2 but not COX-1 activity (which in turn leads to increased prostaglandin E among others) is elevated in both human respiratory epithelium <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and <italic>in vivo</italic> in neonatal lamb (<italic>Ovis aries</italic>)[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and cotton rat (<italic>Sigmodon hispidus</italic>) models of RSV infection [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. This activity is concentrated in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium and in macrophages in lamb models of RSV.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have the potential to interrupt the prostanoid surges that follow RSV infection.

Palivizumab an anti-RSV antibody that binds both pre- and post-fusion forms of the RSV F protein is highly effective as prophylaxis against RSV in human infants [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]but is ineffective as antiviral treatment once infection has occurred.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Experiments in a cotton rat model of RSV bronchiolitis demonstrated that a combination of anti-RSV antibodies and immunomodulation with NSAIDs or steroids did improve clinical outcomes following infection in a way that monotherapy did not.

Failure of these drugs to improve outcomes when started at three to five days following inoculation would severely limit any potential clinical application for FPIs or NSAIDs in either bovines or humans.</p><p>Here we extend our previous work and answer two questions:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>How long after RSV inoculation can ibuprofen and FPI be administered with clinical benefit?</p></list-item><list-item><p>Does dual therapy with both ibuprofen and FPI improve outcomes compared with either drug alone?</p></list-item></list><p>In this report we answer these questions using clinical parameters and viral shedding.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Study design</title><p>We conducted a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 36 bovine calves (<italic>Bos taurus</italic>) comparing clinical scores and viral shedding in bovine RSV infected calves treated with ibuprofen, GS-561937 hereafter referred to as the FPI, or combinations of these initiated at three or five days after artificial infection with bovine RSV.

These replicates were performed separately between 5/October /2017 and 28/November 2018. For each replicate the day of inoculation with virus was staggered by one day thereby dividing each replicate into an &#x02018;A&#x02019; and &#x02018;B&#x02019; group. Each drug treatment arm contained a group A and a group B calf. Infection days (study day 0) were one calendar day apart to ensure a maximum of six animals would need to be necropsied on any Study day 10.

Thirty-six healthy asymptomatic calves with negative swabs for bovine RSV were transported to our research barns in acid washed trucks and observed for five to 10 days prior to the study. On arrival they received a ceftiofur (Zoetis Services LLC, Parsippany, NJ) once daily for three days to prevent stress induced bacterial pneumonia. Calves were housed in climate controlled barns and fed milk replacer for the duration of the study.</p><p>Calf weights were recorded prior to randomization and at necropsy and converted to centiles weight for age to allow for differing ages. We used heifer centile charts as bull charts were not available.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</p><p>Humane endpoints for infection with bovine RSV were established prior to initiation of the studies. Since the disease causes fever, increased respiratory rate, cough, and dyspnea and these clinical signs are important for assessment of the efficacy of treatment, it was necessary to allow some signs of the disease to occur. Our criteria for early euthanasia were temperature over 40&#x000b0;C (104&#x000b0;F) (normal range from 37.8 to 39.2&#x000b0;C (100 to 102&#x000b0;F) with depression, dyspnea causing open mouth breathing, inability to stand, and inability to drink from a bottle. We examined each calf every morning and recorded a detailed structured clinical examination. We measured rectal temperatures twice daily and assessed each animal&#x02019;s wellbeing at that time. Euthanasia (either when indicated or as planned on day 10 after infection) was performed by a veterinarian and consisted of an overdose of sodium pentobarbital administered through the jugular vein. Two of the 36 calves required early euthanasia. The longest duration between reaching a humane endpoint and euthanasia was one hour. None of the calves died without euthanasia and the cause of death for all animals was sodium pentobarbital overdose.</p></sec><sec id="sec011"><title>The interventions</title><p>Calves were randomized to receive either ibuprofen, FPI, both FPI and ibuprofen, or placebo. Placebo was used to ensure blinding of the humans performing the study and to control for any effect of the carrier solutions on parameters measured. The animals were randomized to one of six treatment arms with varying start times for first dose of ibuprofen, FPI or both. Since previous studies had demonstrated efficacy of each drug singly administered beginning on the day following experimental bovine RSV infection and beginning on day 3 after infection for FPI, [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] we did not include drug initiation on day 1 for either drug or a day 3 start for FPI. Ibuprofen was administered at 10 mg/kg three times daily and 600mg (regardless of weight) of FPI was given in a total volume of 30 ml by oral dose syringe once daily in the morning. Ibuprofen was mixed with First Street Snow Cone Syrup (Amerifoods Inc, Los Angeles, CA) and the placebo had identical appearance and smell as the ibuprofen. FPI was prepared in propylene glycol and the placebo for this drug was simply the propylene glycol without the FPI. Both drugs were administered orally using a 30-ml catheter tipped syringe.

It is similar to a clinical score described by Collie [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] but attributes less importance to fever. The scoring schema is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0230245.s001">S1 File</xref>. A higher score indicates more severe clinical signs. The clinical exam was performed daily by a veterinarian blinded to drug allocation. These clinical examinations were also performed in the days prior to infection with bovine RSV. We also compared the effects of treatment on clinical score without the temperature component, and on respiratory rate alone. The exam was recorded in real time using paper case report forms and subsequently transferred to a customized Filemaker-pro 12 database (Filemaker Inc. Santa Clara, CA).</p><p>Viral shedding was measured with quantitative RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs taken through the calves&#x02019; nostrils. For this purpose, calf nasal swabs collected before infection and daily after infection were extracted in 400 &#x003bc;l of RNALater Stabilization solution (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The cell suspension was spun into a pellet in a microcentrifuge at maximum speed for 5 min, the supernatant was removed, and the cell pellet resuspended in 350 &#x003bc;l of Buffer RLT&#x02014;lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Total RNA was extracted from the cell lysate using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s directions as described elsewhere. [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Extracted RNA was stored at -80&#x000b0;C until used for further procedures. 10 &#x003bc;l of viral RNA from each sample was used for reverse transcription. cDNA was synthesized using the SuperScript VILO Master Mix (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s directions. The reverse transcription thermocycling program consisted of 10 minutes at 25&#x000b0;C, 60 minutes at 42&#x000b0;C, and a termination cycle of 85&#x000b0;C of 5 minutes. Synthesized cDNA was stored at -20&#x000b0;C. The Q-RT-PCR was performed in duplicates on a 384-well plate, in a 20 &#x003bc;l reaction volume. The reaction mixture contained 10 &#x003bc;l PowerUP SYBR Green qPCR master mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 4 &#x003bc;l of cDNA, 2uL nuclease free water, and 2 &#x003bc;l of each primer in 5 &#x003bc;M concentration, specific to BRSV nucleoprotein: forward primer&#x02014;<monospace>GCAATGCTGCAGGACTAGGTATAAT</monospace> and reverse&#x02014;<monospace>ACACTGTAATTGATGACCCCATTC</monospace>. The RT-PCR thermocycling program consisted of one cycle of 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min and 95&#x000b0;C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 seconds and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 minute. RT-PCR performed using ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). As a quantification standard, a supernatant from BRSV-infected bovine turbinate cell culture with virus concentration of 83.5 x10<sup>4</sup> plaque-forming units (PFU) per 1 ml was used. RNA from the virus supernatant was extracted using E.Z.N.A. Viral RNA Kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA) according to manufacturer&#x02019;s directions. cDNA synthesis was performed as described above. Five serial 10x dilutions of standard viral cDNA was prepared and PCR amplification was performed together with the test samples as described above. Standard curve fitting and virus quantification was performed using ViiA 7 software (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Data analysis</title><p>We analyzed the outcomes using a multi-level model with two random effects levels, calves nested within replicates, and days nested within calves. The fixed effects portion included a spline function of time to model the anticipated initially gradual, then steeper rise, and then the rapid fall in the clinical score that reflects the natural history of the disease. We created a separate spline function for each outcome. We analyzed each drug treatment arm, i.e. arm 1 to 6, encoded as dummy variables, interacted with the spline function (modelling time) in the fixed effects portion of the model. We performed the same analyses using the clinical score modified to exclude temperature to determine if there was a benefit beyond antipyresis in the ibuprofen treatment arms. We used the same approach when estimating drug effect on respiratory rates and viral shedding.</p><p>The spline (modelling time) and drug interacted models produce coefficients that are virtually un-interpretable, so we also estimated the un-interacted models to provide interpretable coefficients for drug effects on clinical scores. Both time*drug interacted and un-interacted models produce the same predicted results when the model estimates are graphed. We present un-interacted estimates of the effect of each treatment arm on the clinical score to facilitate interpretation. We compared full versus reduced models using likelihood ratio tests.</p><p>The infecting dose of RSV was introduced as a variable into the models but appeared important only when we analyzed viral shedding and was retained only in these models. Variables used in minimization were included as regressors because the blocking or otherwise stratifying randomization as occurs during minimization breaks the assumption of independence.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Models were compared using likelihood ratio tests. Adherence to underlying assumptions was assessed graphically. Some outlying observations were noted in these graphs. We refit models with and without these observations that may have deviated from the underlying assumptions and compared these models with the full models. Including or excluding these apparent outliers did not materially change overall coefficients or standard errors. Ultimately, we retained the outlying observations because we did not have a good clinical reason to exclude them.</p><p>We also estimated the hazard ratio using the Andersen-Gill variance-corrected extension of Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the hazard ratio for potentially repeatedly being in the top quartile of clinical scores. We graphed the hazard ratio for time to each treatment group to first the top quartile of clinical score using Cox proportional hazard regression. We started the risk period at day 0 for each treatment group to avoid immortal time bias.</p><p>Our replicates are numbered 1, 3, and 4.

The combination of both drugs led to better clinical scores than either drug alone. We found ibuprofen increased and FPI decreased viral shedding but that dual therapy with both drugs led to viral loads comparable to those seen when FPI alone was used.</p><p>Prior experimental evidence that treatment with NSAIDs decreases illness when initiated after RSV infection has occurred is limited. Richardson et al found some benefit using 20 mg of indomethacin in a cotton rat model.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Treatment within a day of inoculation using ibuprofen in a bovine RSV model did not decrease histopathological changes but was associated with better clinical scores than placebo. This was useful only as proof of concept because infected but asymptomatic patients (human or bovine) will not often be diagnosable.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] We have advanced current knowledge (1) by determining that initiation of treatment up to five days after inoculation is beneficial and (2) by demonstrating that dual therapy of an NSAID with an FPI should be used.</p><p>Human clinical research of NSAIDs in RSV is sparse. A large retrospective study using propensity scores to simulate an RCT of ibuprofen and acetaminophen in human bronchiolitis found that both drugs decreased wheezing at 12 months follow-up.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] However, the authors were unable to assess duration of symptoms prior to NSAID prescription and they could not distinguish RSV from non-RSV bronchiolitis.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] Despite the very different design and associated limitations this work complements ours and helps draw the outlines for future large studies in human infants.</p><p>Our work extends prior work on antiviral treatment for RSV. Pretreatment and early treatment with antiviral drugs decreases clinical findings and lung histopathology. Treatment benefit decreases with time from inoculation initiated treatment on first detection of viral shedding by PCR again making antivirals of limited practical clinical use.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Jordan <italic>et al</italic> found decreased clinical scores with FPI monotherapy at one and three days post inoculation in a bovine model as measured by, however viral shedding was minimally decreased when treatment was started on day 3 post-inoculation.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Our results for FPI started as monotherapy at 5 days post inoculation were disappointing&#x02014;FPI alone performed similarly to NSAID alone and NSAIDS are much less expensive.</p><p>In clinical practice NSAIDs are widely given in combination with antibiotics to animals with bovine respiratory disease complex.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] In this case the primary benefits being sought are anti-inflammatory and antipyretic in the context of bacterial lung infection that frequently complicates bovine RSV.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] Similarly, the combination of doxycycline, an antibiotic, with ketoprofen, an NSAID, in the drinking water of piglets decreases the severity of porcine respiratory disease complex. Bacterial super infection complicates human RSV in at least 40% of those infants ill enough to require intubation. [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Infants who are less ill are generally assumed to have only the virus and antibiotics are generally withheld; because such children are not intubated comparable data regarding bacteria in the lung are not available. Practical application of our results in bovines could potentially decrease antibiotic use if the diagnosis of bovine RSV can be made early enough to initiate treatment, and FPI manufacturers could be persuaded to make the FPI inexpensive enough for agricultural use. Equally, one could also imagine clinical reasoning resulting in combined NSAID, antiviral, and prophylactic antibiotic therapy, all being co-administered at the earliest clinical signs of respiratory infection.</p><p>Human infant research with FPI for RSV is limited because the barriers to research in infants are appropriately high. Adults treated at the first appearance of RSV shedding following artificial infection with human RSV do benefit from FPI.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] In infants anti-RSV immunoglobulin delays both the first episode of RSV and decreases subsequent physician diagnosed recurrent wheezing.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] We speculate that delaying the first episode of RSV infection until infants&#x02019; Th2 skew has decreased may decrease the formation of antibodies to bystander antigens. Indeed, Gershwin <italic>et al</italic> previously showed using this bovine RSV infection model that infected calves are more predisposed to production of IgE antibodies against aerosolized ovalbumin during active infection than are uninfected calves [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and a similar phenomenon occurs in mouse models.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</p><p>The concept of dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory or even a more multifaceted treatment regimen for RSV has been proposed before.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] The combination of triamcinolone, a glucocorticoid, with palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody decreased lung histopathology when treatment was started on the third day following inoculation in cotton rats. The primary limitations to applying this study clinically arise from ongoing development of ever more potent pre fusion antibodies [<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] (Higher concentrations of pre-F and G antibodies, but not post-F antibodies are associated with less severe disease infants)[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] and how to translate the steroid dose used to infants.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] Our findings vindicate the concept of dual antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy. We will explore the mechanisms why this is so in a later manuscript. Given the potential for viral resistance to a single FPI, future research may entail the use of two antivirals and an NSAID.</p><p>Our finding of benefit at three days and a smaller benefit at five days post-inoculation sets likely practical limits for when clinicians would have to initiate treatment. This narrow window of opportunity from the onset of clinical symptoms within which dual antiviral and NSAID therapy must be initiated emphasizes the role of early diagnosis.</p><p>Attempts to correlate the amount of RSV shedding with clinical disease severity have had mixed results.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] Prior authors have shown that viral shedding can be effectively eliminated with the early use of monoclonal antibodies but that this does not necessarily translate into better clinical outcomes such as mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, length of hospital stay, need for supplemental oxygen, or pulmonary function testing.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] Steroids and NSAIDs increase viral shedding but have either null or beneficial effects on various clinical outcomes such as mortality, need for hospitalization, respiratory distress, and subsequent recurrent wheezing.[<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0230245.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0230245.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] We observed that NSAIDs and FPI when started on day 5 as monotherapy had almost identical clinical scores despite diverging viral loads, +174, (95% CI -303, +651) in ibuprofen monotherapy started on day 5 group) and -146, (95% CI -631, +340) in FPI monotherapy started on day 5 group.</p></sec><sec id="sec016"><title>Limitations</title><p>Limitations of the study include the inherent variability of the immune response of outbred animals. This makes it harder to detect treatment differences when present. More nuanced and complex outcomes, for example where NSAIDS might cause excessive harm to the sickest individuals but benefit less sick animals will be difficult or impossible to deduce without very large samples. The advantage of outbred animals is improved generalizability. Calves are expensive as experimental subjects and consequently our sample size is relatively small.</p><p>The work had to be divided into three replicates because of the workload involved in using cattle as experimental subjects.

There are currently no efficient treatments available against these viruses: there is no vaccine for humans, bovine vaccines seem poorly efficient, and monoclonal antibodies can only be used as preventive treatments for babies at risk and are very expensive. Nowadays there are no antiviral compounds commercialized against RSV, although several are under development (such as fusion inhibitors used in this study).</p><p>The calf is a natural host of bovine RSV (bRSV) and is thus an excellent and relevant model to study RSV infection, much better than the mouse model. In this work, the authors have investigated the protective effects of the RSV fusion inhibitor GS-561937 and ibuprofen on RSV replication and clinical symptoms in the calf model. In two previous publications, the same authors studied the benefit effects of a fusion inhibitor and ibuprofen independently on calves infected with bRSV. In this work, they used again these compounds and compared their protective effects when used alone or in combination and show that there was a clear benefit when the two compounds were administered together, both for clinical signs and virus shedding. The protective effect was stronger when treatment was started on day 3 compared with day 5 postinfection.</p><p>Globally the work is well done and the paper well written. Although the Results section is short, the Discussion section is rich, the authors highlighting the proof of concept of this work for further studies in infants rather than a clinical trial. The authors are aware of the high cost of fusion inhibitors and thus its limitation for their use in calves, and the problem of treating animals or infants early after infection, when clinical signs are low or non-visible. However, I was surprised that Figure&#x02019;s legends are missing, although there are quite easy to understand. What mean the colors in Fig.1? What are the units for viral load in Fig.4?</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>The definition of NSAIDs should be introduced line 66 instead of line 84</p><p>Lines 72-75 : &#x000ab; Pretreatment and very early treatment with antiviral drugs, typically anti-RSV antibodies, modestly decreases clinical findings and lung histopathology in a cotton rat model of RSV. Anti-RSV antibodies are highly effective as prophylaxis against RSV in human infants but are ineffective as antiviral treatment once infection has occurred.&#x0201d;</p><p>The authors should make a distinction between antiviral drugs and antibodies, which are two different approaches. Concerning antibodies, since the discovery of the prefusion and postfusion forms of the RSV F protein, many new antibodies have been described. Among them, some have been shown to be specific of the prefusion form and were shown to be more effective against RSV infection in small animal models (rodents), in contrast to palivizumab which is used as a preventive treatment in infants at risk. So, the authors should specify about which antibodies they talk.</p><p>Line 83: &#x0201c;GS-561937 and GS-5806 are virtually identical FPI&#x0201d;: unclear for me what means virtually identical FPI.</p><p>Lines 151-152: could the authors indicate (between brackets) the corresponding temperature in degrees Celsius for non-American readers ?</p><p>Fig.2 and Fig.6 tiff are of poor quality</p><p>Reviewer #2: The manuscript by Walsh et al. describes the results of a randomized controlled trial of therapeutic ibuprofen and antiviral (GS-561937, a fusion protein inhibitor) treatment on clinical disease and viral load in a bovine model of RSV infection. The article is relatively straightforward, although the statistical analyses are complex. My comments are mostly minor.</p><p>1) The authors mention the safety of oral ibuprofen use in predominant calves in the introduction. Yet, they have previously published a manuscript describing abomasal ulcers in calves administered ibuprofen. While the incidence of ulcers did not reach statistical significance in their prior published work, some discussion of this should be included (rather than simply stating the treatment is safe).</p><p>2) In the discussion, the authors discuss the importance of NSAID doses in multiple locations (line 329, line 320, line 377). The comparison of doses across species is a slippery slope. Dosing comparisons from rodents to humans, or calves to humans, is complex, particularly when dealing with drugs whose pharmacokinetics are not known in the particular host species. If the authors wish to make an argument for their dose over prior published literature, some discussion on known pharmacokinetics, allometric scaling and its possible implications in this study should be added.</p><p>3) Line 326, the authors make the statement in line 326 that they have determined how long after inoculation the dual treatment can be successfully initiated. This is an overstatement. While the authors have certainly shown that treatment can be started on day 5 and still be beneficial, they have not shown that this is the latest treatment can be initiated.</p><p>4) Figure 6, in my version of this figure, the legend is a bit difficult to read. It could be just due to the low resolution, but please double check the legend and make sure all colors/lines are easily discernible.</p><p>5) The manuscript would benefit from thorough edit. There are a number of sentences that don't make sense, spelling errors, etc. Just a few I have noted: lines 54, 135, 320, 338-339, 399-400.</p><p>**********</p><p>6.
