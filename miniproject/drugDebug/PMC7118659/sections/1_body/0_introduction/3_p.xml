<p id="para0002">Recently, a novel coronavirus emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. After human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) (classified in the genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic>) and HCoV-OC43 (
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> lineage 2a member) described in the 1960s, SARS-CoV-1 (
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> lineage 2b member) that emerged in March 2003, HCoV-NL63 (
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> lineage 1b member) described in 2004, HCoV-HKU1 (
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> lineage 2a member) discovered in 2005, and finally MERS-CoV that emerged in 2012 (classified in 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> lineage 2c), the novel coronavirus is the seventh human coronavirus described to date as being responsible for respiratory infection. Evidence was rapidly reported that patients were suffering from an infection with a novel 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> tentatively named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)

Despite drastic containment measures, the spread of 2019-nCoV, now officially known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is ongoing. Phylogenetic analysis of this virus indicated that it is different (~80% nucleotide identity) but related to SARS-CoV-1 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Because the world is threatened by the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the broad-spectrum antiviral effects of chloroquine warranted particular attention for repurposing this drug in the therapy of the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
