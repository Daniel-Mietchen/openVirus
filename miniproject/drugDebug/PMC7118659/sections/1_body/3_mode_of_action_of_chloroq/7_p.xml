<p id="para0012">Chloroquine can also act on the immune system through cell signalling and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Chloroquine is known to inhibit phosphorylation (activation) of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in THP-1 cells as well as caspase-1 
 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Activation of cells via MAPK signalling is frequently required by viruses to achieve their replication cycle 
 <xref rid="bib0073" ref-type="bibr">[73]</xref>. In the model of HCoV-229 coronavirus, chloroquine-induced virus inhibition occurs through inhibition of p38 MAPK 
 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. Chloroquine is a well-known immunomodulatory agent capable of mediating an anti-inflammatory response 
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Therefore, there are clinical applications of this drug in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">[75]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0076" ref-type="bibr">[76]</xref>, lupus erythematosus 
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">[6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0077" ref-type="bibr">77]</xref> and sarcoidosis 
 <xref rid="bib0078" ref-type="bibr">[78]</xref>. Chloroquine inhibits interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) mRNA expression in THP-1 cells and reduces IL-1β release 
 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">[72]</xref>. Chloroquine-induced reduction of IL-1 and IL-6 cytokines was also found in monocytes/macrophages 
 <xref rid="bib0079" ref-type="bibr">[79]</xref>. Chloroquine-induced inhibition of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) production by immune cells was reported to occur either through disruption of cellular iron metabolism 
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">[80]</xref>, blockade of the conversion of pro-TNF into soluble mature TNFα molecules 
 <xref rid="bib0081" ref-type="bibr">[81]</xref> and/or inhibition of TNFα mRNA expression 
 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">[72</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0082" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0083" ref-type="bibr">83]</xref>. Inhibition of the TNFα receptor was also reported in U937 monocytic cells treated with chloroquine 
 <xref rid="bib0084" ref-type="bibr">[84]</xref>. In the Dengue virus model, chloroquine was found to inhibit interferon-alpha (IFNα), IFNβ, IFNγ, TNFα, IL-6 and IL-12 gene expression in U937 cells infected with Dengue-2 virus
