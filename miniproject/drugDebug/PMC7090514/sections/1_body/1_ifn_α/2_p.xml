IFN-α2b spray can be used for high-risk populations who have a close history of contact with suspected infected patients or those with only upper respiratory tract symptoms in the early phase. One to two sprays can be used on each nostril, and 8–10 sprays on the oropharynx. The dose of IFN-α2b injection is 8000 IU, once every 1–2 h, 8–10 sprays/day for 5–7 days. Intramuscular injection of high-dose IFN-α (&gt; 2 μg/kg/time) could cause myelosuppression in children [
