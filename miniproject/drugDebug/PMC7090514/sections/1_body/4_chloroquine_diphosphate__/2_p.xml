If eye discomfort or visual abnormality occurs, CD should be discontinued. Other adverse reactions of CD include arrhythmia, drug-induced psychosis, leukopenia, etc. CD is mainly metabolized by liver and the burden of liver could be aggravated while combining with the other drugs (e.g., chlorpromazine) metabolized by liver. CD has a direct inhibitory effect on neuromuscular junctions, which could be aggravated while combining with drugs (e.g., clindamycin, streptomycin, gentamicin, etc.). Combination of CD with heparin could increase bleeding risk. For the patients with digitalization, CD could cause cardiac block. Other drug interactions (with indomethacin, thyroxine, isoniazid, etc.) also need to be noted.
