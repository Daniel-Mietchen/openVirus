<p id="Par6">Lopinavir (LPV) is mainly metabolized by the liver, so LPVr should be used with caution in patients with mild to moderate hepatic insufficiency, and contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency. In addition, LPVr could cause increased PR interval, second- or third-degree cardiac block [

The most common adverse reactions of LPVr include diarrhea (adults 19.5%; children 12%), vomiting (adults 6.8%; children 21%), rash (adults 5%; children 12%), etc. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Children are more likely to present with adverse reactions such as rash and vomiting, these symptoms should be closely monitored in children. For LPVr, lopinavir is a substrate of CYP3A enzyme, and ritonavir is a strong inhibitor of CYP3A enzyme. LPVr should be cautiously used while combining with drugs metabolized by CYP3A enzyme or drugs affecting CYP3A enzyme activity. For children with jaundice, LPVr may increase free bilirubin and exacerbate jaundice. Therefore, LPVr should not be used in children with jaundice.
