 <caption> Anthralin inhibits the transcription of the influenza virus and thus interferes with virus replication. (A) MDCK cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.1 and A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1 and treated with serially diluted anthralin starting from 50 μM. After 24 h of incubation at 37°C, the NP expression was measured by indirect immunofluorescence assay using anti-NP. (B) A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 5 and viral protein levels were determined by western blotting of the whole-cell lysates collected at the indicated time points. (C) A549 cells were infected with PR8 at an MOI of 5 and incubated for 3, 5, and 7 h. Total RNAs were prepared from cells, and quantitative RT-PCRs were carried out with primer sets specific for vRNA, cRNA and mRNA of the PA, NP or M2, respectively. The results were normalized to the level of 18S rRNA. The averages and standard deviations determined in three independent experiments are shown. Error bars, mean ± SD of three experiments ( n = 3). The level of significance was determined by Student’s t-test (* P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.01; *** P &lt; 0.001). (D) Influenza virus infected and anthralin-treated or untreated A549 cells were immobilized 8 h after infection. Viral particles inside and outside of the cells were observed using transmission electron microscopy (the arrows in the diagram point to virions). </caption>
