  <p>The antiviral activity of anthralin 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Chemical structures of anthralin. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The antiviral effects of anthralin on the production of infectious virions on two cell lines. The supernatants were harvested and the virus titers were determined by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay. Virus titers were calculated according to Spearman–Karber method as described in methods. The values represent the means ± S.D. of duplicate samples from three independent experiments. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Effect of anthralin administration on survival rates in the infected mice. BALB/c mice were infected with 1000 TCID
   <sub>50</sub> of PR8 and treated with anthralin or PBS control (
   <italic>n</italic> = 10). **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 with respect to PBS controls. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Weight loss of mice infected with lethal influenza virus and treated with or without anthralin. *
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, **
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01 and ***
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001 with respect to PBS controls. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Virus titers in BALFs taken on the third day after infection were measured by TCID
   <sub>50</sub> assay determined on MDCK cells. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Haematoxylin &amp; Eosin-stained sections from lungs of non-infected and PR8-infected BALB/c mice treated with anthralin or PBS at 3 dpi (day post infection) (scale = 200 μm).
