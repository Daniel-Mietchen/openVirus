  <p>Anthralin inhibits the mid-phase of the influenza life cycle. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> MDCK cells were precooled at 4°C for 30 min. (i) Cells were incubated with anthralin at 4°C for 1 h before infected with PR8 virus at 4°C for 1 h, the NA activities in the supernatants were measured 10 hpi. (ii) Cells were incubated with virus and anthralin at 4°C for 1 h, the NA activities in the supernatants were measured 10 hpi. (iii) Time-of-addition assay: Cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 0.01 at 4°C for 1 h, anthralin was added at an interval of 2 h after virus adsorption. The NA activities in the supernatants were measured 10 hpi. 
   <bold>(B,C)</bold> A549 cells were precooled at 4°C for 1 h, and infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 5 at 4°C for 1 h to synchronize the infection. The infected cells were treated with anthralin at 37°C until being fixed at 3, 6, and 9 hpi., respectively, 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, or were treated with anthralin at different time periods and the cells were fixed 9 hpi 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, and stained with anti-NP, HA and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI).
