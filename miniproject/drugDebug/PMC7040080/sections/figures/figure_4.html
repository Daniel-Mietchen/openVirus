 <caption> Anthralin does not inhibit the host RNA polymerase activity. (A) The model illustrates the phosphorylation of Ser5 and Ser2 of RNAPII (phosphorylated residues are highlighted in bright yellow) and the synthesis of the initial cap structure of transcription. When the cell is infected with the IAV, the viral RdRp complexes complete RNA replication cycle by snatching the caps produced by host RNA II. (B) The expression of total RNAPII, serine 2 phosphorylated and serine 5 phosphorylated RNAPII, and the M2 protein of IAV were detected by Western blot. DRB used as a positive inhibitor of transcription initiation (lanes 3). (C) Various concentrations of anthralin were incubated with HEK293T cells stably transfected with pGL6-luc (Fluc), pcDNA3.1 expression vector for influenza virus PA, PB1, and PB2 proteins, and pRL-SV40-N (Rluc) as a transfection control, and DMSO was included as the vehicle control. (D) A549 cells infected with PR8 virus were treated with 50 Î¼M anthralin during the whole culture process, until being fixed at different time points and the co-localizations of RNAPII and vRdRp were observed using a confocal microscope. The first merge includes PolII, PA and DAPI, whereas the second merge does not include DAPI. </caption>
