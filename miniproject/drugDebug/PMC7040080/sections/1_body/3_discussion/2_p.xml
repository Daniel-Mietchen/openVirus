<p>To study the mechanism of action of anthralin against the influenza virus, we performed many assays, including adsorption, entry, nuclear import, and export of RNP, virion production, to assess multiple events in the virus life cycle on which anthralin may affect. We found that anthralin inhibits virus replication in the middle stage of the IAV life cycle, which involves the transcription and replication of the influenza virus genome. Next, we made great efforts to understand the antiviral mechanism of anthralin on RNA replication functions of IAV. Interestingly, in addition to identifying the target of anthralin, our results clarified the timing of transcription and replication of IAV RNA. We found that the reference drug ribavirin inhibits the replication of cRNA and vRNA but not the transcription of viral RNA that have been detected 7 hpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, we believe that the anthralin suppresses the cRNA and vRNA synthesis due to the inhibition of transcription of the IAV genome. So, we focused the mechanism study on the effect of anthralin on the transcription functions of viral RdRp.
