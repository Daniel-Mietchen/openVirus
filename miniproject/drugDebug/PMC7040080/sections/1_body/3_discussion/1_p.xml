<p>Anthralin is a natural anthraquinone derivative, an FDA-approved drug with anti-psoriatic and anti-inflammatory effects. It is used topically in the management of psoriasis, dermatoses, and alopecia areata. Anthralin is also used in biomedical research due to its effect on EGFR autophosphorylation. It controls skin growth by reducing the synthesis of DNA and the mitotic activity in the hyperplastic epidermis, normalizing the rate of cell proliferation and keratinization. There is no current evidence of any long-term anthralin toxicity related either to skin exposure or to systemic issues. In this study, we demonstrated that anthralin inhibits the replication of influenza virus in a mouse model on lowering the virus titers, lung injury, and death rate in mice with lethal IAV infections.</p>
