<p>The influenza virus RdRp is composed of the subunits PB1, PB2, and PA (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Te Velthuis and Fodor, 2016</xref>). PB1, the N terminus of PB2 (PB2-N), and the C-terminal domain of PA (PA-C) form the core of the polymerase (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Te Velthuis, 2019</xref>). They are responsible for interacting with the terminal ends of viral promoters and for catalyzing the nucleotidyl transfer reaction. The core also binds the Ser5-phosphorylated CTD (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). Influenza RdRp binds to m
 <sup>7</sup>G on nascent host RNAs through a cap-binding domain on the vRdRp C terminus of PB2 (PB2-C) subunit (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Fechter et al., 2003</xref>). Then the host RNA at 10–14 nt downstream of the 5′ cap is cleaved by the endonuclease domain at PA-N of vRdRp and form 1- to 3- base pair interactions with the 3′ terminus of the viral genome segment, depending on the sequence of the primer (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Dias et al., 2009</xref>). This biological process is called “cap-snatching.” The vRdRp displays cap-snatch activity only when bound by vRNA promoter that is formed by the 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences of the vRNA segment (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Fodor et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, in order to exclude the effect of vRNA binding on subsequent cap-snatch, which includes cap-binding and cleavage of capped RNA, a vRNA binding assay and a cap-binding assay were performed. Anthralin showed specific inhibition on cap-binding, but not vRNA binding. In addition, anthralin was proved to inhibit the endonuclease activity of vRdRp (
