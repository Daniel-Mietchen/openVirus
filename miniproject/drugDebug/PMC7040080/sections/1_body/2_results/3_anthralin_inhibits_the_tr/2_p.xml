<p>Considering that the synthesis of RNAs is the upstream event of translation, which may contribute to the reduction of viral protein levels, we investigated the effects of anthralin in the synthesis of viral mRNAs, cRNAs, and vRNAs of the gene segments 3, 5, and 7 of IAV in infected cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>, comparing to ribavirin, which inhibited the replication of the influenza virus and did not affect transcription, anthralin could not only significantly reduce the levels of cRNAs and vRNAs, but also the levels of the mRNAs.
