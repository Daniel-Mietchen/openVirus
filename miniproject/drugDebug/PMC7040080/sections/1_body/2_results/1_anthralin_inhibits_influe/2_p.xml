<p>Next, the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> therapeutic effect of anthralin was evaluated in the mouse model. In the assessment of the toxicity of anthralin, the maximum dosage was determined to be 50 mg/kg/d (data not shown). BALB/c mice were challenged with a lethal dose (4LD
 <sub>50</sub>) of PR8 virus, a mouse-adapted IAV strain, and then treated with 25 and 50 mg/kg/d of anthralin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or just PBS. Our results showed that high-dose anthralin treatment reduced the mortality compared to that of PBS control and low-dose treatment (

For determining the virus titers in the lungs of the influenza virus infected mice, the BALFs were harvested on day three post-infection for virus titer determination. The results showed that compared with PBS control, 50 mg/kg/d of anthralin treatment reduced the virus titers by greater than 90% in the BALFs, while 25 mg/kg/d of anthralin treatment reduced the virus titers by 70% in the BALFs (

The results showed that the pulmonary parenchyma and interstitial inflammatory infiltrations of the mice with anthralin treatment were improved in both treated groups compared with the PBS group, it was greatly improved in the high dose group (
