<p>To identify the stage of the influenza virus life cycle that anthralin acts on, we tested the time-dependent inhibitory effects of anthralin on influenza virus replication using a time-of-addition assay as described previously (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2014</xref>). Anthralin was added at different times, and the cells were harvested 10 h post-infection (hpi). MDCK cells pretreated with anthralin at 4°C for 1 h and then infected by IAV (PR8 strain at MOI of 0.01) at 4°C. Then cells were washed twice with PBS and cultured in the absence of anthralin. The influenza virus replication was found not affected by the pretreatment of cells by anthralin. When the PR8 virus was pretreated with anthralin at 4°C for 1 h and then used to infect MDCK cells, it replicates as efficient as the untreated (data not shown). These results suggest that anthralin does not have a virucidal effect on the influenza virus or inhibitory effect on virus adsorption. Whereas, anthralin could efficiently inhibit the virus replication when added during the early to mid-stage of the virus life cycle, indicating that the anthralin affects the entry or the virus replication stage (
