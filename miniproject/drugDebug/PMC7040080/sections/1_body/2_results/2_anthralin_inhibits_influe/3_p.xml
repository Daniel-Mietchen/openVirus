<p>To further analyze the time-dependent events in influenza virus life cycle that are affected by anthralin treatment, we checked the virus replication status by measuring the expression and localization of virus NP and HA in the synchronized infection of A549 cells with anthralin treatment during different time periods (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM2">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). The results showed that the anthralin treatment during 0–3 h after the initial infection does not affect the internalization of influenza viruses. The anthralin treatment during 3–6 h did not affect the nuclear import of NP, while the expression of NP in the nucleus was greatly reduced, and the NP and HA proteins in the cytoplasm were not observed. These results suggest that anthralin does not interfere with the import of RNP into the nucleus, but seems to affect the viral RNA replication or translation of viral proteins. The anthralin treatment during 6–9 hpi suppressed less efficiently the expression of HA and NP proteins in the infected cells, indicating that anthralin does not interfere with the late stage of the life cycle of IAV, which includes the assembly and release of viral particles.
