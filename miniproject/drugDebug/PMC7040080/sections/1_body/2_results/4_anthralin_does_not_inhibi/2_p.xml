<p>To test whether anthralin can inhibit the function of host RNAPII, we performed a one-cycle virus replication assay to analyze the phosphorylations of Ser2 and Ser5 of host RNAPII by Western blot. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>, as expected, the reference compound DRB (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Hensold et al., 1996</xref>), a RNAPII CTD kinase inhibitor (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Medlin et al., 2003</xref>) that can inhibit the transcriptional elongation, reduced the levels of Ser2P and Ser5P significantly. Whereas, the phosphorylation of Ser2 and Ser5 on CTD of RNAPII was not affected by anthralin treatment at all, suggesting that anthralin does not interfere with the activity of host RNAPII. To further understand the transcription and translational processes that are affected by anthralin, we transfected HEK293T cells with the plasmids expressing the pPOLI-Fluc reporter gene under the control of the RNP complex of PR8. The ratios of Fluc to Rluc activity were reduced concentration-dependently upon anthralin treatment, demonstrating that anthralin decreased Fluc activity through inhibiting the vRdRp mediated transcription of pPOLI-Fluc (
