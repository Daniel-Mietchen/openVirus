<p>Transcription of the influenza virus is a primer-dependent process that synthesizes the viral mRNAs with a 5′-cap, but the polymerase of IAV does not have inherent capping activity and relies on the capped RNAs produced by the host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) (
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Plotch et al., 1981</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that anthralin might affect viral transcription by inhibiting the transcriptional competence of RNAPII. The most critical C terminal domain (CTD) residues for RNAPII function are Ser2 and Ser5 (

During the transcription of genes, RNAPII complex with high levels of phosphorylation at serine 5 (Ser5P) were enriched during the primal transcription of the gene and capping the nascent RNA, consistent with the important role of Ser5P in the earliest mRNA processing events (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">Schwer and Shuman, 2011</xref>). In the subsequent transcriptional extension stage, due to the gradual enrichment and increase of RNAPII containing high levels of phosphor-Ser2 (Ser2P), it is suggested that Ser2P plays an important role in this progress (
