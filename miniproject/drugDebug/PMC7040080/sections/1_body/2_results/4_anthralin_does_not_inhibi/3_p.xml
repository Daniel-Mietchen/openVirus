<p>In the process of cap-snatching, the viral polymerase PB2 captures the 5′-cap of nascent host capped RNAs, and the PA cleaves the capped RNA 10–14 nucleotides downstream of the cap structure (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Koppstein et al., 2015</xref>). The processed cap-containing RNA fragments are then used as primers to initiate transcription of viral mRNAs. Next, the co-localization of influenza virus polymerase complexes and RNAPII in cells that infected with IAV and treated with anthralin for 3, 5, and 7 h were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>, at 3 hpi, the host RNAPII localized predominantly in the nucleus, while virus polymerase localized mostly in the cytoplasm. There is a very limited co-localization that may be non-specific random co-localization. During 5–7 hpi, the virus gene transcription and RNA replication are highly efficient and close to complete, host RNAPII and virus polymerase co-localize very well in the nucleus. However, the co-localization of host RNAPII and virus polymerase is completely blocked upon anthralin treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that anthralin inhibits virus RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity not as a result of interference with the function of host RNA polymerase, instead, it may block directly the function of viral RdRp.
