<p>Currently, three classes of antiviral drugs were approved by the FDA for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza (
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq, 2006</xref>). The M2 inhibitors, amantadine and rimantadine blocks the activity of M2 proteins that are ion channels, thereby preventing the viral genomic fragments from entering the cytoplasm (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Pinto and Lamb, 2007</xref>). The prevalence of viruses resistant to these drugs has been growing around the world, greatly undermining effectiveness of drugs. All currently circulating IAV strains are resistant to M2 inhibitors, so these drugs are no longer recommended for flu treatment (

 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Bright et al., 2006</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Garten et al., 2009</xref>). The second class of influenza drugs is neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI), including oseltamivir, peramivir, and zanamivir. NA inhibitors preventing the release of the progeny virus particles through binding to the NA and obstructing its enzymatic activity. Since oseltamivir does not inhibit influenza virus replication, it is not effective in inhibiting the inflammation caused by the virus replication, leading to a poor prognosis. A rapid rise in oseltamivir resistance was detected amongst seasonal A/H1N1 isolates before the 2009 pandemic (

Favipiravir (T-705), a new drug currently in the clinical trial, acts as a purine analog, inhibits multiple RNA viruses by targeting viral polymerase. But it increases uric acid, causes digestive system diseases and has reproductive toxicity (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Sangawa et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Furuta et al., 2017</xref>). Compared with NAI, viral RNA polymerase inhibitors have higher tolerance and longer treatment time, so they may be more effective. The most recently approved drug for influenza virus polymerase is baloxavir marboxil (trade name Xofluza). It is a medication that has been developed by Shionogi, a Japanese pharmaceutical company, for the treatment of influenza A and influenza B. The drug prevents the proliferation of influenza virus by inhibiting the endonuclease activity of the PA subunit (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Omoto et al., 2018</xref>). However, according to the clinical results, compared with treatment in adults, baloxavir showed weak therapeutic effect in the susceptible population that includes children, adolescents and the elderly, which cannot shorten the course of the disease (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hayden et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Kakuya et al., 2019</xref>). The specific amino acid substitution at the PA active endonuclease site (I38T/F) could decrease the sensitivity of the variant virus strain to baloxavir by 11 to 57 times. In the third phase of the trial, 9.7% of the baloxavir-treated patients were found with the variant virus with I38T/M/F replacement in PA decreased the susceptibility to baloxavir, sometimes related to the rebound of virus titer and the continuous prolongation of symptoms (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Hayden et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, new efforts need to be made to discover and develop new flu drugs with improved properties. Adverse reactions, such as hematochezia, after taking baloxavir have been reported (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Kanai et al., 2019</xref>). Nevertheless, the synthesis of viral mRNA, cRNA, and vRNA is the central event and crucial for influenza virus life cycle. Both host factors and virus polymerase are involved in this process, during which, cap-binding, endonuclease, and vRdRp activity, are attractive targets for small molecule inhibitors. In fact, the viral polymerase of influenza virus is the target for several novel anti-influenza candidates under active clinical development (
