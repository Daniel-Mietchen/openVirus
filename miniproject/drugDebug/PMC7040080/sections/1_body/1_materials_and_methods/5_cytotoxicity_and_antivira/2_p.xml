<p>For antiviral assay, in the presence of eight concentrations of 2-fold serial dilutions from 200 μM, MDCK cells were plated and infected with PR8 at an MOI of 0.01, or A549 cells were plated and infected with PR8 at an MOI of 1. After incubation at 37°C for 48 h, the inhibition of viral replication was measured by the modified neuraminidase activity (NA) assay (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Ivachtchenko et al., 2013</xref>). The fluorescence intensity was measured with a multi-label plate reader (Wallac Envision, PerkinElmer, MA, United States) and was expressed as the 50% effective (inhibitory) concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub>). For detection of infectious virus yield reduction, the supernatants harvested 48 hpi were titrated through the TCID
 <sub>50</sub> assay, and the virus titers were calculated according to the method of Spearman–Karber. Ribavirin was used as a positive control.
