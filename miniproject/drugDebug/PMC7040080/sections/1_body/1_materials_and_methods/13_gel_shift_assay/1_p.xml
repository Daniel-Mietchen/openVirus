<p>For the vRNA binding assays, 0.5 μM polymerase complexes were incubated in binding buffer with 0.5 μM 5′ FAM-labeled vRNA (5′-FAM-AGUAGAAACAAGGCC-3′) and different concentrations of anthralin at 37°C for 30-min. For cap-binding assay, following a 30-min reaction for the binding of 0.5 μM polymerase complexes with an unlabeled oligoribonucleotide containing the chemically synthesized 0.5 μM vRNA, the 0.5 μM 20-nucleotide capped RNA (5′-FAM-m
 <sup>7</sup>GpppAAUCUAUAAUAGCAUUAUCC-3′) was added, and the mixture was incubated in the presence of anthralin at 37°C for 30 min. These protein-RNA complexes were separated from free RNA by electrophoresis on 4% non-denaturing gels.
