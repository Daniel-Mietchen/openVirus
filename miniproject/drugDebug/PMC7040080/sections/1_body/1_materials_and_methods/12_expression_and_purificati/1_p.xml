<p>Influenza virus polymerase proteins were expressed by using the 1-step CHO High-Yield IVT Trial Kit acellular expression system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocols. The plasmids expressing full length PA, PB1, and PB2 were constructed, respectively, using pT7CEF1-NHis-GST-CHA expression vector provided by the kit. The expressed proteins were purified using GST purification kit (Beyotime Biotechnology). The expression and purification of the polymerases were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.</p>
