<p>All experiments were conducted according to the protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Wuhan Institute of Virology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (WIVA08201801). BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks) were purchased from the Beijing Vital River Laboratory Animal Technology Co., Ltd. (Charles River laboratories China). Mice were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium and then infected with the influenza virus through the nasal cavity. Infected mice were treated by intragastric managed 50 and 25 mg/kg/d of anthralin once a day for five consecutive days starting 4 h after infection. On the third day after the infection, the lungs of mice were inflation fixed in 10% formalin and paraffin-embedded and then stained with H&amp;E. At the same time, mouse tracheas and lungs were removed and washed twice with PBS containing 0.1% BSA, then centrifuged at 10000 ×
