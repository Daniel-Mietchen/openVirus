<p>A549 cells were planted into a six-well plate and incubated overnight. Cells were precooled at 4°C for 30 min and then infected with influenza virus PR8 at MOI of 5 for 1 h at 4°C for synchronizing viral infections. After washing with cold PBS, the cells treated with or without 50 μM anthralin, and then harvested at the indicated times after infection. Total cells were lysed in radio-immunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer and separated on 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and then samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After membranes were incubated with primary antibody at 1:2000 dilution at 4°C for overnight, the appropriate secondary antibody at 1:10000 dilution was added and incubated. The proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system and antibodies directed against proteins of IAV, cell, and GAPDH.</p>
