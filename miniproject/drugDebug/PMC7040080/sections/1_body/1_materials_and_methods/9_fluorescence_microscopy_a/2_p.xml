<p>To detect co-localization of the vRdRp and RNAPII, A549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at an MOI of 10 at 4°C for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, and then treated with or without 50 μM anthralin. The cells were harvested 9 h after infection, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton in PBS for 3 min at room temperature. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-PA, anti-PB1, anti-PB2 primary antibody overnight and then incubated with the Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated goat anti rabbit IgG and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG for 1 h. After washing, confocal images were acquired with a 60 × objective, using a Nikon A1 confocal microscope with random sampling.</p>
