<p>MDCK and A549 cells were planted in 96-well plates and cultured for 24 h at 37°C. Cells were inoculated with medium alone (negative control), PR8, or virus incubated with various concentrations of the anthralin at 4°C for 1 h. Then the cells were washed three times with cold PBS and inoculated with medium for 24 h at 37°C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with IFA buffer (PBS containing 3% BSA, 0.3% Triton X-100 and 10% FBS) for 1 h and incubated with a primary antibody against the NP for 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:1000). The stained samples were then examined with a Nikon’s Eclipse Ti inverted microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
