<p>The time-of-addition assay was conducted using the method modified from that originally described (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2014</xref>). In the pretreatment assays, the PR8 viruses were treated with 50 μM of anthralin at room temperature for 1 h, before infection with PR8 virus at MOI of 0.01 at 4°C for 1 h followed by incubation at 37°C for 10 h. Then, the cell supernatants were harvested for detection of the production of infectious virus particles by reinfection. For determining the stage of the virus life cycle that is inhibited, the cells were precooled at 4°C for 30 min, followed by infection with PR8 virus at 4°C for 1 h. Then cells were incubated at 37°C by adding anthralin at different times. The cell supernatants were harvested 10 hpi for detection of the production of infectious virus particles by reinfection.
