 <caption> Blocking histamine receptors has minimal effects on KSHV entry. ( A) The lytically-induced iSLK.219 cells were treated by the antagonists of different histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) at non-cytotoxic concentrations (IC 50 and 2Ã—IC 50) for 48 h, then the expression of representative lytic protein, ORF26 and vIL-6, was detected by Western blot. Representative blots from one of two independent experiments were shown. Tubulin was used for loading controls. Numbers represent immunoreactivity relative to induced cells control as quantified using Image-J software. ( B) HEK293T cells were infected by rKSHV.219 in combination with H1R-H4R antagonists using a spinoculation protocol as described in Methods, then the supernatants were removed and replaced with fresh medium. After 48 h, GFP expression was detected using the HCS system. Nine image fields per well were recorded and the associated fluorescence intensity per well was calculated using the Harmony3.5 software. Data were normalized as the fold change compared to the DMSO control. Representative images from one of two independent experiments were shown. Error bars represent S.D. for 9 image fields per well, * = p&lt;0.05 ( vs Control). </caption>
