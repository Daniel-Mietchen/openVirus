 <caption> Anti-KSHV activity of 3 compounds targeting histamine receptors. ( A) The structures of 3 compounds, Phenothiazine, Protriptyline and Cyproheptadine. ( B-D) The lytically-induced iSLK.219 cells were exposed to these compounds at indicated concentrations, then the cytotoxicity and antiviral activities were detected as described in Methods. ( E-H) The TPA-induced BCBL-1 cells were exposed to these compounds at indicated concentrations, then the cytotoxicity and the expression of representative lytic genes were detected as described in Methods. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments. Representative blots from one of two independent experiments were shown. </caption>
