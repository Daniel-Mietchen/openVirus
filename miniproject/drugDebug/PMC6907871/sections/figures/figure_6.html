 <caption> The agonists targeting selective histamine receptors promote KSHV lytic replication. ( A) The iSLK.219 cells were exposed to Dox, the agonists of H1R-H4R alone or the combination for 48 h, then RFP expression was detected by using the HCS system. ( B) The viral supernatants from (A) were collected to infect na√Øve HEK293T cells and GFP expression was detected as above at 48 h post-infection. Representative images from one of two independent experiments were shown. ( C) The HUVEC were first infected by rKSHV.219 virions, then exposed to the desired agonists for 72 h and the transcripts of RTA were quantified by using qRT-PCR. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments, ** = p&lt;0.01 ( vs NC). Data were normalized as the fold change compared to the DMSO control. ( D) The iSLK.219 cells were first transfected with H1R-siRNA, H2R-siRNA or negative control siRNA, respectively, as described in Methods for 48 h, then induced by Dox in combination with histamine for additional 48 h. The protein expression was detected by Western blot. GAPDH was used for loading controls. Representative blots from one of two independent experiments were shown. </caption>
