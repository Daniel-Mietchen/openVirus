 <caption> Histamine promotes KSHV lytic reactivation from iSLK.219 cells. ( A) The iSLK.219 cells were exposed to Dox, histamine alone or the combination for 48 h, then RFP expression was detected by using the HCS system (right panel) and quantitatively analyzed using Harmony3.5 software (left panel). ( B) The iSLK.219 cells were exposed to Dox or the combination with histamine for 48 h, then RFP expression was detected by using the HCS system (right panel). The supernatant were collected to infected na√Øve HEK293T cell for 48 h, then GFP expression was detected by using the HCS system (left panel). ( C) The iSLK.219 cells were exposed to Dox or the combination with histamine for 48 h, then RNA were extracted and transcripts of viral genes were quantified by qRT-PCR. Data were normalized as the fold change compared to the DMSO control. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments, * = p&lt;0.05; ** = p&lt;0.01 ( vs Control). </caption>
