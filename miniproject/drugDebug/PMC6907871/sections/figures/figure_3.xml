  <title>Anti-KSHV activity of 3 compounds targeting histamine receptors.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) The structures of 3 compounds, Phenothiazine, Protriptyline and Cyproheptadine. (
   <bold>B-D</bold>) The lytically-induced iSLK.219 cells were exposed to these compounds at indicated concentrations, then the cytotoxicity and antiviral activities were detected as described in Methods. (
   <bold>E-H</bold>) The TPA-induced BCBL-1 cells were exposed to these compounds at indicated concentrations, then the cytotoxicity and the expression of representative lytic genes were detected as described in Methods. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments. Representative blots from one of two independent experiments were shown.
