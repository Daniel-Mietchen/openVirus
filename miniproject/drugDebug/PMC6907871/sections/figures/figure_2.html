 <caption> High-throughput drug screening of new agents effectively blocking infectious virion production. ( A) Diagrams of high-throughput drug screening. The compounds in source plates were delivered at 10 μM (final concentration) to 384-well plates using Echo system, then iSLK.219 cell suspension including Dox and NaB were added. At 48 h post-induction, the supernatants were collected to infect naïve HEK293T cells seeded in new 384-well plates. The GFP expression (representing infected cells) was detected and quantified with the HCS system at 48 h post-infection. Images from nine fields per well were digitized to determine the total intensity using the Harnomy3.5 software. Data were normalized as the relative fluorescence intensity or inhibition rate compared to the DMSO control. The compounds with &gt;80% of inhibition rate were selected to determine their IC 50, CC 50 and SI (CC 50/IC 50) as described in Methods. ( B) Primary screening results of 1280 FDA-approved drugs against KSHV, which were arranged in order of inhibition rate. </caption>
