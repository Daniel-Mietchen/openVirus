 <caption> Optimization and validation of an in vitro system for anti-KSHV drug screening. ( A) The iSLK.219 cells were induced by doxycycline (Dox) or sodium butyrate (NaB) alone or the combination, then RFP expression (representing viral lytic reactivation) was detected by the Operetta High-Content Screening (HCS) System at 24 h post-induction. ( B-C) RFP expression at 24 h (B) and 48 h (C) post-induction was quantified using Harmony3.5 software. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments. ( D) The viral supernatants from iSLK.219 cells treated by 1 μg/mL Dox in combination with 1.2 mM NaB were collected to infected naïve HEK293T cells, then GFP expression was detected using the HCS system at 48 h post-infection. </caption>
