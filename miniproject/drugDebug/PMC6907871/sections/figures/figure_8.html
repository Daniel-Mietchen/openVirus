 <caption> Inhibition of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways reduces lytic reactivation promoted by histamine and other agonists. ( A-C) The lytically-induced iSLK.219 cells were treated with different agonists of H1R-H4R alone or in combination with pathways inhibitors, including the p38 inhibitor, SB203580 (A), the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 (B) or the Akt inhibitor, A6730 (C). RFP expression was detected as described above. Representative images from one of two independent experiments were shown. </caption>
