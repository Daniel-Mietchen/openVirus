  <title>The anti-KSHV activity of selective histamine receptors antagonists in KSHV+ BCBL-1.</title>
  <p>(
   <bold>A</bold>) BCBL-1 cells under TPA induction were exposed to antagonists of histamine receptors, PMS or Conessine for 48 h, then the cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments. (
   <bold>B</bold>) BCBL-1 cells under TPA induction were exposed to PMS or Conessine at the non-cytotoxic concentrations, then the protein expression was determined by using Western blot at 48 h post-induction. Representative blots from one of two independent experiments were shown.
