 <caption> The anti-KSHV activity of selective histamine receptors antagonists in KSHV+ BCBL-1. ( A) BCBL-1 cells under TPA induction were exposed to antagonists of histamine receptors, PMS or Conessine for 48 h, then the cell viability was assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol. Error bars represent S.D. for 3 independent experiments. ( B) BCBL-1 cells under TPA induction were exposed to PMS or Conessine at the non-cytotoxic concentrations, then the protein expression was determined by using Western blot at 48 h post-induction. Representative blots from one of two independent experiments were shown. (TIF) </caption>
