 <caption> Histidine doesnâ€™t promote KSHV lytic reactivation from iSLK.219 cells. The iSLK.219 cells were exposed to Dox in combination with histidine at indicated concentrations for 48 h, then RFP expression (left panel) was detected and quantitatively analyzed (right panel) as described in Methods. Data were normalized as the fold change compared to the DMSO control. (TIF) </caption>
