<p>The cell viability under tested compound addition was assessed by CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA) according to the manufacturerâ€™s protocol as described previously [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The luminescent signal was measured using the Envison 2102 Multilabel Reader (Perkin Elmer). The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) for each compound was calculated from these dose-response curves using Graphpad5.0 Prism.
