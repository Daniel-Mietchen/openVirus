<p>Transcripts of genes of interest were also measured by qRT-PCR as previously described [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. All qRT-PCR assays were performed using a Bio-Rad CFX384 Touch Real-Time PCR detection system using the iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) with viral specific primers as follows: ORF50 (Forward, 5'-CACAAAAATGGCGCAAGATGA-3' and reverse, 5'- TGGTAGAGTTGGGCCTTCAGTT-3'); ORF48 (Forward, 5'-CGGGCAAGCAAGCTGGT-3' and reverse, 5'-CCCTGGCGATTTTGGGTAC-3'); ORF6 (Forward, 5'-CTGCCATAGGAGGGATGTTTG-3' and reverse, 5'-CCATGAGCATTGCTCTGGCT-3'); ORF59 (Forward, 5'-CGAGTCTTCGCAAAAGGTTC-3' and reverse, 5'-AAGGGACCAACTGGTGTGAG-3'); ORF17 (Forward, 5'-AGATTTTTCACGGGGGCTCTGG-3' and reverse, 5'- TGGGCTGGACACTGGGTCTATTTC-3') and ORF26 (Forward, 5'-GCTCGAATCCAACGGATTTG -3' and reverse, 5'- AATAGCGTGCCCCAGTTGC-3'). The data were normalized to the β-actin housekeeping gene expression (forward, 5'-ATCGTGCGTGACATTAAGGAG-3' and reverse, 5'-GGAAGGAAGGCTGGAAGAGT-3'). “No template” (water) controls were used to ensure minimal background contamination. Using mean Ct values tabulated for each gene, and paired Ct values for 
 <italic>β-actin</italic> as a loading control, fold changes for experimental groups relative to assigned controls were calculated using automated iQ5 2.0 software (Bio-Rad).
