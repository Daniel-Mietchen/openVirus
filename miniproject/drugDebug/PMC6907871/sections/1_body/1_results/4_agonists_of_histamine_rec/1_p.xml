<p>To further assess the importance of histamine receptors in the lytic phase of KSHV, the ability of histamine, a universal agonist of histamine receptors, to stimulate viral lytic reactivation was tested. Both induced and non-induced iSLK.219 cells were exposed to histamine, then RFP expression was detected using the HCS System. Histidine, a precursor for histamine, was used as a negative control since it does not activate histamine receptors (

 </bold>). We found that histidine addition had no effect on Dox-induced RFP expression. In contrast to this, histamine synergistically enhanced Dox-induced RFP expression in a dose-dependent manner, although histamine alone treatment showed no viral induction (
