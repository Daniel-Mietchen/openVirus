<p>Since histamine is a universal agonist of histamine receptors, we further tested specific agonists of select histamine receptors, including 2-Pyridylethylamine (H1R agonist), Amthamine (H2R agonist), R-(-)-α-Methylhistamine (H3R agonist) and 4-Methylhistamine (H4R agonist). Similar to histamine, these agonists had no effects on RFP expression without Dox induction. However, the addition of 2-Pyridylethylamine, R-(-)-α-Methylhistamine or 4-Methylhistamine, significantly increased RFP expression when combined with Dox treatment, while Amthamine only showed less effect (

Similar to the results in iSLK.219 cells, we observed that the addition of 2-Pyridylethylamine, R-(-)-α-Methylhistamine, 4-Methylhistamine and histamine all increased RTA expression, but not Amthamine or histidine (

To further confirm the role of histamine receptors in regulation of viral lytic reactivation, we directly targeted H1R and H2R by RNAi in iSLK.219 cells, then induced with Dox (0.5 μg/mL) and histamine (100 μM) treatment. After 48 h of induction, interestingly, we found that knockdown of either H1R or H2R blocked lytic ORF26 and ORF45 protein expression from induced iSLK.219 cells (
