<p>To examine the functional importance of MAPK and PI3K/Akt pathways in histamine and/or other agonists mediated promotion of KSHV lytic replication, we used specific pharmacological inhibitors to block these pathways. Treatment with SB203580, a MAPK-p38 inhibitor, dose-dependently reduced RFP expression from Dox-induced iSLK.219 cells exposed to histamine and/or other agonists of H1R, H3R and H4R (
