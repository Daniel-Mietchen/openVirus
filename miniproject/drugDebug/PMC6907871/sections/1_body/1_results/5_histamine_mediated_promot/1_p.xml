<p>Histamine receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor family, which bind histamine to regulate intracellular signaling pathways, including PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-ĸB pathways [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We therefore sought to determine whether these downstream signaling pathways are involved in the histamine-mediated promotion of KSHV lytic replication. Our results confirmed that histamine treatment enhanced the expression of representative viral lytic proteins, RTA, ORF26 and vIL-6 from iSLK.219 cells in a dose-dependent manner under Dox induction, while not affecting the expression of latent proteins, such as LANA and LANA2 (

Next, we found that histamine treatment led to increased activation-related phosphorylation of MAPK pathways (including p38, ERK and JNK) as well as the PI3K/Akt pathway in conjunction with Dox induction. In contrast, NF-ĸB pathway activation was not affected by histamine under the same condition (

To further determine whether viral lytic replication can affect the expression of histamine receptors, iSLK.219 cells were induced by Dox in combination with NaB, then the expression of different histamine receptors was measured. Our data indicated that the expression of histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) was not affected by these induction conditions (
