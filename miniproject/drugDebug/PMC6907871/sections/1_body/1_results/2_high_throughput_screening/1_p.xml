<p>We next sought to identify new antiviral agents using a high-throughput screening strategy from a library that consisted of 1280 FDA-approved drugs. Compounds were added to lytically-induced iSLK.219 cells in 384 well-plates, then the supernatants were collected at 48 h post-induction to infect naïve HEK293T cells. At 48 h post-infection, GFP expression was detected and fluorescence intensity was analyzed by the Operetta HCS System (

 </bold>), 132 of these compounds were identified as potential antiviral agents with an inhibition ratio &gt;80%. To further validate the antiviral activities of these compounds, the standard evaluation indexes, CC
 <sub>50</sub>, IC
 <sub>50</sub> and selective index (SI, equal to CC
 <sub>50</sub>/IC
 <sub>50</sub>) were measured and calculated. Based on the dose-dependent curves of KSHV inhibition and the cytotoxicity in iSLK.219 cells, 15 compounds with SI &gt;10 were finally selected as “hit” compounds (
