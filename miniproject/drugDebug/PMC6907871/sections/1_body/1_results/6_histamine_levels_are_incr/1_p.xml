<p>To explore the clinical relevance of histamine production in KSHV+ HIV-infected patients, the histamine levels in plasma and saliva from a cohort of HIV-infected patients were measured using ELISA. KSHV infection status in these patients was determined as described in Materials and Methods. We found that the KSHV+ group had significantly higher histamine concentrations in their plasma and saliva (especially the former) than those from the KSHVâˆ’ group of HIV-infected patients (

 </bold>), although saliva histamine concentrations were much lower than plasma histamine overall. There was no statistical differences in HIV viral loads or CD4 counts between the KSHV+ and KSHV- groups. These data together indicate that the upregulation of histamine is potentially related to KSHV pathogenesis in these immunocompromised patients.
