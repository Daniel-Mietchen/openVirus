<p>KSHV belongs to the human Î³-herpesvirus subfamily and has a large genome of approximately 170 kb that encodes about 90 annotated open reading frames (ORFs) [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similar to many other human herpesviruses, KSHV has two alternating life-cycle programs following primary infection in host cells, the latent and lytic phases, which are characterized by different patterns of viral gene expression [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During latency, viral genomes persist as circular episomes with no progeny virion production and only a limited number of latency-associated genes expressed, including LANA, vFlip and vCyclin [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Once entering the lytic phase, almost all viral genes are highly expressed, followed by genomic DNA replication and mature virion release [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A key characteristic of the KSHV lytic phase is that most viral genes are expressed in an orderly fashion based on the time of expression, defined as immediate-early (IE), early and late genes [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most cells become latently infected following primary KSHV infection, with only a small population of cells undergoing spontaneous lytic replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, recent findings reveal that KSHV lytic replication also plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of virus-associated cancers [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].
