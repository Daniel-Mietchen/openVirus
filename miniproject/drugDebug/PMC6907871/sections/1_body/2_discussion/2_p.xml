<p>Among the hit compounds, Monobenzone, a depigmenting agent that typically is used to eliminate melanin from skin cells for clinical treatment of people with vitiligo [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], is highly effective in inhibiting KSHV lytic reactivation and virion production with the best SI (&gt; 500) and little cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;360 Î¼M), suggesting its high potential to become an effective and safe drug for the treatment of KSHV infection, although to our knowledge it has never been reported to have antiviral activity. In contrast, another hit compound, Spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist used to treat heart failure, hypertension and hypokalemia [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], was previously demonstrated to have antiviral activity against several herpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus and Equid alpha-herpesviruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Not surprisingly, a cluster of compounds related to DNA synthesis or replication were also identified as hit candidates, including Hycanthone, Oxaliplatin and Oxibendazole. For example, as an anti-schistosomal drug [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Hycanthone is an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (Top II), an enzyme that is indispensable for KSHV lytic replication [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similarly, the anti-KSHV activities of Oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug used for treating advanced colon and rectal cancers, and Oxibendazole, a polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of intestinal helminth infections, are largely dependent on their inhibition of DNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, our hit compounds also include several inhibitors targeting a series of neurotransmitter receptors, including dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, serotonin receptors, muscarinic receptors and histamine receptors. Although published results indicate that some neurotransmitter receptors, such as adrenoreceptors and dopamine receptors, can regulate KSHV reactivation through related signaling pathways [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the functional roles of most neurotransmitters in KSHV lytic replication still remain unclear. It is conceivable that some neurotransmitters may interact with inflammatory factors to create and/or maintain a pro-lytic microenvironment for this oncogenic virus.
