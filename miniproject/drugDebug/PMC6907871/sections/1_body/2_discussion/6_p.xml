<p>Although our current study focuses on the role of histamine, receptors and signaling in KSHV lytic reactivation and replication, the histaminergic system may also directly contribute to viral oncogenesis. There is now overwhelming evidence supporting the significance of histamine/receptors in cancer formation and spread, producing protumor or, conversely, antitumor effects, which depend on different tumor types [
