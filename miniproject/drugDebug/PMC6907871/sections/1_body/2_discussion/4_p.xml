<p>It is also possible downstream signaling by specific histamine receptors functions through different proteins and pathways. For example, a recent study in colorectal cancer cells demonstrated that H2R activation reduced MAPK phosphorylation to suppress their activities [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which differs from the activating effects of other histamine receptors on MAPK pathways [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our findings here demonstrate that the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are involved in the histamine-mediated promotion of KSHV lytic reactivation. Other studies report that the MAPK pathways, including p38, JNK and/or ERK, are essential for KSHV reactivation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and the PI3K/Akt pathway is closely related to KSHV lytic reactivation [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms for histamine receptors in regulating these signaling pathway activities in KSHV-infected cells still require further investigation.
