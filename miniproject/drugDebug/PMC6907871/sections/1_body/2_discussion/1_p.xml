<p>In the current study, we employed a high-throughput screening assay to identify 15 FDA-approved drugs as new and potent anti-KSHV agents with SI&gt;10 capable of blocking KSHV lytic replication. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that histamine receptors play a role in facilitating KSHV lytic reactivation. This is supported by results showing that the inhibition of most histamine receptors by antagonists reduces KSHV lytic replication, while stimulation of these receptors by agonists promotes viral lytic replication and enhances infectious virion production. Further mechanistic studies implicate the involvement of MAPK and PI3K/Akt as downstream signaling pathways triggered by histamine and/or other agonists to promote KSHV lytic replication. Taken together, our study has provided new clues for the development of therapeutic strategies against KSHV infection and related diseases.</p>
