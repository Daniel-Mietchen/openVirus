Current treatment options for KSHV infection and virus associated diseases are sometimes ineffective, therefore, more effectively antiviral agents are urgently needed. As a herpesvirus, lytic replication is critical for KSHV pathogenesis and oncogenesis. In this study, we have established a high-throughput screening assay by using an inducible KSHV+ cell-line, iSLK.219. After screening a compound library that consisted of 1280 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 15 hit compounds that effectively inhibited KSHV virion production were identified, most of which have never been reported with anti-KSHV activities. Interestingly, 3 of these drugs target histamine receptors or signaling. Our data further confirmed that antagonists targeting different histamine receptors (HxRs) displayed excellent inhibitory effects on KSHV lytic replication from induced iSLK.219 or BCBL-1 cells. In contrast, histamine and specific agonists of HxRs promoted viral lytic replication from induced iSLK.219 or KSHV-infected primary cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that downstream MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were required for histamine/receptors mediated promotion of KSHV lytic replication. Direct knockdown of HxRs in iSLK.219 cells effectively blocked viral lytic gene expression during induction. Using samples from a cohort of HIV+ patients, we found that the KSHV+ group has much higher levels of histamine in their plasma and saliva than the KSHV- group. Taken together, our data have identified new anti-KSHV agents and provided novel insights into the molecular bases of host factors that contribute to lytic replication and reactivation of this oncogenic herpesvirus.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>As a major oncogenic human herpesviruses, KSHV infection causes several cancers mostly seen in immunocompromised patients. Currently, effective antiviral treatments are still lacking. The &#x0201c;old drugs, new tricks&#x0201d; approach may serve as a feasible strategy for high-throughput screening of novel agents against lytic replication of KSHV. Here we screened an FDA-approved drug library and identified 15 new anti-KSHV agents. Interestingly, several of these candidates target histamine receptors, implying the involvement of histamine-related signaling in lytic replication and reactivation of KSHV. This involvement was directly demonstrated using antagonists and agonists specific for individual histamine receptors as well as RNAi. The downstream signaling pathways required for histamine-mediated promotion of KSHV lytic replication was also identified. Clinical data from a cohort of HIV+ patients confirm the relevance and elevation of histamine in the microenvironment of HIV+/KSHV+ patients. Thus, our findings provide new clues for developing anti-KSHV treatments, and identify novel mechanisms through which histamine and related signaling pathways function as important host factors facilitating KSHV lytic reactivation and pathogenesis.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></funding-source><award-id>Y605221SA1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-4479-1145</contrib-id><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xulin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA228166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0002-9905-1275</contrib-id><name><surname>Qin</surname><given-names>Zhiqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution>the Seeds of Science Pilot Award of Winthrop P.

KS is an endothelial-originated multicentric malignant neoplasm found in immunosuppressed patients, and most frequently in patients infected with HIV [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In contrast, PEL is a rare and aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that typically presents as a lymphomatous effusion without forming a solid mass [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. MCD is also a B-cell lineage disorder with specific characteristics of cytokine excess and viral lytic activation [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Current therapeutics for KSHV-associated malignancies are not completely efficacious and have significant adverse side effects [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, the identification of more effective and safer anti-KSHV agents is urgently needed.</p><p>KSHV belongs to the human &#x003b3;-herpesvirus subfamily and has a large genome of approximately 170 kb that encodes about 90 annotated open reading frames (ORFs) [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Similar to many other human herpesviruses, KSHV has two alternating life-cycle programs following primary infection in host cells, the latent and lytic phases, which are characterized by different patterns of viral gene expression [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. During latency, viral genomes persist as circular episomes with no progeny virion production and only a limited number of latency-associated genes expressed, including LANA, vFlip and vCyclin [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Once entering the lytic phase, almost all viral genes are highly expressed, followed by genomic DNA replication and mature virion release [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A key characteristic of the KSHV lytic phase is that most viral genes are expressed in an orderly fashion based on the time of expression, defined as immediate-early (IE), early and late genes [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Most cells become latently infected following primary KSHV infection, with only a small population of cells undergoing spontaneous lytic replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, recent findings reveal that KSHV lytic replication also plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of virus-associated cancers [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Several studies demonstrate that lytic replication contributes to viral oncogenesis through the inflammation caused by long-term persistent viral replication and cytokine production, providing a pro-tumor microenvironment for tumor initiation in a paracrine manner and the expression in cells of lytic viral gene products that manipulate cell cycle and directly regulate immune responses to avoid immunologic surveillance [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Meanwhile, case reports and retrospective studies have also pointed out the benefit of antiviral therapy, specifically targeting the KSHV lytic replication cycle in the treatment and prevention of KSHV-associated diseases [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, treatment with Ganciclovir (GCV) and Foscarnet (PFA) to block the viral DNA polymerase during lytic replication were shown to prevent KS in KSHV-seropositive transplant recipients [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In addition, GCV has been reported to be effective in MCD patients with active KSHV replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Knowing that KSHV lytic replication is important in the development of virus-associated diseases, makes screening and identifying new antiviral agents targeting viral lytic replication critical for developing new effective therapies. Here, we sought to screen for novel anti-KSHV agents using a high-throughput screening strategy applied to a library consisting of 1280 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. Our screening finally identified 15 hit compounds with significant anti-KSHV activity. Additional mechanistic studies demonstrated the involvement of histamine, histamine receptors and related signaling pathways in KSHV lytic replication and reactivation.</p><p>Histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) are a class of G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors (GPCRs) that bind histamine as their primary endogenous ligand [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Histamine, a biogenic amine, is mainly synthesized and released by mast cells (MCs) [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Interaction of histamine with its receptors plays a significant role in the development of various allergic diseases through regulating inflammation and immune responses [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Many studies showed that the transduction of biological activities by histamine receptors involve various downstream signaling pathways, including MAPK, PI3K/Akt, NF-&#x003ba;B [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Interestingly, histamine receptor expression is also detected in many tumor cells, making them sensitive to histamine stimulation, and histamine has been found to be a bivalent regulator for tumor development [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. More importantly, MCs were recently reported to be one of the major pro-inflammatory cells within KS lesions, and the elevated circulating levels of MC granule contents, such as tryptase and histamine metabolites, were found in plasma samples from KS patients [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In the same study, the authors reported that one patient with clinical signs of extensive MC activation was treated with antagonists of MC pro-inflammatory mediators, which resulted in a rapid and durable regression of AIDS-KS lesions. These data suggest that MC secreted products are important components of KS tumor microenvironment, although the roles of histamine-related signaling in regulation of KSHV infection and replication are still unclear.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Optimization and validation of an <italic>in vitro</italic> system for anti-KSHV drug screening</title><p>To identify new antiviral agents against KSHV lytic replication, the human iSLK.219 cell line was used as a screening model. iSLK.219 carries a recombinant rKSHV.219 virus encoding a constitutive GFP reporter and an RTA-inducible RFP reporter in the viral genome, thereby facilitating the monitoring of viral maintenance and lytic reactivation. Previous reports demonstrated that iSLK.219 cells are suitable for anti-KSHV drug screening [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. To optimize conditions for the induction of lytic replication, iSLK.219 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of doxycycline (Dox) (up to 4 &#x003bc;g/mL) and/or sodium butyrate (NaB) (up to 4.8 mM), then RFP expression was detected at 24 h and 48 h post-induction using the Operetta High-Content Screening (HCS) System. We found that at 24 h post-induction, both Dox and NaB induced RFP expression, but the RFP signal induced by NaB alone was weaker than Dox alone. NaB addition synergistically promoted RFP expression by Dox in a dose-dependent manner (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008156.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref></bold>). At 48 h post-induction, the level of RFP expression showed minor differences among the different concentration groups except for the Dox alone group (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008156.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold>), indicating that the effects of induction plateau at this time point. Based on these data, 1 &#x003bc;g/mL Dox in combination with 1.2 mM NaB was chosen as the optimal lytic-induction condition for subsequent antiviral screening. This treatment also promoted the production of mature virions as detected using an infectivity assay in which increasing doses of supernatants from induced iSLK.219 cells were used to infect HEK293T cells.

Based on these results, we hypothesized that blocking histamine receptors inhibits KSHV lytic replication. To test this, we examined the antiviral activities of classic antagonists targeting different histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) on induced iSLK.219 cells. As shown in <bold><xref rid="ppat.1008156.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008156.s001">S1 Fig</xref></bold>, each of the tested antagonists of H1R, H3R and H4R effectively inhibited KSHV virion production from induced iSLK.219 cells (SI &#x0003e;6). It is noteworthy that all four antagonists of H3R tested (Clobenpropit, Conessine, Thioperamide, Tiprolisant) displayed potent anti-KSHV activity with SI &#x0003e;20. In contrast, only one of the H2R antagonists (Burimamide oxalate&#x02013;which is actually a mixed H2R/H3R antagonists), displayed anti-KSHV ability with SI &#x0003e;6, while other H2R antagonists tested exhibited an SI &#x0003c;3 against KSHV, implying that blocking H2R may have less effect on KSHV lytic reactivation from iSLK.219 cells. To exclude the possibility that antiviral activities of these antagonists are due to decreasing viral entry or a virucidal effect, we evaluated viral lytic gene expression from induced iSLK.219 cells treated with representative antagonists under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Our results indicated that all representative antagonists, Pyrilamine maleate salt (PMS, H1R antagonist), Burimamide oxalate (H2R/H3R antagonist), Thioperamide (H3R antagonist) and JNJ-7777120 (H4R antagonist), significantly blocked ORF26 and vIL-6 expression under the concentrations of their IC<sub>50</sub> and 2&#x000d7;IC<sub>50</sub>, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008156.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>). Next, we used rKSHV.219 virions to infect HEK293T cells in the presence of four representative antagonists of histamine receptors (H1R-H4R) using a spinoculation protocol. Our results showed that, regardless of histamine receptor subtype specificity, all of the antagonists at their IC<sub>50</sub> concentrations displayed almost no inhibitory effects on relative GFP levels. PMS, Thioperamide, and JNJ-7777120 showed a minimal inhibitory effect (&#x0003c;20%) at the highest concentrations (&#x0003e;10&#x000d7;IC<sub>50</sub>) tested (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat.1008156.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>), which may reflect the cytotoxicity.

Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that histamine receptors play a role in facilitating KSHV lytic reactivation. This is supported by results showing that the inhibition of most histamine receptors by antagonists reduces KSHV lytic replication, while stimulation of these receptors by agonists promotes viral lytic replication and enhances infectious virion production. Further mechanistic studies implicate the involvement of MAPK and PI3K/Akt as downstream signaling pathways triggered by histamine and/or other agonists to promote KSHV lytic replication. Taken together, our study has provided new clues for the development of therapeutic strategies against KSHV infection and related diseases.</p><p>Among the hit compounds, Monobenzone, a depigmenting agent that typically is used to eliminate melanin from skin cells for clinical treatment of people with vitiligo [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], is highly effective in inhibiting KSHV lytic reactivation and virion production with the best SI (&#x0003e; 500) and little cytotoxicity (CC<sub>50</sub> &#x0003e;360 &#x003bc;M), suggesting its high potential to become an effective and safe drug for the treatment of KSHV infection, although to our knowledge it has never been reported to have antiviral activity. In contrast, another hit compound, Spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor antagonist used to treat heart failure, hypertension and hypokalemia [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], was previously demonstrated to have antiviral activity against several herpesviruses, including Epstein-Barr virus and Equid alpha-herpesviruses [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Not surprisingly, a cluster of compounds related to DNA synthesis or replication were also identified as hit candidates, including Hycanthone, Oxaliplatin and Oxibendazole. For example, as an anti-schistosomal drug [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], Hycanthone is an inhibitor of topoisomerase II (Top II), an enzyme that is indispensable for KSHV lytic replication [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Similarly, the anti-KSHV activities of Oxaliplatin, a chemotherapy drug used for treating advanced colon and rectal cancers, and Oxibendazole, a polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of intestinal helminth infections, are largely dependent on their inhibition of DNA synthesis [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Interestingly, our hit compounds also include several inhibitors targeting a series of neurotransmitter receptors, including dopamine receptors, adrenergic receptors, serotonin receptors, muscarinic receptors and histamine receptors. Although published results indicate that some neurotransmitter receptors, such as adrenoreceptors and dopamine receptors, can regulate KSHV reactivation through related signaling pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], the functional roles of most neurotransmitters in KSHV lytic replication still remain unclear. It is conceivable that some neurotransmitters may interact with inflammatory factors to create and/or maintain a pro-lytic microenvironment for this oncogenic virus.</p><p>In the current study, we focus on the roles of histamine, its receptors and downstream signaling in KSHV lytic replication. One previous report found that histamine addition into KS-1 cells (a KSHV+ PEL cell line) induced KSHV lytic gene expression through activating PKA signaling pathway [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], but which histamine receptors were involved in this process was not explored. In the current study, we found that KSHV lytic reactivation was inhibited by targeting histamine receptors by both antagonists and RNAi, while viral replication was enhanced by histamine receptor agonists, demonstrating that histamine receptors indeed affect viral lytic replication. Interestingly, the antagonists and agonists of H2R displayed less effects on viral reactivation and replication when compared to those of other histamine receptors in iSLK.219 cells. However, we speculate that histamine receptor subtypes will exhibit differential expression on the various cells targeted by KSHV for infection, and they are probably differential among endothelial cells, epithelial cells, fibroblasts, and B cells, when compared to iSLK.219 cells. Future studies will identify which histamine receptor subtypes mediate histamine promotion of KSHV lytic reactivation in different host cells.</p><p>It is also possible downstream signaling by specific histamine receptors functions through different proteins and pathways. For example, a recent study in colorectal cancer cells demonstrated that H2R activation reduced MAPK phosphorylation to suppress their activities [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], which differs from the activating effects of other histamine receptors on MAPK pathways [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Our findings here demonstrate that the MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways are involved in the histamine-mediated promotion of KSHV lytic reactivation. Other studies report that the MAPK pathways, including p38, JNK and/or ERK, are essential for KSHV reactivation [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], and the PI3K/Akt pathway is closely related to KSHV lytic reactivation [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanisms for histamine receptors in regulating these signaling pathway activities in KSHV-infected cells still require further investigation.</p><p>We demonstrate here histamine levels are elevated in plasma and saliva samples from a cohort of HIV+/KSHV+ patients when compared to HIV+/KSHV- ones, which implicates histamine in the clinical progression of KSHV pathogenesis and virus-associated diseases. However, we note that plasma and saliva histamine levels (especially the latter) were lower than those we used in cell culture assays. In fact, we think the patients&#x02019; histamine levels are greatly underestimated in our test, because 1) although histamine rises much more rapidly than does serum tryptase, the short half-life of histamine, on the order of minutes, and the difficulties in handling patient samples usually preclude accurate measurements [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; 2) some chemical components of mouthwash we used to collect saliva may accelerate histamine degradation. Therefore, future work will use fresh samples, including whole saliva directly collected without mouthwash or test stable metabolites of histamine such as N-methylhistamine [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Although our current study focuses on the role of histamine, receptors and signaling in KSHV lytic reactivation and replication, the histaminergic system may also directly contribute to viral oncogenesis. There is now overwhelming evidence supporting the significance of histamine/receptors in cancer formation and spread, producing protumor or, conversely, antitumor effects, which depend on different tumor types [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study reported that the use of antagonists of MC pro-inflammatory mediators (including histamine receptors antagonists) successfully caused a rapid and durable regression of AIDS-KS lesions in one patient [<xref rid="ppat.1008156.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. They also found increased plasma N-methylhistamine levels in AIDS-KS and classic KS patients when compared to healthy comparators.</p><p>In conclusion, the lacking of effective treatment for KSHV-associated malignancies, especially in immunocompromised patients, requires the discovery and development of novel and safe therapeutic strategies. In this study, we have identified 15 FDA-approved drugs with excellent anti-KSHV activities, which may offer clues that foster the development of new antiviral treatments.
