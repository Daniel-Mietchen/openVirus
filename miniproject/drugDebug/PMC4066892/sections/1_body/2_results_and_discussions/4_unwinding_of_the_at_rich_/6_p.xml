<p>The shape of the experimental curves suggests that Pt-bis-netropsin decreases the rate of ATP-dependent unwinding of the AT-rich hairpin by OBP. The mean value of 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> is 169.6 ± 22.7 min (data from three independent experiments), while 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> measured in the absence of Pt-bis-Nt is 113.5 ± 14.7 min. The difference between the mean values of 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>1</sub> can be considered as a quantitative measure of the decrease in the rate of the unwinding reaction caused by Pt-bis-Nt binding to the AT-rich hairpin. Previous studies established that upon binding to the AT-rich hairpin Pt-bis-Nt increases its stability, as can be evidenced from the rise of the melting temperature by nearly 20 °C (

 <sub>1</sub> value for ATP-dependent DNA unwinding process is increased on lowering the temperature of the reaction mixture from 37° to 33 °C (
