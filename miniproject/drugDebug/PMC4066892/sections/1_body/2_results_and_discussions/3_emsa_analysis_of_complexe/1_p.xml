<p>The fluorescence spectra measured for the single-stranded oligonucleotide S5 and its complex with UL9 helicase are indicative of substantial quenching. The eletrophoretic mobilities of single-stranded oligonucleotides S1* and S2* and their mixtures with OBP are distinctly different (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). We have found that OBP forms a strong complex with the single-stranded oligonucleotide S1 and exhibits a lower affinity for binding to the (S1 + S2) duplex. The values of the corresponding association constants differ nearly 10-fold as revealed from competition-type experiments, using ethidium bromide as a competitive ligand (
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Surovaya et al., 2010</xref>). Such a difference in the affinities of OBP to the (S1 + S2) duplex and single-stranded oligonucleotides S1 seems to be the main cause of structural changes induced on binding of OBP to the (S1 + S2) duplex. These structural changes involve DNA bending and formation of 3D structure containing both single-stranded and base paired DNA segments.
