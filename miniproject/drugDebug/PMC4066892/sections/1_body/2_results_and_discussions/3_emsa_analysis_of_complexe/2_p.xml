<p>Analysis of the melting curves for (S1 + S2) duplex showed that on average three base pairs in the (S1 + S2) duplex exist in an unwound state at 42°C and may serve as a “nucleus” for helix-coil transition within the A + T cluster in (S1 + S2) duplex. Incubation of the (S1* + S2*) duplex with OBP and ATP (60 min, 42 °C) gives a small quantity of the product whose mobility during polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis coincides with the mobility of a complex between OBP and single-stranded oligonucleotide S1 (
