<p>The similarities between the sequences implicated in the (HhH)
 <sub>2</sub> motif of the HJ-binding protein RuvA and DNA-binding domains of the viral replication origin binding proteins suggest that HSV1 OBP and its homologs in other viruses belong to a family of the HJ-binding helicases. Interesting that peptide RVKNLTK flanking the second hairpin in the presumed (HhH)
 <sub>2</sub> motif of HSV1 OBP is known to be implicated in the recognition of the viral DNA replication origin (
 <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Olsson et al., 2009</xref>). Our recent experiments show that HSV1 OBP binds more strongly to a synthetic HJ than to a linear DNA and catalyzes the unwinding of HJ in the presence of ATP (
