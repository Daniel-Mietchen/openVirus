<p>In the hairpin structure of the oligonucleotide S5 (or S6), the 5′- and 3′-ends are held close to each other. If the structure of the duplex is deformed upon binding of OBP dimers to DNA, the donor and acceptor molecules conjugated to the 5′- and 3′-ends of each oligonucleotide become spatially approximated (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), as can be evidenced from the quenching of the donor fluorescence by the acceptor. The fluorescence intensity of the free oligonucleotide S5 is substantially lower than that of the duplex conjugated with the same fluorophore and quencher which are separated by a larger distance from one another. The efficiency of the energy transfer from D to A in case of the free oligonucleotide S5 (1 −

 <sub>DA</sub>/

 <sub>D</sub>) is equal to .81 ± .07 suggesting that S5 exists in solution in the hairpin-like conformation. Similar results were obtained for the oligonucleotides S6 and S8. After addition of OBP to the single-stranded oligonucleotide S5 and duplex (S5 + S9), the fluorescence intensity diminishes in the absence of ATP and ICP8 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, panel A). It is noteworthy that the shape of the normalized fluorescence spectrum is not changed in the presence of the enzyme. The quenching may occur as a result of direct interaction of OBP with the fluorophore and/or may arise from a change in the DNA structure induced on binding of OBP, thus reflecting some change in the distance between the donor and acceptor chromophores. Our studies reveal that both mechanisms of quenching may occur. Their relative contribution to the overall amplitude of quenching can be determined experimentally.
