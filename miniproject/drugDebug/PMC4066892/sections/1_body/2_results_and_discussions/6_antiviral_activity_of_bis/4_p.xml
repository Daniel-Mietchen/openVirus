<p>The therapeutic effect was the most apparent after application of 15Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt in the form of .15% ointment. The size of the injured zone diminished by âˆ¼9 and 7%, respectively. The areas affected by vesicular herpetic rash decreased in size reliably in comparison with control. Complete re-epithelization occurred 24 h earlier than in the control group. By comparison, a similar therapeutic effect could be attained through application of acyclovir in the form of 5% ointment with a 30 times higher drug content (by weight) (

 <italic>in vivo</italic> effects of two bis-netropsins and acyclovir demonstrated that Lys-bis-Nt and 15Lys-bis-Nt used as ointment-based drugs had much greater curative effects on herpetic infection than acyclovir. The data obtained also show that dimeric derivatives of netropsin serve as effective inhibitors of infections transmitted by acyclovir-resistant HSV1 strains in cases where oral or intraepidermic administration of acyclovir has little effect.
