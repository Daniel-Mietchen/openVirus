<p>Footprinting studies have revealed that Pt-bis-netropsin binds selectively to the A + T cluster in OriS and inhibits the fluctuation opening of the AT pairs which is a prerequisite to DNA unwinding by OBP. In the presence of Pt*-bis-Nt, less apparent protective effects are seen in comparison with Pt-bis-netropsin. The binding constant of Pt-bis-netropsin is ≈10
 <sup>8</sup> M
 <sup>−1</sup>, that is, ∼10 times higher than that found for Pt*-bis-Nt. It is noteworthy that 15Lys-bis-Nt, Pt-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt also possess antiherpetic activity in cultured Vero E6 cells (IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 1.3, 4.4 and 11.6 µM, respectively); the values of the selectivity indexes (SI) for 15Lys-bis-Nt, Pt-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt are equal to 47, 59 and 29, respectively. Pt*-bis-Nt exhibits low (if any) antiviral activity against HSV1-infected Vero E6 cells (SI ≈ 0) (

 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Surovaya et al., 2010</xref>). We also studied the cell toxicity of 15Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt in the cultured Vero E6 cells. Cell viability estimated by trypan blue exclusion method was significantly lowered in the presence of Nt, as compared with 15Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt. The values of cytotoxic concentration CC
 <sub>50</sub> (the concentration sufficient to induce death of 50% of cells after 72 h incubation) for 15 Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt are equal to 176 and 362 µg/ml, respectively, being in case of administration of Lys-bis-Nt approximately by one order of magnitude higher than that found for Nt (37.5 µg/ml).

The concentrations of the bis-linked netropsin derivatives sufficient to suppress the virus-induced cytopathic effect by 50% in comparison with control, CI
 <sub>50</sub>, were commensurate to the value obtained for the parent antibiotic Nt (3.7, 12.5 and 5.0 µg/ml for 15Lys-bis-Nt, Lys-bis-Nt and Nt, respectively). However, the selectivity index calculated as the CC
 <sub>50</sub>/CI
 <sub>50</sub> ratio was significantly lower for netropsin as compared with the corresponding values for 15Lys-bis-Nt and Lys-bis-Nt (7.5 against 47 and 29, respectively). It is noteworthy that a similar selective antiviral effect was observed for HSV1 strains resistant to basic antiherpetic drugs (acyclovir, phosphonoformic acid, etc.).
