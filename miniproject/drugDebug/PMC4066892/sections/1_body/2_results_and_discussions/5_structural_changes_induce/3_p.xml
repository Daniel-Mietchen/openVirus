<p>Consistent with these results are the observations obtained for the (S3 + S7 + S8) oligomer which differs from the (S3 + S6) duplex in that the oligonucleotides S7 and S8 replace oligonucleotide S6 in a complex with the oligonucleotide S3 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>). After annealing of the oligonucleotides S3, S7, and S8, the upper strand of the oligomer contained a 3′-terminal single-stranded tail of 18 nucleotides long. The analogue of the cyanine dye Cy5 is tethered to the 3′-end of the oligonucleotide S8, whereas the donor (R6G) is attached to the 5′-end of the oligonucleotide S7. The observed quenching effect reflects a change in the efficiency of energy transfer from the excited donor to the acceptor attached to the 5′- and 3′- ends of the oligonucleotides S7 and S8. Consistent with this are the observations that a decrease of the fluorescence intensity at 559 nm is accompanied by an increase of the fluorescence intensity at 670 nm (
