<p>At bis-netropsin/DNA oligomer molar ratio equal to 1.2 the ATP-dependent unwinding of the oligomer (S3 + S7 + S8) by OBP appeared to be inhibited virtually completely (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Figure 12</xref>, panel C). It is noteworthy that Pt-bis-Nt also decreased the rate of unwinding of the AT-rich hairpin in the oligonucleotide S5 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>) and prevented formation of an extended non-structured tail at the 3â€²-end of the oligonucleotide.
