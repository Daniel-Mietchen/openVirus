<p>As can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>, the fluorescence intensity of a complex between (S3 + S6) duplex and OBP measured immediately after addition of ATP increases and then a slow time-dependent quenching of the fluorescence is observed. After 300-min incubation, the distance between the donor and the acceptor becomes closer to the value observed for the free oligonucleotide S6. The slope of the straight line

This reflects the fact that upon binding to the (S3 + S6) duplex Pt-bis-netropsin stabilizes structure of A + T-rich DNA segment and diminishes the rate of DNA unwinding by OBP.
