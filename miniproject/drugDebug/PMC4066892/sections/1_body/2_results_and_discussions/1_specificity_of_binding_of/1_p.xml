 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> shows the footprinting diagrams of Pt-bis-Nt and Pt*-bis-Nt complexes with the DNA fragments containing an insert with the nucleotide sequence corresponding to the origin of replication OriS of HSV type 1. The DNA fragment used in our footprinting studies also contains oligonucleotide inserts carrying pseudosymmetrical sequences which may serve as potential interaction sites for Pt-bis-Nt and Pt*-bis-Nt.
