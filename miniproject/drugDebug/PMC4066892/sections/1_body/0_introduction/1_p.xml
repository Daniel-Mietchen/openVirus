<p>The use of therapeutically active chemical compounds able to bind selectively to viral DNA and to inhibit the activities of key viral DNA-binding proteins is one of the perspective approaches to therapy of the diseases caused by DNA-containing viruses. Nucleosides related to acyclovir are the only compound class available at present for systematic treatments of herpes disease. In the present work, new minor groove binding ligands have been synthesized which selectively inhibit development of virus-induced cytopathic effect in Vero cell culture infected with HSV1. In the past 20 years, great progress has been achieved in the design and synthesis of low-molecular-weight compounds that can bind to DNA at selected sites. Most of the synthesized sequence-specific DNA-binding compounds are derivatives of antitumor antibiotics netropsin and distamycin or dye Hoechst 33258 (for reviews see

 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">Klevit, Wemmer, &amp; Reid, 1986</xref>) studies have shown that these two antibiotics bind in the minor DNA groove at runs of four and five AT- base pairs. Their binding specificity derives from specific hydrogen bonding interactions between the amide NH groups of the antibiotic molecule and the thymine O2 and adenine N3 atoms, electrostatic interactions and van der Waals contacts with the floor and both sides of the minor groove. An obvious way to enhance the binding specificity shown by these antibiotics is to synthesize dimer compounds (bis-netropsins and bis-distamycins) in which two monomers are covalently linked by different linkers (

 <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Mrksich, Parks, &amp; Dervan, 1994</xref>). NMR and X-ray studies also revealed that two distamycin (lexitropsin) molecules can be packed in an antiparallel side-by-side manner in the minor DNA groove (

Such molecules could be expected to influence the binding of regulatory proteins to DNA and to act as potential regulators of gene expression. This has been demonstrated in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, with down-regulation of promoter activities in some cases (

Sequence-specific DNA-binding ligands can also be used to inhibit initiation of replication of viral DNA and to serve as potential antiviral drugs. In the present paper, we provide experimental evidence that complexes of the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) OBP with the viral replication origins, two OriS sites and one OriL site, serve as perspective targets for suppression of the diseases caused by HSV1. Previous studies showed that bis-linked netropsin derivatives effectively suppress development of virus-induced cytopathic effect in the cultured cells (
