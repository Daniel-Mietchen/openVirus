In the present study, kinetics of DNA unwinding by OBP was monitored by measuring the efficiency of the resonance energy transfer between the fluorophore and quencher covalently linked to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide. The data obtained suggest that Pt-bis-netropsin inhibits the unwinding of the OriS duplex by OBP. We investigated antiviral activities of bis-netropsins and their therapeutic effects on the HSV1-infected laboratory animals.
