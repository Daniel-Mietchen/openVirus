 <sub>0</sub> is the critical distance between the excited molecule of the donor and the non-excited molecule of the acceptor wherein the probability of the energy transfer from the excited donor molecule to the nonexcited acceptor molecule is equal to the probability of spontaneous light emission from the excited donor molecule. The values of
