<p>The single-stranded oligonucleotides and double-stranded DNA constructs (S1 + S2) and (S5 + S2), (S5 + S9), (S4 + S9), (S3 + S6), (S10 + S11) и (S12 + S11), and (S3 + S7 + S8) were used as substrates in the studies of DNA binding and DNA unwinding catalyzed by UL9 helicase (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The oligonucleotides S1–S12 were synthesized by the phosphoroamidite method and purified by electrophoresis in polyacrylamide gel (Syntol, Russia). The dyes were covalently attached to the 3′- and 5′-ends of the oligonucleotides S4 to S8 via aminohexamethylene linkers. Here, R6G and Cy5 are the derivatives of 6-carboxyrhodamine G and dye Cy5, respectively. Radioactively labeled oligonucleotides S1*, S2*, S3*, S7*, and S8* each containing a radioactive residue [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P]-AMP at the 5′-end. The analogs of R6G and Cy5 dyes were used as donors of electron excitation energy; the roles of the acceptors during the resonance energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor were played by the nonfluorescent dye BHQ2 (Black Hole Quencher 2) and Cy5 dye.
