<p>The full-sized recombinant UL9 protein was synthesized on the basis of the modified plasmid PET14 carrying a HSV1 UL9 gene (strain L
 <sub>2</sub> from the State Virus Collection of D.I. Ivanovsky Institute of Virology) (
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Surovaya et al., 2010</xref>). The protein contains a histidine “tag”, that is, a cluster of six N-terminal histidine residues enabling protein purification on metal-chelating (Ni-NTA) columns (Quiagen). Protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar extinction coefficient for the UL9 monomer of 89,000 M
 <sup>−1</sup> cm
 <sup>−1</sup> at 280 nm (
 <xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">Surovaya et al., 2010</xref>). The recombinant protein was stored in the buffer containing 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 7.2), 20 mM HEPES-NaOH, .54 M NaCl, .01% Tween 20, .10 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol and 20% (v/v) glycerol.
