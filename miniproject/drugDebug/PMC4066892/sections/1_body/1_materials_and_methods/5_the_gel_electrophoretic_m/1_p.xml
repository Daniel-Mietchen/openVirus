<p>In order to prepare radioactively labeled oligonucleotides, 300 pmol of the oligonucleotide was mixed with 2 MBk (∼15 pmol) of [γ-
 <sup>32</sup>P]-ATP and 10 units of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Sibenzyme) in 20 mkl of phosphorylation buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.2, 10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, .1 mM EDTA, 5 mM DTT and .1 mM spermidine), the mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h and then added 1 µl of 1 M unlabeled ATP solution and was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h.
