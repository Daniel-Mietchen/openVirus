  <p>EMSA studies in the nondenaturing 10% polyacrylamide gel of complexes formed by OBP with single-stranded oligonucleotide S8 (panel a), partial duplex (S3* + S7) and oligomer (S3* + S7 + S8*) (panel b). Lane 0, oligonucleotide S8* alone (panel a), ternary complex (S3* + S7* + S8*) and partial duplex (S3* + S7) in the absence of OBP and ATP (panel b). In panels a, b, and c, lane 1 corresponds to a complex of OBP with single-stranded oligonucleotide S8* (panel a), duplex (S3* + S7*) (panel b) and oligomer (S3* + S7* + S8*) (panel c) in the absence of ATP. Lane 2 corresponds to the same complex incubated for 30 min at 37°C in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.8) in the presence of 5 mM dithiothreitol, 15 mM MgCl
   <sub>2</sub>, 10% (v/v) glycerol; .01% (v/v) Triton X-100 and 20 mM ATP. The reaction mixtures were cooled to room temperature and loaded on a 10% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (19:1) with a thickness of .4 mm. Electrophoresis was carried out for 120 min at 800 V and temperature 20 °C.
