  <p>Panel A – the fluorescence spectra of the duplexes (S5 + S9) and (S4 + S9) (curves 1 and 5, respectively) and their complexes with OBP (curves 2 and 6, respectively). The fluorescence spectra of the free oligonucleotides S5 and S4 (curves 3 and 7, respectively) and their complexes with OBP (curves 4 and 8, respectively) are also shown. Panel B – the fluorescence spectra of the duplexes (S10 + S11) and (S12 + S11) (curves 1 and 2, respectively) and their complexes with OBP (curves 3 and 4, respectively). Excitation wavelength – 510 nm, excitation and emission slits are 10 and 5 nm, respectively, a. u. – arbitrary units. Concentrations: duplexes and free oligonucleotides – 2 × 10
   <sup>−7</sup> M, OBP dimers – 4.9 × 10
   <sup>−7</sup> M. Incubation conditions: 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2), 4 mM MgCl
   <sub>2</sub>, 0.18 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, .01% Triton X-100, 1 mM dithiothreitol.
