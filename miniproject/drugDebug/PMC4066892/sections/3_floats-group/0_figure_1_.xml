 <caption>
  <p>The nucleotide sequence at the HSV1 origin of replication OriS (A). The positions of DNA segments carrying palindromic sequences are indicated by arrows. These segments contain binding sites I and III for helicase (Boxes I and III), the A + T cluster and Box II. D and A – donor and acceptor molecules covalently linked to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the oligonucleotide in the minimal duplex OriS. Indicated are the proposed stem and loop structures for a fragment (63 nt) of the upper chain in the minimal OriS duplex (panels B and C).</p>
