<p id="p-51ff5126bb9efbe49341856251e914c8">Lopinavir/ritonavir is a combination of drugs mainly used for AIDS treatment. Lopinavir inhibits viral protease resulting in immature/non-infectious virus particles; ritonavir inhibits the degradation of lopinavir in the liver and thereby extends lopinavirâ€™s half-life. Results from

 </sup>. However, whether they can inhibit COVID-19 is unknown. Therefore, a clinical trial to use lopinavir/ritonavir for COVID-19 treatment will be launched soon in a hospital in Wuhan, China. In addition, since darunavir (trade name: Prozekal) is another protease inhibitor used for HIV treatment, a combination of darunavir and ritonavir could also be a potential treatment of COVID-19, especially since darunavir has been approved in China since 2018 for HIV treatment.
