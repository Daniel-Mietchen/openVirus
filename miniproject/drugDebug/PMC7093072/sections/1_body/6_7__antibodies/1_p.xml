On the other hand, non-neutralizing antibodies may bind the virus and activate the immune cells (mainly macrophages) to engulf and clear the virus. However, excessive activation of these non-specific immune cells may cause the release of a large number of pro-inflammatory factors leading to cytokine storm and sepsis-related death. Therefore, non-neutralizing antibodies play an antiviral role in the early stages but may cause lung damage at later stages. However, it usually takes an extended period of time to generate monoclonal antibodies for a new pathogen that can be used clinically.</p>
