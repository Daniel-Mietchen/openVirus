<p id="Par6">In vitro methodologies are well-positioned to study potential DILI of compounds currently being developed against COVID-19. Relatively simple human-relevant cell models can be used to evaluate hepatotoxic properties of (novel) drugs in a relatively short time. This has been robustly demonstrated for a large series of compounds (Rodrigues et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2016</xref>; Kuna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Also co-morbidities such as NAFLD that increase the risk for developing DILI can be modeled using in vitro methodology (Massart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>; Boeckmans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2019</xref>). Recently, Huh7 and Vero E6 cells in culture have been used to assess the pharmacological effects of remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, all potential anti-COVID-19 treatments under study (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020a</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). Hence, in vitro methodologies can be easily explored for increasing our knowledge with respect to the pharmacological concern and concomitant toxicological aspects of COVID-19 treatment.
