<p id="Par5">Patients suffering either from diabetes type 1 or 2, or developing hypertension, often receive blood pressure reducing ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II type I receptor blockers, which may lead to ACE2 overexpression. Therefore, although clinical evidence is lacking, it has to be kept in mind that ACE2 upregulation might be at the origin of a higher susceptibility for developing COVID-19 (Fang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020</xref>; Fitzgerald 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). Furthermore, these patients often suffer from the metabolic syndrome, which is a major risk factor for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). NAFLD can sensitize the liver for hepatotoxicants such as acetaminophen (Michaut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2014</xref>; Massart et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), which is the advised and widely used anti-pyretic symptomatic drug treatment. Although it is actually not known whether a link exists between COVID-19 and liver steatosis, it is worrying that in a recent 
 <italic>post-mortem</italic> histopathological analysis of a liver biopsy of a COVID-19 patient microvesicular liver steatosis was observed (Xu et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>). Even though this finding needs to be confirmed in larger studies, it has also been demonstrated that patients suffering from COVID-19 exhibited increased serum levels of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>), which is a chemokine known to exacerbate steatohepatitis (Gao and Tsukamoto 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2016</xref>). Consequently, pre-disposing factors for developing steatohepatitis, such as intake of steatosis-inducing drugs (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> sodium valproate, amiodarone, tamoxifen and methotrexate) (Boeckmans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>), could play a role in combined COVID-19 and DILI. Knowing that liver dysfunction and NAFLD are more common in the elderly, who are also more prone to develop severe COVID-19, it is probably wise to carefully monitor COVID-19 patients for drug treatment that could lead to DILI.
