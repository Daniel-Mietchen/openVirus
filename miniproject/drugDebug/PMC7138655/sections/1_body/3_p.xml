<p id="Par4">It has been reported that patients suffering from certain viral infections, such as infections caused by hepatitis C and human immunodeficiency viruses, are more prone for developing drug-induced liver injury (DILI), especially when associated with highly active anti-retroviral therapy (Naidoo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2019</xref>; Bonacini 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2004</xref>). Recently it was postulated that liver impairment in COVID-19 patients could also be drug-related (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2020</xref>). This may have consequences for patients who are treated with novel, potentially hepatotoxic, antiviral drugs and perhaps also antibiotics for bacterial superinfections (Xu et al

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">b</xref>). Hydroxychloroquine is applied as an antiviral drug, with sparse evidence in small clinical settings. Yet, viral replication and disease progression would be reduced and overall survival would increase. The effect of hydroxychloroquine on hepatic tissue seems ambiguous, since it is used to treat liver infection with protozoa (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1994</xref>; Liu et al
 <italic>.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020a</xref>). Azithromycin would have additional effects to hydroxychloroquine. However, there is little evidence and the underlying mechanisms are unclear (Gautret et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020</xref>). Furthermore, azithromycin-induced hepatotoxicity only appears 1–3 weeks after azithromycin initiation (Martinez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2015</xref>).
