  <p>Structure and binding of COVID-19 virus to ACE2. The above-mentioned figure depicts the structure of the COVID-19 virus. Among the viral structure the S protein has a major role in binding of the virus to the host receptor cells. S protein has two subunits which are the S1 receptor-binding subunit and S2 the membrane fusion subunit; where the earlier one attached itself to the ACE2 receptor of the human host cell and the S2 subunit internalises and creates the membrane fusion among the viral subunit and the ACE2 receptors. This leads to the release of the viral RNA into the host cell and results into respiratory infection.</p>
