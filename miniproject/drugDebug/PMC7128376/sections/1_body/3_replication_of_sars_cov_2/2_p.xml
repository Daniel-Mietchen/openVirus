<p id="p0070">After the SARS-CoV-2 virus has entered the human host cells, the next step for its survival is its RNA replication. The viral RNA replication is the most unusual and critical step carried out by the virus for its survival inside the host body. The tools that are required for the process of replication are open reading frames (ORFs), two replicase genes (rep1a and rep1ab), a slippery sequence (5′-UUUAAAC-3′) and two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab). Both these polyproteins contain the most important proteins of the virus that are the Nsp proteins (Nsp1–11and Nsp1–16), these proteins are a common occurrence in these virus types (

Further these Nsp proteins (Nsp1/2, Nsp2/3 and Nsp3/4) assemble to form the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC) which creates an environment inside the host body suitable for RNA synthesis and replication. Also, these Nsps have various roles in RNA replication of the virus. Nsp12 codes for the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) domain, Nsp13 is encrypted with RNA helicase domain and RNA 5′-triphosphase, Nsp14 encodes exoribonuclease (ExoN) which helps in replication conformity and finally Nsp16 encodes 2′-Omethyltransferase activity. These evidences prove that Nsp protein has a vital role in keeping the virus alive inside the host body by promoting basic synthesis, replication and translation.
