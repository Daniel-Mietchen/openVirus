 <xref rid="bb0835" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2020d</xref>). National Institutes of Health (NIH), has mentioned that SARS-CoV-2 could survive for up to 3Â h maximum as aerosols to a maximum of three days on surfaces. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. It will also give researchers more time to develop the vaccine against COVID-19. So, it's time for all the citizens to join hands together to fight against coronavirus by practicing self-hygiene and social distancing.
