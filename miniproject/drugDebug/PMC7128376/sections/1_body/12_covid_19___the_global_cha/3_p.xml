<p id="p0205">The genomic structure of the virus is not the only factor that presents a great challenge to research, its ability to adapt and survive in different environmental conditions make it nearly impossible to identify its mode of survival. It has been earlier reported that the SARS virus can survive at 4 °C with a humidity rate of 20%. The first outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 was during the peak of winter, where the environmental temperature was around 2 °C to 10 °C. But since then the virus has infected people and survived in countries of completely different climatic conditions, making its demographic association hard to predict. The health care professionals and equipment are limited and are unable to handle the vast number of patients who are infected. Moreover, some of the individuals who are infectious are asymptomatic and continue to travel or gather in social surroundings infecting more people. These factors pose a challenge for scientists, health-care professional and government officials to handle and contain the condition. Government officials in all countries continue to make efforts to minimize human contact by facilitating country wide shutdowns of public places as well as various steps have been initiated to ensure the safety of the people, like social distancing and self-quarantine which limits our social interactions. This will reduce the risk of spreading the COVID-19 to people by breaking the transmission chain and the influx of new COVID-19 cases in a given time period (
