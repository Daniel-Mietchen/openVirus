<p id="p0050">Human coronaviruses are predominantly concomitant with upper respiratory tract illnesses ranging from mild to moderate including common cold. Most of the people may be infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lifetime (

The exact origin of the virus, continues to remain as a mystery, to researchers worldwide. Investigations need to be carried out to pinpoint the exact source of infection. The WHO, on February 11, 2020, officially named the viral disease COVID-19 (

The COVID-19 is known to show symptoms slowly over an incubation period of around 2Â weeks. During this time the virus replicates in the upper and lower respiratory tract, forming lesions (
