<p id="p0080">SARS-CoV-2 shares homology with the SARS-CoV but the rate of transmission and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 has been remarkable; this accelerated spreading rate may be due to a gain of function mutation, making this novel virus different from the SARS-CoV virus. These changes found in SARS-CoV-2 include, an absent 8a, longer 8b and shorter 3b segments and different Nsp 2 and 3 proteins (

It may be beneficial to understand the biological function of these proteins. Further, it has been found that more pathogenic viruses contain a furin like cleavage site in the S protein, which is not present in SARS-CoV but present in the SARS-CoV-2 (

Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 binds the same receptor as SARS-CoV, namely, ACE2 with much higher strength; this could be the reason for the increased transmission rate and its capacity to affect other species with such ease. The S protein has S1 on its N terminal and S2 at its C terminal, and the RBD is present at the S1 region. The S2 domain of the S protein consists of the fusion protein, a second proteolytic site (S2â€²), followed by an internal fusion peptide (FP) and two heptad-repeat domains preceding the transmembrane domain (TM) and internal FP is identical between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV (
