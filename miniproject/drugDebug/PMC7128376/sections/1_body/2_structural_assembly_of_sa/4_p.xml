<p id="p0065">Interestingly, it has also been proposed that SARS-CoV-2 mechanism of action in infection of humans is similar to the SARS. It has been reported that the RBM of the SARS-CoV-2 has a major amino acid residue (Gln493) that favours the attachment and fusion of the viral S protein with virus into the ACE2 protein of the human cell especially the one present in the lungs which results in respiratory infections in humans (
