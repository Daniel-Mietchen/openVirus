<p id="p0060">It has been reported that the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have similar kind of receptors, especially the receptor binding domain (RBD) and the receptor binding motif (RBM) in the viral genome (

 <xref rid="bb0740" ref-type="bibr">Tai et al., 2020</xref>). During the SARS infection, the RBM of the S protein gets directly attached to the Angiotension-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) in the human or the host cells (

 <xref rid="bb0915" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). The ACE1 and ACE2 have gained recognition as significant regulators of the physiology and pathology of the reproductive system (

Although, due to the novel nature of the virus, no study has proven that it will reduce men's fertility or sexual potency but medics in Wuhan have suggested the likelihood that the disease can affect the production of sperm leading to low sperm count and the formation of male sex hormones (low libido). In addition, SARS-CoV-2 infects host cell through ACE2 receptors leading to COVID-19 related pneumonia, while also causing acute myocardial injury and chronic damage to the cardiovascular system (
