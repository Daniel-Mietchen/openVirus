<p id="p0095">The HCoVs generally are very long (30,000 bp) positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses. Two groups of protein characterize HCoVs; the structural proteins, and non-structural proteins such as RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (nsp12) (
 <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Elfiky, 2020</xref>). Coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS are particularly adept at evading immune detection and dampening immune responses. It's not yet clear how SARS-CoV-2 affects the immune system. During viral infection, host factors elicits immune response against the viruses. T cells, particularly CD4+ and CD8+ play a significant antiviral role to combat the pathogens and elevate the risk of developing autoimmunity/inflammation (
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Cecere et al., 2012</xref>). The CD4 + T cells advance the production of viral-specific antibodies by activating T cell-dependent B cells. However, CD8+ T cells are cytotoxic and kill virus infected cells. The CD8+ T cells account for about 80% of total inflammatory cells in the pulmonary interstitium in SARS-CoV infected patients and play a critical role in clearing coronaviruses in infected cells and inducing immune injury (
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">Maloir et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, T helper cells make proinflammatory cytokines via NF-kB signaling (
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Manni et al., 2014</xref>). The cytokines, IL-17 recruit monocytes and neutrophils to the infection site showing inflammation and activates other downstream cascades of cytokines and chemokines, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-21, TNF-β, and MCP-1 (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Bunte and Beikler, 2019</xref>). It was observed that, T cell apoptosis was induced by a novel BH3-like region located in the C-terminal cytosolic domain of SARS-CoV protein mediated by Bcl-xL (
 <xref rid="bb0875" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). From the experimental evidences it was shown that T cell response to S protein and other structural proteins (including the M and N proteins) is long-lasting, persistent and provides evidence for designing new drugs and vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 composed of viral structural proteins, which can induce dominant, effective, and long-term memory cell responses against the virus. However, earlier studies have also reported a crucial role of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in SARS-CoV clearance (
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), while 
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Janice Oh et al. (2012)</xref> also observed that development of SARS-CoV specific neutralizing antibodies requires CD4+ T helper cells. Moreover, the ACE2 protein fused to a human immunoglobulin G Fc domain (ACE2-Fc) of SARS-CoV-2 patients may have the benefits of a traditional neutralizing antibody which could be used as a treatment for the infection. Ultimately, there will be a need for clinical trials to delineate any specific side effects of ACE2-Fc treatment (
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Kruse, 2020</xref>). Therefore ACE2-Fc might play an important role in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2, if the function of ACE2-Fc is inhibited (
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">Kruse, 2020</xref>). These immunological studies show how crucial it is to understand the basics of the immune responses in these viruses, so these immune cells can be induced to further attack the virus with increased specificity. Besides the immune system, scientists have also found a possible involvement of the COVID-19 in the nervous system.
