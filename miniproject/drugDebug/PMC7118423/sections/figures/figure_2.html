 <caption> Model of the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) signalling pathway involved in SARS-CoV-induced CCL2 expression. Infection of lung epithelial cells with SARS-CoV induces casein kinase II (CK II)-mediated phosphorylation of the ACE2 receptor, leading to activation of ERK1/2 and AP-1 and upregulation of CCL2. The elevated level of CCL2 protein detected in the sera of SARS-CoV-infected patients may account for the development of lung fibrosis. Figure was modified from Chen et al. [41]. SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; CCL2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2. </caption>
