 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. These studies show that ACE2-targeted drugs are expected to be used to treat SARS-CoV-2. The S2 subunit of the SARS-CoV spike protein plays a key role in mediating fusion of the virus and host cell and host cell entry. Heptapeptide repeat 1 (HR1) and heptapeptide repeat 2 (HR2) can interact to form six-helix bundles (6Hb), which makes the virus and cell membrane tightly bound 
 <xref rid="bib0058" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. A variety of effective fusion inhibitors against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been developed using S-HR1 and S-HR2, such as HR2P peptide 
 <xref rid="bib0059" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Researchers have found that the HR1 and HR2 regions of SARS-CoV-2 could also interact to form 6Hbs, and they have designed a pan-coronavirus fusion inhibitor denoted EK1 that can significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection in a dose-dependent manner
