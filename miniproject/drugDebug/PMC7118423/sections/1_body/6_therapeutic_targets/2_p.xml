<p id="para0015">SARS-CoV-2 is characterised by high contagiousness, high morbidity and high mortality, but no specific drugs for COVID-19 have been developed so far. Many researchers are trying to find therapeutic targets of the virus to develop high-efficiency, low-toxicity targeted drugs. A number of epidemiological studies have shown that the transmission characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 appear to be similar to SARS-CoV

 <xref rid="bib0043" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0044" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0046" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. These similarities give doctors and scientists a clue to look for targeted drugs. Although coronaviruses are subject to extensive mutations, some key proteins, particularly replication-related enzymes, are highly conserved 
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, so drugs targeting conserved proteases are usually able to block replication and proliferation of the virus and exhibit a broad spectrum 
 <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Specific inhibitors of key proteases involved in viral replication and proliferation are effective ways of killing viruses. Candidate compounds include RNA proteases, membrane proteins, spike glycoproteins, polymerases and viral envelope that act directly on the virus, as well as targets on the host such as receptors and proteases for virus entry and endocytosis

 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. Recently, scientists screened out four small-molecule drugs (prulifloxacin, tegobuvir, nelfinavir and bictegravir) with strong binding affinity to the main protease of SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0047" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. The first case of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia in the USA experienced significant improvement in clinical symptoms after receiving an intravenous (i.v.) infusion of remdesivir on the seventh day of hospitalisation 
 <xref rid="bib0051" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Remdesivir is a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug under development that inhibits viruses by inhibiting RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and that was originally used to treat Ebola although it was not very effective. Amazingly, it is effective against SARS and MERS
