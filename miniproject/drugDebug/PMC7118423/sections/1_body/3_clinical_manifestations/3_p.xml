<p id="para0007">Regarding the current situation, the source of infection is mainly infected patients, but the possibility of asymptomatic infection should not be ignored. Respiratory droplets and close contacts are the key routes of transmission. The possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment for a long-time exposure to high concentrations of aerosol also exists, but still requires scientific evidence. Recently, SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in the faeces of some confirmed patients with pneumonia, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be transmitted through the faecalâ€“oral route. Zhang et al. found that the ACE2 cell receptor is highly expressed on type II alveolar epithelial cells, oesophageal epithelium, stratified epithelial cells, and even in absorptive intestinal epithelial cells from the ileum and colon

The spread and infection of the virus are complex problems requiring co-operation from multiple perspectives including medicine, biology and fluid mechanics to give a complete answer.
