<p id="para0019">Ribavirin is a broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside analogue that has been used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus and respiratory syncytial virus. The antiviral mechanism involves interacting with virus RdRp to inhibit RNA synthesis 
 <xref rid="bib0067" ref-type="bibr">[67]</xref>. It has been shown in in vitro experiments that ribavirin inhibits the replication of MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43, but the dosage that produces a significant effect is not within the range of typical human therapies 
 <xref rid="bib0068" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. Simultaneous use of interferon can reduce the dose of ribavirin 
 <xref rid="bib0069" ref-type="bibr">[69]</xref>. In a primate model, clinical symptoms of MERS could be improved by the combination of ribavirin and type I interferon 
 <xref rid="bib0070" ref-type="bibr">[70]</xref>. However, side effects of ribavirin, such as anaemia, limit its widespread use 
 <xref rid="bib0071" ref-type="bibr">[71]</xref>. In addition, two meta-analyses of SARS and MERS case studies demonstrated limited efficacy in treating patients with coronavirus respiratory syndrome 
 <xref rid="bib0072" ref-type="bibr">[72</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0073" ref-type="bibr">73]</xref>. Therefore, further studies are needed to determine whether ribavirin can effectively treat novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), and ribavirin and interferon are still in clinical trials (Chinese Clinical Trials Registry ID R2000029387).
