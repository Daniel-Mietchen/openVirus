<p id="para0023">Due to the similar RBD structures of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, screening anti-SARS-CoV antibodies will facilitate the rapid development of monoclonal antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Tian et al. reported that CR3022, a SARS-CoV-specific human monoclonal antibody, could effectively bind to the SARS-CoV-2 RBD 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. CR3022 has the potential to be used alone or in combination with other neutralising antibodies for the prevention and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, the dose needs to be determined before applying monoclonal antibodies 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">[85]</xref>. Using convalescent plasma to treat critically ill patients has been included in the latest Chinese treatment protocol (Pilot Version 6). One meta-analysis showed that glucocorticoids reduce the risk of ARDS 
 <xref rid="bib0086" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. However, different studies suggest that glucocorticoids slow viral clearance 
 <xref rid="bib0087" ref-type="bibr">[87]</xref>. Clinical data are still needed to demonstrate the value of glucocorticoids for SARS-CoV-2
