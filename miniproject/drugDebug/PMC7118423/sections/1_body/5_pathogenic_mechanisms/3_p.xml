<p id="para0014">However, when SARS-CoV attempts to invade host cells, it is not as simple as ACE2 interacting with the S protein, as other pathways and cytokines are involved. Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2) is an important cytokine in the spike–ACE2 signalling pathway. CCL2 is a small CC chemokine that attracts memory T lymphocytes, monocytes and basophils. The receptor of CCL2 is CCR2, both of which are involved in the inflammatory reaction 
 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, therefore they are associated with some lung inflammatory disorders. Referring to previous reports, patients infected with SARS-CoV had pulmonary fibrosis due to CCL2. Cheung et al. observed the expression of CCL2 in SARS-CoV patients and found that expression of CCL2 was upregulated in the sera of patients 
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. To determine the relationship between the spike–ACE2 signalling pathway and CCL2, Chen et al. suggested an interaction between the S protein of SARS-CoV with ACE2 on human cells

 <xref rid="fig0002" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ). Infected lung epithelial cells induce casein kinase II (CK II), which is able to phosphorylate ACE2 and involves ERK1/2 activation. CK II phosphorylates ACE2 at Ser-787, by which SARS-CoV binds to its ACE2 receptor and causes a conformational change of ACE2. It also activates the ACE2 downstream signal transduction pathways, including ERK1/2 and AP-1 
 <xref rid="bib0042" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. These changes lead to the activation of ERK1/2 and AP-1 and upregulate CCL2. ACE2 also participates in an intracellular signalling pathway. It activates ERK1/2 by interacting with upstream factors such as Ras and protein kinase C. Finally, the elevated levels of CCL2 protein in the sera of SARS-CoV-infected patients account for the development of lung fibrosis.
