<p id="para0013">Ren et al. sequenced SARS-CoV-2 and phylogenetic analysis revealed that it belonged to the Betacoronaviruses with 79.0% nucleotide identity to SARS-CoV and 51.8% identity to MERS-CoV, meaning that it was closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Importantly, homology modelling revealed that the RBD structure of SARS-CoV-2 was similar to that of SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. From previous reports, the interaction with ACE2 was responsible for SARS-CoV entering human cells 
 <xref rid="bib0031" ref-type="bibr">[31</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0032" ref-type="bibr">32]</xref>. Dong et al. compared the structural similarity of the S protein in various viruses and speculated that SARS-CoV-2 could most likely use the same receptor as SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Zhou et al. conducted virus infectivity studies using HeLa cells with or without ACE2 proteins obtained from humans or animals and found that SARS-CoV-2 could invade all ACE2 protein-expressing cells except for mouse cells 
 <xref rid="bib0034" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. In short, SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as an entry receptor into ACE2-expressing cells, but not cells without ACE2, and SARS-CoV-2 is likely to bind to ACE2 receptor in humans just like SARS-CoV. Dimitrov reported that SARS-CoV infected human host cells by a basic interaction of its S glycoprotein and the receptor ACE2 on human cells 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Although the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 is a little different from SARS-CoV, its functionally important ORFs and major structural proteins, especially the spike (S) protein, are well described, of which the original identity is 76% 
 <xref rid="bib0036" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The S protein has two regions (S2 and S1), with stronger affinity with the RBD in the S1 region interacting with ACE2 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Similar to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may also engage the RBD to bind ACE2 in order to enter human host cells, but since many residues in S1 and S2 have been replaced in SARS-CoV-2, differences in the interactions with ACE2 on host cells exist 
 <xref rid="bib0033" ref-type="bibr">[33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0037" ref-type="bibr">37]</xref>. Wrapp et al. determined the cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and the structure is presented in 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
 <xref rid="bib0038" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. These structures have been used to calculate the reconstruction of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2. 
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows side and top views of the prefusion structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein with a single receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the ‘up’ conformation. The two RBD ‘down’ protomers are shown in either purple or red, and the RBD ‘up’ protomer is shown in green. The result suggests that ACE2 binds to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein ectodomain with 15 nM affinity, which is approximately 10–20-fold higher than that of SARS-CoV, and this result is very surprising.
