<p id="para0026">A folk method expressed that adding sesame oil into the nostrils can prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. To find theoretical reasons to support this method for preventing viral infection with SARS-CoV-2, Fan et al. discussed from the perspective of colloid and interface science that sesame oil had a low surface tension and was incompatible with water

 <xref rid="bib0094" ref-type="bibr">94]</xref>. They investigated the epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 and found because of the low intermolecular attraction between adjacent two sesame oil molecules, pure sesame oil had a good wettability which could readily wet the surface of various solid and aqueous phases. In view of this feature, sesame oil might prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, the mechanism of this method remains uncertain and it is not approved and verified by experimental and clinical studies. In future, scientists need to pay more scientific attention to these potentially useful clues from folk medicine methods.
