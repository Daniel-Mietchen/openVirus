Most patients display an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level, with normal procalcitonin level. Severe cases show progressively decreased blood lymphocyte counts and high D-dimer levels. Inflammatory factors are often increased in severe and critical patients.
