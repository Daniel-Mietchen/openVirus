<p id="para0011">Samples from suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients collected from the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal), lower respiratory tract (expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage), blood and faeces can be diagnosed by RT-PCR 
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Two sequence regions (ORF1b and N) designed based on the first public access sequence in GenBank have been selected for primer and probe designs, which are highly conserved amongst Sarbecoviruses. The N gene assay is ~10 times more sensitive than the ORF1b gene assay in detecting positive clinical specimens 
 <xref rid="bib0026" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Existing PCR methods have very good specificity but low sensitivity, meaning that negative test results cannot exclude the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, laboratory sample contamination caused by lack of control can lead to false-positive results. In addition, RT-PCR tests may be falsely negative due to insufficient viral material or operational error. Some patients with negative RT-PCR results may present with positive chest CT findings for COVID-19, meaning that PCR results can assist clinical diagnosis and evaluation but the possibility of the disease cannot be confirmed or ruled out. For individuals with a high clinical suspicion but negative RT-PCR screening, a combination of CT scanning and repeated swab tests may be helpful
