<p id="para0012">The CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) technique allows portable, multiplexed and ultrasensitive detection of RNA or DNA from clinically relevant samples. SHERLOCK assays are set up with recombinase-mediated polymerase pre-amplification of DNA or RNA and subsequent Cas13- or Cas12-mediated detection via colorimetric read-outs and fluorescence that provide results in &lt;1 h with a setup time of &lt;15 min 
 <xref rid="bib0028" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Based on the RNA sequence of the novel coronavirus, researchers carefully designed two guide RNAs, one recognising the S gene of the new coronavirus and the other recognising the Orf1ab gene. To maximise the accuracy of the detection, scientists have selected sequences that are most specific for the new coronavirus. In this way, interference from other respiratory virus genomes can also be minimised. Theoretically, as long as the RNA corresponds to the new coronavirus in the sample, the guide RNA can accurately recognise it and activate the Cas13a protein to bind to it. Cas13a is a very interesting enzyme; once activated, it will indiscriminately and intensely cut any other RNA molecules it encounters. In this way, by confirming whether these molecules have been cut off, it can detect the presence of the new coronavirus in the original sample. They consistently detected SARS-CoV-2 target sequences in a range between 20 and 200 aM (10â€“100 copies per microlitre of input) by using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA fragments. The test can be read using a dipstick in &lt;1 h without requiring elaborate instrumentation, but still needs to be confirmed with patient samples.
