<p id="para0002">Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like (or corona in Latin) spikes of the virus protruding to the periphery, with a diameter of 60–160 nm observed by electron microscopy. Each viral particle is enveloped and contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of 27–32 kb with a 5ʹ-cap structure and 3ʹ-poly A tail that interacts with the nucleoprotein. All coronaviruses have similarities in the organisation and expression of the genome, and the genome size of coronaviruses is the largest among all RNA viruses. Sixteen non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16), encoded by open reading frame (ORF) 1a/b at the 5ʹ-end, are followed by the nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) structural proteins, which are encoded by other ORFs at the 3ʹ-end 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The envelope includes three proteins: the M protein binds the nucleocapsid and enhances viral assembly and budding; the E protein is involved in viral morphogenesis, release and pathogenesis; and the S protein contributes to homotrimeric spikes that recognise the cell receptor, thus helping the virus invade target cells 
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Since the outbreaks of SARS in 2002 and MERS in 2012, the possibility of coronavirus transmission from animals to humans had been proven. Coronaviruses are ubiquitous pathogens in nature for humans and animals, usually causing gastrointestinal or respiratory infections and sometimes involving important organs such as the liver, kidney, heart and brain. They are sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat. Lipid solvents such as ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peracetic acid and chloroform can effectively inactivate the virus.
