   <bold>Author contributions</bold> T.C., M.L. and T.F.M. conceived the project. RNAi screen was performed as follows: assay development by P.B. and A.K.; screening and data acquisition by A.K. and P.B.; validation and data analysis: A.K. and M.M. CHIKV 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> infection and replication assays were performed by A.K., S.B., N.G. and T.C. 
   <italic>In vitro</italic> infection and replication assays for all other viruses were performed by M.R., A.K. and G.S. Drug repurposing was performed by A.K. and M.M. (
   <italic>in vitro</italic> testing and statistical association). Detailed characterization of hits was performed by S.B., T.C., A.K., F.W., M.V., P.B., N.G. and L.K.-A. 
   <italic>In vivo</italic> experiments were performed by T.C. and S.B. A.W. and F.B. developed CLK1 inhibitors and U.K. generated CLK1 knockout mice. The work was supervised by T.F.M. and M.L. F.B. supervised Clk1 inhibitor development. A.K., S.B., T.F.M. and M.L. analysed the data and wrote the manuscript.
