<p>On the basis of the demonstration of the antiviral activity of all lipid biosynthesis inhibitors targeting the proviral factors identified by the host genome-wide loss-of-function screen, we next considered all the other hits as putative drug targets. Therefore, to exploit the translational potential of our screen, we systematically assessed the antiviral activity of chemical compounds targeting the identified proviral factors involved in CHIKV replication. We interrogated specialized databases (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), linking several drugs to their experimentally proven target proteins/genes, and identified 52 compounds interacting with the gene products of 14 distinct CHIKV proviral genes. In addition, we generated three compounds against the CDC-like kinase 1 (CLK1), a proviral factor for CHIKV, IAV and WNV (

These antiviral compounds inhibit the following targets and pathways: (i) the vacuolar-type H+ ATPase (vATPase); (ii) CLK1; (iii) the fms-related tyrosine kinase 4 (FLT4 or VEGFR3); (iv) calmodulin signalling; (v) fatty acid synthesis; (vi) the K (lysine) acetyltransferase 5 (KAT5 or TIP60; see
