<p>Cytosolic fatty acid synthesis involves the following three enzymes: (i) ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), needed for the formation of acetyl CoA, (ii) acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC), which transforms acetyl CoA into malonyl CoA, and (iii) fatty acid synthase (FASN), which converts acetyl and malonyl CoA into palmitate (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. To analyse the functional implication of lipid metabolism in CHIKV replication, we used a CHIKV replicon, allowing measurement of genomic and subgenomic viral RNA (vRNA) expression simultaneously (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3a</xref>). Consistent with the screening results, the expression of both the vRNA forms was impaired in HeLa cells depleted in either FASN or ACLY, but not in cells depleted in ACC (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis further showed that Rc co-localized with FASN (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3d,e</xref>; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 3b</xref>). We next independently confirmed these results pharmacologically. Infected HeLa cells were exposed to cerulenin (FASN inhibitor), 5-tetradecyloxy-2-furoic acid (TOFA, ACC inhibitor), BMS-303141 (ACLY inhibitor) or vehicle only (dimethylsulphoxide, DMSO). All three inhibitors induced a significant and dose-dependent reduction in genomic and subgenomic vRNA synthesis (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>), with no deleterious effect on cell viability (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3g</xref>). Together, these results show that fatty acid synthesis is necessary for CHIKV vRNA replication.
