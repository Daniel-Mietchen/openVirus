<p>To definitely validate these 16 factors, we used an independent method, the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, to generate cells deficient for each of these genes. We observed a significant reduction of CHIKV replication with guide RNAs (gRNA)-transduced Cas9-expressing cells for 14 out of 16 genes, establishing that they are proviral factors (

Among the proviral factors, the three largest protein–protein interaction networks are involved in transcription, translation and signalling, respectively (
