<p>A host genome-wide loss-of-function screen was performed by reversely transfecting a genome-wide library of ∼60,000 short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting ∼17,000 annotated and ∼6,000 predicted genes into CHIKV-permissive human cells (HEK-293) for 3 days. Transfected cells were infected with a recombinant CHIKV-expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (CHIKV-GFP) in infected cells. At 18 h post infection (p.i.), cells were fixed and analysed by automatic fluorescence microscopy to quantify the ratio of infected to uninfected cells (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1a</xref>) and 3,274 toxic siRNAs (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1b,c</xref>) were excluded following transcriptional microarray and viability analyses, respectively. RNAi data were then analysed statistically using cellHTS2 (ref. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>), and normalized using as positive control, an siRNA targeting the viral E1 gene, and as negative control AllStars siRNA (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1d</xref>), and the medians of resulting values of at least three independent replicates were used for redundant siRNA activity (RSA) analysis

 <italic>P</italic> values of ≤−2 as cutoff, we identified 279 proviral and 269 antiviral factors (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1e,f</xref>). To minimize off-target false positives, we further validated these hits with three additional siRNAs per gene. On the basis of the calculated cSSMD (collective strictly standardized mean difference) values, which reflect effect strength and significance
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1g,h</xref>), we validated 156 proviral and 41 antiviral host factors (
