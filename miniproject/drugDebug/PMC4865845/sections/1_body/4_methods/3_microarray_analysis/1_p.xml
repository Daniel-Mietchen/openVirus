<p>To allow exclusion of non-expressed genes from the hit identification process, microarray analyses of (i) AllStars-transfected and CHIKV-infected, (ii) AllStars-transfected and non-infected, (iii) non-transfected and CHIKV-infected, and (iv) non-transfected and non-infected HEK-293 cells were performed. Transfection was carried out by adding 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> HEK-293 cells (in complete DMEM medium) to a mixture of serum-free RPMI medium, HiPerFect (Qiagen) and AllStars siRNAs (final siRNA concentration: 20 nM). Infection with CHIKV-GFP was performed 72 h post transfection at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 3. Cells were lysed 18 h p.i. using Trizol (Invitrogen), followed by isolation of RNA, which was subsequently subjected to microarray analysis. Correlation analysis revealed no significant influence of AllStars transfections (compared with non-transfected cells) on the global expression of cellular genes (correlation coefficient=0.992). Therefore, only the data set derived from transfected (CHIKV-infected and non-infected) HEK-293 cells was used for the removal of non-expressed genes (cutoff criterion: expression intensity&gt;100), as described in data analysis below. Microarray experiments were performed as dual-colour hybridizations on Agilent 4 × 44 K human whole-genome catalogue arrays (Agilent-014850). To compensate for dye-specific effects, a dye-reversal colour swap was applied.
