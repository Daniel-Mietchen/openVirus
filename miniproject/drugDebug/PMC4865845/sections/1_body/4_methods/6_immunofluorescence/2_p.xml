<p>Immunostaining with the mouse anti-human-FLT4 (clone 9D9F9, Biolegend, 356201, 1:100) and rabbit anti-human-phospho-FLT4 (rabbit polyclonal from Cell applications, CY1115, 1:400; 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5b</xref>) was performed on 4% PFA-fixed cells, activated with −20 °C cold methanol (Sigma) for 20 min, and then permeabilized and stained in 0.05% saponin (Sigma) and 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) in PBS. Anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 were used as secondary antibodies. HeLa cells were transfected for 20 h (using the JetPRIME transfection reagent, Polyplus) with the pcDNA3.1-VEGFR-3 (overexpressing the wild-type form of FLT4) or with the pcDNA3.1-VEGFR-3-G857R (overexpressing a non-phosphorylatable mutant form of FLT4). The two plasmids were kindly provided by K. Alitalo, Helsinki).
