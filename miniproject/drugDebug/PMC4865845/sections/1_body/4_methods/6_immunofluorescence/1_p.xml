<p>For indirect immunostaining, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma). Antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 5% FCS. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-ACC (clone EP687Y, from Abcam, ab45174, 1:100), anti-ACLY (rabbit polyclonal from Abcam, ab137579, 1:100), anti-FASN (rabbit polyclonal from Novus, NB400-114, 1:100), mouse anti-dsRNA (clone J2, English and Scientific Consulting Kft, 1:200); incubation with primary antibodies was followed by treatment with secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 568 (Life Technologies). Cells were observed using a Carl Zeiss LSM710 confocal microscope.</p>
