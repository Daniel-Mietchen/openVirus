<p>The following viruses were used: CHIKV-GFP
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> (a kind gift of S. Higgs, Kansas, USA), CHIKV C21 and SINV AR339 (both kind gifts of P. Desprès, Paris, France). Viral production and titration were performed as previously detailed
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Briefly, viruses were expanded on C6-36 cells and virus stocks were stored at −80 °C before titration by plaque assay on Vero cells. CHIKV-GFP was concentrated using Vivaspin concentrators (molecular weight cut off (MWCO) 100,000 kDa, Sartorius). Viral titration of cell supernatants (
