<p>The numbers of CHIKV-infected and non-infected cells were determined using an automated microscope (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions). Images were taken with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and GFP filter sets (AHF-Analysetechnik). Scan
 <sup>R</sup> Analysis Software (Olympus Soft Imaging Solutions) was used to automatically identify and quantify GFP-positive cells (indicating infected cells) and cell nuclei. The number of automatically counted nuclei was further used to estimate the cytotoxic effects of specific siRNAs. The siRNA was classified as toxic if 1,000 or fewer nuclei were determined within one well of a 384-well plate. All multi-well pipetting steps were performed using a Biomek FX
 <sup>P</sup> Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter). An siRNA library (Qiagen Hu_Genome 1.0 and Human Druggable Genome siRNA Set V2.0; Qiagen) containing four siRNAs per gene for the druggable genome
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref> and two siRNAs per gene for non-druggable and predicted genes was screened at least three times independently. The following siRNAs with the indicated target sequence were included in all screening plates as controls: siE1 5′-AACCGAUGAUAAGGCACGAAA-3′, siPLK1 5′-CACCAUAUGAAUUGUACAGAA-3′ and AllStars (Qiagen). For validation experiments, three siRNAs (Silencer Select) per gene were purchased from Ambion. The same transfection and screening conditions were used as in the primary screen.
