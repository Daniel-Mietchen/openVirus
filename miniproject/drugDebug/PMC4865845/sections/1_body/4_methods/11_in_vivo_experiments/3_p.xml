<p>Drugs were handled as follows: for experiments shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6</xref>, tivozanib (Selleck) was first dissolved in DMSO (40 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) and then diluted in 0.5% methylcellulose to a final concentration of 0.25 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>; pimozide (Sigma) was dissolved (25 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>) in 
 <italic>N</italic>-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and then diluted in PEG300 (5 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>); TOFA (Sigma) was dissolved in DMSO to a final concentration of 5 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>. For experiments shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7d,e</xref>, TOFA and pimozide were dissolved in DMSO (independently or in combination) to a final concentration of 3.64 and 4.55 mg ml
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, and dosed at 5.5 μl g
 <sup>−1</sup>. Littermate controls treated with appropriate vehicles were used for all experiments. CHIKV titrations from mouse explants were performed using the standard TCID50 dilution assay on Vero cells. Animal tissues were homogenized in DMEM (high glucose, GlutaMAX, pyruvate) at the final concentration of 0.1 g ml
 <sup>−1</sup> using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Technologies). In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7e</xref>, joint swelling was measured 4 days p.i. using a Schnelltaster caliper.
