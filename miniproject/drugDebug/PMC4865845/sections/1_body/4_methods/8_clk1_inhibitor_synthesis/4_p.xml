 <italic>AnnH80</italic> (1-bromo-7,8-dichloro-9-(prop-2-yn-1-yl)-9
 <italic>H</italic>-pyrido[3,4-b]indole) was prepared in three steps from 7,8-dichloro-3,4-dihydro-1-oxo-9

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Methods</xref> for experimental details and analytical data). Briefly, dehydrogenation of 7,8-dichloro-3,4-dihydro-1-oxo-9H-pyrido-[3,4-b]indole (A) was performed with 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyano-1,4-benzoquinone (DDQ) in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to give the 1-oxo-β-carboline (B; step 1). Subsequent bromination with phosphoryl bromide in anisole (step 2) gave the 1-bromo-β-carboline (C). This compound was converted to the target compound AnnH80 by deprotonation with sodium hydride, followed by N-alkylation with propargyl bromide (step 3).
