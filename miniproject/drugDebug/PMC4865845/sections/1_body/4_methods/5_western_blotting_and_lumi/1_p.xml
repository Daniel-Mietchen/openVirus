<p>For experiments in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b,c</xref>, a combination of two siRNAs (Ambion) was used to silence FASN (s5030 and s5031), ACC (s882 and s883) or ACLY (s915 and s916). HeLa cells (at 40% confluency in 24-well plates) were transfected using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Life Technologies), with 5 pmol of each siRNA (10 pmol in total) or 10 pmol of silencer negative control no. 2 siRNA (AM4613; Ambion). Knockdown effect was analysed 72 h post transfection by western blotting. Proteins were separated by 6% SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (GE Lifesciences) and detected using primary antibodies against ACC (clone EP687Y, from Abcam, ab45174, 1:1,000), ACLY (rabbit polyclonal from Abcam, ab137579, 1:1,000), FASN (rabbit polyclonal from Novus, NB400-114, 1:1,000) or β-actin (clone C4, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc-47778, 1:2,000). Appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (LabAs Ltd) were used for visualization. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (GE Healthcare) was used to develop the blots (uncropped immunoblots presented in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). To perform the luciferase activity assay, siRNA-transfected HeLa cells were infected with Rluc- and Fluc-expressing CHIKV VRPs (MOI=0.01) at 72 h post transfection for 1 h. At 8 h p.i., cells were lysed using passive lysis buffer (Promega), and the relative activities of Rluc and Fluc were measured using a dual-luciferase detection kit (Promega). For experiments in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3f</xref>, specific FASN, ACC or ACLY chemical inhibitors were added from 1 h p.i. until the end of the experiment. The effects of drugs targeting the fatty acid biosynthesis pathway in HeLa cells were monitored in real time using the xCELLigence System (Roche) and corresponding electrode plates (E-plate). The system measures electrode impedance, which is given as cell index value. For the assay, HeLa cells were seeded in the wells of a E-plate and 18 h later growth medium pre-mixed with drugs was added to the wells to monitor the cell index change.
