<p>Simultaneous detection of FLT4 (clone 9D9F9, Biolegend, 356201, 1:50) and P-FLT4 (rabbit polyclonal from Cell applications, CY1115, 1:400) was performed on CHIKV-GFP-infected cells (MOI: 10 for 18 h), fixed in 4% PFA, activated with −20 °C cold methanol for 20 min and stained in permeabilization buffer. Cells were acquired using an LSR-fortessa flow cytometer (BD). Anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 555 and anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 647 (both from Life Technologies) were used as secondary antibodies. We used cells stained with a mouse isotype control antibody (clone MOPC-21, Biolegend, 400101, 1:50) or with the anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody only as labelling controls.</p>
