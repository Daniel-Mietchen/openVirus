Silencing efficiency was determined by quantitative PCR using the TaqMan RNA-to-Ct 1-Step Kit and the following TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Life Technologies): Hs00197310_m1, Hs00367471_m1 and Hs00219525_m1. RNAs were extracted following the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) protocol with DNAse treatment.
