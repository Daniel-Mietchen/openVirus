<p>Intracellular capsid (C) staining for flow cytometry was performed using a permeabilization buffer (PBS, 0.05% saponin and 0.2% BSA). We used a mouse monoclonal antibody (clone H3-18, 1:1,000) generated in-house and directly coupled with ATTO532 to reveal CHIKV capsid and a rabbit polyclonal serum recognizing the capsid protein (Ventoso I, Madrid, 1:1,000) to detect SINV. Flow cytometry acquisition was performed using a MACSQuant VYB system; FlowJo was used for the analysis. The percentage of infected cells was used as infection readout. Data were then normalized by setting the DMSO condition as an arbitrary value of 100.</p>
