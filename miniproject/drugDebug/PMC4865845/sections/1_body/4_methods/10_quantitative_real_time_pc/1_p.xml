<p>For vRNA quantification, vRNA was extracted from infection supernatants using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), whereas total RNA from cells was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). One-step quantitative real-time PCR reactions were conducted on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast system or a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using the qPCR SyGreen 1-Step Lo-ROX or Hi-ROX mix (PCRBIOSYSTEMS) and the following primers: E1-C21_F (5′-ACGCAGTTGAGCGAAGCAC-3′), E1-C21_R (5′-CTGAAGACATTGGCCCCAC-3′), GAPDH_F (5′-GGTATCGTGGAAGGAAGGACTCATGAC-3′) and GAPDH_R (5′-ATGCCAGTGAGCTTCCGTTCAG-3′). vRNA present in infected cells was normalized on the GAPDH expression using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method, whereas a standard curve derived from a viral stock of known titre was used to quantify vRNA in the supernatants. Cell viability in HeLa cells treated with the indicated drugs was measured using the CellTiter-Glo kit (Promega) and the Fluoroskan Ascent FL luminometer (Thermo Scientific).
