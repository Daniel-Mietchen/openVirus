<p>The ingenuity analysis on the proviral factors, which is depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1g</xref>, was performed using the ingenuity knowledge-base reference set (genes only), including direct and indirect relationships, and endogenous chemicals, and filtered for the ‘experimentally observed' confidence criterion. Enriched molecular functions were selected on the basis of their statistical significance (
 <italic>P</italic>≤0.01 was used as threshold). Statistically enriched gene ontology terms associated to less than two genes were removed. Co-localization analysis shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3e</xref> was performed on three-dimensional cell stacks using the intensity correlation analysis plugin for the WCIF Image J program. Statistical analyses in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 5</xref> were performed using GraphPad prism. Networks in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1c</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Fig. 1k</xref> were drawn using the Cytoscape software. The STATA software (StataCorp) was used to calculate the Δ values for interaction effect on the geometric means of data shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7</xref> following the two-factor design method
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. No statistical method was used for the sample size determination and experiments were performed without randomization or blinding strategy.
