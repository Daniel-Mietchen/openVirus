<p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne alphavirus that causes chikungunya fever, an acute infection characterized by arthralgia and frequently complicated by chronic joint symptoms
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Originating from Africa, CHIKV has spread to Asia, emerged in Southern Europe and reached the Americas
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Despite its severe health and economic impact, little is known about the cell biology of CHIKV infection and, as for all emerging infections, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic strategies are available on the market
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. In the absence of available therapeutics and vaccines, there is an urgent need for antimicrobial agents to combat emerging infections
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. As illustrated by the latest generation of drugs available to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected or hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients, deciphering that the biology of infections has proven successful for the development of highly effective drugs targeting different viral proteins
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>. However, this virus-directed strategy for drug discovery is time-consuming and not rapidly applicable to emerged pathogens
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. In the context of emerging infections, targeting host factors critical to infection is a promising approach
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. Indeed, this host-directed antiviral design can be coupled with a drug repositioning strategy
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> that could lead to the rapid identification of antiviral agents.
