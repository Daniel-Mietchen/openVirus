 <caption> In vitro validation of selected chemical inhibitors and proviral factors. ( a– g) Infection rate and cell viability for compounds specific to vATPase (bafilomycin, n=12, 6, 12 and 6 for all conditions at increasing concentrations), calmodulin (pimozide, n=12, 12, 12 and 9 for all conditions at increasing concentrations and W7, n=9 for all data sets), fatty acid synthesis (cerulenin, n=9, 6, 6 and 9 for all conditions at increasing concentrations), FLT4 (tivozanib, n=12, 6, 9 and 12 for all conditions at increasing concentrations) and KAT5 (anacardic acid, n=9 for all data sets) administrated to CHIKV-infected HEK-293T cells as indicated. Cells were treated 2 h before (solid lines) or 2 h after (dashed lines) infection with CHIKV C21 (MOI 40) and left until 8 h p.i. to avoid multiple cycles of infection. Viral infectivity and cell viability were then measured by flow cytometry after intracellular staining of CHIKV capsid (CHIKV-C, see a for an example). Equal amounts of supernatants from the 2 h post treatment conditions were measured for viral infectivity on Vero cells (dotted lines) to detect eventual defects in viral release. ( h, i) Quantitative PCR with reverse transcription quantification of cell- ( n=20, 9, 9, 12, 12 and 9 in displayed order) ( h) and supernatant-associated ( n=18, 6, 6, 12, 12 and 9 in displayed order) ( i) vRNA performed on RNA extracts of HeLa cells infected with CHIKV C21 (MOI: 50) for 1 h and treated with cerulenin (50 μM), TOFA (25 μM), pimozide (pimo, 10 μM), W7 (20 μM), tivozanib (tivo, 5 μM) or vehicle alone for an additional 7 h. ( j) Cell viability measured at the end of the experiment shown in h, using the CellTiter-Glo kit ( n=9 for all data sets). ( k, l) Cell- and supernatant-associated vRNA measured on CHIKV-infected HeLa cells treated with the indicated drugs from 6 to 8 h p.i. ( n=18, 9, 8, 9, 9 and 9 for m and n=18, 9, 9, 9, 9 and 9 for n in displayed order). Data represent mean+s.e.m. of at least three independent experiments, analysed by one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test (*** P&lt;0.001; NS P≥0.05). </caption>
