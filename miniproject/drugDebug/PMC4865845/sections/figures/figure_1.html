 <caption> Primary screen for CHIKV host cell factors. ( a) Outline of screening procedure. ( b) Heatmap of all identified proviral and antiviral hits showing replication data ( Z-scores) of the four most efficient siRNAs. Arrowheads indicate genes experimentally characterized in this study. ( c) Requirement of identified proviral factors for other viruses based on published loss-of-function studies. Viruses other than CHIKV are indicated by specific colours, and colour-coded boxes contain genes shared between CHIKV and the corresponding virus. White boxes contain genes shared between CHIKV and more than one other virus. Full details in Supplementary Data 3. ( d) Heatmap illustrating the replication capability of CHIKV in Cas9-positive HEK-293T cells expressing the indicated gRNAs. Cells were infected with CHIK-GFP at MOI 6 for 24 h ( n=9). ( e) Validation of CLK1 as CHIKV relevant host factor. Infection rate of A549 cells depleted for CLK1 by CRISPR/Cas9 (see Supplementary Fig. 1j for more details) and infected with CHIKV-GFP for the indicated periods of time ( n=9 for each data set). Data represent the means±s.e.m. of three independent experiments and were analysed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test. (* P&lt;0.05; NS P≥0.05). CTRL, control; NS, not significant. </caption>
