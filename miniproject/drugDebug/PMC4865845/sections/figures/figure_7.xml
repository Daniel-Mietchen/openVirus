  <p>(
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>c</bold>) Infection rate (
   <italic>n</italic>=9 for all data sets at increasing concentrations; 
   <italic>n</italic>=51 for DMSO) (
   <bold>a</bold>), supernatant titration (
   <italic>n</italic>=8 for all data sets at increasing concentrations; 
   <italic>n</italic>=57 for DMSO) (
   <bold>b</bold>) and cell viability (
   <bold>c</bold>) of HEK-293T cells infected with CHIKV-GFP (MOI: 0.5) for 1 h, and then exposed to the indicated concentrations of antiviral drugs for 23 h. Solid and dashed black lines indicate the mean±s.e.m. of the DMSO control (pimo=pimozide). Data in 
   <bold>a</bold> and 
   <bold>c</bold> were measured by flow cytometry. (
   <bold>d</bold>) Experimental design of the footpad CHIKV infection model of adult mice used to measure the therapeutic effect on CHIKV replication of pimozide, TOFA or their combination (
   <italic>n</italic>=13 for all data set, one outlier for pimo is not shown in the graph but was considered for statistics). (
   <bold>e</bold>) Footpad swelling measured 4 days post infection in mice treated as in 
   <bold>d</bold> (
   <italic>n</italic>=11, 10, 12 and 12 in displayed order). The experiment shown in 
   <bold>e</bold> was repeated twice. All the other data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Data in 
   <bold>a</bold>,
   <bold>b</bold> and 
   <bold>c</bold> are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. and in 
   <bold>d</bold> and 
   <bold>e</bold> are shown as the median±interquartile range; each dot represents one mouse. Statistics were calculated using the Kruskal–Wallis test with the Dunn's post test (*
   <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05; 
   <sup>NS</sup>
   <italic>P</italic>≥0.05) NS, not significant.
