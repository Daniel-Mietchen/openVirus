 <caption> Impact of pimozide and TOFA combination on CHIKV replication in vitro and in vivo. ( a– c) Infection rate ( n=9 for all data sets at increasing concentrations; n=51 for DMSO) ( a), supernatant titration ( n=8 for all data sets at increasing concentrations; n=57 for DMSO) ( b) and cell viability ( c) of HEK-293T cells infected with CHIKV-GFP (MOI: 0.5) for 1 h, and then exposed to the indicated concentrations of antiviral drugs for 23 h. Solid and dashed black lines indicate the mean±s.e.m. of the DMSO control (pimo=pimozide). Data in a and c were measured by flow cytometry. ( d) Experimental design of the footpad CHIKV infection model of adult mice used to measure the therapeutic effect on CHIKV replication of pimozide, TOFA or their combination ( n=13 for all data set, one outlier for pimo is not shown in the graph but was considered for statistics). ( e) Footpad swelling measured 4 days post infection in mice treated as in d ( n=11, 10, 12 and 12 in displayed order). The experiment shown in e was repeated twice. All the other data were obtained from at least three independent experiments. Data in a, b and c are expressed as the mean±s.e.m. and in d and e are shown as the median±interquartile range; each dot represents one mouse. Statistics were calculated using the Kruskal–Wallis test with the Dunn's post test (* P&lt;0.05; NS P≥0.05) NS, not significant. </caption>
