 <caption> Fatty acid synthesis requirement for CHIKV life cycle. ( a) Impact of FASN or ACLY knockdown on CHIKV replication. Closed and open symbols indicate replicates from the primary screen and during validation, respectively. ( b) Western blot showing silencing efficiency of siRNAs used in c. ( c) Impact of FASN-, ACC- and ACLY-specific siRNAs on CHIKV replication ( n=10 for each data set). ( d) Confocal section of CHIKV replicon-infected HeLa cells labelled for FASN, dsRNA and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). Scale bar, 10 μm. ( e) Co-localization analysis of cells labelled as in d and in Supplementary Fig. 3b, plotted as Pearson's coefficient per cell. Each symbol corresponds to a cell stack from three independent experiments ( n=29 cells for FASN, 30 cells for ACC and 31 cells for ACLY); median values shown in red. ( f) Effect of FASN (cerulenin, n=12 for each data set), ACC (TOFA, n=11 for each data set) and ACLY (BMS-303141 n=11 for each data set) inhibitors on CHIKV replication. ( g) Real-time cell toxicity assay performed on HeLa cells ( n=3 for each point). Excepted for b and d where representative images are shown and for g where the mean±s.d. is shown for each point of a representative experiment, all data represent the means±s.e.m. of three independent experiments analysed using one-way analysis of variance with Tukey's post test (* P&lt;0.05; ** P&lt;0.01; *** P&lt;0.001; NS P≥0.05). NS, not significant. </caption>
