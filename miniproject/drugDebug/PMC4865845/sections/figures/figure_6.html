 <caption> In vivo validation of selected chemical inhibitors and proviral factors. ( a, b) Health status and body weight evolution in 9-day-old C57BL/6 clk1−/− or C57BL/6 clk1+/+ mice infected intradermally with CHIKV C21 (10 4 PFU) and killed at the appearance of paralysis. ( c) Experimental design of the intradermal infection of the young mouse model used for tivozanib. ( d– f) Effect of daily tivozanib (tivo) treatment on C57BL/6 mouse survival, paralysis and body weight change in response to CHIKV C21 infection. ( g) Health status of each mouse with paralysis, estimated by measuring the area under the body weight curve. ( h) CHIKV viral load measured 3 days post infection in the indicated organs obtained from mice treated with tivozanib as in c ( n=9 for all data sets). ( i, j) Experimental design of the footpad infection of adult mice model used and viral titres measured in C57BL/6 mice treated with pimozide (pimo, per os, n=15 for both data sets) or TOFA (i.p., n=11 for both data sets) or the corresponding vehicles before infection with CHIKV C21 (10 3 PFU). Data in b, f and g represented as the mean±s.e.m.; in h, i and j as the median±interquartile range; each dot represents one mouse. All data obtained from at least two independent experiments. Statistics were calculated using Log-rank (Mantel–Cox) test in a, d and e, two-sided t-test for two independent samples in g and Mann–Whitney test in h, i and j, (* P&lt;0.05; NS P≥0.05). AUC, area under curve; d, days; i.p., intraperitoneal; NS, not significant. </caption>
