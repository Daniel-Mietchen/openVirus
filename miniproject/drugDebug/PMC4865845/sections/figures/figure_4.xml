  <title>Effect of the identified antiviral drugs on different classes of viruses.</title>
  <p>Dose–response curves (coloured solid lines) performed on HEK-293 cells or A549 cells (in case of IAV infection), pretreated for 2 h with the indicated drugs and then infected with distant classes of viruses. Black solid lines and coloured dashed lines indicate the corresponding dose–response curves determined for cell viability and CHIKV infection, respectively (
