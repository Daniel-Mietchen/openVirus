       <p>In humans, anti-TNF therapy utilising etanercept has been reported to be beneficial for treatment of the non-infectious idiopathic pneumonia syndrome which can follow stem-cell transplantation, a pulmonary syndrome that resembles SARS pneumonia in some respect.</p>

       <p>If the SARS coronavirus does indeed lead to massive release of TNF-αf rom alveolar macrophages, then early inhibition of TNF-α might be able to prevent TNF-αmediated immune activation and therefore reduce pulmonary injury in these patients.</p>

       <p>Compared with the use of corticosteroids, the use of biologic TNF inhibitors, including etanercept, has the potential to be a more specific and more effective method of ameliorating the severe alveolar damage which can occur following infection with these agents.</p>

     <break/>The study demonstrates that after intratracheal administration etanercept is able to successfully block TNF-α activity in vivo in the lungs of PRCV-LPS inoculated pigs during the first 4–8 HPI.
     <break/>TNF-α reduction, however, was not associated with decrease in disease severity, bronchoalveolar neutrophil infiltration, or altered virus replication and induction of IL-1, IL-6, IL-12/IL-23 or IFN-α in the lungs.
     <break/>There was no obvious difference in macroscopic lung lesions and histopathological findings in the lungs. This data confirms the generally accepted belief that TNF-α, though very important, is not the sole culprit in development of respiratory disease and pathology, and possibly other, yet unidentified, components and mechanisms of the immune system are involved.
