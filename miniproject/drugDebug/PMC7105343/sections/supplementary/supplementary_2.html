Hypertension is also treated with ACE inhibitors and ARBs, which results in an upregulation of ACE2 
    <br/>ACE2 can be increased by thiazolidinediones and ibuprofen. These data suggest that ACE2 expression is increased in diabetes and treatment with ACE inhibitors and ARBs increases ACE2 expression. Consequently, the increased expression of ACE2 would facilitate infection with COVID-19. 
    <br/>The authors therefore hypothesise that diabetes and hypertension treatment with ACE2-stimulating drugs increases the risk of developing severe and fatal COVID-19.

    <br/>Treatment with dexamethasone suppressed early local IL-6 levels but increased later on in disease. Suggests may decrease inflammation at early infection stage but not later. 
    <br/>Results also suggest that dexamethasone induced reduction of IL-6 might play a role in delayed onset of lung lesions but increases of IL-6 at later infection stage may contribute to severity of lung lesions (mimicking delayed onset of disease severity as seen in SARS patients treated with corticosteroids).

    <br/>Corticosteroids used during SARS outbreak for their ability to module variety of involved cytokines. 
    <br/>Numerous papers published outcomes of patients administered corticosteroids (mostly IV hydrocortisone or methylprednisolone) in either early low-dose or pulsed-dose strategies. Most concluded corticosteroids appeared to be effective in reducing immunopathological damage (resulting in improved and rapid resolution of symptoms). 
    <br/>Opposition to corticosteroid use centred around use of corticosteroid use in treatment of acute respiratory distress syndrome- concern that corticosteroid treatment may weaken immune response and promote viral rebound. Reports also add evidence to theory. 
    <br/>Further opposition includes association with adverse events such as hyperglycaemia, hypokalaemia, hypertension, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and avascular necrosis (AVN).
