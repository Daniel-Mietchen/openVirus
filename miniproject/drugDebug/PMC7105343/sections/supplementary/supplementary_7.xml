     <break/>MPA showed strong inhibition, with an IC50 of 2.87 mM. This drug may provide an alternative to ribavirin for treatment of MERS-CoV. In conclusion, IFN-b, MPA or a combination of the two may be beneficial in the treatment of MERS-CoV or as a post-exposure intervention in high-risk patients with known exposures to MERS-CoV.

     <break/>They found that a combination of mycophenolic acid and IFN-b1b lowered the EC50 of each drug by 1-3 times.
     <break/>Mycophenolic acid exhibits a number of attributes that support its practical use in MERS-CoV infection. It is commonly available in two forms, the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil and the salt mycophenolate sodium, and could be given orally.
     <break/>Interferon-b1b with mycophenolic acid should be considered in treatment trials of MERS.

     <break/>The authors sought to identify potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of corona viruses. They concluded that they had identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, 
     <bold>mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid</bold>, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. They all inhibited the replication of all CoVs with EC50 values of 5μm.
     <break/>Mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid, showed a similar antiviral effect on the four CoVs suggesting that the two drugs might harbour similar core structures and antiviral mechanisms.
     <break/>In vivo antiviral activity is unknown from this study.

     <break/>Mycophenolic acid also inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes. This makes it a popular immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplants and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.
     <break/>The use of mycophenolic acid monotherapy has not been reported in MERS. IFN-b and mycophenolic acid combination therapy was described in a retrospective observational study in Saudi Arabia involving 51 patients; all of the 8 patients who received IFN-b and mycophenolic acid survived.
     <break/>Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid are likely to cause more harm than benefit.
     <break/>There are no clinical data on the efficacy of mycophenolic acid in SARS or MERS. However, it led to severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads in an animal model.
