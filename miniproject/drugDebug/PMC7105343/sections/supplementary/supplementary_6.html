    <br/>Infection with coronavirus activates mast cells which in turn causes the generation of pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members. The authors state that they demonstrate for the first time that inflammation by coronavirus may be inhibited by anti-inflammatory cytokines belonging to the IL-1 family. However, as this is only an abstract there is no further information to support this statement.

    <br/>Following entry into the cell, the virus uncoats, nucleic acid is released and transcription occurs for production of viral proteins. During this course, the host immune system is activated (B and T-cells). 
    <br/>Specifically, CD4+ T helper cells recognise antigenic peptides produced by antigen presenting cells and produce cytokines that promote cell mediated and/or humoral immunity. 
    <br/>Similarly to avian flu, SARS infection induced similar pro-inflammatory cytokine pattern and might contribute to the severe nature of the virus. 
    <br/>Clinical evidence of SARS treatment by corticosteroids where levels of IL-1beta reduced after administration- thus inhibition of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 may be beneficial strategy for treatment of SARS.

    <br/>Acute lung injury associated with SARS can be attributed to complex and multifactorial pathophysiological process involving cytokines. Demonstrated that IL-1 play key role in pathogenesis of acute lung injury. WHO inferred that severe immune response kills SARS patients and that some cytokines may play important role in the process. 
    <br/>IL-1 cytokine promotes inflammation by inducing cell injury. 
    <br/>Study measured levels of IL-1 in 4 patient groups: controls, patients with SARS, patients with severe SARS and convalescent SARS patients. 
    <br/>Study showed that levels of IL-1alpha did not differ between 3 SARS groups or controls. 
    <br/>Suggests that host immune response to novel coronavirus may be different from the immune reaction to other pathogens. 
    <br/>Overall results suggest that acute lung injury associated with SARS may not be induced by circulating cytokines. HOWEVER some patients had accepted corticosteroids and therefore results consistent with reports that only long term treatment (7-10 days) with a steroid can alter serum cytokine levels.

    <br/>Study involved measurement of cytokines and chemokines including IL-1beta in 20 consecutive patients admitted to Hong Kong hospital. 
    <br/>IL-1beta was significantly elevated above normal range within first 12, 7 and 5 days after disease onset. 
    <br/>Those patients with more severe disease treated with pulsed methylprednisolone. IL-1beta levels higher in this patient group particularly 3-10 days after onset but returned to normal levels 1 week after disease onset in both sets of patients. 
    <br/>IL-1beta can act as early response cytokine to viral infection. IL-1 elevation in SARS can induce hyperinnate inflammatory response leading to recruitment and accumulation of alveolar macrophages and PMN. 
    <br/>Higher disease severity associated with more elevated plasma IL-1beta and addition of pulsed steroid controlled rapidly deteriorating clinical condition and attenuated otherwise exaggerated immunological response.
