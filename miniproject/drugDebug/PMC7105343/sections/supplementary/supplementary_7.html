    <br/>MPA showed strong inhibition, with an IC50 of 2.87 mM. This drug may provide an alternative to ribavirin for treatment of MERS-CoV. In conclusion, IFN-b, MPA or a combination of the two may be beneficial in the treatment of MERS-CoV or as a post-exposure intervention in high-risk patients with known exposures to MERS-CoV.

    <br/>They found that a combination of mycophenolic acid and IFN-b1b lowered the EC50 of each drug by 1-3 times. 
    <br/>Mycophenolic acid exhibits a number of attributes that support its practical use in MERS-CoV infection. It is commonly available in two forms, the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil and the salt mycophenolate sodium, and could be given orally. 
    <br/>Interferon-b1b with mycophenolic acid should be considered in treatment trials of MERS.

    <br/>The authors sought to identify potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of corona viruses. They concluded that they had identified seven compounds (lycorine, emetine, monensin sodium, 
    <b>mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid</b>, phenazopyridine, and pyrvinium pamoate) as broad-spectrum inhibitors according to their strong inhibition of replication by four CoVs in vitro at low-micromolar concentrations. They all inhibited the replication of all CoVs with EC50 values of 5μm. 
    <br/>Mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid, showed a similar antiviral effect on the four CoVs suggesting that the two drugs might harbour similar core structures and antiviral mechanisms.

    <br/>Mycophenolic acid also inhibits purine nucleotide synthesis in lymphocytes. This makes it a popular immunosuppressant in solid-organ transplants and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. 
    <br/>The use of mycophenolic acid monotherapy has not been reported in MERS. IFN-b and mycophenolic acid combination therapy was described in a retrospective observational study in Saudi Arabia involving 51 patients; all of the 8 patients who received IFN-b and mycophenolic acid survived. 
    <br/>Corticosteroids, ribavirin monotherapy and mycophenolic acid are likely to cause more harm than benefit. 
    <br/>There are no clinical data on the efficacy of mycophenolic acid in SARS or MERS. However, it led to severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads in an animal model.
