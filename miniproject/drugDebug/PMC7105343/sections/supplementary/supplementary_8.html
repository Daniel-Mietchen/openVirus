    <br/>Viral replication represents potential antiviral targets. 
    <br/>Study performed genome-wide SARS-CoV yeast-two-hybrid interaction screen with human cDNA libraries identifying FK506-binding proteins as interaction partners of SARS-CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). 
    <br/>FK506-binding proteins bind the immunosuppressive drug FK506 (tacrolimus). 
    <br/>Since Nsp1 interacts with FK506-binding proteins, investigated whether FK506 inhibits replication of human coronaviruses. 
    <br/>VeroFM cells infected with SARS-CoV and other human coronaviruses and treated with FK506. 
    <br/>Study found that FK506 inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E at non-toxic, low-micromolar concentrations with reduction in viral titers to undetectable levels. 
    <br/>All human coronaviruses sensitive to FK506 indicating the involvement of FK506-binding proteins in viral replication.

    <br/>This study further shows that novel non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CsA and FK506 strongly inhibit the growth of human coronavirus HCoV-NL63 at low-micromolar, non-cytotoxic concentrations in cell culture. 
    <br/>HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 discovered in 2004 and 2005 causing more severe lower respiratory tract 
    <br/>infections in younger children. 
    <br/>PPIase-independent activities of CsA and FK506 exerted by gain-of-function, result from binary complexes formed by binding of the drugs to FKBPs. Based on inhibition of the protein phosphatase activity of calcineurin, these complexes block the cellular calcineurin/NFAT pathway 
    <br/>thereby interfering with T-cell activation and IL-2 production.
