   <p>Although HIV protease inhibitors such as lopinavir has been suggested as a low-micromolar inhibitor of MERS-CoV, the different mechanistic classes that HIV and coronavirus fall under meant that there was low affinity for coronavirus strains compared to HIV [

   <p>The following compounds have been shown to be active 
    <italic>in vitro</italic> against the SARS-CoV virus: TNFα-converting enzyme inhibitor (TAPI-2); IFN-α (B/D, mDEF201 by adenovirus 5 vector, CR3014 humanized monoclonal antibody (a neutralising antibody specific for SARS-CoV), recombinant IFN-α2b and type I IFN-β); Interferon inducers (Ampligen and polyinosinic–polycytidylic); therapeutic antibodies (2978/10, equine anti-SARS-CoV F[ab’] and monoclonal antibody 201); attachment inhibitors (Urtica Dioica lectin and griffithsin); host immune system [

   <p>6-mercaptopurine (6MP) and 6-thioguanine (6TG) have been used in cancer chemotherapy for treatment of acute lymphoblastic or myeloblastic leukaemia and were found to be specific inhibitors for the SARS coronavirus [

   <p>Carbohydrate-binding agents (CBA) may be able to block enveloped viruses other than HIV in their entry process and coronaviruses and influenza viruses are other examples of enveloped viruses that may be highly susceptible to the antiviral action of CBAs [

   <p>The genome of SARS-CoV encodes five major proteins: the spike protein (S), the envelope protein (E), the membrane glycoprotein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N). M and E may help host cells to induce the production of protective IFN-α to fight against the virus. Bananin 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol acts as zinc (Zn
    <sup>2+</sup>) chelator and is therefore of interest to target and inhibit immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) zinc finger HIV-1 RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7). Bananin is converted to bananin 5’-monophosphate (BNP) which together with B6RA (vitamin A-vitamin B6 conjugate) and could inhibit infectious virion encapsidation. Targets of BNP and B6RA has shown to be present also in SARS-associated coronavirus making them possible therapeutic candidates [
