<p>Tylophorine-based compounds are isolated from plants and exert potent anti-coronaviral activities against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) activation is a common pro-inflammatory response of host cells to viral infection. Following

 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] suggests the use of a combination therapy for SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV, wherein a tylophorine compound known to target transmissible gastroenteritis virus and a JAK2 inhibitor synergise to block the alternative dominant NF-κB activation mediated by JAK2. Therefore, the combination treatment for the inhibition of coronavirus per se, e.g. viral genome replication, and blocking cellular NF-κB activation by coronaviruses, is a promising approach for the development of anti-coronavirals.
