<p>IL-6, promptly and transiently produced in response to infections and tissue injuries, contributes to host defence through the stimulation of acute phase responses, hematopoiesis, and immune reactions.

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. For this reason, tocilizumab, a humanized anti-IL-6 receptor antibody was developed. Other approved anti IL-6 drugs are siltuximab (Sylvant) and sarilumab. Several agents are in clinical trials:olokizumab (CDP6038), elsilimomab, BMS945429(ALD518), sirukumab (CNTO 136), CPSI-2364, ALX-0061, clazakizumab, olokizumab, sarilumab, sirukumab, ARGX-109, FE301 and FM101
