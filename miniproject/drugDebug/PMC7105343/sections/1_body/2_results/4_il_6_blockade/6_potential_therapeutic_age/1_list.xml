  <p>Pretreatment of primary cultures of human nasal and tracheal epithelial cells with glycopyrronium or formoterol decreased viral RNA levels and/or titers, the expression of the HCoV-229E and the infection-induced production of cytokines, including IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-beta. Treatment of the cells with the CD13 inhibitor 2’2’-dipyridyl decreased viral titers. Pretreatment of the cells with a combination of three drugs (glycopyrronium, formoterol and budesonide) exerted additive inhibitory effects on viral titers and cytokine production [
