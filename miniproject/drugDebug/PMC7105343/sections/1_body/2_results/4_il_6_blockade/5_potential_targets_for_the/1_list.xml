  <p>ADAM-17 regulates IL-6 class switching as a mediator between pro- and anti-inflammatory responses to viral antigenic stimuli in Ebola, SARS-CoV and dengue infections in humans. Therefore, ADAM-17 should be considered as a potential target molecule for novel antiviral drug discovery for infections, such as SARS-CoV [
