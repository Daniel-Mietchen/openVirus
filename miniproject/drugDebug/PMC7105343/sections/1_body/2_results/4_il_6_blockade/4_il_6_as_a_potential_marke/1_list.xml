  <p>IL-6 blood measurements seem useful to diagnose severe COVID-19 cases. The findings suggest that IL-6 and D-Dimer level can be used to estimate the severity of COVID-19. The optimum critical point of IL-6 in the group was 24.3 pg/ml, which was the upper limit of no severe pneumonia [

  <p>The increased expression of IL-2R and IL-6 in serum is expected to predict the severity of the 2019-nCoV pneumonia and the prognosis of patients [

  <p>The serum levels of IL-6 and CXCL-10 were significantly elevated in MERS-CoV patients who developed severe diseases [

  <p>A new lethal animal model was characterised for SARS-CoV. Strain v2163 had nine mutations that increased levels of IL-1alpha and IL-6 in mice. The high IL-6 expression was correlated with mortality [

  <p>SARS vaccination was tested in a murine SARS model. A high level of IL-6 and on days 2 and 3 after SARS-CoV infection was closely linked to the virus replication and disease severity [

  <p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 are key SARS-CoV-induced epithelial cytokines capable of inhibiting the T-cell-priming ability of dendritic cells, a cellular element of the host innate defenses against respiratory infections, leading to an exacerbated inflammatory cascades and severe tissue damage in SARS patients [

  <p>In patients with a diagnosis of SARS-associated coronavirus infection, there were no significant differences in peak levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF
   <bold>α</bold> between patients with and without acute respiratory distress syndrome. However , CRP and TNFα were associated with worse outcomes and might be used as prognostic markers of SARS [

  <p>IFN-gamma, IL-18, TGF-beta, IL-6, IP-10, MCP-1, MIG were highly elevated in the acute phase sera of Taiwan SARS patients, being IL-18, IP-10, MIG, and MCP-1 were significantly higher in the death group than in the survival group. It suggests that an interferon-gamma-related cytokine storm was induced post SARS coronavirus infection [

  <p>Eight patients with SARS [

  <p>A cytokine profiling was performed for 110 serum from healthy donors, patients with SARS, patients with severe SARS, and patients with SARS in convalescence. IL6 concentrations were significantly elevated in severe SARS patients, but the IL-6 concentrations were similar in convalescent patients and control subjects which suggested that IL6 is associated with SARS severity [

  <p>The authors of this study set out to study the inflammatory cytokine profile in children with SARS. They found that the plasma concentrations’ key proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, were not substantially increased in any of the patients throughout the course of illness. From this, the authors stated that the cytokine results cast doubt on the liberal use of corticosteroids in paediatric SARS patients [
