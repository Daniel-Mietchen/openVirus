<p>According to the review by Mo and Fisher [
 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>], MPA monotherapy had not been tested in a clinical setting for the treatment of MERS-CoV. Al Ghamdi 
 <italic>et al</italic> [
 <xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>], presented an example where eight patients were treated with MPA for MERS-CoV, seven in combination with IFN-Î². All eight of these patients survived, however the review by Mo and Fisher stated that this group of patients had lower Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores compared with others in the cohort who received a variety of antiviral agents including ribavirin and IFN-a, steroids and antibiotics. Therefore, the results must be interpreted with caution.
