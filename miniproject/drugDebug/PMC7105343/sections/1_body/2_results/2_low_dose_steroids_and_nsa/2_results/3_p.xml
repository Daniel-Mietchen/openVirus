<p>In general, there appeared to be a few positive results for the use of corticosteroids in viral infections such as SARS-CoV [

 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Corticosteroids were widely used during the SARS-CoV outbreak due to their known ability to modulate a variety of involved cytokines (including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 and TNFα) [

Various studies in humans noted that corticosteroids appeared effective in reducing immunopathological damage but concerns centred around the promotion of viral rebound and association with adverse events (including acute respiratory distress syndrome) [
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. One laboratory study which treated porcine respiratory coronavirus infected pigs with dexamethasone suggested that one or two doses of the corticosteroid in the acute phase of infection may effectively alleviate early pro-inflammatory response, but prolonged administration may play a role in enhancing viral replication [
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. A separate Chinese study, which separated SARS-CoV patients into 4 treatment groups, identified early high-dose steroids in combination with a quinolone as producing the best patient outcomes [
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nevertheless, one review stated that the WHO does not currently recommend corticosteroids in other viral diseases such as Dengue as the ‘glucocorticoid-mediated stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal axis can also drive lymphocytopenia, or it may promote exaggerated pro-inflammatory responses that eventually cause a worsening of the pathogenic condition’ [
