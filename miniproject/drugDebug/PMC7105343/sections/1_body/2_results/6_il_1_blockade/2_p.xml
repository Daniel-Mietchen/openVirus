<p>It is well established that an over-expression of interleukin-1 is a hallmark of SARS-CoV infection, probably through activation of transcription factor nuclear factor, activator protein 1 and activating factor 2. In COVID-19 specifically, the virus is thought to bind to TLRs which activate the formation of pro-IL-1 and activation of the inflammasome [

This inflammasome activation is important for the regulation of cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system paving the way for specific immune responses. As part of the inflammasome activation, IL1-b is subsequently produced which mediates the inflammation of the lungs, fever and fibrosis thus causing respiratory complications in the infected host.
