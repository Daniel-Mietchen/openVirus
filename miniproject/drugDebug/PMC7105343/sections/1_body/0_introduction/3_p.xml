<p>We hypothesise that the drugs selected will likely be categorised into one of two groups: 1) those that may be harmful for patients and put them at risk of increased morbidity/mortality associated with COVID-19 infection and 2) those that may be used to treat the immunopathology associated with severe persistent viral infection. The clinical impact of this review is, thus, twofold. It aims to identify which drugs clinicians should be thinking about taking patients off to protect them from increased harm from COVID-19 and also which drugs could be potentially beneficial in the fight against the disease.</p>
