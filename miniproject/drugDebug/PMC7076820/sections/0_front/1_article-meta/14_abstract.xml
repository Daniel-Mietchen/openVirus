  <title>Background</title>
  <p id="Par1">
   <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> has been used in China and other Asian countries for its antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects for thousands of years. However, the antiviral effect of 
   <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide against pseudorabies virus (PRV) is still unknown.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Methods</title>
  <p id="Par2">The polysaccharide were isolated from extract of the roots of 
   <italic>Radix isatidis.</italic> MTT assays were used to determine the preventive effect, inhibitory effect and antiviral effect of 
   <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide on PRV in vitro.
  </p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Results</title>
  <p id="Par3">This study found that different concentrations of polysaccharides from this plant can inhibit PRV replication by 14.674–30.840%, prevent infection at rates of 6.668–14.923%, and kill this virus at rates of 32.214–67.422%.</p>
 </sec>
 <sec>
  <title>Conclusion</title>
  <p id="Par4">These results broaden the understanding of this traditional Chinese herb and provide a theoretical basis for further research. Moreover, 
   <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide could be used for antiviral therapy.
