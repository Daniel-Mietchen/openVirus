<p id="Par21">To evaluate the effect of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide on PRV replication, porcine testicle cells were first infected with PRV, which was followed by the addition of various concentrations of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide. Based on the results, this extract was found to effectively inhibit PRV replication. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows that the rate of inhibition of PRV replication was 14.674–30.840%.
