<p id="Par16">Swine testicle cells were cultured in 96-well plates as described. After culture for 24 h to achieve 80% confluence, the supernatant was removed and various concentrations of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide were added to each well. The culture medium with 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide was discarded after a 4-h incubation. Cells were then infected with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% tissue culture infective dose) of PRV for 1.5 h. The TCID
 <sub>50</sub> was calculated by the Reed-Muench method [

 <sub>2</sub> for 68 h. MTT assays were then applied as described previously herein.
