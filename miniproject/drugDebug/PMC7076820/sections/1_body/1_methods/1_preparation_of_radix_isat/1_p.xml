 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> was purchased from Henan Herbal Medicine Center Chain Co., Ltd. (Zhengzhou, China). A voucher specimen (No. 2013-zz-012) was deposited at the herbarium of laboratory of ethnopharmacology at Henan Agricultural University. The crude herbs were authenticated by Prof. HY Zhang, Department of Chinese Herbal Medicine of Henan Agricultural University. The methods to separate 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide from the plant were in accordance with previous work [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Briefly, the fresh roots of 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica Fort</italic>. were cut into small pieces. Approximately 100-g roots were soaked in 600 mL water for 2 h and then boiled at 100 °C for 30 min. The solution was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure at 50 °C. After the concentrated liquid was precipitated with 60% ethanol at 4 °C, the suspension was collected and concentrated under reduced pressure at 50 °C. Total purified polysaccharide were measured by Vitriol-anthracene ketone and glucose without H2O was tested as standard control. The content of total Radix isatidis polysaccharide was 92.76%. Purified polysaccharides were stored at − 20 °C for further study. All experiments were approved by the Chinese Medicine Research Ethics Committee of Henan Agricultural University (Number HENAUCC1035).
