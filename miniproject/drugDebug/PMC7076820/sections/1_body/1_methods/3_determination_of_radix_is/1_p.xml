<p id="Par15">The cytotoxic effect of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide toward swine testicle cells was evaluated by performing MTT assays (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Swine testicle cells were digested with trypsin and seeded into 96-well cell culture plates at 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well. After culture for 36 h, several different concentrations of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide were added to each well (repeated four times). Then, cells were cultured for 68 h, MTT reagent was added, and the cell culture plate was incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 4 h. The supernatant was discarded and 100 μL of DMSO was added to each well, which was followed by gentle oscillation for 10 min. The OD values were then measured using a Thermo Scientific Multiskan™ FC microplate reader (Thermo, MA, USA). Each MTT experiment was repeated three times with four wells per point for each concentration.
