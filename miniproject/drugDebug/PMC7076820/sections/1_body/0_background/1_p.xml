<p id="Par10">Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a double-stranded DNA virus and the causative agent of Aujeszkyâ€™s disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which is a highly infectious neurological and respiratory disease of pigs. It can lead huge economic losses to the global swine industry as PRV epidemics can lead to an average loss of $6/cwt [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. PRV has a vast host range and most mammals and some birds can be infected by this pathogen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Swine is the natural reservoir and is susceptible to PRV. After young pigs or other susceptible species are infected, PRV is often lethal and can also lead to central nervous system disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Accordingly, it can cause huge economic losses to the swine industry in many countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Despite the fact that humans are not typically susceptible to infection, one case of PRV resulting in infectious endophthalmitis was reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Since the first antiviral drug was approved in 1963, many others have been produced for clinical use [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, with respect to clinical therapy for humans or animals, various viral strains are resistant to antiviral drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. To solve this problem, novel antiviral drugs or compounds are urgently needed.
