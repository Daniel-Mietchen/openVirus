<p id="Par12">In addition, 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> has obvious antiviral effects. Specifically, it can inhibit the replication of human influenza viruses (H1N1 and H3N2), avian influenza viruses (H6N2 and H9N2) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], and human herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Polysaccharides comprise one of the main components of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> and these also have the anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiviral activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, the antiviral effect of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide against PRV is still unknown. Few studies have focused on this point and accordingly, in this study, we explored the antiviral effect of 
 <italic>Radix isatidis</italic> polysaccharide using swine testicle cells and investigated its protective effect against PRV infection.
