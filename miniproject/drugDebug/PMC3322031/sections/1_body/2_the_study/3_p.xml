<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes showed that the isolates with reduced sensitivity to zanamivir belonged to 2 distinct clusters (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). These viruses accumulated 2 and 3 amino acid (aa) substitutions in HA and 6 and 2 aa changes in NA in 2007 and 2008 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>), respectively. Epidemiologic and sequencing data did not suggest any link between the cases. Analysis of the NA gene showed that the isolates with reduced sensitivity to zanamivir had a glutamine (Q) to lysine (K) substitution at aa position 136. Sequence chromatograms showed a heterogeneous population of virus possessing either Q or K at position 136, with a dominant peak for the K136 mutant (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Direct sequencing of primary samples showed a similar profile of chromatogram with a higher signal for the K136 mutant and a minor peak for the Q136 wild-type strain (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The rest of the zanamivir-sensitive isolates in 2007 and 2008 had the Q136 genotype, and no NAI-resistant-associated mutations were detected elsewhere in the NA gene.
