<p>In this study, we detected a novel influenza virus A (H3N2) with Q136K mutation in NA and S31N mutation in M2, which demonstrated reduced susceptibility to both zanamivir and amantadine but remained susceptible to oseltamivir. These Q136K viruses were isolated at a low frequency (&lt;1.5%) in Myanmar in 2007 and 2008. Phylogenetic analysis showed that these viruses were already amantadine-resistant with S31N mutation in M2. Amantadine-resistant viruses with S31N mutation have been the predominant circulating strains among subtype H3N2 viruses in Myanmar since 2005 (
