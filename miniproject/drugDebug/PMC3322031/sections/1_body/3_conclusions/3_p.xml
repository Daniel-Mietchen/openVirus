<p>We searched the database for NA sequences of influenza viruses A (H3N2) with Q136K mutation that are available on GenBank. Of the 3,381 sequences obtained, 4 sequences from human influenza, which were isolated in 1995, 2003, 2004, and 2007, and 1 sequence from swine influenza, which was isolated in Japan in 1997, contained the Q136K substitution. Sequences from Q136K mutants isolated before 2007 showed no mutations in the M2 gene. The data indicate that these viruses occur naturally because some of the isolates in the database were obtained before introduction of zanamivir into clinical practice in 1999 in Australia, New Zealand, United States, and Europe (
