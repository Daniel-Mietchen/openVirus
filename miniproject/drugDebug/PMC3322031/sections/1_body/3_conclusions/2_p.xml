<p>Hurt et al. recently reported the characterization of zanamivir-resistant subtype H1N1 with Q136K mutation in NA (

 <sub>50</sub>s of these viruses ranged from 6 nM to 238 nM (

 </xref>), which differed from the 1–60 nM range of subtype H3N2 viruses obtained in this study. This finding may be due to differences in subtype and variations in the assay. The Q136K mutation was not detected in the primary clinical samples by sequencing (

  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>), however, in our study, the Q136K mutation in subtype H3N2 isolates was detected in primary samples. Comparison of the sequence chromatograms between original samples and virus isolates showed a similar profile, suggesting that the Q136K mutants were present in primary samples of subtype H3N2 isolates. The presence of Q136K variants in primary samples appears to be subtype-specific because these mutants were present in very low proportions among subtype H1N1 viruses (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">
  <italic>12</italic>
 </xref>). To determine whether mutations exist in other gene segments associated with Q136K mutations, we performed a full genome analysis of Q136K mutants and wildtype viruses. We found no additional mutations in Q136K strains, which suggest that the genetic background of these viruses can compensate for the K136 mutation. However, further study is needed to confirm whether the accumulated 5 aa changes in HA and 8 substitutions in NA would compensate for the Q136K mutation.
