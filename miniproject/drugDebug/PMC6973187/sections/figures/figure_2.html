 <caption> Pharmacokinetics and drug composition of Cidofovir and Brincidofovir. (a) The activated antiviral, cidofovir diphosphate, leads to chain termination as it is incorporated into the viral DNA. (b) In Brincidofovir, the lipid conjugated form of Cidofovir, intracellular uptake is increased leading to a more than 100-fold increase in intracellular concentration of active cidofovir. </caption>
