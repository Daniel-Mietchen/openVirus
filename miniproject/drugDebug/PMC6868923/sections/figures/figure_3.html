 <caption> Sequence alignment of HBV-RT and HIV-1-RT polymerases. Secondary structure prediction of HBV-RT. Predicted amino acid sequences of HBV-RT (O11885) and HIV-1-RT PDB code 3v81 (P03366) were accordingly to Daga et al. (2010) conserved residues, which are highlighted with a red background. </caption>
