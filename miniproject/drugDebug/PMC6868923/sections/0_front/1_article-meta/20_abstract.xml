  <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic> is a neotropical plant present in South America and it has been evaluated in several biological models due to the presence of active metabolites. Nevertheless, there is a limited quantity of studies related to the antiviral activity of the compounds present in this 
  <italic>genus</italic>. In our work, the antiviral effect of the compounds isolated from the aerial parts of 
  <italic>Marcetia taxifolia </italic>was evaluated against Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), and Poliovirus type 1 (PV-1). The cytopathic effect and viral quantification by qPCR were determined as indicative of antiviral activity. Our data show that myricetin rhamnoside (MyrG), myricetin-3-α-O-ramnosil (1→6)-α-galactoside (MyrGG), 5,3'-dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3',4'pentamethoxyflavone (PMF-OH) had antiviral activity without cytotoxic effects. The methoxyflavones PMF and PMF-OH were the most active compounds, showing an antiviral effect against all the evaluated viruses. Computational studies showed that these compounds could interact with the Reverse Transcriptase. Altogether, these results suggest that the flavonoids (related to myricetin and methoxyflavones) are the main antiviral compounds present in the aerial parts of 
  <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic>. Furthermore, our results showed that the methoxyflavones have a broad antiviral activity, which represents an opportunity to evaluate these flavonoids as lead molecules to develop new antiviral compounds.
