<p>The antiviral activity of each compound against Polio-1 and HSV-1 was assayed. The myricetin related compounds did not show antiviral activity against these viruses. However, methoxyflavones exhibited activity with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> near to 1 µM against PV-1 (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). An inhibitory effect of 90 % (PMF) and 60 % (PMF-OH) against HSV-1 was observed at a concentration of 10 μM (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>).
