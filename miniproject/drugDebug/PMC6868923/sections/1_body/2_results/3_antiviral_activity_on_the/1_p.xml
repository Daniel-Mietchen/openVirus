<p>The selectivity index (SI) of the methoxyflavones (PMF and PMF-OH) against HBV was 10,000 and 102 respectively, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.001 µM for PMF and 0.098 µM for PMF-OH. These compounds showed the highest antiviral activity against HBV (Figure 2A
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). Additionally, MyrG presents an SI of 6667 and an EC
 <sub>50</sub>= 0.015 µM while MyrGG showed an SI of 8.3 and EC
 <sub>50</sub>= 12 µM (Figure 2B
