<p>Some flavonoids have been characterized as HIV-1-RT inhibitors. Furthermore, previous reports showed that these compounds, particularly myricetin and myricetin 3-rhamnoside, could occupy the NNRTI pocket (Li et al., 2011[
 <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]; Ortega et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]). Thus, molecular docking study of glycosylated flavonoids (MyrG and MyrGG) and methoxyflavones (PMF and PMF-OH) into the NNRTI pocket on the HBV-RT model were carried out. Figure 5
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">(Fig. 5)</xref> shows the docking representation of the MyrG (A) and PMF (B) on the HBV-RT model, and Table 3
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="T3">(Tab. 3)</xref> summarizes the docking scores for the ligands evaluated in this study. The compounds that best interact with the NNRTI pocket were the methoxyflavones. However, the best-docked compound was PMF-OH, with a binding energy of -5.59 kcal/mol. The compound PMF shows binding energy of -5.33 kcal/mol. However, the glycosylated flavonoids showed lower binding energy than methoxyflavones. The best ranked binding energy was for MyrG with a binding energy of -4.61 Kcal/mol. All these results are summarized in Table 3
