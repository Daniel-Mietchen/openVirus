<p>To determine the antiviral activity against Herpes and Polio, a plaque reduction assay, on 24 well culture plates was performed. The Vero cells were infected with 100 plaque forming units (PFU) of HSV-1 or PV-1. After 60 min adsorption at 37 Â°C and 5 % CO
 <sub>2</sub> the virus was removed. Then, the monolayers were washed twice with PBS and overlaid with plaque medium (0.5 % Methylcellulose). Next, the compounds were added at different concentrations in each well and incubated by 24 or 48 h for PV-1 and HSV-1 respectively. Finally, cells were fixed with 10 % formalin and stained with 0.4 % crystal violet. Viral infection, cellular morphology, and cytotoxic controls in each assay were all performed.
