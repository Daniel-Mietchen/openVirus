<p>The results showed that only the glycosylated flavonoids related to myricetin and the methoxyflavones exhibited antiviral activity. Myricetin related compounds and methoxyflavones were active against HBV (Figure 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). However, the most potent compounds were the methoxyflavones (Figure 2A
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>). In our best knowledge, this is the first report that indicates the antiviral activity of these compounds on HBV. Interestingly, other flavonoids related to myricetin such as quercetin have exhibited an antiviral effect against HBV (Cheng et al., 2015[
