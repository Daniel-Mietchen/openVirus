<p>In conclusion, the methoxyflavones showed antiviral activity against all the evaluated viruses, while the glycosylated flavonoids related to myricetin were active only on HBV. In the HBV model, the possible antiviral mechanism could be related to HBV-RT inhibition. On the other hand, the results obtained for PMF against HSV-1 and PV-1 suggest that these compounds could have another mechanism related to a cellular process modulation. However, additional pharmacological studies to establish the target of the methoxyflavones and further evaluations of glycosylated flavonoids as RT inhibitors are needed. Altogether, these results show the potential of flavonoids as antiviral lead compounds. </p>
