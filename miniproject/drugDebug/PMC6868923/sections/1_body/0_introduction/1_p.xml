<p>Emergence, resistance and spreading of viral strains promote research for new antiviral drugs. In fact, several biological compounds are found in plants and some of these plant extracts have shown broad antiviral properties. These inhibitory effects could be related to blocking main viral enzymes directly or in some cases, to be modulating a cellular pathway (Arena et al., 2004[

 <xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; Sharma et al., 2009[
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]). These molecular mechanisms are similar to the drugs used in antiviral therapy: direct-acting antiviral and drugs that block a host cellular process avoiding viral replication (Ortega et al., 2013[
