 <italic>Marcetia</italic> is a Neotropical 
 <italic>genus</italic> distributed from Venezuela to Uruguay (Berry and Luckana, 2001[
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). Baptista et al. (2016[
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) described for the first time the compounds present in the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic>. These compounds are: marcetol (1), 5-α-cholestan-3-β-ol (2), 5-α-cholestan-7-en3-β-ol (3), 24,25-dehydropollinastanol (4), lupa-12,20(29)-dien-3-ol (5), 5,3'- dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (6), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3',4'pentamethoxyflavone (7), myricetrine (8) and myricetin-3-α-O-ramnosil (1→6)-α-galactoside (9). Previous reports have shown that these methoxyflavones and myricetrine have antiviral activity against HIV-1 (Ortega et al., 2017[
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>][
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]). Additionally, Leite et al. have reported the antibacterial and antifungal activities of 
 <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic> extract. These activities are principally associated with polymethoxylated flavonoids (Leite et al., 2012[
 <xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]). However, the antiviral activity of these compounds has been scarcely evaluated. Thus, in this study the compounds obtained from the aerial parts of 
 <italic>Marcetia taxifolia </italic>were evaluated against three different viral families of public health concern: Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Poliovirus (PV). HBV affects around 240 million people worldwide and is related to hepatic cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (WHO, 2019[
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]). HSV may produce oral or genital lesion depending on the virus type (HSV-1 and HSV-2 respectively) (Whitley and Baines, 2018[
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]) and Poliovirus is associated with paralysis in unvaccinated children (Menant and Gandevia, 2018[
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). These viruses exhibit many differences in the replicative cycle. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the antiviral activity of compounds isolated from 
 <italic>Marcetia taxifolia</italic> against these different viral families.
