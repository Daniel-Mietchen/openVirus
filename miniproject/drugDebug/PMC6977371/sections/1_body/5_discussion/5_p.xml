<p>Animal experiments provide reliable data for the mechanisms of drug susceptibility or resistance due to the fact that the results can be monitored over a longer period of time, with simultaneous sampling whereas the experiments in the embryonated chicken eggs have limitations of time and sampling. It has been observed that sometimes substitutions in the viral NA protein do not necessarily lead to an apparent phenotypic change in the susceptibility of the virus to NAIs

In view of the emergence of new influenza viruses at the animal-human interface, such studies are necessary to develop antiviral surveillance and pandemic preparedness strategies.
