<p>It was reported earlier that in mice challenged with lethal doses of HPAI H5N1 virus, a daily dose of 1 to 10 mg per kg oseltamivir prevented mortality, reduced virus titres in the lungs and prevented the spread of the virus in the brain
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. HPAI H5N1 causes severe disease in ferrets, and a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality has been recorded after treatment with oseltamivir
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The two HPAI H5N1 viruses used in the present study were representative isolates, which were found to be sensitive to OC. Since HPAI H5N1 viruses possessing molecular markers for resistance to NAIs have been reported in India
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, it is imperative that such models be developed which enable rapid as well functional screening for antiviral resistance.
