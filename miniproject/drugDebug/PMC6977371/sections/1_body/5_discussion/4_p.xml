<p>The ISIRV antiviral working group provides standard wild-type and resistant reference viruses with known IC
 <sub>50</sub> values range to be used as controls for NA inhibition assays
 <xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. Due to known susceptibility of the reference viruses, they were used in the 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> antiviral assays to demonstrate the validity as well as relevance of the use of EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres in the egg model. In the study by Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, the antiviral drug ribavirin was administered via the albumen route, while the virus was inoculated via the allantoic route. It was found that ribavirin administered in the albumen of the egg is detectable in the allantoic fluid even after 72 h of administration
