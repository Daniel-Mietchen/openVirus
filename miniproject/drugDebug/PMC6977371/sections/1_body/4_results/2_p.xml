 <italic>In ovo antiviral assay</italic>: aBoth H5N1-33487 and H5N1-4396 viruses showed a significant drop (
 <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.05) in HA titres after OC treatment, as compared to untreated controls (without drug). A significant reduction in the HA titres of treated viruses for every individual dilution ranging from 10
 <sup>−3</sup> to 10
 <sup>−7</sup> was observed as compared to respective controls (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure</xref>). There was also a one-log drop in EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres, but no significant reduction in ELD
 <sub>50</sub> (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table</xref>). The H1N1 wild-type and pH1N1 wild-type control reference viruses showed the EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres of 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> and 10
 <sup>3.7</sup>, respectively, in the absence of OC, as compared to the treated groups, which had nil EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres for both. H1N1 variant and pH1N1 variant control viruses showed the EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres of 10
 <sup>4.8</sup> and 10
 <sup>6.0</sup>, respectively, in the presence of OC, while the titres of 10
 <sup>4.7</sup> and 10
 <sup>6.0</sup> in the absence of OC. Thus, there was no significant drop in EID
 <sub>50</sub> titres of the variant control viruses. There was no mortality in eggs inoculated with any of the control viruses.
