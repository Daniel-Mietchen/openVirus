 <italic>Antiviral drug</italic>: For 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> antiviral assays, OC stock of 56 μg/ml concentration (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd., Basel, Switzerland) was prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 
 <italic>p</italic>H 7.2) from which 14 μg/ml drug suspension was prepared. This concentration of the administered drug led to a final resultant concentration of 0.35 μg/ml in the allantoic fluid of the eggs (taking into consideration its double dilution after mixing in an equal volume of virus suspension and further dilution in 10 ml of allantoic fluid in the egg). This concentration mimics the peak plasma concentration of OC in humans after the prescribed 75 mg dose of oseltamivir phosphate
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. In a previous study, 1.75, 3.5, 7, 14, 28, 56 and 112 μg/ml doses were tested against 100 EID
 <sub>50</sub> (50% egg infectious dose) virus. OC concentrations of 14 μg/ml and above showed complete inhibition of the virus. Therefore, 14 μg/ml of OC was chosen for the 
 <italic>in ovo</italic> antiviral assays.
