 <italic>Fluorescence-based neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) assay</italic>: For use in the NAI assay, HPAI H5N1 viruses were inactivated using 0.1 per cent formalin (Fisher Scientific, New Hampshire, USA) as described elsewhere
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Briefly, 0.1 per cent of formalin (by volume) was added to the virus stock and mixed thoroughly. The mixture was transferred carefully to a fresh, previously labelled container, at the bottom, making sure that there was no fluid sticking to the walls or the brim, and incubated at 37°C for 16 h (overnight). Confirmation of inactivation was carried out by two passages in embryonated chicken eggs and carrying out HA assay for the allantoic fluids. The fluorescence-based NAI assay was carried out as per the method described previously
 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. The appropriate virus dilution of each virus sample to be used in the NAI assay was determined by NA activity titration. For NAI assay, the determined virus dilutions were incubated with serial ten-fold drug dilutions ranging from 30000 to 0.03 nM OC. The artificial fluorogenic substrate, 2'-(4-methyl-umbelliferyl)-α-D-N-acetylneuraminic acid (MUNANA, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) was added. After the specified incubation, the reaction was stopped, and the fluorescence was measured in a fluorometer (VictorX Multilabel plate reader, PerkinElmer, USA) at an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength of 460 nm. The IC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated using the curve-fitting software JASPR (v1.2, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, USA).
