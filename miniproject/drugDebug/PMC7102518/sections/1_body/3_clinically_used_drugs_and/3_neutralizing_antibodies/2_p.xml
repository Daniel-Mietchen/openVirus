<p id="para0012">Three influenza virus HA stalk-targeting broadly neutralizing Abs (bnAbs), MHAA4548A, MEDI8852, and VIS410, have advanced to phase 2 clinical trials and demonstrated some antiviral efficacy when dosed therapeutically, accelerating symptom resolution and reducing virus replication.

 </xref>: after viral adaptation in cell culture, resistant variants either carried a point mutation in the stalk epitope preventing antibody binding, or harbored substitutions that enhanced HA fusion activity and therefore allowed viral entry in the presence of antibody. These experimental resistance mutations affected viral fitness, however, reducing viral replication in cell culture.
