<p id="para0016">Baloxavir marboxil was well tolerated in clinical trials with only mild and transient adverse events that resolved without further intervention. Side effects included headaches and increased eosinophil and white blood cell counts. PK properties in pediatric recipients were similar to those seen in adults, and a trial involving 107 pediatric patients receiving 1 weight-adjusted dose of baloxavir marboxil established equivalent efficacy in adults and children against uncomplicated influenza.

 </xref> Although efficacy of baloxavir marboxil and NAIs were comparable, baloxavir marboxil provides full benefit after a single oral dose, giving the drug an advantage over current standard-of-care. Consistent with distinct protein targets of baloxavir marboxil and the NAIs, viruses harboring signature NAI resistance mutations were shown to remain susceptible to inhibition by baloxavir marboxil.
