<p id="para0023">EIDD-2801/NHC appears to establish an unusually high barrier against viral resistance, since several studies have unsuccessfully tried to induce viral escape through dose-escalation and sublethal fixed-dose adaptation strategies. Next-generation sequencing of the resulting treatment-experienced virus populations revealed an elevated number of low-frequency mutations, but none of these became allele-dominant or mediated robust resistance to the drug.
