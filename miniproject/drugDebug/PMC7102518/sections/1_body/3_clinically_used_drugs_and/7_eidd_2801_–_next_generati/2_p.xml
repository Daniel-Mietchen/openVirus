<p id="para0022">Whereas rodent PK properties of NHC were good, oral bioavailability of the drug in non-human primates such as cynomolgus macaques was limited. This liability was addressed through the development of the prodrug EIDD-2801, a 5′-isopropylester (

 </xref> Oral daily doses of 14 mg/kg EIDD-2801 were reportedly efficacious against H1N1 and H3N2 IAV strains in the ferret model, causing significant reduction of viral load in both the upper and lower respiratory tract and alleviation of clinical signs. The compound showed potent antiviral activity in disease-relevant well-differentiated human airway epithelium model cultures, inhibiting both IAV and IBV strains with active concentrations around 0.08 μM and selectivity indices &gt;1700.
