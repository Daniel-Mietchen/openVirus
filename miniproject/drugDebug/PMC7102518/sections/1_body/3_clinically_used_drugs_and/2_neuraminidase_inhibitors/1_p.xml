<p id="para0008">Of the NAIs in clinical use, oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="fig0001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref> ), peramivir, and zanamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate is the most frequently prescribed and considered standard-of-care for influenza management since essentially all circulating influenza viruses have acquired resistance to the adamantanes. Mechanistically, NAIs competitively inhibits the enzymatic activity of IAV and influenza B virus (IBV) neuraminidases, preventing cleavage of the terminal sialic acid residues from glycoproteins and carbohydrates displayed on the surface of mammalian cells and influenza virus particles. Binding of virions to uncleaved sialic acid then impairs virion release and dissemination.
