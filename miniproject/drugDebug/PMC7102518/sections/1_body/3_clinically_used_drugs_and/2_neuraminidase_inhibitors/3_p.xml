<p id="para0010">Resistance to oseltamivir can develop rapidly in both experimental settings and the clinic, and typically originates from substitutions at signature resistance sites in the viral NA protein such as H274Y and I223R (predominant in H1N1 and H5N1 viruses), and E119V, R292K, or N294S (predominant in H3N2 viruses).
