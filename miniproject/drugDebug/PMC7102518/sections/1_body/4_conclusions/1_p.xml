<p id="para0027">Influenza viruses continue to present a major threat to human health globally. In the past year, the first new drug class in over 2 decades was approved for influenza therapy, providing a much-needed expansion of the available antiviral arsenal. However, low genetic barriers of both neuraminidase and PA endonuclease inhibitors against viral escape create an urgent need for next-generation therapeutics. Of the different developmental candidates currently explored, bnAbs are attractive for the protection of high-risk groups if treatment costs can be managed. Competitive ribonucleoside analog inhibitors with high resistance barrier are promising for use against seasonal and pandemic viruses, provided the risk of adverse effects is acceptably low or can be appropriately mitigated.</p>
