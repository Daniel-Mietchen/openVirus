<p id="para0005">Exemplifying the scope of the problem, the adamantanes, amantadine and, subsequently, rimantadine, were the first drugs approved for the treatment of influenza A virus (IAV) infections. These inhibitors target the viral M2 ion channel, preventing dissociation of the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) genome from the matrix protein by blocking M2-mediated diffusion of protons into virions located in maturing endosomes.
