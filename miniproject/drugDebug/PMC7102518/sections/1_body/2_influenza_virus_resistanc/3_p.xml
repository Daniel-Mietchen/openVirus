<p id="para0006">In the past 2 decades, major research efforts have been directed towards the discovery of host-directed antiviral drugs, lured by the prospect of a high barrier of these therapeutics against the development of resistance. Mechanistically unique is the host-directed viral entry inhibitor DAS181, a recombinant sialidase fusion protein, which targets cellular sialic acid residues required for influenza virus infection. In contrast to this extracellular host target, the majority of experimental host-directed antivirals aim to modulate host immune responses or have been developed against intracellular processes that are critical for successful virus replication (reviewed in

Reflecting the conundrum that antiviral efficacy and undesirable adverse effects of host-directed antivirals follow in most cases the same structure-activity relationship, no intracellularly acting host-directed candidate has been approved yet for clinical use against influenza viruses
