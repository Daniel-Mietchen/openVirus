<p id="para0001">Influenza virus affects approximately 10% of the population during every season. In most healthy individuals, these infections predominantly result in relatively mild, self-limiting disease that remains restricted to the upper respiratory tract and does not require therapeutic intervention. Reflecting the overall high disease prevalence, however, the World Health Organization estimates that 3â€“5 million infections lead to severe disease that advances to the lower respiratory tract and viral pneumonia, resulting in up to 650,000 deaths annually.

 </xref> High-risk groups for severe influenza infection include older adults, the immunocompromized, pregnant women, people with underlying pulmonary conditions, and, to a lesser degree, the very young. Yearly vaccination is recommended for everyone older than 6 months of age, but vaccine efficacy varies substantially based on how well circulating viruses and vaccine strains are matched, patient age and patient influenza history. In the 2017/18 influenza season, for instance, vaccine efficacy against the predominant H3N2 strain was only 25%, leading to the highest mortality rate since the 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

Due to these limitations to vaccine prophylaxis combined with continued high disease burden caused by seasonal influenza viruses, the threat of spill-over of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses into the human population and a low barrier to viral escape of standard-of-care therapeutics (discussed in detail below), effective novel antiviral therapeutics are urgently needed for improved disease management especially in high risk patients and for heightened preparedness against the risk of future global pandemics.
