  <p>Fluorescence quenching spectra of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. A solution containing 1 μM SARS-CoV 3CLpro showed a strong fluorescence emission (the solid line) with a peak at 340 nm at the excitation wavelength of 290 nm. After adding 40 μM each inhibitory compound such as herbacetin (the dashed line), rhoifolin (one dashed one dotted line) and pectolinarin (one dotted line), fluorescence quenching spectra were obtained.</p>
