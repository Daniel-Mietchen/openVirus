<p>The protein was purified by cation chromatography using a 5 ml Hi-Trap SP column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, New Jersey, USA). The column was equilibrated with a buffer consisting of 50 mM MES pH 6.5 and the pooled fractions were loaded. The column was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient to 1 M NaCl and the protein was eluted at 0.23 M NaCl. SDS-PAGE showed one band around 22 kDa (21895.09 Da), corresponding to the molecular weight of the catalytic domain of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. The protein was concentrated to 16 mg ml
