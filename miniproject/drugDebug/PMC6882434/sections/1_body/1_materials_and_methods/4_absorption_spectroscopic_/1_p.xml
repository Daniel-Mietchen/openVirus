<p>To confirm the feasibility of the assay method independently, the fluorescence spectra from the tryptophan of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro with candidate inhibitors were investigated

 </xref>. The fluorescence measurements were recorded with a SpectraMax i3x Multi-mode microplate reader (Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 290 nm and 300–500 nm, respectively. The optimal excitation and emission wavelengths were determined by SoftMax Pro. One tryptophan of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro showed a fluorescence emission with a peak at 350 nm after the excitation at the wavelength of 290 nm. In contrast, the flavonoids were almost non-fluorescent under the same experiment condition. Each 40 μM chemical was incubated with 1 μM the SARS-CoV 3CLpro for 1 h and the fluorescence intensity of the mixture was measured.
