<p>In order to deduce the binding modes of the inhibitory flavonoids in the molecular level, an in-depth theoretical investigation through an induced-fit docking study was carried out. The interactions between SARS-CoV 3CLpro and three inhibitory flavonoids were analysed to predict their binding affinities. Top-ranked structures (according to the glide gscores) from the induced-fit docking results for herbacetin (–9.263), rhoifolin (–9.565) and pectolinarin (–8.054) were selected and hypothesised to be biological complexes. To find reasonable structural factors endowing the good affinity of herbacetin, the poses of kaempferol (–8.526) and morin (–8.930), two closest homologues, were also calculated and compared. The predicted complex structures and 2D schematic representations of them are illustrated in
