Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiCl's antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment <italic>in vivo</italic> obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Our finding further expands the antiviral targets of LiCl and provides an alternative agent for viral myocarditis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple" id="ulist0010"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p id="p0010">Lithium chloride inhibits coxsackievirus B3 virus replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo.</italic>

Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a member of the <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus of Picornaviridae, is well-identified as the dominant etiological factor causing viral myocarditis. It was reported that about 25&#x02013;27% cases of dilated cardiomyopathy and VMC in young adults and children were caused by CVB3 [<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although type-I interferon is reported to have certain therapeutic effect, the treatment or vaccine has been successful in treating CVB3 infection and myocarditis [<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p id="p0030">Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied as a psychotropic anti-depressant agent in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders since its approval by the FDA in 1949 [<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cumulative evidence suggests that LiCl participates in many cellular processes, such as cell gene expression, apoptosis, proliferation, oncogenesis, glycogen synthesis and inflammation. So LiCl has been explored for treating diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and ovarian cancer, as well as antimicrobial infection [<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Prior investigations have also revealed that LiCl exhibits antiviral effects on certain viruses, e.g., coronavirus, herpes simplex, infectious bronchitis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and feline calicivirus [<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>]. Given that there are few reports about the influence of LiCl on the enteroviruses infections and it's rarely studied to evaluate the antiviral potential of LiCl in viral infection models based on animals, it's of high significance to examine the effect of LiCl on CVB3 infections and virus-induced viral myocarditis in mice.</p><p id="p0035">Therefore, we studied the antiviral effects of LiCl in HeLa cells and in CVB3-infected mouse. The results indicate that LiCl acts as a potential antiviral agent to significantly inhibit CVB3 replication through decreasing virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment could markedly suppress the cardiac virus replication and alleviate the progress of myocarditis in mice, which might expand LiCl's new application in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Mice, viruses, cells and reagents</title><p id="p0040">About 6&#x02013;8 weeks-old male BALB/c mice (16&#x02013;18g) were obtained from (Shanghai Slac Animal Inc.).

LiCl treatment also significantly decreased the activity of serum creatine kinase (CK) and echocardiographic measurements showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were markedly increased after treated with LiCl, which suggested that LiCl could obviously improve the cardiac function (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D and E). Consistently, HE staining analysis displayed that control mice showed severe myocarditis with necrotic lesions and inflammation, LiCl treatment significantly alleviated myocarditis with less inflammatory foci and necrosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F and G). <funding-source id="gs1">IHC</funding-source> analysis showed that LiCl treatment decreased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 within the myocardium, which further supported that LiCl inhibit virus-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>H).To further verify the role of LiCl on the inflammation within the myocardium, we analyzed the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hearts by Q-PCR. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E, the levels of IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2; were significantly decreased after LiCl injection while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was slightly increased with LiCl treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>I).

It is well-known that interferon (IFN) pathway plays a key role on virus replication and GSK3&#x003b2; is also reported to regulate IFN-&#x003b2; production. However, CVB3 has evolved mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response by directly cleaving MDA5 and MAVS. We also explored the effect of LiCl on IFN production upon CVB3 infection and found that the expression of IFN was not altered by CVB3 infection in HeLa cells and LiCl treatment also did not influence the IFN expression. Besides, we also checked type-I interferon responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages after CVB3 stimulation. We found that IFN-&#x003b2; production was induced by CVB3 and inhibited after LiCl treatment, which cannot explain LiCl's antiviral effect on CVB3 infection. Moreover, it seems that IFN-&#x003b2; inhibition induced by LiCl in immune cells also apply to other virus or stimuli. We found similar result in Sendai virus (SeV) infected peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Wang et al. also reported similar phenotype. They found that, in macrophages, LiCl attenuated IFN-&#x003b2; production and IFN regulatory factor 3 activation induced by LPS-, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-, and SeV, but this is in a glycogen synthase kinase-3&#x003b2;-independent manner [<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p id="p0115">GSK3&#x003b2; was reported to induce apoptosis in neuron cells and fibroblasts, but recent studies have suggested that the role of GSK3&#x003b2; on apoptosis is complicated [<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].

Here, we report that LiCl restricts the replication of CVB3 through inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis, thus expanding the range of LiCl targets to CVB3. Moreover, we also confirm the antiviral potential of LiCl in hearts of VMC mice and demonstrated that LiCl potently protects mice against CVB3-induced myocarditis, indicating a therapeutic target of LiCl in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>Ethical approval</title><p id="p0125">The animal experiments were performed in accordance with Soochow University institutional guidelines, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Soochow University in written form.
