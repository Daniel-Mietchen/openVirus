 <caption> Effect of LiCl treatment on CVB3-induced myocarditis. Mice were infected intraperitoneally with 1500 TCID 50 of CVB3 and then divided into two groups (8–10 mice/group), PBS and LiCl treatments. After CVB3 infection, LiCl were daily applied to mice i.p. The survival rate (A) and body weight (B) of the mice were recorded daily until day 7 post infection (p.i.). (C) At day 3 and 7 p.i., viral RNA level in hearts were analyzed by Q-PCR. (D) Serum CK activity as indicative of cardiac injury was detected at day 0 and 4 post infection. (E) Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to each mouse at day 7 p.i (n = 4). LVEF and LVFS were calculated from measured ventricle dimensions. (F) At day 3 and 7 p.i., paraffin sections of heart tissues were subjected to HE analysis and the arrows indicated inflammatory foci. (G) Pathological scores of the hearts are shown. (H) At day 7 p.i., hearts were sectioned and subjected to IHC assay with primary antibody against cleaved caspase 3. Five images were captured for each section and representative one was shown. (I) At day 3 and 7 p.i., the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines in heart tissues were measured by Q-PCR. Data were presented as mean ± SD of three representative independent experiments. </caption>
