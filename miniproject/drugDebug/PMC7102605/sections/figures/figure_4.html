 <caption> Effect of LiCl treatment on virus-induced apoptosis.HeLa cells were infected with CVB3 at MOIof 10, and then cells were added with LiCl for 24 h. Cell were stained with Annexin V and 7-AAD and apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry. The apoptosis was quantified and indicated in Annexin V + cells (A). The absolute number of Annexin V + cells were shown as mean ± SEM (B). </caption>
