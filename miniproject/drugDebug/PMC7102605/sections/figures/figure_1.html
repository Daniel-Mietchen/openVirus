 <caption> Cytotoxic effect of LiCl administration on cell lines. HeLa or 293T cells were added to a various LiCl doses (0,10, 20, 30, 40, 50 mM) for 72h, after being cultured for 24h in 96-well plates with DMEM with 10% FBS. (A–B) Comparison of the cell viability by CCK8 assay. Each value was standardized to that of 0 mM group (set at 100%). (C)AnnexinV-FITC and 7-AAD were stained on HeLa or 293T cells, after being treated with LiCl. The cellapoptosis was detected by flow cytometry. </caption>
