<p id="p0090">We firstly evaluated the influence of LiCl on CVB3 attachment to HeLa cells. LiCl of different doses (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 mM) were mixed with CVB3, after which the mixture was added into cells at 4 °C for 1 h. Subsequent to changing the medium and PBS-wash, cells were cultured at 37 °C for 24 h and were analyzed by Q-PCR and Western blot. The results showed that the viral RNA level and VP-1 expression were not altered after treatment with LiCl (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> A and B). Next to rule out the effect of LiCl on viral entry, HeLa cells were infected with CVB3 together with LiCl treatment followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. Subsequent to changing the media, HeLa cells were cultured for 24 h at 37 °C and then used to carry out Western blot and Q-PCR and. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>C and D, we did not observe any significant difference in levels of viral RNA and capsid protein VP-1 observed between LiCl- and mock-treated groups. All these results implied that LiCl treatment has no influence on CVB3 attachment and entry into cells.
