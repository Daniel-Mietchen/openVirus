<p id="p0100">Next we establish CVB3-induced myocarditis in mice to evaluate antiviral effect of LiCl on the viral infections 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. LiCl was applied daily to the mice after infection, after which we analyzed myocarditis and cardiac viral replication. It was found that the bodyweight loss and survival rate of mice were markedly improved in mice treated with LiCl (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref> A and B). As expected, the viral RNA level was obviously decreased in hearts of mice after LiCl treatment (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>C). LiCl treatment also significantly decreased the activity of serum creatine kinase (CK) and echocardiographic measurements showed that the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) were markedly increased after treated with LiCl, which suggested that LiCl could obviously improve the cardiac function (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>D and E). Consistently, HE staining analysis displayed that control mice showed severe myocarditis with necrotic lesions and inflammation, LiCl treatment significantly alleviated myocarditis with less inflammatory foci and necrosis (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>F and G). 
 <funding-source id="gs1">IHC</funding-source> analysis showed that LiCl treatment decreased the expression of cleaved caspase 3 within the myocardium, which further supported that LiCl inhibit virus-induced cardiomyocytes apoptosis (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>H).To further verify the role of LiCl on the inflammation within the myocardium, we analyzed the productions of pro-inflammatory cytokines in hearts by Q-PCR. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>E, the levels of IL-6, TNF-α and IL-1β were significantly decreased after LiCl injection while anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was slightly increased with LiCl treatment (
 <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>I). Thus, these results indicated that LiCl could significantly suppress CVB3 replication and inhibit the virus-induced inflammation
