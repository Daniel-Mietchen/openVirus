<p id="p0055">Cell apoptosis analysis was performed by staining cells with staining Annexin V-FITC kit (BioVision, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Briefly, cells were infected CVB3 (MOI = 10) and then were treated with LiCl for 24 h. They were then recovered and washed two times using cold PBS and were staining with Annexin V for 15min. 7-AAD was then added for 5 min at room temperature (RT). The number of Annexin V
 <sup>+</sup> apoptotic cells was analyzed with FlowJo v10.0 software (Tree Star) after processing on a Canto II flow cytometer (BD Bioscience).
