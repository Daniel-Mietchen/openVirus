<p id="p0045">HeLa or 293T cells were added into 96-well plate with LiCl which had been diluted with DMEM (without serum) for 48 h. Six wells were mock treated as control. At the end of the incubation period, 20 μl of CKK8 solution and 80 μl of DMEM were put into every well, followed by incubation for 4 h at 37 °C. OD
 <sub>450</sub> was calculated using a microplate reader and the relative cell viability values were calculated as (mean OD
 <sub>450</sub> LiCl)/(mean OD
 <sub>450</sub> control) × 100%.
