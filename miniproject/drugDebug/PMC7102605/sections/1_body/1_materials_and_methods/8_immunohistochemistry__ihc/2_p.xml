<p id="p0070">Immunohistochemistry was performed to assess cardiac levels of cleaved caspase-3 according to the manufacturer's instructions (Mouse and Rabbit Specific HRP/DAB Detection IHC Kit, ab64264, Abcam). Briefly, the paraffin sections of hearts were incubated with primary antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 (1:250, Cat. No. 9664, Cell Signaling Technology) at 4 °C overnight. After washing, sections were stained with Biotinylated Goat Anti-Polyvalent for 10 min at room temperature. After washing, the sections were incubated with Streptavidin Peroxidase and DAB Substrate. Stained sections were imaged with a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope and five images were captured under high power fields (100× magnifications) randomly.</p>
