 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It is well-known that interferon (IFN) pathway plays a key role on virus replication and GSK3β is also reported to regulate IFN-β production. However, CVB3 has evolved mechanisms to antagonize the IFN response by directly cleaving MDA5 and MAVS. We also explored the effect of LiCl on IFN production upon CVB3 infection and found that the expression of IFN was not altered by CVB3 infection in HeLa cells and LiCl treatment also did not influence the IFN expression. Besides, we also checked type-I interferon responses in mouse peritoneal macrophages after CVB3 stimulation. We found that IFN-β production was induced by CVB3 and inhibited after LiCl treatment, which cannot explain LiCl's antiviral effect on CVB3 infection. Moreover, it seems that IFN-β inhibition induced by LiCl in immune cells also apply to other virus or stimuli. We found similar result in Sendai virus (SeV) infected peritoneal macrophages (data not shown). Wang et al. also reported similar phenotype. They found that, in macrophages, LiCl attenuated IFN-β production and IFN regulatory factor 3 activation induced by LPS-, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid-, and SeV, but this is in a glycogen synthase kinase-3β-independent manner [
