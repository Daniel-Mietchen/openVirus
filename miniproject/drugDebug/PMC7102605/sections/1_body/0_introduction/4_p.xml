<p id="p0035">Therefore, we studied the antiviral effects of LiCl in HeLa cells and in CVB3-infected mouse. The results indicate that LiCl acts as a potential antiviral agent to significantly inhibit CVB3 replication through decreasing virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment could markedly suppress the cardiac virus replication and alleviate the progress of myocarditis in mice, which might expand LiCl's new application in virus-induced inflammatory diseases.</p>
