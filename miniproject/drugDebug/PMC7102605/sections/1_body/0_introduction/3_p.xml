<p id="p0030">Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied as a psychotropic anti-depressant agent in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders since its approval by the FDA in 1949 [
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Cumulative evidence suggests that LiCl participates in many cellular processes, such as cell gene expression, apoptosis, proliferation, oncogenesis, glycogen synthesis and inflammation. So LiCl has been explored for treating diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and ovarian cancer, as well as antimicrobial infection [
 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Prior investigations have also revealed that LiCl exhibits antiviral effects on certain viruses, e.g., coronavirus, herpes simplex, infectious bronchitis virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) and feline calicivirus [

Given that there are few reports about the influence of LiCl on the enteroviruses infections and it's rarely studied to evaluate the antiviral potential of LiCl in viral infection models based on animals, it's of high significance to examine the effect of LiCl on CVB3 infections and virus-induced viral myocarditis in mice.
