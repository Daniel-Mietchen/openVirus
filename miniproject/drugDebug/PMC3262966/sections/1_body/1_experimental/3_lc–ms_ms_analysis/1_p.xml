 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. ‘LC 1’ consisted of an Acquity vacuum degasser, autosampler and binary solvent pump (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). ‘LC 2’ consisted of a Separations (Hendrik-Ido-Ambacht, the Netherlands) vacuum degasser, mixing chamber and two type K-1001 HPLC pumps. ‘V1’ and ‘V2’ are 6-way valves (Separations), which are operated by ‘LC 1’. ‘MS’ is a mass spectrometer Quattro Premier XE (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). ‘Column1’ is a Waters Symmetry C
 <sub>18</sub> (3.0 × 150 mm, 5 μm) analytical column and ‘column 2’ is a Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham MA, USA) Hypercarb (3.0 × 100 mm, 5 μm) analytical column.
