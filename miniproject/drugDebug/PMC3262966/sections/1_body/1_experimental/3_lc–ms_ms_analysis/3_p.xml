<p>During phase 1, running from the initial time until 6 min, both columns are placed in series. At the start of phase 2 (6.0 min) ‘V2’ is switched and the mobile phase of ‘LC 1’ runs solely through the Symmetry C
 <sub>18</sub> column and is diverted to waste, whereas the mobile phase of ‘LC 2’ runs through the Hypercarb column and enters the MS. At the start of phase 3 (10.0 min) ‘V1’ is switched and the mobile phase of ‘LC 1’ runs solely through the Symmetry C
 <sub>18</sub> column and enters the MS, whereas the mobile phase running through the Hypercarb column is diverted to waste.
