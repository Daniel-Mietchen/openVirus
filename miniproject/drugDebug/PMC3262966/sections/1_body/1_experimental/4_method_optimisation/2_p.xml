<p>As an alternative to the column-switch set-up, different single analytical columns were tested. zic-HILIC (Sequant, Ume√•, Sweden) was tested in combination with gradient elution using ammonium formate in water and ACN or MeOH as the mobile phase, at a pH ranging from 3 to 10. Reversed-phase (RP) C
 <sub>18</sub> was tested in combination with gradient elution using water and ACN or MeOH as the mobile phase, at a pH ranging from 3 to 11. Hypercarb was tested in combination with gradient elution using water and ACN, MeOH or tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase. For each chromatographic condition, the matrix effects were evaluated on the basis of spiked poultry muscle samples using only a methanolic extraction in combination with evaporation of the extraction solvent and redissolution in a suitable solvent. We aimed for a chromatographic system that results in sufficient retention for all compounds and adequate separation of the antiviral drugs from the matrix constituents to minimize matrix effects.
