<p>Within the EU no regulations for the use of antiviral drugs in food production are established. Within the USA, the FDA prohibited extra-label use of antiviral drugs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Therefore, confirmation of the identity of antiviral drugs should be carried out at levels as low as reasonably possible. Therefore, the decision limit (CCα) was calculated on the basis of zero tolerance in accordance with 2002/657/EC [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] to assign samples that contain antiviral drugs and thus deviate from the blank population (α-error is 1%). CCα was calculated on the basis of the bandwidth of the signal in blank samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) in the time window in which the analyte is expected. CCβ is the detection capability and expresses the concentration of the antiviral drugs in a poultry muscle at which the sample will be found non-compliant (β-error is 5%). CCβ was determined on the basis of the bandwidth of the signal in blank samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) and the bandwidth of the signal in the samples spiked at 10 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (zanamivir and ribavirin, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) or 5 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (other antiviral drugs, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) in the time window in which the analyte is expected. The individual blank and spiked samples were analysed on three different occasions and calculations were carried out as suggested by Antignac et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], but without a normalisation based on the signal of the internal standards.
