<p>HPLC grade methanol (MeOH) and acetonitrile (ACN) were obtained from Biosolve (Valkenswaard, the Netherlands). Formic acid (FA) and ammonia (25% solution in water) were obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Milli-Q water was prepared using a Milli-Q system at a resistivity of at least 18.2 MΩ cm
 <sup>−1</sup> (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Rimantadine HCl (99% purity) and amantadine HCl (100% purity) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) and arbidol (99.3% purity) from Amplachem (Carmel, IN, USA). Zanamivir (100% purity), ribavirin (99.5% purity), oseltamivir phosphate (98% purity) and oseltamivir carboxylate (98% purity), and the internal standards zanamivir-

 <sup>−1</sup> in MeOH. Stock solutions of zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir carboxylate and their isotopically labelled internal standards were prepared at 100 mg L
 <sup>−1</sup> in water. All dilutions of the stock solutions were prepared fresh daily in Milli-Q water.
