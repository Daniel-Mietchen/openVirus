<p>The robustness of the method became clear during the optimisation of the sample preparation, chromatographic conditions and MS parameters. Additionally, some minor changes to the method were tested in duplicate: (1) extraction for 30 min instead of 15, (2) dry the PBA cartridges by applying vacuum for 1 min after applying the extract and after washing the cartridge and (3) evaporation of the solvent at 55 °C instead of 50 °C. The trueness and repeatability of the results were compared to the characteristics of the regular method.</p>
