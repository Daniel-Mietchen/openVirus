<p>On three different days a matrix-matched calibration line was prepared including the following calibration levels: 0, 2.5, 5, 10, 15 and 20 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> (six data points including zero) by adding solutions of the antiviral drugs to blank poultry muscle samples. Calibration lines were constructed by plotting the peak areas normalized by the peak areas of the internal standards, versus the added concentration and carrying out least-squares linear regression. The linearity was considered acceptable if the coefficient of correlation was at least 0.990.
