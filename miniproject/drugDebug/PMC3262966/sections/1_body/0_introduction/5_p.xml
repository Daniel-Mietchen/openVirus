<p>This paper presents a tandem solid-phase extraction clean-up in combination with a column-switch liquid chromatography (LC) system for the quantitative confirmatory analysis of a broad range of antiviral drugs in poultry muscle. The necessity of using tandem SPE and two analytical columns to adequately remove matrix effects and thus to enable quantitative analysis of the antiviral drugs is demonstrated. The method was fully validated for zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol. This is the first time a quantitative confirmatory method for the analysis of a broad range of antiviral compounds is presented.</p>
