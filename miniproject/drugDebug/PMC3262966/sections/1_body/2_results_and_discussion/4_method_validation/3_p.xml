<p>For oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine, rimantadine and arbidol the calculated decision limits (CCα) vary from 0.1 to 0.6 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> indicating that for these antiviral drugs very low levels are still detectable. The calculated detection capabilities (CCβ) of these compounds are between 0.5 and 2.5 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> and samples spiked at 5 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> were found to be non-compliant based upon the ion ratio criteria [

 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively, indicating that for these drugs relevant levels are still detectable. The calculated detection capabilities (CCβ) of zanamivir and ribavirin are 15 and 9 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, respectively. Even though the calculated CCβ for zanamivir exceeds 10 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>, samples spiked at 10 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> with zanamivir and ribavirin were found to be non-compliant based upon the ion ratio criteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] in 100% of the cases (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21) indicating that the calculated CCβ for at least zanamivir is slightly overestimated and that the method is suitable for confirmatory analysis of zanamivir and ribavirin at relevant levels as well.
