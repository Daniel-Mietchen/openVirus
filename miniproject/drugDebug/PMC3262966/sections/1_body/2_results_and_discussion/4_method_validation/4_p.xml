<p>From the theoretical study hydroxyflunixin, ADD and THG were found to have the same molecular mass as one of the antiviral drugs and might theoretically interfere in the described method. Standard solutions of 100 μg L
 <sup>−1</sup> of these compounds were prepared and injected into the column-switch LC–MS/MS system. No interfering signals were observed in these chromatograms and, furthermore, no significant interferences were detected in the blank samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 21); therefore, the procedure is considered sufficiently selective for the antiviral drugs.
