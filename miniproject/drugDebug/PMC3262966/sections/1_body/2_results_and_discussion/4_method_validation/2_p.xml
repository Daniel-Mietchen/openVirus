<p>For zanamivir, ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, amantadine and rimantadine the linearity in the range of 0–20 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> is above the criterion of 0.990; the trueness is between 95 and 108% for all antiviral drugs which is well within the established criterion of 80–110%; the determined maximum RSD
 <sub>r</sub> and RSD
 <sub>RL</sub> are 14.3% and 15.2%, respectively, and thus below the criteria of 14.7% and 22%, respectively; therefore, the validation results comply with the established criteria. It is concluded that the presented method is adequate for quantitative trace analysis of these six antiviral drugs. For arbidol, inadequate linearity, trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility are observed. On two validation days, the calibration lines are adequate, but on 1 day the linearity is insufficient due to two deviating calibration points. The poor trueness, repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility of arbidol are caused by 10 out of 63 spiked samples showing a quantitative result that is 1.5–3.5 times higher than expected. This is likely to be caused by a difference in matrix interference, which plays a major role for arbidol (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>). This effect might be overcome if a suitable internal standard for arbidol becomes available. However, the presented method is suitable for the qualitative analysis of arbidol.
