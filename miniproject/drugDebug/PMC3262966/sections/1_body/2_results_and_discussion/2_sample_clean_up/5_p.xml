<p>From the comparison of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> with Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, it is concluded that the developed sample clean-up procedure strongly contributes to the decrease of the matrix effect for all compounds. The most striking is the decrease in the suppression for zanamivir from 85% to 29%. After the sample clean-up procedure, for arbidol, signal enhancement (approximately 400%) is observed instead of signal suppression. From Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref> it is concluded that applying the developed sample clean-up procedure in combination with RP chromatography only is adequate for the analysis of ribavirin, oseltamivir, oseltamivir carboxylate, rimantadine, amantadine and arbidol, but the matrix effect for zanamivir is still very pronounced and as a result 50 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> of zanamivir in poultry muscle is not detectable using solely RP chromatography. Only when using the combination of the tandem SPE sample clean-up procedure and the column-switch LC–MS/MS system, the matrix effects are sufficiently decreased, enabling detection and identification of all antiviral drugs included at relevant levels. SRM chromatograms of a blank poultry muscle sample spiked at 10 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> with zanamivir and ribavirin are presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and those of a blank poultry muscle spiked at 2.5 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> with the other antiviral drugs are presented in Fig.
