<p>When using Hypercarb as the stationary phase, all antiviral drugs, including the most polar compounds zanamivir and ribavirin obtained retention (retention factor of 3.0 and 4.6 respectively). The matrix suppression for zanamivir decreased from 100% using zic-HILIC or C
 <sub>18</sub> to 97% (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) resulting in the detection of zanamivir in poultry muscle at a concentration of 50 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup>. For ribavirin, instead of signal suppression, signal enhancement was observed (signal MMRS/signal standard 255%). The main disadvantage of the use of a Hypercarb column is that arbidol, the most non-polar compound studied, does not elute from the column. It contains a free phenyl group, which strongly interacts with the column material, preventing its elution even when using tetrahydrofuran as the mobile phase.
