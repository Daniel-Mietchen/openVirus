<p>To be able to analyse the antiviral drugs within one run, a column-switch system combining a C
 <sub>18</sub> column with a Hypercarb column was developed. A schematic of the LC procedure is given in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b</xref>. Zanamivir and ribavirin are not or hardly retained by the C
 <sub>18</sub> column, elute from it within 5 min and are subsequently retained on the Hypercarb column. After that, on the Hypercarb column, zanamivir and ribavirin are separated from the matrix constituents using a gradient and are directly detected by MS. In the meantime the other antiviral compounds are retained on the C
 <sub>18</sub> column. After elution of zanamivir and ribavirin from the Hypercarb column, the other antiviral drugs are eluted from the C
 <sub>18</sub> column by increasing the organic content of the mobile phase, passing by the Hypercarb column and entering the MS directly. The total run time, including equilibration of both columns, is 20 min. As presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>, the matrix effects using the column-switch LC system are tremendously improved for zanamivir.
