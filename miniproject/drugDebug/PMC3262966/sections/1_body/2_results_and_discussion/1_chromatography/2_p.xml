<p>Using RP chromatography applying C
 <sub>18</sub> columns, zanamivir eluted at the dead time of the system and only slight retention was obtained for ribavirin (retention factor of 0.4). Although the matrix effects significantly decreased for ribavirin, zanamivir was completely suppressed by matrix constituents (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>) and was therefore not detectable, even at a concentration of 50 μg kg
 <sup>−1</sup> in poultry muscle.
