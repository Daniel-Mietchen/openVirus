 <caption> Effect of porcine β-defensin 2 (PBD-2) on PK-15 cells. a Cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells. PK-15 cells were incubated with different concentrations of PBD-2 for 16 h (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μg/mL). The cytotoxicity was measured by CCK-8 assay ( n = 8); b Pseudorabies virus (PRV) was pre-incubated with PBD-2 of different concentrations and used to inoculate cells, the PRV copies were measured 2 days after infection ( n = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. * P&lt;0.05, ** P&lt;0.01, ns = no significance, unpaired one tailed Student′s  t-test </caption>
