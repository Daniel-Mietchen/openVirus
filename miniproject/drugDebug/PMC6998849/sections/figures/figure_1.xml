  <p>Effect of porcine β-defensin 2 (PBD-2) on PK-15 cells. 
   <bold>a</bold> Cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells. PK-15 cells were incubated with different concentrations of PBD-2 for 16 h (5, 10, 20, 40, 80 μg/mL). The cytotoxicity was measured by CCK-8 assay (
   <italic>n</italic> = 8); 
   <bold>b</bold> Pseudorabies virus (PRV) was pre-incubated with PBD-2 of different concentrations and used to inoculate cells, the PRV copies were measured 2 days after infection (
   <italic>n</italic> = 5). Data are presented as mean ± SD from three independent experiments. *
