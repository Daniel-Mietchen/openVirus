<p id="Par21">On the basis of amino acid sequence alignment and molecular biological analyses, PRV resembles other alphaherpesviruses within the family

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The antiviral abilities of defensins against alphaherpesviruses have been described previously. Some α-defensins with antiviral ability against herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection were characterized, such as human neutrophil peptide (HNP) 1–4, human α-defensin (HD) 5 and 6, rabbit α-defensin NP-1 and NP-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In terms of β-defensins, human β-defensin (HBD) 3 and a synthetic β-defensin analog constituted by domains of HBD-1 and HBD-3 have been confirmed to inactivate HSV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Bovine neutrophil β-defensin 3 has been found to show inhibitory activity against bovine herpes virus 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Besides, HBD-2 has been reported to inhibit varicella zoster virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Retrocyclins 1 and 2 and rhesus θ defensin 3 belonging to θ-defensins have been found to suppress HSV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, the utilization of defensins as drugs or target genes for generation of disease-resistant animals may be useful to control virus infection.
