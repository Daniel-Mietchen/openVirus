<p id="Par28">Both TG and WT mice intraperitoneally injected with 0.2 mL of PRV (2 × 10
 <sup>3.3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) were sacrificed on day 5 post-infection and brain, spleen, liver and lung were harvested for further analyses. DNA from 30 mg of brain, liver and lung tissues each was extracted using E.Z.N.A Tissue DNA kit (Omega Bio-tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PRV copies in the total DNA of tissue samples were measured by RT-qPCR and calculated as described above.
