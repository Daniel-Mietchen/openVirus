<p id="Par24">PK-15 cells were used to propagate PRV. Briefly, 100 μL of virus stock was added to PK-15 cells which reached 70% confluence on a T75 cell culture flask for 1 h at 37 °C. After removal of virus inoculum, 15 mL of maintenance medium was added. When 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) was present, cells were harvested and repeatedly freeze-thawed before centrifugation. PRV was obtained in the supernatant and titration of PRV was measured and calculated using the Reed-Muench method in accordance with protocols described previously [
