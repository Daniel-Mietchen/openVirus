<p id="Par33">The PRV genomic copy numbers were quantified in brain, liver and lung tissues of TG and WT mice infected with PRV by RT-qPCR. PRV viral loads in brain tissues of TG mice and WT mice were higher than those in liver and lung tissues. However, PRV viral loads in brain (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001), liver (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001) and lung (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .05) of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Hence, PBD-2 could significantly depress viral loads of PRV in different tissues.
