<p id="Par37">On the other hand, PBD-2 may be used as drug additives or vaccine adjuvants to develop alternative strategies to control PRV and other viruses. Attempts at using β-defensins to control viral diseases in vivo have been carried out. Expression of zebrafish β-defensin 2 in fishes improved their resistance to spring viraemia of carp virus infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. In addition, mice intranasally or intratracheally inoculated with P9, a derivative of mouse β-defensin 4, were protected from infections of three types of influenza A viruses and SARS-associated coronavirus [
