 <caption> Evaluation of GA, an HSP90 inhibitor. ( A) Dose-response analysis. Percentage of single, infected (green, GFP-positive ) cells was determined as a function of GA concentration. ( B to F) Distributions for each parameter in the presence of 25 or 100 nM GA were compared with that in the absence of drug using a t test. ** P &lt; 0.005. Numerical values for experimental parameters and statistical analysis are provided in table S3. The parameters presented in the panels are as follows: (B) maximum, (C) slope, (D) infection time, (E) start point, and (F) midpoint. </caption>
