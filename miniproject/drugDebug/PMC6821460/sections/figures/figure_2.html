 <caption> Evaluation of rupintrivir, a PV 3C protease inhibitor. ( A) Dose-response analysis. Percentage of single, infected (green, GFP-positive ) cells was determined as a function of rupintrivir concentration. ( B to F) Distributions for each parameter in the presence of 10 or 20 nM rupintrivir were compared with that in the absence of drug using a t test. A * P &lt; 0.05 and ** P &lt; 0.005. Numerical values for experimental parameters and statistical analysis are provided in table S2. The parameters presented in the panels are as follows: (B) maximum, (C) slope, (D) infection time, (E) start point, and (F) midpoint. hpi, hours postinfection; a.u., arbitrary units. </caption>
