 <caption> Mechanistic classes of antiviral agents distinguished by PCA of single-cell data. ( A) Points representing groups of single cells are colored according to compound identities with each point representing a different drug treatment concentration. PCA was performed using the mean values of the maximum, slope, infection time, start point, and midpoint from the various drug treatment concentrations and control groups. The top two principal components accounted for 94% of the total variance. The light blue lines indicate the relationship between variables in the space of the first two components. ( B) The pair of scores for principle components 1 and 2 for the drug combination experiment shown in Fig. 4 was plotted in the PCA space from (A). The expected vector for additive behavior of the combination is indicated. This analysis reveals the synergistic behavior of the combination of 2â€²- C-Me-A and GA. </caption>
