 <caption> Addition of cell-trapping microstructures to wells of a microfluidic device enhances single-cell occupancy. ( A) Schematic of the device. The following layers exist: microwell (not shown explicitly), channel (green), and valve (cyan). The device is divided into five sections of 1140 microwells (different shades of green for the channel layer) for a total of 5700 microwells. ( B) Schematic of two wells of the device with all relevant dimensions indicated. The microwell layer creates a physical barrier between adjacent wells. The barrier between adjacent wells is sealed with water emanating from the valve layer. Water in the valve layer is sealed by application of air under pressure (20 to 30 psi). ( C) Simulation of the flow velocity field in a microwell indicated that the outlet would maximize cell trapping by the microstructure. ( D) Image showing cells captured by the microstructures in the microwells. The device was infused with cells (5 × 10 5 cells/ml) at a rate of 0.5 μl/min. Under optimal conditions, 86.1% (4908) microwells of the device contained single cells. </caption>
