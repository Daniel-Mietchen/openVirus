 <caption> Evaluation of an antiviral drug combination: 2′- C-Me-A and GA. ( A) Combination of 2′- C-Me-A and GA is not synergistic based on the fraction of established infections. Percentage of single, infected (green, GFP-positive) cells was determined in the presence of 50 μM 2′- C-Me-A, 25 nM GA, or the combination of the two drugs. ( B to F) Distributions for each parameter in the presence of the combination were compared with that in the presence of GA alone using a t test. Numerical values for experimental parameters and statistical analysis are provided in table S4. The parameters presented in the panels are as follows: (B) maximum, (C) slope, (D) infection time, (E) start point, and (F) midpoint. * P &lt; 0.05; ** P &lt; 0.005. </caption>
