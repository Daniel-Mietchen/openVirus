 </xref>). As a result, substantial between-cell variation exists in all quantifiable parameters of infection. An underappreciated consequence of the behavior of systems such as these is the non–self-averaging nature of these systems, which means that the population average of any single-cell parameter will almost certainly fail to represent the dynamics within any single cell (

 </xref>). The practical complication arising from this phenomenon is that changes in the average kinetics observed in a growth curve for a virus caused by a perturbation, e.g., exposure to an antiviral therapeutic, will not inform accurately the step(s) of the viral lifecycle affected most by the perturbation.
