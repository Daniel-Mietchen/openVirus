<p>Over the past few decades, the world has witnessed outbreaks of myriad RNA viruses, including West Nile virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Chikungunya virus, Ebola virus, Zika virus, and, most recently, the poliovirus (PV)–related viruses: enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) and enterovirus A71 (EV-A71) (

Because sporadic outbreaks come, go, and may never come again, development of broad-spectrum therapeutics exhibiting high barriers to resistance would have the greatest value. Unbiased screening of chemical libraries for antiviral agents using cell-based assays has no problem identifying active compounds of high potency. However, identifying the target and predicting the likelihood for evolution of resistance generally take years of effort following compound discovery.
