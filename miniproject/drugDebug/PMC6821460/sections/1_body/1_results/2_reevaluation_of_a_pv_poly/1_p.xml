<p>Viral polymerases represent a well-established target of antiviral therapeutics. For example, cocktails used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection include synthetic nucleoside analogs targeting reverse transcriptase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively (

 <sub>50</sub>)]. To our surprise, we observed selective ablation of cells infected with virus variants capable of the fastest rates of replication and the highest yields of replicated RNA (
