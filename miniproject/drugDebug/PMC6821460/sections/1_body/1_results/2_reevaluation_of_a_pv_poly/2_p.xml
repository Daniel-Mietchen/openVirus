<p>For all experiments reported herein, we pretreat HeLa S3 cells with drug for 1 hour, infect cells off chip with PV engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (PV-eGFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell, pellet and wash cells to remove free virus, suspend cells to a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/ml in drug-containing medium, and load the microfluidic device. Each well is monitored for eGFP fluorescence every 30 min for a 24-hour period, which gives rise to a population of time courses exhibiting substantial between-cell variability (fig. S2A). We plot the percentage of infected (green, GFP-positive) cells as a function of drug concentration and fit to a hyperbola to obtain a value for the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value. In the case of 2′-

 </xref>); therefore, these data do not fit to a hyperbola (fig. S2B). It is clear from this experiment, however, that the approach is sensitive enough to acquire data for a complete dose-response analysis (fig. S2B).
