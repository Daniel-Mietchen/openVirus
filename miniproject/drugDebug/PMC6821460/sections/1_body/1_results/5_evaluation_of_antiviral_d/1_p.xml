<p>The long-term use of an antiviral therapy is determined, in part, by the time required for resistance mutants to emerge. One approach to delaying or even eliminating the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is the use of antiviral combinations (

  <italic>30</italic>
 </xref>, 
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>31</italic>
 </xref>). What is often evaluated is the ability of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A to synergize with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>). In the absence of drug, 34 ± 3% of cells in the device were infected. That number was reduced to 18 ± 2, 30 ± 3, or 15 ± 3% in the presence of 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, respectively. On the basis of this observation alone, the conclusion would be that this combination of antiviral agents is not even additive. Analysis of the entire single-cell dataset is presented in table S4. Because 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A exhibits the most substantial antiviral effect relative to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, here we compare the combination to 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A alone. We observed a statistically significant difference for all parameters (
 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B to F</xref>). Single-cell analysis therefore has the ability to reveal efficacy of drug combinations masked at the population level. We performed the comparable experiment with GS and reached the same conclusion (fig. S5 and table S4).
