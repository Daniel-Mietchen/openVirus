<p>To address this problem, we created a multilayer device as previously described (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (
 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>7</italic>
 </xref>) but added a trapping structure to the channel layer of the device (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and fig. S1A). The position of the trapping structure was guided by simulation (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), leading to placement of the trapping structure on the rear wall of each well (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The device contains five independent zones, each containing 1140 wells for a total of 5700 wells. The device mounts easily to the stage of a microscope (fig. S1B); the device in the cross section is shown in fig. S1C. Single-cell occupancy of the device was sensitive to the width of the channels used for loading (fig. S1D) and cell density (fig. S1E) with maximum occupancy near 90% (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S1). Under conditions in which an inhibitor reduces infection to 10%, ~100 infected cells will be observed using this device. This number of events is more than enough for statistical analysis.
