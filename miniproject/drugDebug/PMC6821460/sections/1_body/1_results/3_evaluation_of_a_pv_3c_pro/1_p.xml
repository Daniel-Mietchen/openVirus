<p>The observation that a subset of the viral population was most sensitive to 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-A was unexpected but could be easily rationalized by the notion that increased replication efficiency should correlate to increased 2′-
 <italic>C</italic>-Me-AMP incorporation efficiency. Do inhibitors of other viral enzymes exhibit the same selectivity? Proteases of retroviruses and positive-sense RNA viruses responsible for polyprotein processing represent a second category of well-established antiviral therapeutics used in the cocktails to treat HIV and HCV, respectively (
