Unfortunately, viral emergence has outpaced the discovery and development of compounds capable of treating these pathogens. Because sporadic outbreaks come, go, and may never come again, development of broad-spectrum therapeutics exhibiting high barriers to resistance would have the greatest value. Unbiased screening of chemical libraries for antiviral agents using cell-based assays has no problem identifying active compounds of high potency. However, identifying the target and predicting the likelihood for evolution of resistance generally take years of effort following compound discovery.</p><p>As a part of a study evaluating PV infection dynamics on the single-cell level, we observed that a chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotide selectively eliminates the most-fit members of the viral population (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). This class of antiviral agent has always been touted as having a high barrier to resistance (<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr"><italic>8</italic></xref>). The typical explanation for this high barrier is that amino acid substitutions in the active site of the viral RNA polymerase conferring resistance to the antiviral ribonucleoside also impair the specificity and/or efficiency of incorporation of natural ribonucleotides (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr"><italic>9</italic></xref>). Elimination of the most-fit members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerges from the surviving, low-fitness members of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr"><italic>10</italic></xref>). Restoration of fitness may be the insurmountable barrier precluding the development of resistance to chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotides.</p><p>This study was designed to determine the extent to which single-cell analysis of antiviral agents can contribute to our understanding of antiviral therapeutics relative to traditional approaches. We describe a microfluidics device that can be used to produce complete dose-response curves. We have used this device to compare three mechanistically distinct classes of antiviral agents: a PV polymerase inhibitor [2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-methyl-adenosine (2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A)], a PV protease inhibitor (rupintrivir), and two heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors [geldanamycin (GA) and ganetespib (GS)]. We find that single-cell analysis distinguishes these classes of inhibitors. We suggest that addition of single-cell analysis to the existing paradigm for preclinical development of antiviral therapies may have the potential to identify leads with limited potential for development of resistance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" disp-level="1"><title>RESULTS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>A device for single-cell analysis of the activity of antiviral agents</title><p>Our initial foray into single-cell analysis of PV infection dynamics used cell density to control single-cell occupancy of wells of a microfluidic device (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). What this means practically is that most wells are empty. Reducing the number of events monitored by a mere factor of two takes us below the number of events required for statistical analysis of the data. Acquisition of a dose-response curve was therefore impossible using this first-generation device.</p><p>To address this problem, we created a multilayer device as previously described (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>) but added a trapping structure to the channel layer of the device (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref> and fig. S1A). The position of the trapping structure was guided by simulation (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>), leading to placement of the trapping structure on the rear wall of each well (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>). The device contains five independent zones, each containing 1140 wells for a total of 5700 wells. The device mounts easily to the stage of a microscope (fig. S1B); the device in the cross section is shown in fig. S1C. Single-cell occupancy of the device was sensitive to the width of the channels used for loading (fig. S1D) and cell density (fig. S1E) with maximum occupancy near 90% (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref> and fig. S1). Under conditions in which an inhibitor reduces infection to 10%, ~100 infected cells will be observed using this device. This number of events is more than enough for statistical analysis.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Addition of cell-trapping microstructures to wells of a microfluidic device enhances single-cell occupancy.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the device. The following layers exist: microwell (not shown explicitly), channel (green), and valve (cyan).

For example, cocktails used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infection and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection include synthetic nucleoside analogs targeting reverse transcriptase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), respectively (<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr"><italic>11</italic></xref>, <italic>12</italic>). The nonobligate, chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleoside 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A is the prototype for the HCV RdRp inhibitor, sofosbuvir, and related compounds (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr"><italic>13</italic></xref>). In a previous study, we evaluated infections that survived treatment when present at a concentration that reduces the number of infections by 50% [median inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>)]. To our surprise, we observed selective ablation of cells infected with virus variants capable of the fastest rates of replication and the highest yields of replicated RNA (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). This experiment suffered from the inability to evaluate concentrations of drug higher than the value of the IC<sub>50</sub>. Here, we use 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A to validate the new device.</p><p>For all experiments reported herein, we pretreat HeLa S3 cells with drug for 1 hour, infect cells off chip with PV engineered to express enhanced green fluorescent protein (PV-eGFP) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell, pellet and wash cells to remove free virus, suspend cells to a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/ml in drug-containing medium, and load the microfluidic device. Each well is monitored for eGFP fluorescence every 30 min for a 24-hour period, which gives rise to a population of time courses exhibiting substantial between-cell variability (fig. S2A). We plot the percentage of infected (green, GFP-positive) cells as a function of drug concentration and fit to a hyperbola to obtain a value for the IC<sub>50</sub> value. In the case of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A, concentrations greater than 50 &#x003bc;M exhibit toxicity (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr"><italic>14</italic></xref>); therefore, these data do not fit to a hyperbola (fig. S2B). It is clear from this experiment, however, that the approach is sensitive enough to acquire data for a complete dose-response analysis (fig. S2B).</p><p>A major advantage of the single-cell platform is that the effect of a drug on the viable population can be determined. To analyze the single-cell data, we use five phenomenological parameters extracted from each time course (fig. S2C). These parameters are maximum fluorescence observed, which correlates to yield of genomic RNA; slope at the time of half-maximum fluorescence, which correlates to replication speed; infection time, which, to a first approximation, is the time it takes for an infection to go from start to finish akin to the virus generation time; start point, which is the earliest time in which fluorescence can be detected; and midpoint, the time of half-maximum fluorescence. This analysis leads to a collection of data points for each parameter value measured in each cell. Instead of displaying the primary data in a scatter plot (fig. S2, D and E), we display and analyze the curve derived from the first derivative of the cumulative distribution function from the raw data (fig. S2E). Our statistical analysis uses an unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test to determine if a significant difference exists for the means of a given parameter under two experimental conditions. In these experiments, the area under the curve defining each distribution has been normalized to one for ease of comparison. We do not attempt to interpret a difference in the &#x0201c;fine&#x0201d; structure of the distributions.</p><p>Using this data analysis pipeline to evaluate outcomes in the absence and presence of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A (50 &#x003bc;M), we observed a statistically significant difference in the mean values for the maximum (fig. S2F) and slope (fig. S2G) parameters without a statistically significant change in the mean values for the remaining parameters (fig. S2, H to J). Tabulation of the data and statistical analysis for this experiment are provided in table S1. These observations reproduce outcomes presented by us previously using the first-generation device (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). The mean values for maximum and slope parameters were reduced substantially in the presence of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A. The observed between-cell variability in response to 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A treatment can be attributed to multiple factors, including speed and/or fidelity of the viral polymerase, the capacity for the nucleoside to be converted to the nucleoside triphosphate (NTP), among other possibilities.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evaluation of a PV 3C protease inhibitor</title><p>The observation that a subset of the viral population was most sensitive to 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A was unexpected but could be easily rationalized by the notion that increased replication efficiency should correlate to increased 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-AMP incorporation efficiency. Do inhibitors of other viral enzymes exhibit the same selectivity? Proteases of retroviruses and positive-sense RNA viruses responsible for polyprotein processing represent a second category of well-established antiviral therapeutics used in the cocktails to treat HIV and HCV, respectively (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr"><italic>15</italic></xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr"><italic>17</italic></xref>). Inhibitors of the picornaviral protease responsible for polyprotein processing (3C) have been pursued for many years (<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr"><italic>18</italic></xref>). For this study, we selected rupintrivir, which targets the 3C protease activity of all three types of PVs as well as that of other EVs (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr"><italic>20</italic></xref>).</p><p>We measured the impact of rupintrivir on the establishment of PV infection in HeLa S3 cells (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> value was 8.0 &#x000b1; 4.0 nM, which agrees with values (5 to 40 nM) measured using conventional plaque assays (<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr"><italic>19</italic></xref>). We analyzed the single-cell data obtained at all concentrations (table S2) but focused only on the concentrations approximating the IC<sub>50</sub> and 2 &#x000d7; IC<sub>50</sub>, 10 and 20 nM, respectively, to emphasize trends in the data. At both concentrations, we observed a statistically significant difference compared with the control for all parameters: maximum (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), slope (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2C</xref>), infection time (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2D</xref>), start point (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2E</xref>), and midpoint (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2F</xref>). This outcome with rupintrivir is distinct from that above with 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A. We conclude that not all antiviral agents interfere with the viral population in the same manner or at the same stage(s) of the lifecycle reflected by the parameters determined by monitoring the kinetics of fluorescence produced by GFP reporter virus.</p><fig id="F2" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Evaluation of rupintrivir, a PV 3C protease inhibitor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dose-response analysis.

Chaperones of the HSP90 family are required when the cell is growing fast and/or producing high levels of proteins, as observed in cancer cells or in virus-infected cells. Seminal studies from the Frydman and Andino laboratories demonstrate a clear, essential role for HSP90 in the production of infectious PV virions (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). However, every step of the virus lifecycle has been suggested as a target for HSP90 when viruses outside of the picornavirus family are considered (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr"><italic>22</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr"><italic>24</italic></xref>). The benefit of targeting antiviral therapeutics to cellular proteins is that the likelihood for evolution of resistance is minimized (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>).</p><p>We have used GA because it is a potent inhibitor of HSP90 (nanomolar range) that is active against PV (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>).

An earlier study did not observe an impact of GA prior to virus assembly; however, it is possible that a reduction of the magnitude shown here would be concealed by experimental error (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr"><italic>23</italic></xref>). Because infection is monitored by eGFP, which requires virus entry, genome replication, and genome translation, interference with any of these steps would lead to a reduction in the number of eGFP-positive cells. It is clear, however, that translation and folding of eGFP are not altered in the presence of the highest concentration of GA used in this experiment (fig. S3).</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><title>Evaluation of GA, an HSP90 inhibitor.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dose-response analysis.

The mean of the distribution of values for the maximum parameter did not change in the presence of GA (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>), in contrast to the inhibitors targeting viral proteins. Observation of a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the values for the infection time parameter was concentration dependent (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). A statistically significant difference for the mean of the distributions for the remaining parameters was observed at concentrations corresponding to the IC<sub>50</sub> and above (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, C, E, and F</xref>). A third signature of antiviral action is therefore revealed with GA.</p><p>Given the interest in using HSP90 inhibitors as therapeutics for cancer, a variety of compounds exist (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr"><italic>25</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr"><italic>26</italic></xref>). For example, GS is an HSP90 inhibitor that differs from GA substantially in chemical structure (compare inset in fig.

The use of GS provides an important test of the capacity of the single-cell analysis to reveal common signature for compounds with common mechanisms.</p><p>In contrast to observations with GA, GS reduced the number of infections established by 70 &#x000b1; 14%, with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 3 &#x000b1; 1 nM due to its higher affinity for HSP90 (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr"><italic>29</italic></xref>). Analysis of the single-cell data is presented in table S3. The impact of GS on the five phenomenological parameters was the same as observed for GA (fig. S4). In this case, it is clear that mechanistically identical compounds yield identical signatures at the single-cell level.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Evaluation of antiviral drug combinations</title><p>The long-term use of an antiviral therapy is determined, in part, by the time required for resistance mutants to emerge.

What is often evaluated is the ability of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A to synergize with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC<sub>50</sub> values (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A</xref>).

That number was reduced to 18 &#x000b1; 2, 30 &#x000b1; 3, or 15 &#x000b1; 3% in the presence of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, respectively. On the basis of this observation alone, the conclusion would be that this combination of antiviral agents is not even additive. Analysis of the entire single-cell dataset is presented in table S4. Because 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A exhibits the most substantial antiviral effect relative to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, here we compare the combination to 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A alone. We observed a statistically significant difference for all parameters (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B to F</xref>). Single-cell analysis therefore has the ability to reveal efficacy of drug combinations masked at the population level. We performed the comparable experiment with GS and reached the same conclusion (fig. S5 and table S4).</p><fig id="F4" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><title>Evaluation of an antiviral drug combination: 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A and GA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Combination of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A and GA is not synergistic based on the fraction of established infections.

We evaluated the antiviral drug combinations in the context of the PCA space (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). An additive combination is defined by the vector bisecting the parallelogram defined by the experiment in the absence of either drug (control) and the experiments in the presence of each drug alone (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5B</xref>). The 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A&#x02013;GA combination was synergistic, with the position indicating that the combination delays the start point and retards the infection time. We conclude that single-cell analysis of antiviral therapeutics can provide not only information on the efficacy of a drug but also information on the mechanism of action and synergy of combinations of antiviral therapeutics. This experimental paradigm should have a transformative impact on the drug development process.</p><fig id="F5" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><title>Mechanistic classes of antiviral agents distinguished by PCA of single-cell data.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Points representing groups of single cells are colored according to compound identities with each point representing a different drug treatment concentration.

Infection outcomes in cells are determined, in part, by stochastic processes (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr"><italic>36</italic></xref>). For example, the presence and abundance of viral restriction factors and viral replication promoting factors of the host are largely governed by stochastic gene expression (<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr"><italic>37</italic></xref>). As a result, substantial between-cell variation exists in all quantifiable parameters of infection. An underappreciated consequence of the behavior of systems such as these is the non&#x02013;self-averaging nature of these systems, which means that the population average of any single-cell parameter will almost certainly fail to represent the dynamics within any single cell (<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr"><italic>38</italic></xref>, <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr"><italic>39</italic></xref>). The practical complication arising from this phenomenon is that changes in the average kinetics observed in a growth curve for a virus caused by a perturbation, e.g., exposure to an antiviral therapeutic, will not inform accurately the step(s) of the viral lifecycle affected most by the perturbation.</p><p>With this perspective in mind, it is not surprising that our previous evaluation of an antiviral ribonucleotide using a single-cell approach revealed the unexpected finding that the most-fit members of the viral population were most susceptible to this class of compounds (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). This observation left one major unresolved question: Do all effective antiviral therapeutics target the same subpopulation of viruses or do unique signatures exist for distinct mechanistic classes of antiviral therapeutics? Addressing these questions is the central objective of this study.</p><p>Our first-generation microfluidic device for on-chip investigation of viral infection dynamics relied on cell density as the mechanism to achieve isolation of single cells in wells of the device, an approach which leaves most wells of the device empty (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). We have redesigned the device to add physical cell-trapping structures to each well. The outcome of which is the ability to achieve single-cell occupancy of ~90% of the ~6000 wells of the device (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> and fig. S1). The enhanced occupancy enabled the complete characterization of antiviral therapeutics by permitting the acquisition of complete dose-response curves (e.g., <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p><p>The three classes of antiviral therapeutics chosen target a viral polymerase (2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A; fig. S2), a viral protease (rupintrivir; <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), or a host factor, HSP90, [GA (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>) and GS (fig. S4)]. Our data analysis pipeline emphasizes five phenomenological parameters with correlates to traditional parameters for assessment of the viral lifecycle. The major finding of this study is that each class of antiviral therapeutics exhibited a unique signature with respect to the five phenomenological parameters measured. We used the absolute value of the difference of each parameter in the presence and absence of the antiviral agent to visualize the signature for the antiviral agent and compare one antiviral agent to another (fig. S6A). It was possible to use PCA to stratify the different therapeutic classes (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Both GA and GS overlapped by PCA despite their substantial differences in structure and efficacy (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A</xref>). Drug combinations, which failed to affect establishment of infection, exhibited synergy when single-cell parameters were monitored (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>).</p><p>As observed previously, viruses with the highest yields (maximum) and fastest rates of replication (slope) were sensitive to 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A (fig. S6B) (<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr"><italic>7</italic></xref>). An efficient polymerase is likely required to replicate fast and to the highest levels. Such a polymerase might be expected to use the antiviral nucleotide better, leading to extinction of this population of viruses. These same members of the viral population were sensitive to rupintrivir (fig. S6C). In this case, at concentrations equivalent to or lower than the IC<sub>50</sub>, binding is driven by the concentration of the protease target, which would be highest in cells replicating fastest and to the highest levels. GA only affected a subset of 2&#x02032;-<italic>C</italic>-Me-A and rupintrivir-sensitive members, those with a fast rate of replication (fig. S6D). This observation is quite interesting in that fast rates of replication in our assay mean fast rates of translation to produce GFP. Chaperones like HSP90 would be expected to be most useful under these conditions. A comparable analysis using the start point and infection time provided an even greater distinction between the three classes of antiviral agents studied herein (fig. S6, E to G). Most noteworthy was the observation that rupintrivir retarded the time it took to establish infection and to complete replication (fig. S6F). This observation may reflect the role of the protease in promoting replication by cleaving cellular antagonists of the virus lifecycle.</p><p>This study is among the first to analyze a range of antiviral therapeutics on viral infection dynamics at the single-cell level. The resolution afforded by this approach is unprecedented when compared with other cell-based approaches, which only provide a measure of efficacy. Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogs to be synthesized during the drug development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action; single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis instead of much, much later in the development process. Last, although we have used antiviral agents to demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis, use of this technology and approach will be applicable to the discovery and development of any class of therapeutics that can be assessed in cell culture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" disp-level="1"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells, viruses, and reagents</title><p>HeLa and HeLa S3 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and maintained in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium/F12 (1:1) (Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals) and penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml; Corning) in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>To generate enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)&#x02013;tagged PV used in this work, pMo-EGFP-PV-WT plasmid was linearized with Apa I and purified using the QIAEX II Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Netherlands).
