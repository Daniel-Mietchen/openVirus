<p id="P93">Boceprevir exerts anti-HCV properties by binding reversibly to the HCV nonstructural 3 protein, ultimately inhibiting viral replication. In a recently conducted phase 3 international randomized placebo-controlled trial that enrolled previously untreated black and nonblack adults with HCV genotype 1 infection (SPRINT-2 [serine protease inhibitor therapy 2] trial), the addition of boceprevir for 22 weeks or 44 weeks to standard therapy (peginterferon-Î±-2b and ribavirin) resulted in significantly higher SVR rates compared with standard therapy alone for the nonblack cohort (67% and 68% vs 40%, respectively) and the black cohort (42% and 53% vs 23%, respectively).

 </sup> The relative increases in SVR rates for the nonblack cohort were 68% and 70%, respectively, compared with the standard therapy.
