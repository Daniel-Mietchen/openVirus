 </sup> In a recent phase 3 international randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, the addition of telaprevir to the standard treatment of peginterferon-ribavirin was associated with significantly higher SVR rates compared with standard peginterferon-ribavirin alone in a cohort of 1088 patients with previously untreated HCV genotype 1 infections.

 </sup> Specifically, the group of patients who received 12 weeks of telaprevir combined with peginterferon-ribavirin, followed by peginterferon-ribavirin for 12 weeks (if HCV RNA was undetectable at weeks 4 and 12) or 36 weeks (if HCV RNA was still detectable at weeks 4 and 12), had SVR rates of 75% vs 44% with standard therapy.

 </sup> The SVR rates were also significantly higher compared with standard therapy among patients who received only 8 weeks of telaprevir combined with peginterferon-ribavirin (69% vs 44%).

 </sup> In the second randomized phase 3 trial that evaluated telaprevir in treatment-experienced patients with HCV genotype 1 infection, the addition of telaprevir to the standard treatment regimen of peginterferon-Î± and ribavirin was associated with significantly higher SVR rates compared with the standard regimen of peginterferon-ribavirin alone.
