<p id="P94">The HCV RESPOND-2 (Retreatment with HCV Serine Protease Inhibitor Boceprevir and PegIntron/Rebetol 2) trial evaluated boceprevir for the treatment of patients who had experienced a relapse or who had not achieved SVR to peginterferon-ribavirin treatment.

 </sup> In this randomized open-label trial that enrolled 403 patients, the SVR rates were significantly higher for patients who received peginterferon-ribavirin plus boceprevir treatment for 32 weeks (59%) or 44 weeks (66%) compared with standard peginterferon-ribavirin treatment alone (21%).

 </sup> In a multivariable stepwise logistic regression analysis, the baseline factors associated with SVR were boceprevir use, previous relapse (compared with previous nonresponder), low viral load at baseline, and absence of cirrhosis.
