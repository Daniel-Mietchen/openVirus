 </sup> The duration of treatment, and sometimes its dose, may be dictated by HCV genotype. Treatment for infections with HCV genotype 1, and probably with genotype 4, should generally continue for 48 weeks, whereas those with genotype 2 or 3 may be treated for 24 weeks. Treatment of HCV in patients coinfected with HIV should be for 48 weeks.
