<p id="P65">Ribavirin, a synthetic nucleoside analogue of guanine, is available in oral, aerosolized, and IV formulations. Oral ribavirin is absorbed extensively, but its bioavailability is only 65% because of first-pass metabolism. Peak plasma ribavirin concentrations occur within 1 to 2 hours after oral dose.

 </sup> Peak plasma concentrations increase over time and are 6 times higher after 4 weeks of treatment. Administration of aerosolized ribavirin leads to high concentrations in the respiratory tract, with some ribavirin absorbed systemically. Ribavirin is mainly excreted in the urine.
