 </sup> and ribavirin should not be given to patients with preexisting medical conditions exacerbated by ribavirin-induced hemolysis, including significant cardiac disease or hemoglobinopathies. Severe depression, suicidal ideation, and relapse of drug abuse may occur, and ribavirin is contraindicated in patients with a history of, or existing, psychiatric disorders. Significant teratogenic and/or embryocidal effects have been observed in animals exposed to ribavirin. Ribavirin is therefore contraindicated in pregnant women and their male partners, and it is recommended that patients use 2 forms of contraception and avoid pregnancy during therapy and for 6 months thereafter.
