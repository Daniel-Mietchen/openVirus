<p id="P60">Interferon-α-2a and -2b are approved for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (CHC); however, they are not approved for acute hepatitis C. A meta-analysis found that IFN-α for at least 12 months had the best risk-benefit ratio for patients with CHC.

 </sup> Once-weekly peginterferon-α was more effective than IFN-α given 3 times weekly in patients with CHC.

 </sup> However, combination therapy with IFN-α and oral ribavirin is more effective than either drug used alone.

 </sup> Combining oral ribavirin with peginterferon-α may be more effective than combining it with IFN-α.

 </sup> recommends once-weekly SC peginterferon-α combined with oral ribavirin as the first line of treatment of CHC. The recommended duration of treatment of CHC in patients not infected with HIV is 24 weeks (for hepatitis C virus [HCV] genotype 2 or 3) or 48 weeks (for HCV genotype 1).
