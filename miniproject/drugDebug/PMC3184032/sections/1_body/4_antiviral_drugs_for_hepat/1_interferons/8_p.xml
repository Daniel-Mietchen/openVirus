<p id="P64">Most patients receiving IFN may develop flulike symptoms, which appear to be dose-related, are more likely to occur at the start of treatment, and typically respond to acetaminophen. Among the more serious adverse effects are neuropsychiatric disorders (eg, depression and homicidal and suicidal ideation), neurologic disturbances (eg, confusion and seizures), myelosuppression (neutropenia [most commonly] and aplastic anemia [rarely]), cardiovascular disorders (eg, arrhythmias), endocrine disorders (eg, thyroid disorders), and pulmonary disorders (eg, dyspnea and pneumonitis).

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have been used successfully to treat patients with IFN-associated depression, allowing therapy to be continued,
