<p id="P57">Interferons (IFNs) are naturally occurring proteins produced in response to viral infection.

 </sup> The 3 major classes of IFNs are α, β, and γ; IFN-α and IFN-β are further classified as type I, whereas IFN-γ is type II.

 </sup> Available only in parenteral formulation, more than 80% of a subcutaneous (SC) or intramuscular dose of IFN-α is absorbed.

 </sup> After an intramuscular injection, peak IFN concentrations occur within 4 to 8 hours and return to baseline levels in 16 to 24 hours.

 </sup> Pegylation, which is the process of attachment of IFN to a large inert polyethylene glycol, markedly reduces the rate of absorption and excretion of IFN and therefore increases its plasma concentration.

 </sup> For example, after an SC dose of peginterferon α-2b, the peak serum concentration occurs in 15 to 44 hours, high concentrations are maintained for 48 to 72 hours, and the mean terminal half-life is about 40 hours.

 </sup> In contrast, the peak serum concentration of peginterferon α-2a is reached in 72 to 96 hours after an SC dose, and the mean terminal half-life is 160 hours.

 </sup> Interferon-α undergoes extensive renal catabolism, and negligible amounts of IFN are excreted in the urine.
