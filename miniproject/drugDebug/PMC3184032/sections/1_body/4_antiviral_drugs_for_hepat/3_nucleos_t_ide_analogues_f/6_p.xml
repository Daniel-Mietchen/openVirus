 </sup> Oral entecavir is extensively absorbed: peak plasma concentrations occur in 30 to 90 minutes, and oral bioavailability is almost 100%. Despite low plasma concentrations, entecavir maintains its potency by the long intracellular half-life of its active metabolite entecavir triphosphate. Entecavir is mainly excreted by glomerular filtration and active tubular secretion.
