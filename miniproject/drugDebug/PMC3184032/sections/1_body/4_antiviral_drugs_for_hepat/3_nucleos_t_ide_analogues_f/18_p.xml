<p id="P88">Tenofovir is used for the treatment of CHB. In a randomized trial comparing tenofovir and adefovir, a higher percentage of patients receiving tenofovir achieved HBV DNA level suppression. In HBeAg-positive patients, the biochemical response was higher with tenofovir; however, the anti-HBe seroconversion rates and histologic responses were similar for adefovir and tenofovir.
