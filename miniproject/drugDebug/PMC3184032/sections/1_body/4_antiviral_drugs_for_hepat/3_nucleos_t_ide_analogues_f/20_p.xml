<p id="P90">Primary tenofovir resistance mutations have not been well defined. Although viruses with rtN236T are not resistant to tenofovir, they have a slower response than do wild-type viruses. One study reported rtA194T as a tenofovir resistance mutation; however, this pattern was not confirmed in other studies.</p>
