<p id="P74">The major adverse effect of adefovir is nephrotoxicity, including proximal renal tubular dysfunction and Fanconi syndrome. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, may be observed. Adefovir resistance, characterized by the rtN236T mutation, gradually increases over time to 11%, 18%, and 29% at year 3, 4, and 5, respectively.

 </sup> To minimize the risk of resistance, adefovir is used in combination with other drugs such as lamivudine.

 </sup> However, concomitant use with the related drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is not recommended because of the augmented risk of nephrotoxicity.
