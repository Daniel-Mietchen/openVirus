 <bold>Emtricitabine.</bold> Emtricitabine is an analogue of cytidine. Although not currently approved for the treatment of CHB, emtricitabine has been used clinically in combination with tenofovir in HIV/HBVâ€“coinfected patients. Emtricitabine is very similar to lamivudine, and cross-resistance between these drugs is common. Emtricitabine may be more potent than lamivudine; however, it should not be used as monotherapy because of high rates of resistance development.
