<p id="P82">The adverse effects of lamivudine are mild and include abdominal pain, nausea, and headache. The clinical utility of lamivudine is limited by the rapid development of antiviral resistance. Lamivudine shares with the L-nucleosides the primary resistance mutation, rtM204V/I, which occurs easily and confers cross-resistance. After 4 years of lamivudine monotherapy, rtM204V/I resistance develops in up to 70% and 90% of patients with HBV monoinfection and HIV/HBV coinfection, respectively.</p>
