<p id="P87">Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a prodrug that requires diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir. Subsequent phosphorylation by cellular enzymes forms tenofovir diphosphate, which competes with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine 5â€²-triphosphate for incorporation into the viral DNA strand.</p>
