<p id="P30">Ganciclovir is approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, the treatment of herpes simplex keratitis, and CMV prophylaxis in transplant recipients. Intravenous ganciclovir may also be used to treat other forms of CMV disease, such as colitis or esophagitis. Induction therapy with IV ganciclovir for CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS has an efficacy of 85% to 95% in stabilizing disease.

 </sup> Because it is poorly absorbed, oral ganciclovir should not be used for induction treatment of CMV disease.

 </sup> Because CMV disease often recurs or progresses in patients with advanced AIDS, oral or IV ganciclovir (or valganciclovir) is given as maintenance therapy until immune reconstitution is achieved.

 </sup> Intravitreal ganciclovir may also be surgically implanted for the treatment of CMV retinitis, although this treatment should be used together with systemic therapy with IV ganciclovir or oral valganciclovir therapy.
