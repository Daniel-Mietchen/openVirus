<p id="P33">Resistance to ganciclovir occurs most commonly in severely immunocompromised patients with prolonged exposure to the drug. The most common mechanism for ganciclovir resistance is 
 <italic>UL97</italic> gene mutation
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R71">71</xref>
 </sup>; this mutation leads to deficiency in the viral kinase that is necessary for the initial phosphorylation of ganciclovir into its active form. A less common mechanism is a mutation in the 
 <italic>UL54</italic> gene, which encodes for the CMV DNA polymerase.
