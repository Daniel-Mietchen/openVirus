<p id="P27">Nephrotoxicity is the most common serious adverse effect of foscarnet, affecting 30% of patients. It is caused by deposition of foscarnet crystals in the glomerular capillary lumen.

 </sup> Foscarnet may cause myelosuppression, with anemia as the most common effect. It can chelate bivalent metal ions and may lead to reductions in ionized calcium. Other electrolyte disturbances are hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypophosphatasemia, which could manifest as paresthesias, cardiac dysrhythmias, and neurologic symptoms, including seizures.

 </sup> Patients should be hydrated to prevent nephrotoxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities should be corrected to avoid cardiac and neurologic complications.
