<p id="P38">Valacyclovir is approved for treatment of VZV. Varicella often resolves without antiviral therapy in those who are immunocompetent. However, in immunocompromised patients, such as HIV-infected patients and transplant recipients, valacyclovir may be used to treat varicella, even if it is uncomplicated.

 </sup> In a randomized double-blind trial of older immunocompetent patients, valacyclovir was as effective as acyclovir, with similar resolution rates of cutaneous zoster but accelerated resolution of herpetic pain and a lower risk of postherpetic neuralgia.

 </sup> The typical course of zoster treatment is 7 days, and the first dose should be started within 48 hours of rash onset. Treatment can be prolonged, continuing until all lesions have crusted, in immunocompromised patients.
