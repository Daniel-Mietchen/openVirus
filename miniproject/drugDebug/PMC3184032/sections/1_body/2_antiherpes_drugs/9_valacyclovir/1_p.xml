  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R75">75</xref>
 </sup> provides a higher bioavailability (55%) than oral acyclovir. After absorption, valacyclovir is hydrolyzed almost completely to acyclovir by first-pass intestinal and hepatic metabolism. It achieves peak serum concentration in 1 to 3 hours. Serum acyclovir levels are much higher with valacyclovir than with oral acyclovir.
