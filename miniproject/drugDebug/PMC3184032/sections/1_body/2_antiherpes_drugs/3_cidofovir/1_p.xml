  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">27</xref>
 </sup> It is available as an IV formulation, and an oral prodrug of cidofovir (known as 
 <italic>CMX-001</italic>) is under clinical development.

 </sup> This investigational lipid ester formulation of cidofovir has enhanced bioavailability, resulting in improved 50% inhibitory concentrations.

 </sup> Direct intraocular injection of cidofovir is contraindicated due to ocular hypotony.

 </sup> Serum cidofovir concentrations decline rapidly after IV infusion, with a half-life of 2 hours; however, the intracellular half-life of active cidofovir-diphosphate is as long as 65 hours. Cidofovir is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion; probenecid reduces its excretion by blocking tubular secretion.
