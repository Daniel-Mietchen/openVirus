<p id="P17">Cidofovir is phosphorylated by cellular kinases into cidofovir-diphosphate, a competitive substrate for viral DNA polymerase, thereby halting viral DNA synthesis.

 </sup> The major clinical indication for cidofovir is the treatment of CMV retinitis in HIV-infected patients (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>).

 </sup> Cidofovir is also used as rescue therapy for immunocompromised patients with CMV disease resistant or unresponsive to ganciclovir.

 </sup> Because activation of cidofovir does not rely on viral kinases, it retains activity against CMV with the UL97 mutation and HSV with the TK mutation.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">33</xref>
 </sup> Resistance to cidofovir occurs when the virus develops mutations in the DNA polymerase gene (ie, 
 <italic>CMV-UL54</italic> gene mutations).

 </sup> Cidofovir has also been used off-label for various illnesses, such as acyclovir-resistant HSV disease, condyloma acuminatum, BK virus–associated hemorrhagic cystitis, JC virus–associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and other infections due to double-stranded DNA viruses.
