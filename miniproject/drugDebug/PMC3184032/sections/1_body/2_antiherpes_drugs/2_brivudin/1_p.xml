 </sup> Brivudin is phosphorylated by viral TK and cellular kinases to brivudin-triphosphate, which serves as a competitive inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase, thereby terminating viral DNA synthesis. It is available in some countries for the treatment of herpes zoster and herpes simplex. However, concerns about its toxicity halted its clinical development in the United States. Its metabolite, bromovinyluracil, irreversibly inhibits dihydropyridine dehydrogenase, which regulates nucleoside metabolism. Coadministration with 5-fluorouracil has resulted in lethal bone marrow toxicity and severe gastrointestinal toxicity.
