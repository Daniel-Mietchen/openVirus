<p id="P52">Oseltamivir is also used for postexposure prophylaxis against influenza A and B, including pandemic strains. For this indication, oseltamivir should be started within 48 hours of exposure and continued daily for at least 10 days or for up to 6 weeks during an outbreak. A systematic review reported no statistically significant difference between oseltamivir and zanamivir prophylaxis for preventing symptomatic influenza among immunocompetent adults.
