 </sup> Oral oseltamivir is well absorbed and reaches peak serum concentrations in 1 hour. Bioavailability of oseltamivir phosphate is at least 75%. The prodrug oseltamivir phosphate undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism via ester hydrolysis. More than 99% of active oseltamivir carboxylate is excreted renally.
