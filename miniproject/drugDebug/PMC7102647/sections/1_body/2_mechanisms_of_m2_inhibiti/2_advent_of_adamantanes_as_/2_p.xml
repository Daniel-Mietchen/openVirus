During virus entry, amantadine's inhibition of M2 results in incomplete dissociation of M1 from ribonucleoprotein complexes, which in turn fail to enter the nucleus to initiate further replication. As M2 can also equilibrate pH across the trans-Golgi network and the cytoplasm, amantadine-based M2 inhibition may also disrupt viral egress (
