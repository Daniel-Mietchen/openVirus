<p id="p0120">The effects of the Ser31Asn mutation on M2 pore size and proton conduction have been elucidated in exquisite detail. For example, the solution NMR structure (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2RLF" id="intref0040" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2RLF</ext-link>; 
 <xref rid="bib109" ref-type="bibr">Schnell and Chou, 2008</xref>) presents Ser31 between two alpha-helices, and its mutation to the larger asparagine expands the pore by creating a kink in each monomer which would be expected to result in higher conductance. In contrast, the crystal structure (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:3C9J" id="intref0045" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">3C9J</ext-link>; 
 <xref rid="bib115" ref-type="bibr">Stouffer et al., 2008</xref>) shows Ser31 facing the pore, where mutation to asparagine decreases the pore size and would be expected to reduce conductance. However, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Holsinger et al. (1994)</xref> did not observe a difference in the rate of proton conduction due to the Ser31Asn mutation as measured by single electrode electrophysiology recordings. This result was further confirmed by 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Balannik et al. (2010)</xref> in two-electrode voltage clamp assay in which S31N mutant had indistinguishable specific conductance as M2 WT. Regardless, being located at a pore lining residue, the Ser31Asn mutation is likely to alter the diameter as well as the polarity and dynamics of the channel pore, resulting in changes between the observed interactions of the Ser31Asn channel and amantadine when compared to WT M2 (

 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:5C02" id="intref0050" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">5C02</ext-link>; (

 <xref rid="bib127" ref-type="bibr">Thomaston et al., 2018</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib129" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), in the absence of a drug molecule in the pore and in the Inward
 <sub>open</sub> state, Asn31 was found to face the pore and was stabilized by H-bonds formed with the carbonyl groups of neighboring Asn31 (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>A). This arrangement sterically constricts the adamantane binding site in the pore. In contrast, in the Inward
 <sub>closed</sub> state, Asn31 was tucked away from the centre of the pore and stabilized by forming H-bonds with carbonyls at the monomer-monomer interface, thereby twisting the helices and narrowing the pore near the binding site (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>B). Alternatively, using a solution NMR structure 
 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013b</xref> demonstrated that the Asn31 carboxamide could be stabilized in a pore-facing conformation through a bidentate interaction with the M2-S31N inhibitor M2WJ332 (compound

 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>; 
 <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref> B). These observations further emphasize that the orientation of Asn31 in the pore is dependent on the conformational state of the protein and/or the presence of interacting drug molecule in the lumen of the pore.
