<p id="p0115">In addition to Ser31Asn (and further consistent with the pore-binding model described above), the mutations Leu26Phe, Val27Ala, Ala30Thr and Gly34Glu also confer adamantane resistance (

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>). Large-scale sequence analyses of circulating IAV strains indicate that Leu26Phe, Val27Ala and Ser31Asn are the three major adamantane-resistance mutations found in transmissible viruses (

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">2009b</xref>). Among these, Ser31Asn is the prevalent mutation in more than 95% of adamantane-resistant strains (

 <xref rid="bib85" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2009</xref>), although a recent study reported a potential rise in the frequency of virus strains containing the Val27Ala and Ser31Asn double mutations (
 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Durrant et al., 2014</xref>). A recent crystallography study reported that elimination of hydrophobic contacts that are essential for adamantane drug binding is the underlying cause behind adamantane resistance to Val27Ala mutant (
 <xref rid="bib125" ref-type="bibr">Thomaston et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to the Val27Ala single mutation that results in complete resistance to amantadine, M2 sequences containing Ser31Asn can still be inhibited by amantadine

 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>). Notably, the Ser31Asn mutation has been isolated in curated virus strains that were in circulation before use of adamantanes, and so the prevalence of the Ser31Asn mutation in the wild may not be exclusively the result of drug selection pressure. This contrasts with mutations such as Val27Ala which appear more likely than Ser31Asn to have evolved as a result of drug selection pressure (
