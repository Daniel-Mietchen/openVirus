<p id="p0100">Another computational study using small molecular probes and solvent mapping techniques found the pore-binding site to be more energetically favored, although the allosteric site was also observed under some conditions (

 <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Gu et al. (2011)</xref> also applied molecular dynamics approaches to study the antagonistic effects of known M2 inhibitors and observed that, while interactions with the pore-binding site were more thermodynamically stable, ligands bound slowly and poorly dissociated due to a high energy barrier of binding. In contrast, the allosteric binding was readily accessible, the energy barrier for binding was minimal, and drug binding was less stable and more readily dissociated. Moreover, the initial NMR structure (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2RLF" id="intref0030" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2RLF</ext-link>) did not show evidence of an intraluminal binding site but rather binding at the allosteric peripheral site in the lipid interface. However, this can also be interpreted by noting that the NMR structure was narrower as compared to the counterpart X-ray structure (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:3C9J" id="intref0035" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">3C9J</ext-link>) due to a smaller tilt angle which resulted in transmembrane helices being overly parallel. This finding further alerted the field to the importance of the protein crystallization environment and emphasised the risk of crystal packing distortions across all published crystal structures (
