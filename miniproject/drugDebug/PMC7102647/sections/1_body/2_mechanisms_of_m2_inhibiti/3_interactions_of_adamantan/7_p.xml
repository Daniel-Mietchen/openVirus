<p id="p0110">More recently, the binding affinities of the R and S enantiomers of rimantadine to M2 have also been questioned. Surprisingly, by comparing the isotropic chemical shift changes of rimantadine's two enantiomers through ssNMR experiments and molecular dynamics simulations, 
 <xref rid="bib147" ref-type="bibr">Wright et al. (2016)</xref> proposed that the 2-R enantiomer may bind to full-length M2 differentially and with a higher affinity relative to the 2-S enantiomer. However, a subsequent series of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and cellular assays, electrophysiology experiments, and molecular dynamics simulations indicated that both enantiomers exhibited similar channel blockade in TEVC experiments, comparable antiviral activity in plaque assays, and similar free energies of binding in isothermal titration calorimetry and computational simulations (
