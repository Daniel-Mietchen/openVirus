<p id="p0095">To reconcile these findings, a series of both experimental and computational studies were rapidly reported (

 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Jing et al. (2008)</xref> demonstrated that the intraluminal binding site is more physiologically relevant through conducting whole-cell electrophysiology and antiviral assays using mutant and chimeric M2 forms. By mutating the critical Asp44 residue to alanine, Jing and coworkers continued to observe inhibition by amantadine in both electrophysiological and antiviral plaque assays, suggesting that the allosteric-binding site is not pharmacologically essential (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Jing et al., 2008</xref>). Additionally, in a chimeric ion channel based on the M2 of influenza B, which is normally amantadine-insensitive due to a larger and more hydrophilic transmembrane pore (
 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Mould et al., 2003</xref>), substitution with the M2 transmembrane domain from influenza A restored amantadine sensitivity (
 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Jing et al., 2008</xref>). Using solid-state NMR, 
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Cady et al. (2010)</xref> also reported that the channel pore was the preferred binding site (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2KQT" id="intref0020" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2KQT</ext-link>), where amantadine preferentially localized to a hydrophobic cage formed by Ala30, Ser31, and Gly34. Hydrophobic interactions between Val27 side chains and the adamantane cage were also observed, and the ammonium group of amantadine showed hydrogen bonding to water molecules and pore-facing residues that stabilized its interactions in the occluded pore. The authors also reported that interactions with the allosteric binding site were observed only at high amantadine concentrations and were thus less probable as the primary mode of M2 inhibition. In further support of the pore-binding model, mutation of Asp44, proposed as the key residue of the allosteric binding mechanism, to six different amino acids (Asp44Ala, Asp44Lys, Asp44Asn, Asp44Phe, Asp44Gly, and Asp44Thr) did not affect inhibition by amantadine (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Balannik et al., 2010</xref>). Notably, in further testing their initial hypothesis of an allosteric binding site of amantadine to M2, 
 <xref rid="bib94" ref-type="bibr">Pielak et al. (2011)</xref> next generated an M2 chimera where the C-terminus was derived from the amantadine-insensitive M2 of influenza B virus (PDB: 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:2LJB" id="intref0025" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">2LJB</ext-link>). Contrary to their previously proposed allosteric binding mechanism, using solution NMR, they described the rimantadine binding pocket to be preserved within the pore of the chimeric M2 protein. In a series of surface plasmon resonance experiments, the pore-binding site was also found to be more energetically favorable than the allosteric binding site, although the latter did remain sensitive to amantadine (
