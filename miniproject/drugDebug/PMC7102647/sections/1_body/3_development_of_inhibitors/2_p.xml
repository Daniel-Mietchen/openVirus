 <xref rid="bib142" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>) along with iterative cycles of medicinal chemistry, electrophysiological testing, and antiviral assaying have led to the discovery of several classes of compounds that inhibit at least one of the three major drug-resistant mutations (Leu26Phe, Val27Ala, or Ser31Asn) with efficacies comparable or better than amantadine against WT M2. While several other compounds are reported throughout the literature to inhibit M2 Ser31Asn-containing viruses, the mechanism of action of many of them is not confirmed to be mediated through M2 as many of these compounds were not tested in M2-specific assays. The most promising compounds have therefore been validated by both antiviral 
 <italic>and</italic> M2 conductance assays, the vast majority of which have been assessed by TEVC. These “second-generation” inhibitors of drug-resistant M2 can be broadly categorized in two main groups: adamantanes (
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and a series of chemically diverse non-adamantane molecules (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). While numerous compounds are reported by many groups, in addition to those cited in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, we have highlighted particular compounds with electrophysiology-based IC
 <sub>50</sub>s and PRA-based EC
 <sub>50</sub> s at low or sub-micromolar concentrations, which approximate the activities of amantadine and rimantadine in these assays with wild-type M2. Clearly, the efficacy of a given inhibitor as measured by TEVC and PRA does not necessarily translate to efficacy 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, a subset of these inhibitors has recently advanced to preclinical and animal efficacy studies, where promising results are reported. Additional compounds that inhibit WT M2, in addition to early but weaker inhibitors of M2 Val27Ala and Ser31Asn, have been reviewed elsewhere (
