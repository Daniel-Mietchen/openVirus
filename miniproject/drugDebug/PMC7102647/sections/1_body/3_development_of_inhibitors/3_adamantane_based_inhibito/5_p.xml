<p id="p0145">An important question is whether these second-generation inhibitors are capable of giving rise to additional drug-resistant forms of M2 and influenza viruses with comparable replicative fitness. In beginning to address this, the Wang group first reported that 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging of influenza virus in the presence of increasing concentrations of the M2 Ser31Asn inhibitor 
 <bold>5</bold> resulted in a novel M2 mutation, Leu26Ile, which conferred drug resistance. This mutation was also co-observed with an occasional Asn31Ser mutation which reverted back to Asn31 upon drug withdrawal. In contrast, passaging with the dual inhibitor compound 
 <bold>8</bold> resulted in Asn31Asp and Ile32Thr mutations which also reverted after drug withdrawal (
