<p id="p0135">Additional adamantane-based compounds have also been reported to inhibit multiple forms of M2. For example, 
 <xref rid="bib143" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2013b)</xref> proposed that installation of aromatic groups to the amine group of amantadine might also improve inhibitory activity against Ser31Asn M2 while maintaining activity against WT M2. This design hypothesis lead to the synthesis and discovery of benzyl-substituted amantadine derivatives, among which a benzdiol (
 <bold>7</bold>) was reported as the first potent WT and Ser31Asn M2 dual-inhibitor with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 60 and 35 μM, respectively, as measured by TEVC. By plaque reduction assay, 
 <bold>7</bold> further showed a EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 3.2 μM against the A/WSN/33 M2 Ser31Asn strain of IAV and complete inhibition of WT (Ser31 M2-containing) virus at 1 μM. Another series of dual inhibitors, exemplified by compound 
 <bold>8</bold>, inhibited 77 and 76% of currents from both M2 WT and Ser31Asn, respectively, as measured by TEVC. Compound 
 <bold>8</bold> additionally inhibited amantadine sensitive and resistant viruses with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 4.6 and 1.8 μM, respectively, as measured by PRA.
