 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Gandhi et al., 1999</xref>). More recently, 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al. (2017)</xref> reported the discovery of divalent copper complexes such as compound 
 <bold>27</bold> as non-selective M2 inhibitors. The authors proposed that the mechanism of action of these copper complexes is independent of mutation at Leu26, Val27, or Ser31 but is instead dependent on the conduction moiety, His37, as no inhibition was observed with 
 <bold>27</bold> against His37Ala mutant. Compound 
 <bold>27</bold> was able to inhibit 80% of M2 proton currents at 100 μM as measured by TEVC and had an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 0.7 μM against A/CA/07/2009 encoding M2 Ser31Asn in PRA.
