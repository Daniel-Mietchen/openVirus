 <xref rid="bib59" ref-type="bibr">Jang et al. (2018)</xref> reported that the monovalent ionophore salinomycin (

 <italic>in vitro.</italic> However, it indirectly inhibits M2 channel function by preventing cellular endosome acidification, similar to the mechanism of chloroquine. Salinomycin inhibited proton conduction by both M2 WT and Ser31Asn incorporated into virus-like particles (54% and 72% vs. WT and N31 at 100 Î¼M), in addition to proton conduction by the highly divergent M2 channel of influenza B (~60%). Salinomycin also synergized with oseltamivir 
 <italic>in vitro.</italic> However, while salinomycin on its own exhibited limited antiviral activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>; it did rescue mice treated with a sub-optimal concentration of oseltamivir and lethally-infected with oseltamivir sensitive or resistant viruses. (
