<p id="p0025">Influenza A virus (IAV) is a significant and ongoing cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. While prophylactic vaccines can confer immunity against circulating virus strains, their effectiveness and extent of immunization coverage vary across populations from year to year. This variability contributed in part to the recent and notable 2017â€“2018 seasonal outbreak which is estimated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to have caused approximately 710,000 hospitalizations and up to 79,400 deaths in the United States alone (

Of particular concern are less common but historically regular pandemic outbreaks in populations with limited or no immunity that can result in hundreds of thousands to millions of deaths worldwide. Moreover, there still remains a significant technical gap to expedite a rapid vaccine production response, particularly in the face of an increasingly global spread of newly-emergent virus strains (
