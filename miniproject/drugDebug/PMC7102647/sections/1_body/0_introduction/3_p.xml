<p id="p0030">The M2 protein is required for IAV replication and spread and is an established antiviral target. M2 is a proton-gated proton channel that belongs to a growing viroporin family of virus proteins. M2 ion channel activity is required for IAV replication, and adamantane-based M2 inhibitors including amantadine (

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Hayden and De Jong, 2011</xref>). More than 95% of circulating adamantane-resistant viruses harbor a serine to asparagine mutation at amino acid position 31 in M2 (Ser31Asn; 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Bright et al., 2005</xref>), which distorts adamantane interactions within the pore without significantly affecting M2 ion channel activity or the fitness of viral replication (
