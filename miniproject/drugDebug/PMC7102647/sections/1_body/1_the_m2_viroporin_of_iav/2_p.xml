<p id="p0040">Viroporins are small (often ~60–120 amino acids), virally-encoded transmembrane proteins that regulate ion conduction across lipid membranes and are a frequent feature of both RNA and DNA viruses (

Viroporins are frequently described as exhibiting a “channel-pore dualism,” where some sequences are broadly permeable to ions and small molecules, while others are tightly-regulated channels that conduct specific ions. Although the functions of most viroporins are not well understood, they are generally involved in conducting ions to facilitate viral entry, assembly, and/or release from host cells.
