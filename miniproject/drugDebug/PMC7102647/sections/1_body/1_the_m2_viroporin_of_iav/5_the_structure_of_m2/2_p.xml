<p id="p0065">Recently reported structures of M2 have been instrumental toward understanding how adamantanes inhibit this ion channel and how drug resistance overcomes them, in addition to generally informing new M2 drug discovery and ion channel biology. Experimentally-determined protein structures derived from X-ray crystallography, solid-state and solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and protein-ligand complex structures originating from computational studies have also formed the basis of structure-based drug design. As of this writing, there were more than 35 structures of wild-type (WT) and drug-resistant A/M2 proteins available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). Most of these were solved by X-ray techniques although some were elucidated using NMR.</p>
