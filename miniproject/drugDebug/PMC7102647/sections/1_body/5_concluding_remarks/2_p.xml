<p id="p0225">The next influenza virus pandemic, albeit unpredictable, is not a matter of “if” but “when.” New therapeutics, especially those that are distinct from current antivirals and with the ability to inhibit existing drug-resistant viral strains, may be essential toward mitigating the next inevitable outbreak. The M2 viroporin, a proton-dependent proton channel required for virus entry and egress, has historically been an effective antiviral target for drugs like amantadine and rimantadine. However, mutations in M2, particularly lining the pore where adamantanes interact, are now widespread and have rendered these therapies ineffective. Over the past decade, new inhibitors of drug-resistant M2 consisting of both adamantane derivatives and new chemical scaffolds have been found that inhibit M2 ion conduction, as demonstrated using both electrophysiological techniques

 <bold>7–10</bold>, 
 <bold>12</bold>, 
 <bold>17–18</bold>, 
 <bold>22</bold>, 
 <bold>25</bold>), inhibit viruses with major resistance to other IAV antivirals like oseltamivir (
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>10</bold>, 
 <bold>16</bold>) and/or synergize with oseltamivir (
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>16</bold>, 
 <bold>28</bold>), exhibit high genetic barriers to resistance following long-term 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> passaging (
 <bold>5</bold>, 
 <bold>8</bold>, 
 <bold>14–16</bold>), have supportive preclinical parameters such as good stability and low toxicity (
 <bold>9</bold>, 
 <bold>16</bold>, 
 <bold>23</bold>), and rescue mice from lethal infection (
 <bold>9</bold>). Going forward, further discovery of new chemical scaffolds and/or optimization of existing leads by medicinal chemistry may be enabled by emerging technologies to screen for and monitor M2 conductance. In addition, demonstration of clinical efficacy of new chemical leads remains to be achieved. The coming decade will likely show whether new M2 inhibitors can significantly add to the evolving armamentarium of antivirals to combat current and emerging seasonal and pandemic influenza strains.
