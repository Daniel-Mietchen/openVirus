<p id="p0210">When designing drugs against viral targets, an inherent challenge is the higher degree of structural flexibility exhibited by viral proteins in comparison to many prokaryotic and eukaryotic targets (

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Fischer and Hsu, 2011</xref>). Yet another challenge imposed against rational drug design is the dependence of such highly flexible proteins on their surrounding environment, which in turn affects their function. In contrast to thermostable proteins that encompass tight hydrophobic cores, viral proteins are frequently loosely packed, resulting not only in a smaller difference in energy levels between folded and unfolded states, but also a reduced contribution of random mutations or interactions with chemical inhibitors to overall stability (
 <xref rid="bib88" ref-type="bibr">Paciaroni et al., 2002</xref>). This equips viruses with enormous adaptive mechanisms to buffer the deleterious effects of random mutations; even more in the case of RNA viruses which intrinsically mutate faster than DNA viruses (
 <xref rid="bib132" ref-type="bibr">Tokuriki et al., 2009</xref>). These challenges also apply to M2, where until recently the lack of high-resolution structures had impeded the advancement of rational drug design. Other obstacles that have prevented the successful design of a universal M2 inhibitor include the constricted drug binding site, technical difficulties in effective measurement of drug inhibition, and absence of reliable protocols to assess protein drug interactions.
