 <caption> Water molecules in the wild-type M2 proton channel at different pH conditions. The structures were determined by X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) at room temperature. (A) Low pH (5.5) structure (PDB: 5JOO). (B) Intermediate pH (6.5) structure (PDB: 5UM1). (C) High pH (8.0) structure (PDB: 5TTC). Waters are shown as spheres ( Thomaston et al., 2017). </caption>
