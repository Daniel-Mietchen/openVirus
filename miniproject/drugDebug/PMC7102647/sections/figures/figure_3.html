 <caption> X-ray crystal structures of M2-S31N (22–46) in the Inward open (A) and Inward closed (B) states (PDB: 6MJH ( Thomaston et al., 2019);). In the Inward open state, the distance between the Trp41 indole nitrogen from opposition chains is 12.4 Å. In the Inward closed state, the distance between the Trp41 indole nitrogen from opposition chains is 6.7 Å. </caption>
