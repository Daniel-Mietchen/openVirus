<p id="Par5">Hemagglutinin (HA), one of the viral surface proteins deeply involved in membrane fusion with the host cell, has been investigated as another potentially effective antiviral strategy. During the fusion process, disulfide bonds linking the two different parts of HA cleave to unfold the HA molecule and the fusion peptide hidden within causes membrane fusion to spread viral RNA to the host cell [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Disulfide bonds have a crucial role in the membrane fusion process as previously described [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], thus we focused on HA disulfide bonds as an antiviral target herein.
