<p id="Par11">Moreover, the biocompatibility of the synthesized nanoparticles was evaluated by MDCK cell viability assay. MDCK cells in 96-well plates were exposed to various nanoparticle concentrations and cell viability was measured by the WST-1 assay, with the optical density being measured at 450 nm. The measured cell viability after nanoparticle treatment was greater than 95%, except for 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP and 0.1–0.2 mg/mL AgNP, which were observed to have 80% cell viability. The results of the nanoparticle cell viability assay implied that the infectivity of nanoparticle-treated viruses could be evaluated by MDCK cytotoxicity assay because the nanoparticles exhibited good biocompatibility with the MDCK cells (Additional file
