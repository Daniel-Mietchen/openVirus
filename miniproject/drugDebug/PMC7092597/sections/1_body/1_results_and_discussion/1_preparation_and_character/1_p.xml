<p id="Par9">In contrast to conventional gold nanoparticle synthesis, PoGNP was synthesized using the surfactant-free emulsion method. The Au
 <sup>3+</sup> ion in HAuCl
 <sub>4</sub> and anilinium ion (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>5</sub>NH
 <sub>3</sub>
 <sup>+</sup>) formed the PANI-Au complex nanoparticle by reducing the Au
 <sup>3+</sup> ion and oxidizing the anilinium ion to PANI through redox reaction [

After fabrication of the PANI-Au complex nanoparticle, PANI was selectively etched by NMP from the PANI-Au nanocomplex, shaping a mesoporous gold structure. Non-porous sGNP was synthesized via the seed-mediated growth method to compare whether nanoparticle morphology could affect inactivation of the virus. AgNP was also prepared as an antiviral control group as AgNP has been widely studied for its antiviral properties.
