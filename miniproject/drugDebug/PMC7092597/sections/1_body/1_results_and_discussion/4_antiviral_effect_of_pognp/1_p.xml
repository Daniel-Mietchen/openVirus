<p id="Par14">To confirm the inactivation of PoGNP regardless of genetic mutation, 3 IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) were treated with PoGNP (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> and Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Figure S3). According to the phylogenic tree of IAV, the selected virus strains had low sequence similarity, so they were considered representative of general viral treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For the 10 min-treated sample, only 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP showed over 50% cell viability. Under 0.1 mg/mL PoGNP concentration, the treated virus was only slightly inactivated compared to the non-treated virus. After the 60 min treatment, the antiviral effect of treatment with 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP on H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2 increased to 74%, 76%, and 56%, respectively. 54% of MDCK cells survived H1N1 infection when treated with 0.1 mg/mL PoGNP for 60 min. H3N2 and H9N2 were minorly affected under 0.1 mg/mL PoGNP and still exhibited higher cell viability than the control group. PoGNP displayed antiviral activity on various virus strains, which is important for on-the-spot preprocessing of IAV for further analysis. Here, we could conclude that 0.2 mg/mL PoGNP could attenuate the infectivity of multiple IAV strains.
