<p id="Par17">Moreover, results of the WST-1 assay revealed that TCEP-treated IAVs lost their infectivity similar to PoGNP-treated viruses. Samples treated with under 1 mM TCEP exhibited nearly 60% cell viability, which was much higher than the 33% viability of H3N2 virus-infected MDCK cells (Additional file

Likewise, as the viral infectivity of PoGNP-reacted influenza virus was suppressed to the level similar to that of the TCEP interacted one, which derives that PoGNP also cleaves the disulfide bonds in HA as TCEP.
