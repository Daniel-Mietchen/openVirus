<p id="Par22">Non-porous sGNP was obtained following the seed-mediated growth method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. First, gold nanoparticle (GNP) seed was synthesized using the citrate reduction method. Briefly, 100 mL of sodium citrate solution (5 mM) was heated to 95 °C with vigorous stirring. Thereafter, 1 mL of gold (III) chloride solution (0.1 M) was injected into the sodium citrate solution. After 30 min, a wine-colored GNP seed solution was obtained. Then, 100 μL of gold (III) chloride solution (25 mM) was added to GNP seed solution (0.8 μM) to give a final volume of 10 mL. Subsequently, 22 μL of sodium citrate solution (30 mM) was injected into the seed solution mixture, following the addition of 100 μL of hydroquinone solution (30 mM). The mixture was kept at room temperature (RT) for 24 h. PVP solution (2 μg/mL) was added to prevent the aggregation of nanoparticles, followed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min.
