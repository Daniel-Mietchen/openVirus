<p id="Par20">PoGNP was prepared following the surfactant-free emulsion method [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Aniline monomer (0.182 mL, 2 mmol) was dispersed in 20 mL of deionized water. Then, 1 mL of gold (III) chloride solution (0.1 M) was added to construct a polyaniline (PANI)-Au hybrid nanoparticle under emulsification for 30 min with ultrasonication. The produced PANI-Au nanoparticle was washed 3× by centrifugation. PANI was then removed from the PANI-Au composite by dissolving the composite in NMP. Finally, purified PoGNP was redispersed in DPBS.
