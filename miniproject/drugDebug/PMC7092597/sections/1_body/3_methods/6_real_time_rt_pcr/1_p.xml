<p id="Par30">A/canine/Korea/GCVP01/2007(H3N2) virus was serially diluted tenfold (108.25–102.25 EID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL). Viral genomic RNA from each dilution was extracted using the QIAamp
 <sup>®</sup> viral RNA mini kit (QIAGEN), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was employed to quantify the viral load in the samples using the QuantiTect Probe RT-PCR Kit (QIAGEN) and the LightCycler 96 system (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The 50 μL final reaction volume contained 0.4 μM of matrix (M) gene-specific primer (forward: GACCRATCCTGTCACCTCTGAC; reverse: AGGGC ATTYTGGACAAAKC GTCTA) and 0.2 μM of specific probe (FAM-TGCAGTCCTCGCTCACTGGGCACG-BHQ-1). The thermal cycling conditions were: reverse transcription at 50 °C for 30 min, initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min, followed by 40 cycles of [94 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s] according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Roche). The primers targeted the region of the M gene highly conserved across all IAV strains, as formulated by the CDC (Biosearch Technologies, Inc.

A standard curve was generated with EID values and copy numbers. The amount of viral RNA in nanoparticle-treated samples (in logEID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) was calculated from the standard curve generated by real-time RT-PCR data using canine H3N2 virus (Additional file
