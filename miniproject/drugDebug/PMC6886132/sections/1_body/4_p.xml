<p>The idea of treating the host response is &gt;10 yr old
 <xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, and it is supported by a large body of experimental evidence and several observational studies

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The host response may involve mechanisms that enhance resistance (which reduces pathogen burden) or tolerance (which reduces the impact of infection). In 1918, mortality rates were much lower in children than those in young adults, but the better survival of children was not unique: similar age-related mortality differences have been seen with other virus and bacterial diseases
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. Recently, this difference has been experimentally reproduced in pre- and post-pubertal mice that were either infected with an influenza virus or treated with endotoxin
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Because influenza virus titres and endotoxin levels were similar in both groups, the better survival of pre-pubertal mice suggested that they were more tolerant, not more resistant. Their better tolerance likely reflects the heritage of evolution.
