<p>Physicians count on antiviral drugs to treat individual patients
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. Anti-neuraminidase inhibitors are only modestly effective in reducing mortality due to seasonal influenza, and antiviral resistance is always a threat. Newer antiviral drugs are being developed, but even if they are efficacious, they may be no more effective than the current antivirals. In addition, the development of antiviral resistance is also a possibility. Thus, given the absence of both pandemic vaccines and highly effective antiviral treatments, it takes little imagination to recognize that human experience during the next pandemic could be similar to what it was 100 years ago
