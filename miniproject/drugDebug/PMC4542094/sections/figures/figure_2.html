 <caption> Differential expression of HERV-W E1 and HERV-FRD 1 in HCT8 WT/RETO colon carcinoma cells analyzed by ICC. Cells growing on chamber slides were labeled with anti-HERV-W E1 and anti-HERV-FRD antibodies. Wildtype cells express basal levels of both HERV elements while the HCT8 RETO cells express high levels and develop hypertrophy. Magnification 400x, n = 3 independent experiments </caption>
