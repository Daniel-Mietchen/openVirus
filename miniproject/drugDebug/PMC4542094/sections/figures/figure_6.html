 <caption> Cytotoxic effect of antiviral drugs and their influence in the expression of HERV proteins in HCT8 colon carcinoma cells. Simultaneous incubation of HCT8 WT/RETO with amantadine, ribavirin and pleconaril based on the IC 50 values calculated for the drugs applied alone or in combination for 24 hours. a: Influence of Amantadine, Pleconaril and Ribavirin in the expression of HERVs analyzed by ELISA in HCT8 WT/RETO cells. b: Down regulation of HERVs proteins after antiviral exposure analyzed by Western blot. c: relative expression of HERVs under the influence of antiviral drugs. Amantadine-pleconaril show a potentiation of circa 35 % in HCT8 WT and 20 % in HCT8 RETO. Amantadine-ribavirin have a potentiation of circa 25 % in HCT8 WT and 10 % in HCT8 RETO. The three-way combination ARP was the most effective. Results are representative of n = 3 independent experiments </caption>
