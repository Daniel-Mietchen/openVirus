 <caption> Effect of amantadine on HERV protein expression in HCT8 WT/RETO analyzed by ELISA. The expression of both HERV-W E1 and HERV-FRD 1 is downregulated after incubation with amantadine at 2 x IC 50 for 24Â hours. Expression is reduced to basal levels in HCT8 RETO. The results are given in percent in relation to the expression of beta-actin as endogenous control </caption>
