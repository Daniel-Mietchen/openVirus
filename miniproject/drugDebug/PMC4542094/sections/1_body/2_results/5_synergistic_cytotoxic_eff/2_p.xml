<p>In general, using the chemo-sensitive HCT8
 <sup>WT</sup> cell line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, panels 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">c</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">e</xref>), interaction between amantadine and doxorubicin was slightly synergistic (panel 
 <bold>a</bold>), between amantadine and cisplatin (CP) additive (panel 
 <bold>c</bold>), and remarkable antagonistic activity was observed between amantadine and 5FU (panel 
 <bold>e</bold>), respectively. In contrast, in the chemoresistant HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cell line (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>, panels 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">b</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">d</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">f</xref>), synergistic interaction between amantadine and all three anticancer drugs was shown, although synergism was less pronounced using 5-fluorouracil (5FU) (panel 
 <bold>f</bold>). These results indicate that antiviral compounds like amantadine do not only exhibited substantial cytotoxic activity in chemoresistant tumor cells by itself, but also enhance the cytotoxic efficacy of anticancer drugs
