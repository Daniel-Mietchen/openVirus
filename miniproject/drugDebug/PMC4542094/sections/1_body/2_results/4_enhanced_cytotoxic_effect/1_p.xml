<p>To get a first hint on the antiproliferative activity of antiviral compounds in colon carcinoma cells, we analyzed antiviral drugs like amantadine, ribavirin, pleconaril, lamivudine, acyclovir, ganciclovir, AZT, foscavir and brivudine in HCT8
 <sup>WT/RETO</sup> cells. Of these, only three compounds showed some degree of antiproliferative effect, as defined by their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values: amantadine, ribavirin and pleconaril (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). All other drugs did not show detectable activity at concentrations up to 200 μg/ml (data not shown) and therefore were excluded from further analysis. In general, amantadine and pleconaril were the most active compounds in the HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup> cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
