<p>The simultaneous effect of antiviral drugs and cytostatics was analyzed by the isobologram method (50 % isodose) as described previously [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Briefly, the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for both substances were first determined using the MTT proliferation assay. Applying fixed percentages of the IC
 <sub>50</sub> for the first drug (20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 %) and varying the concentration of the second drug from 0.1 to 50 μM, the variation in the resulting IC
 <sub>50</sub> was determined for every percentage. The same procedure was carried out inversely for the second drug. Dose-response curves were then plotted and evaluated.
