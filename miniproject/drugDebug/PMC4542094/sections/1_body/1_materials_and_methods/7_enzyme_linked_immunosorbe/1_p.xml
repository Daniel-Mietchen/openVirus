<p>Differential HERV expression and its repression by antiviral drugs were monitored using an indirect ELISA method. In brief, 96-well microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One GmbH, Frickenhausen, Germany) were coated with protein homogenates (5 μg/100 μl) overnight at 4 °C. Well contents were aspirated and the wells washed 3 times with washing buffer (PBS/0.05 % Tween 20). The wells were then incubated with 300 μl blocking buffer [PBS/0.05 % Tween 20/1 % bovine serum albumin (BSA)] each at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed 3 times. Primary antibodies diluted 100 μl in blocking buffer 1:500 were added, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 1 h. The wells were aspirated and washed three times followed by incubation with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) in 100 μl at 37 °C for 1 h, dilution 1:2000. The wells were washed 3 times and incubated at 37 °C for 30 min with 100 μl of fresh 0.4 mg/ml

 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>/0.05 M citric acid adjusted to pH 5. The color reaction was stopped with 50 μl of 1 M HCl per well, and the optical density measured after 1 h at 492 nm (OD
 <sub>492</sub>) on an Infinite M200 microtiter plate reader (Tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland). Results were normalized using beta-actin as control and presented as percent of expression.
