<p>Resistance to etoposide in HCT8 cells was induced in the same form previously described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Briefly, IC
 <sub>50</sub> values for cytostatics were determined by MTT assay. Exponentially growing cells were then exposed to 2× IC
 <sub>50</sub> for 24 hours. For recovery, cells were washed and incubated with drug-free culture medium until new colonies had formed. This procedure was repeated several times, each time doubling the original IC
 <sub>50</sub> until 64× IC
 <sub>50</sub> was reached. The surviving cells were subjected to a resistance selection by incubation with increasing concentrations of the respective drugs (16× to 512× IC
 <sub>50</sub>) for 24 hours. Cells which proliferated at higher drug concentrations (128×) within one week were considered chemotherapy refractory. Resistant colonies were then expanded in the continuous presence of cytostatics and used for molecular-biological analysis, in particular for studying the expression of CSC features. The resistance factor (RF) was determined by MTT proliferation assay and reported as the IC
 <sub>50</sub> iCSCs/ IC
 <sub>50</sub> parental ratio. Using etoposide as chemoresistance-inducer it is feasible to induce a wide HCT8 subpopulation of cells (HCT8
 <sup>RETO</sup>) with cancer stem cell features (CSCs) in a very short time. HCT8
 <sup>WT/RETO</sup> cells were cultured in DMEM medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) and 15 μg/ml Ciprobay (Bayer AG, Wuppertal, Germany).
