<p>HERV expression was monitored by qPCR with validated primers and probes from Life Technologies (Cat. Nr.: 18S Hs99999901_s1, HERV WE1 Hs01926764_u1, HERV-FRD1 Hs01942443_s1, HERV3-1 Hs 04184598_s1 and HERV-V1 Hs00708335_s1), using the Taqman PCR core reagents according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. In addition, the expression of these HERV-elements was confirmed using specific primers purchased from Biomol (Hamburg, Germany). The primers details are reflected in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. The amplification of 25 ng of RNA was performed in triplicate in a CFX96TM Real-Time System (Biorad Laboratories, California, USA). Results were analyzed with CFX-ManagerTM Software Version 3.1 (Biorad Laboratories, California, USA). The evaluation of HERV relative expression was determined using the Ct comparative method.
