<p>It was recently demonstrated that iRNA targeting HERV-K can suppress tumor growth in melanoma models, suggesting that the overexpression of particular HERVs may play a crucial role in tumor physiology [

The introduction of antiviral drugs such as ribavirin into the therapy of tumors with high HERV expression (e.g. refractory AML) has shown complete and partial responses and a reduction in overall levels of eIF4E [
