<p>While organs like ovaries and testes as well as embryonic stem cells express HERV elements abundantly, expression is typically low or non-detectable in somatic cells. Furthermore, it is known that HERV-W significantly contributes to the differentiation of cytotrophoblasts into syncytiotrophoblasts through the fusogenic properties of the syncytins (HERV-W
