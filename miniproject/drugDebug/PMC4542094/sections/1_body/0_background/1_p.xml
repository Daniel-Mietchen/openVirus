<p>Cancer chemotherapy is likely to be associated with the development of cancer stem cell-like phenotypes. This chemical stress can force the genesis of cell heterogeneity in the tumor that becomes manifest in its histology, protein expression pattern, and genetic/epigenetic signature [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. However, the relationship between the manifest endoretroviral spectrum and the development of chemotherapy resistance has not been concatenated until now.
