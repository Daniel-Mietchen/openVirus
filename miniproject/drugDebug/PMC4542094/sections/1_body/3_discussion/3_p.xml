<p>Recently, we described a method to induce multi-resistant cancer cells that express several CSC tissue-related markers as well as stemness features like sphere formation, radio- and chemoresistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These cells also showed an up-regulation of a set of HERVs. Moreover, HERVs expression has been also linked to stemness in both normal and cancer cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].
