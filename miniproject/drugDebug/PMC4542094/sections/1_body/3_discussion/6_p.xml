<p>The first evidence for the impact of HERV gene repression on the inhibition of tumor cell growth came from the group of Thierry Heidmann [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], who used iRNA directed against HERV-K in a melanoma model. Wang-Johanning and coworker reported on the immunotherapeutic potential of anti-human endogenous retrovirus-K envelope protein antibodies in targeting breast tumors

 <italic>in vivo</italic>. These anti-HERV-K-specific monoclonal antibodies inhibited tumor growth and induced apoptosis of breast cancer cells [
