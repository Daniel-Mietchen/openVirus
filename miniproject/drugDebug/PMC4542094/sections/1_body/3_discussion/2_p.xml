<p>A number of HERVs have been found to be upregulated during carcinogenesis in tumors derived from tissues that normally show no or only basal expression of these elements. For example, HERV-K transcripts of the 
 <italic>Env</italic> protein, while entirely absent in normal breast tissue, were demonstrated to be overexpressed in almost all breast carcinomas [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, the expression of HERV-H and HERV-3-1 in colon carcinomas has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].
