<p>Co-morbidity at high risk of complications was defined by ICPC- and ATC-codes that are used in general practices to select patients eligible for influenza vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This method has been used to monitor the Dutch influenza vaccination rate in different high risk groups for several years, using the LINH database, with stable and representative results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We assumed these patients had at least one contact (claim) with their GP, resulting in at least one record with the specified codes. We think it is very unlikely that a patient with a certain chronic condition did not contact his or her general practitioner for an entire year, nor was prescribed any medication for this chronic condition during that year. Misclassification of patients with co-morbidity is therefore unlikely.
