<p id="p0040">The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of CoV has similar structural and functional properties as the 3CL protease or 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of picornavirus, norovirus, and SARs-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). In human CoV, the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> has been termed “the Achilles’ heel of coronaviruses”. It is an attractive target for drug discovery. The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of FIPV could act as a model to study the potential antiviral drugs against further emerging CoV-associated diseases. The 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assay is particularly available in the FIPV system. The inhibitors that target 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, including pyridine N-oxide derivatives, peptidomimetic analogs, covalent inhibitors, and peptidyl compounds, have been evaluated previously (

 <sup>pro</sup> of SARs-CoV and interfere with viral replication (
