<p id="p0035">The genome of FIPV contains a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA that is approximately 29,000 nucleotides in length, with 11 open reading frames (ORFs) encoding structural, non-structural, and accessory genes (

 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">2014a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2013</xref>). Two-thirds of the FCoV genome at the 5’ end comprise two overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and 1b, which encode two polyproteins. The translation of ORF1a yields the polyprotein pp1a. At lower frequencies, ribosomes initiate translation at the beginning of ORF1a and undergo a frameshift at the junction between ORF1a and 1b, resulting in a long polyprotein, pp1ab (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Similar to other coronaviruses (CoV), FCoV pp1ab contains two cysteine proteases, the papain-like protease (PL
 <sup>pro</sup>) and the 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>). The 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is also known as the main protease (M
 <sup>pro</sup>) (

The polyprotein pp1a and pp1ab are subsequently enzymatically cleaved into 16 nonstructural functional proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) that are mainly involved in proteolytic processing and viral RNA synthesis, including the replication of the genome and synthesis of the sub-genomic mRNA. The remaining genome contains nine ORFs that encode four structural proteins––spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, and five accessory proteins (3a–c, 7a, and 7b).
