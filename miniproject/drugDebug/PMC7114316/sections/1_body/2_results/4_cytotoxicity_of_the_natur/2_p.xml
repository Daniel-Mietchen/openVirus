<p id="p0140">The cytotoxicity assay revealed that five of the seven hits showed 50% cytotoxicity (50% cell cytotoxicity, CC
 <sub>50</sub>) at concentrations higher than 300 μM. The CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of compounds NSC87511, CID5318214, CID3821945, CID5748691, and CID5373747 were higher than their IC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Table 1</xref>). Generally, if the IC
 <sub>50</sub> of a compound is less than the CC
 <sub>50</sub>, the compound can effectively inhibit the virus without exhibiting significant cell toxicity.
