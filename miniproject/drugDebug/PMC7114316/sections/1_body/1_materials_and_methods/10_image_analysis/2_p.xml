<p id="p0110">The antiviral activities of the tested compounds were evaluated by measuring the intensity and numbers of the positive FIPV-infected CRFK cells using IPMA assay. Five concentrations of each compound were added to 96-well plates in duplicate. Images of the presenting FIPV antigens in the infected cells were analyzed using the software CellProfiler (version 2.7.0), with an open-source code of available algorithms (Broad Institute; freeware available at

Five images from each concentration of the tested compounds were used for the analysis. The CellProfiler pipeline that was utilized in this project was modified from the open-source (

The pipeline, IPMA1.cppippe, was developed to calculate the intensity of the DAB-stained cell parts compared to the unstained cell parts, and set to separate clumped from isolated cells based on their shapes.
