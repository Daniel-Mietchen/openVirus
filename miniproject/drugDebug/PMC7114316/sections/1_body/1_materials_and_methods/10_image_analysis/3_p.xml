<p id="p0115">Under three antiviral conditions, an active compound or “hit” is a compound that exhibits at least 50% inhibition of positive FIPV-infected cells without compromising cell viability. The effective concentration at which the compound inhibited 50% of the infected cells (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) in the absence of drug was determined. The selectivity index (SI) was calculated as SI = CC
 <sub>50</sub>/EC
 <sub>50</sub>.
