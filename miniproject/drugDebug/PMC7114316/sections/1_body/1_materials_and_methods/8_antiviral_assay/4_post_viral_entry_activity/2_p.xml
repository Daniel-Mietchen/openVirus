<p id="p0095">In order to determine the antiviral activities of the candidate compounds against intracellular replication of FIPV, CRFK cells were inoculated with FIPV at 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/well. The infected cells were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h for viral adsorption. Then, the infected-CRFK cells were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of each compound as mentioned above.
