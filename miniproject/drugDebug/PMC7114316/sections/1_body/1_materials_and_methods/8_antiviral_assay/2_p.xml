<p id="p0085">Antiviral activities of the candidate compounds were examined using CRFK cells infected with different concentrations of FIPV with two biological and three technical replicates. The CRFK cells were seeded at 1 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL (100 μl/well) onto a 96-well plate for the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA), and at 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well into a 24-well plate for qPCR-based detection of the virus. The inhibitory activities of each compound at all the tested concentrations were compared with ribavirin, a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, and lopinavir, an HIV-protease inhibitor, as positive control drugs, for 24 h. A set of wells designated as negative control, consisting of no inhibitor with 1% DMSO control, no virus control, and no inhibitor or virus control, was included in each experiment. Three conditions were generated for each tested compound.
