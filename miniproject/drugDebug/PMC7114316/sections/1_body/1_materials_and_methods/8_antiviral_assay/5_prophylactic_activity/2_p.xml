<p id="p0100">In order to determine whether small molecules could enter the host cells and demonstrate antiviral activity after FIPV infection, the CRFK cells were incubated with the candidate compounds prior to viral inoculation. The seeded CRFK cells were first incubated overnight, following which they were incubated with different concentrations of the compounds at 37 °C for 2 h. The compound solution was then removed and the cells were washed once with Ringer's saline solution (pH 7.4). Then, the cells were inoculated with FIPV at 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/well and incubated at 37 °C for 24 h.
