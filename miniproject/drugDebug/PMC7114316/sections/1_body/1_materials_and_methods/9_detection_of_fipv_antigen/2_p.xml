<p id="p0105">IPMA was performed using a previously described method (
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Lekcharoensuk et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the infected CRFK cells were fixed with cold methanol at room temperature for 20 min and then washed with PBST buffer. The primary antibody for detection of FIPV, a mouse monoclonal antibody specific to pan-coronavirus FIPV3–70 (dilution 1:500, ThermoFisher, Carlsbad, USA), was incubated with the infected cells at 37 °C for 1 h. These treated cells were then washed using PBST, following which they were incubated with the secondary antibody, a goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody (dilution 1:400, Kirkegaard &amp; Perry Laboratories, Madison, USA), at 37 °C for 1 h. The antigen-antibody reaction was stained using DAB substrate (DAKO, Santa Clara, USA) and observed under a phase-contrast inverted microscope (Olympus CKX41, Tokyo, Japan).
