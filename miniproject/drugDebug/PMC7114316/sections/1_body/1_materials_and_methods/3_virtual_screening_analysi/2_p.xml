 <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Dallakyan and Olson, 2015</xref>). The input files were converted to the pdbqt file format. The grid parameters were grid center (x = −40, y = −10, z = −5) and size (x = 30, y = 30, z = 30), wherein the space was at the center of the catalytic pocket of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Lamarckian genetic algorithm (GA) was set by default, where the parameters included 20 GA runs, 150 individuals in the population, and 270,000 generations. The top 10 outputs of the best binding affinities for each docking run were stored. In this study, the 64 selected compounds were re-scored using different docking algorithms on the program GOLD version 5.5 (license kindly provided by Assoc. Prof. Dr Kiattawee Choowongkomon, Kasetsart University), based on GA. The grid parameters of the interface region were similar to those set for PyRx with 20 GA runs. The score function was based on the GoldScore fitness function for ranking of the binding affinity. The second program for re-scoring, ICM-pro suite version 3.8.6, was used to calculate energy according to the Monte Carlo biased-probability algorithm. The grid space was adjusted similarly for both the mentioned software. The parameters of Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and Areas Under the ROC Curve (AUCs) were applied to determine the performance of each scoring function and docking performances. The interactions of protein-ligand complexes were characterized using the program LigPlot version 1.4.5. (

The ADME/T (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Elimination, and Toxicity) analysis was subsequently performed on the selected candidate compounds using the web-based software SwissADME (
