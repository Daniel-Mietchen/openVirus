<p id="p0075">The Crandell-Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cell line (ATCC, CCL–94) was used for viral propagation and titration. The cell lines were maintained in Modified Eagle Medium (MEM, Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, USA), supplemented with 7% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, USA) and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, USA). The CRFK cell lines were inoculated with FIPV strain 79–1146 (ATCC, VR–990) and incubated at 37 °C with CO
 <sub>2</sub> for 48 h. The cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed by an inverted microscope (Olympus CKX41, Tokyo, Japan). The infected cells were subjected to a double freeze/thaw cycle to release cell-bound viruses. The virus suspension was clarified by centrifugation at 2,000×
