<p id="p0065">The kinetic measurements of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> were carried out following the previously described procedures (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2004</xref>). FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was added to a solution containing 20 mM Bis-Tris (pH 7.0) at 25 °C. Enhanced fluorescence resulting from the cleavage of the fluorogenic substrate peptide (Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans) of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was monitored at 538 nm (Dabcyl), with excitation at 355 nm (Edans), on a fluorescence plate reader (BMG FLUOstar OPTIMA Microplate Reader, Ortenberg, Germany). The concentration of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> that was used to measure 
 <italic>K</italic>m and 
 <italic>k</italic>
 <sub>cat</sub> values was 35 nM, while the substrate concentrations were ranged from 0.5 to 5-fold of the 
 <italic>K</italic>m value. The initial rate up to 10% substrate consumption was used to calculate the kinetic parameters using the Michaelis-Menten equation on the program KaleidaGraph. For the protease inhibition assay, the initial rates of inhibition of 35 nM enzyme using 6 μM fluorogenic substrate were plotted against different inhibitor concentrations to obtain the IC
 <sub>50</sub> values. The 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> measurements were performed at two fixed inhibitor concentrations of 1- and 2-fold of IC
 <sub>50</sub>. Substrate concentrations ranged from 3 to 40 μM in a reaction mixture containing 35 nM FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. Lineweaver-Burk plots of kinetic data were fitted using nonlinear regression on the computer program KinetAsyst II (IntelliKinetics, State College, PA), to obtain the
