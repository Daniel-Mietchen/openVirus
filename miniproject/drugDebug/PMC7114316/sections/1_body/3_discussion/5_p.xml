<p id="p0170">Two reference inhibitors, ribavirin, and lopinavir, were included in our experiments. Ribavirin is a synthetic nucleoside and a ribosyl purine analog with antiviral activity. The mechanism of action of ribavirin is still unclear and highly variable among patients (

 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Zumla et al., 2016</xref>). However, it from isolated is known to interfere with the synthesis of viral mRNA and viral replication, and is primarily indicated for hepatitis C virus (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Dixit and Perelson, 2006</xref>). The activity of ribavirin is enhanced by using its combination with interferons or other antiviral drugs that synergistically inhibit the viruses, rather than treatment with ribavirin alone, as reported for the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV regimens (

 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Omrani et al., 2014</xref>). Ribavirin in combination with lopinavir/ritonavir and steroids showed a slight reduction in the mortality rate in patients infected with SARS-CoV (

In our pre- and post-viral entry experiments, ribavirin showed less antiviral effect on FIPV, compared to compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 48.87–73.98 μM). Furthermore, it did not show an antiviral effect in the prophylaxis study.
