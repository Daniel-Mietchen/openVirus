 <sup>pro</sup> contains a Cys residue as the nucleophile of the catalytic dyad (

 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Usually, the inhibitors of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> are designed to facilitate the nucleophilic attack by protease at the carbonyl residue for the formation of a covalent bond with the inhibitor and trap the enzymatic nucleophile, terminating its catalytic activity. The functional groups are commonly termed as ‘warheads’, which are based on carbonyl groups and contain dipeptidyl residues with different warheads (

 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2012</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). The dipeptidyl aldehyde contains a carbonyl group with a nucleophile that can donate a pair of electrons. Consequently, hydrolysis of the key catalytic group occurs at the active site of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. In this study, we observed that most of the candidate compounds contained an acyl group, which tends to share a lone-pair of electrons to the active site of FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. According to our molecular docking analysis, the three best candidate compounds interacted with the His41 or Cys144 and other residues in the binding pocket, mainly through non-covalent bonds. We also evaluated the ADME/T properties, which were useful in prioritizing drug modifications. We observed that NSC87511 and NSC343256 passed the Ro5 and had good ‘drug-like’ properties of small molecules for refinement into potential oral drugs. However, NSC345647 violated two of the Ro5 filters. Nevertheless, modification of the chemical structures should be able to reduce the undesirable properties and increase the drug-like fragment contents. In our study, the FIPV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>–compound complexes were mainly stabilized by the non-covalent interactions within the binding pocket. Therefore, besides the affinity of the molecule to its protein target, its chemical structure, especially the properties related to bioavailability and serum albumin binding, should be considered.
