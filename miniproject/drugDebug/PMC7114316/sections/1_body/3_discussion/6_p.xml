<p id="p0175">Lopinavir, an inhibitor of HIV protease, has been commonly used in combination with ritonavir for treatment of HIV. The booted forms of lopinavir and ritonavir have exhibited antiviral activities in some clinical cases of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (

 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2003</xref>). It was expected that lopinavir could possibly inhibit 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> activity. However, lopinavir and its derivatives partially inhibited the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> of SARS-CoV, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of ~50 μM and ~25 μM, respectively (

 <sub>50</sub> = 5.38–31.70 μM). It is possible that lopinavir may have higher inhibitory activity toward other proteases when examined by cell-based experiments. The papain-like protease 1 (PL1
 <sup>pro</sup>), a common protease of CoV, has a finger-shaped subdomain and a catalytic triad Cys32–His183–Asp196, which have been found only in the alpha-CoV including FIPV, but absent in beta-CoV (
