<p id="p0165">Hitachimycin (NSC343256), a natural compound, was first isolated from

 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Umezawa et al., 1981</xref>). It was also known as stubomycin, which is one of the β-amino acid-containing macrocyclic lactam polyketides, with β–phenylalanine at the starter units (

 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Kudo et al., 2015</xref>). Hitachimycin and related compounds, such as vicenistatin, fluvirucin A1, fluvirucin B2, cremimycin, and incednine contained an aromatic ring of a β-amino acid as its polyketide skeleton. Hitachimycin has been reported to possess antiprotozoal and antitumor properties, but there a lack of literature on its antiviral effect. Fluvirucins, which have a core of macrocyclic lactam similar to hitachimycin, showed antiviral effects against influenza virus type A (Victoria strain) in MDCK cell culture, with IC
 <sub>50</sub> = 2–10 μg/mL. It also showed low CC
 <sub>50</sub> values, similar to those observed in our study (

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Naruse et al., 1991b</xref>). The antimicrobial evidence indicated that polyketide synthase could synthesize each metabolite of hitachimycin and fluvirucins. Gene analysis and cluster study have been applied to identify the biosynthetic genes of the enzymes that contribute to biosynthetic machinery to develop new compounds (
