 <caption> Protein purification and kinetic parameters of FIPV 3CL pro. (A) SDS-PAGE analysis of the FIPV 3CL protease at different stages of the purification procedure. Lane 1 represents the molecular mass markers. Lanes 2 and 3 show the cell lysate without and with IPTG induction to overexpress FIPV 3CL protease with fusion tag, respectively. Lane 4 is the tagged protease after Ni-NTA column chromatography. Lane 5 represents the purified FIPV 3CL pro after cleavage of FXa to remove the fusion tag. Two extra bands of the intact FIPV 3CL pro and the fusion tag at lower molecular mass appear on SDS-PAGE. Lane 6 shows the purified untagged protease (arrowed) after passing the second Ni-NTA column. (B) Determining the kinetic parameters of FIPV 3CL protease. The initial reaction rates of the protease at different substrate concentrations were plots against substrate concentrations to obtain the V max and K m values of the enzyme. GraphPad Prism software was used to fit the kinetic data using Michaelis-Menten equation. The k cat and K m of this reaction were 0.71 ± 0.04 s −1 and 8.56 ± 1.15 μM, respectively. </caption>
