 <caption> FIPV 3CL pro – The interactions with three compounds with high affinity. A) NSC345647, B) NSC87511 and C) NSC343356 are docked in 3D-structures (upper panel) and 2D-structures (lower panel) at the substrate-binding pocket of FIP 3CL pro. The interactions are presented as dashed lines for alkyl/π-alkyl bonds (pink), π-donor (dark blue), π-π stack (black), π-sigma (yellow), π-cation (purple), hydrogen bonds (green) and hydrophobic interaction (red circles and ellipses). The ligand-protein interactions are visualized using UCSF Chimera version 1.10.2 and LigPlot software. </caption>
