 <caption> Real-time qPCR (Aâ€“D) demonstrating percent of viral reduction in the FIPV-infected CRFK cells after being treated with each compound in three antiviral cell-based conditions; pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylaxis activities as described in the text. The reductions of viral copy numbers were related to that of FIPV-infected CRFK cells in the absence of any compounds. </caption>
