<p>Researchers are searching for effective and suitable vaccine candidates and therapeutics for controlling the deadly COVID-19. There are no effective vaccines or specific antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Hence, we have to rely exclusively on enforcing strict preventive and control measures that minimize the risk of possible disease transmission. Results obtained from the recently conducted 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> study against COVID-19 are promising since the drugs remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling the infection. Direct clinical trials can be conducted among the patients infected with COVID-19 since these drugs are being used for treating other diseases and have well-established safety profiles, making the further evaluation of these drugs much easier. S protein is considered a key viral antigen for developing CoV vaccines, as shown in several preclinical studies. Although research is in progress to improve prevention, treatment, and control of COVID-19, the documented clinical data on different therapeutic approaches for CoVs are scarce. Further research should be directed toward the study of SARS-CoV-2 in suitable animal models for analyzing replication, transmission, and pathogenesis.
