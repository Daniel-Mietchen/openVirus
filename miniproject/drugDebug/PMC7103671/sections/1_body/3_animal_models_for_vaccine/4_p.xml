 </sup> Further studies are needed to recognize suitable models for emerging SARS-CoV-2 by identifying receptor affinity of SARS-CoV-2 and studying disease manifestations, pathologies/viral pathogenesis associated with experimental inoculation of the virus in mice, rats, and other models, as well as examining virus-specific immune responses and protection. This would facilitate preclinical evaluations of candidate COVID-19 vaccines and drugs.
