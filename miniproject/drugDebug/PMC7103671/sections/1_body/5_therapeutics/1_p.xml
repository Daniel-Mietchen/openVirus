 </sup> Therapeutic options that could be evaluated and used for COVID-19 include molecules binding to the virus, molecules, or inhibitors that target specific enzymes involved in viral replication and transcription, small-molecule inhibitors targeting helicase, essential proteases, or other proteins of the virus, host cell protease inhibitors, host cell endocytosis inhibitors, siRNA, anti-sense RNA and ribozyme, neutralizing antibodies, mAbs targeting host receptor or interfere with S1 RBD, antiviral peptide targeting S2, and natural products.

 </sup> There is a long list of anti-CoV agents, mostly preclinical compounds yet to be evaluated as anti-COVID-19 agents. Some of these agents are in phase III trials for COVID-19, including remdesivir, oseltamivir, ASC09F (HIV protease inhibitor), lopinavir, ritonavir, darunavir, and cobicistat.

 </sup> Many existing MERS- and/or SARS-CoVs inhibitors can be screened for efficacy. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has shown 96% identity to that of SARS-CoV, a critical finding since drugs developed for SARS-CoV RdRp might show similar efficacy for SARS-CoV-2 RdRp.
