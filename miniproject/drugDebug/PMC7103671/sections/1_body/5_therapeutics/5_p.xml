<p>Oral administration of neuraminidase inhibitors such as oseltamivir has been used as an empirical drug for COVID-19 suspected cases in China hospitals even though there is no evidence of its efficacy.

 </sup> Recently, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> antiviral efficacy of approved drugs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, nitazoxanide, nafamostat, and chloroquine was compared with that of the two broad-spectrum antiviral drugs remdesivir and favipiravir for COVID-19. Among the evaluated drugs, both remdesivir and chloroquine were found to be highly effective in controlling COVID-19 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>.

 </sup> The study also pointed out that the three nucleoside analogs such as ribavirin, penciclovir, and favipiravir may not have significant 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> antiviral effects against COVID-19 since higher concentrations were required to reduce the viral infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Both remdesivir and chloroquine are being used for the treatment of other diseases and have a well-defined safety profile. Hence, such drugs can be used for evaluating their efficacy in patients of novel CoV infections.
