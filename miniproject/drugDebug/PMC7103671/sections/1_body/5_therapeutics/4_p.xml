<p>The time required for drug discovery programs to develop, evaluate, and obtain approval for a new potent anti-COVID-19 agent could take more than 10 years.

 </sup> In the present scenario, the development of a new therapeutic agent for COVID-19 is not a feasible option with regard to available time. Another option is to repurpose broadly acting antiviral drugs used for other viral infections. Such drugs have the advantage of easy availability, known pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, solubility, stability, side effects, and also well-established dosing regimens.

 </sup> Repurposed drugs are potential therapeutic options managing CoV infections. Repurposed drugs such as lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-1β possess

 <italic>in vivo</italic> study conducted in common marmosets (non-human primate model) showed that animals treated with lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-1β had better outcomes than untreated animals.

 </sup> The combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-1β is being evaluated for MERS in the MIRACLE trial.

 </sup> The same two protease inhibitors lopinavir and ritonavir, when combined with ribavirin, were found to be associated with favorable clinical responses in SARS patients indicating therapeutic efficacy.

 </sup> As an early attempt to evaluate these repurposed drugs in COVID-19, a controlled trial of ritonavir-boosted lopinavir and interferon-α 2b therapy has been registered for hospitalized patients in China (ChiCTR2000029308).
