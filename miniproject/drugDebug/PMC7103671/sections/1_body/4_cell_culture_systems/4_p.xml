<p>Data from animal CoV vaccination suggest that systemic humoral or cell-mediated immune responses induced by parenteral administration may not be adequate to prevent respiratory tract infection.

 </sup> Because respiratory mucosa is the initial site in CoV infection and transmission, mucosal immunization, such as using intranasal vaccine,

 </sup> could be an effective strategy for prophylaxis by induction of mucosal and systemic immune responses. The molecular mechanisms of mucosal and systemic immunological factors are different, such that it is difficult to predict the surrogate marker for CoV efficacy. The best surrogate assays for protection as well as herd immunity toward different CoV infections warrant detailed investigations.
