<p>Recombinant adenovirus-based vaccine expressing MERS-CoV S protein induces systemic IgG, secretory IgA, and lung-resident memory T-cell responses when administered intranasally into BALB/c mice and provide long-lasting neutralizing immunity to MERS spike pseudotyped virus, thereby suggesting that the vaccine may confer protection against MERS-CoV.

 </sup> Furthermore, rabies virus (RV) as a viral vector as well as Gram-positive enhancer matrix (GEM) as a bacterial vector has been used to express MERS-CoV S protein. The immune responses to these vaccine candidates were evaluated in BALB/c mice for cellular and humoral immune responses, which showed that RV-based vaccine stimulates significantly higher levels of cellular immunity and earlier antibody responses in comparison to the GEM particle vector.
