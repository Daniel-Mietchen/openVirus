<p>The standard treatment regimen of twice daily IP injections of compounds in corn oil suspensions for five days beginning immediately after recovery from anesthesia was used to compare efficacy of individual drugs. The antiherpes drugs PFA, ACV, and CDF and the experimental compound HBPG protected animals from HSV-1 and/or HSV-2 encephalitic death following infection by the ocular route in a dose dependent manner. The ED
 <sub>50</sub> values (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-dddt-3-289">Table 1</xref>) show that CDF is by far the most effective drug, and that ACV and PFA have potencies within about twofold of each other. These results are consistent with reported activity of the drugs on HSV encephalitis in mice (see DeClercq and Hol√Ω).
