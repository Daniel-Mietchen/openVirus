<p>The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of ACV for plaque reduction in HSV-1 infected Vero cells (see Materials and methods) was 2.2 μg/mL, and that of HBPG was &gt;100 μg/mL. When 10 μg/mL of HBPG was present the apparent EC
 <sub>50</sub> of ACV increased to 7.5 μg/mL, suggesting antagonism of the antiviral effect. This result is consistent with observations for selective herpesvirus thymidine kinase inhibitors, which antagonize the activity of ACV in cell cultures (reviewed by Spadari and Wright).
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-dddt-3-289">14</xref> In contrast, the EC
 <sub>50</sub> of PFA for plaque reduction in HSV-1 infected Vero cells was 20 μg/mL in the absence and 18 μg/mL in the presence of 10 μg/mL HBPG. PFA is a pyrophosphate analog that does not require activation by thymidine kinase. Thus the apparent synergism between ACV and HBPG against HSV encephalitis involves a completely different mechanism than inhibition of thymidine kinase.
