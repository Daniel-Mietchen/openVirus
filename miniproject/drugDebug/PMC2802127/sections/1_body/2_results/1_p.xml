<p>Various routes of infection have been used to establish HSV encephalitis in mice, including intranasal,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12-dddt-3-289">12</xref> We used primarily ocular infection (see below) for comparison of drug–drug combination efficacy. Mean days of death after infection (MDD) in untreated animals were usually 9–10 with HSV-1 and 11–12 with HSV-2 infections. For comparison, in one experiment we used intranasal infection in which the MDDs for HSV-1 and HSV-2 were 9.1 and 9.9 days, respectively.
