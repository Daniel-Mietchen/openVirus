<p>Intravenous acyclovir (ACV) is the drug of choice for therapy of newborns with localized or disseminated HSV disease, although vidarabine and phosphonoformate (PFA) have also been used. Although these treatments have reduced mortality from encephalitis to 15%, only 50% of survivors develop normally.

Clearly there is a need for a superior antiviral drug which enters the CNS and inhibits infection and related neurological sequellae.
