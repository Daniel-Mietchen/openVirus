<p>The treatment of HSV infection in the CNS requires that the drug reach this tissue at an effective concentration and in a timely manner. HSV infection of an epithelial surface, for example the nasal passages or the cornea, results in entry of the virus into the peripheral nervous system in two days and the CNS in three days. Exactly how many viral particles reach the CNS initially or how many rounds of viral replication are necessary to produce encephalitis is not known. Temporal studies with HBPG showed that 7 of 10 mice were protected from HSV-2 encephalitic death when treatment was begun two days after infection (
