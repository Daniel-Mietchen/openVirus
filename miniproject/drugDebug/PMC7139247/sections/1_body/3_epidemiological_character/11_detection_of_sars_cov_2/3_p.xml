<p id="para0024">Besides RT-qPCR, Zhang et al. described a protocol using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK (Specific High-sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) technique for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Using synthetic SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA fragments, the authors found that this technique is able to consistently detect target sequences of SARS-CoV-2 in a range between 20 and 200 aM (10â€“100 copies per microlitre of input). This test can be read out using a dipstick in &lt;1 h, without requiring elaborate instrumentation 
 <xref rid="bib0063" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref>. Compared with RT-qPCR, the SHERLOCK technique is more accurate and the detection time is reduced by one-half. Thus, use of the SHERLOCK technique for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical patient samples is expected.
