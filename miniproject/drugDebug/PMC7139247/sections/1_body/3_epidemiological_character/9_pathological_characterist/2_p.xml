<p id="para0021">Recently, Xu et al. reported the pathological features of the first patient known to have died from SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. Biopsy samples were obtained from lung tissue of the patient and it was found that the pathological features of COVID-19 are related to ARDS. For example, evident desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation were seen in the lung tissue, indicating ARDS. Moreover, interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltration was observed in lung tissue. Multinucleated giant cells with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterised by large nuclei, prominent nucleoli and amphophilic granular cytoplasm were observed in the intra-alveolar spaces, suggesting viral cytopathic-like changes 
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>. These pathological characteristics of COVID-19 are highly similar to those seen in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection 
 <xref rid="bib0056" ref-type="bibr">[56</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0057" ref-type="bibr">57]</xref>. Taken together, understanding the pathological characteristics of this severe case of COVID-19 could help to provide new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2-infected pneumonia, which may help physicians to formulate a timely strategy for the treatment of similar severe patients and to decrease mortality.
