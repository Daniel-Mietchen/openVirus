<p id="para0016">The novel CoV can be transmitted between humans via respiratory droplets. Notably, the respiratory tract is probably not the only route of transmission. Close contact is also a source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. For example, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact with mucous membranes in the eyes, mouth or nose

 <xref rid="bib0039" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. There is also a possibility of aerosol transmission in a relatively closed environment with continuous exposure to high concentrations of aerosol. Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients have some gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting

However, additional studies are required to test this possibility. In addition, whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 can occur via breast milk or vertically from mother to infant has not been determined.
