<p id="para0012">Upon entry into alveolar epithelial cells, SARS-CoV-2 replicates rapidly and triggers a strong immune response, resulting in cytokine storm syndromes and pulmonary tissue damage. Cytokine storm syndromes, also known as hypercytokinaemia, are a group of disorders characterised by the uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and are important causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ failure

 <xref rid="bib0029" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. Analysis of the first 99 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed that cytokine storm syndromes occurred in patients with severe COVID-19; 17 patients (17%) had ARDS, among whom 11 (11%) deteriorated within a short period of time and died of multiple organ failure

 <sup>+</sup> T-cells and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cells are decreased in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the surviving T-cells are functionally exhausted
