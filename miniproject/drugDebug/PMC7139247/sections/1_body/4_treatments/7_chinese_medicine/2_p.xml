<p id="para0038">Glycyrrhizin, an active component of liquorice roots used in Chinese medicine, could effectively inhibit the replication of SARS-associated CoV in vitro 
 <xref rid="bib0108" ref-type="bibr">[108</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0109" ref-type="bibr">109]</xref>. Furthermore, high doses of glycyrrhizin have been used in clinical trials and the compound was reported to be clinically effective for the treatment of SARS at that time 
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">[110</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0111" ref-type="bibr">111]</xref>. Recently, glycyrrhizin was predicted to have the ability to bind ACE2 with potential anti-COVID-19 effects 
 <xref rid="bib0112" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>. Hesperetin, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine, is a natural predominant flavonoid found in citrus fruits. Hesperetin dose-dependently suppresses the cleavage activity of the 3C-like protease (3CLpro) of SARS-CoV in cell-free and cell-based assays 
 <xref rid="bib0113" ref-type="bibr">[113]</xref>. Hesperetin was also reported to have the potential to inhibit ACE2 and therefore block infection with SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="bib0112" ref-type="bibr">[112]</xref>. Baicalin, another traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is a flavone isolated from 
 <italic>Scutellaria baicalensis</italic>. It has been shown that baicalin has antiviral activity against 10 clinical isolates of SARS-CoV by neutralisation tests 
 <xref rid="bib0114" ref-type="bibr">[114]</xref>. In addition, quercetin is a plant flavone that is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine and botanical medicine. Quercetin was reported to exert antiviral effects by inhibiting the 3CLpro of SARS-CoV 
 <xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr">[115]</xref> and blocking the entry of SARS-CoV into host cells 
 <xref rid="bib0116" ref-type="bibr">[116]</xref>. Therefore, these studies suggest that Chinese medicine also plays a key role in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.
