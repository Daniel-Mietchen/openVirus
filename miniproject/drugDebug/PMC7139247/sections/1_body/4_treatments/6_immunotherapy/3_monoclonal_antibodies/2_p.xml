<p id="para0037">Remission of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic may depend on the development of monoclonal antibodies. Previous studies have identified a number of effective monoclonal antibodies that target the SARS-CoV spike protein to prevent the virus from entering host cells

 <xref rid="bib0104" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">[105]</xref>. The 193-amino acid (residues 318â€“510) receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein is the key target of neutralising monoclonal antibodies 
 <xref rid="bib0106" ref-type="bibr">[106]</xref>. The SARS-CoV neutralising monoclonal antibodies CR3014 and CR3022 were found to bind non-competitively to the SARS-CoV RBD and neutralised the virus in a synergistic manner 
 <xref rid="bib0104" ref-type="bibr">[104]</xref>. A recent study showed that CR3022 could combine effectively with SARS-CoV-2 RBD (K
 <sub>D</sub> of 6.3 nM) 
 <xref rid="bib0107" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. Moreover, the epitope of CR3022 does not overlap with the binding site of ACE2 in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD 
 <xref rid="bib0107" ref-type="bibr">[107]</xref>. Thus, CR3022 could be a promising therapeutic candidate, alone or in combination with other neutralising monoclonal antibodies, for the treatment of COVID-19 pneumonia.
