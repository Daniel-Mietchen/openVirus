<p id="para0036">Antiviral antibodies (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD) found in convalescent plasma from recovered patients can effectively treat patients with viral infections. Convalescent plasma therapy has been widely used in infectious diseases such as poliomyelitis, influenza A (H5N1) and Ebola

 <xref rid="bib0099" ref-type="bibr">[99]</xref>. In addition, such passive immunisation can also be achieved by using convalescent plasma from patients with SARS-CoV infection. It has been reported that a small number of SARS-CoV-infected patients in Taiwan and Hong Kong received treatment with convalescent plasma during the early course of the disease with certain clinical benefits, including a reduction of plasma viral load from ~10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/mL to undetectable levels 24 h after plasma transfusion

 <xref rid="bib0102" ref-type="bibr">[102]</xref>. Thus, convalescent plasma could, theoretically, be a promising option for the treatment and prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, although this has not been tested clinically.
