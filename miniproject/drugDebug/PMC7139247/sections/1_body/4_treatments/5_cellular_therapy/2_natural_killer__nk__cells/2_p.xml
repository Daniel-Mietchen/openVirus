<p id="para0034">NK cells are important immune cells necessary for defence against microbe-infected, stressed or malignant cells. Human NK cells lyse antibody-coated virus-infected cells via the process of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
 <xref rid="bib0086" ref-type="bibr">[86]</xref>. In this way, NK cells are specific to almost all virus-infected cells. Several studies have shown that NK cells can exert antiviral activity by mediating ADCC against SARS-CoV, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus and HIV

 <xref rid="bib0089" ref-type="bibr">[89]</xref>. Umbilical cord blood is a promising source of allogeneic NK cells. Recently, Sorrento and Celularity have announced the launch of a clinical collaboration aimed at extending the use of CYNK-001, an allogeneic, off-the-shelf, umbilical cord blood-derived NK cell therapy, to the treatment of the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 infection 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[90]</xref>. Whilst developing new drugs, new vaccines or clinical trials of old drugs, carrying out NK cell therapy to enhance immunity is currently a very feasible strategy for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 pneumonia.
