 <caption> Substrate specificity of the PEDV 3CL pro at the P2 site and the optimization of GC376. ( A) The structure of PEDV 3CL pro-GC376 (light magenta) is superimposed over the complex structure of PEDV 3CL pro-peptide (yellow, PDB: 4ZUH). GC376 and the peptide substrate are shown as sticks with balls. The P1, P2 and P3 residues of the substrate and the Leu residue of GC376 are shown and labeled; ( B) an enzyme (100 nM) and fluorescent peptide substrates (40 Î¼M) were used in the FRET assay. The relative fluorescence units (RFU) detected upon cleavage of the fluorescent peptide substrate and its seven variants by the PEDV 3CL pro are shown in the figure; ( C, D) viability of YN144-infected Vero cells after treatment with the two GC376 variants, Target 1 (L-M) and Target 2 (L-F), was measured using the Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). EC 50 values were calculated using GraphPad Prism5 to assess inhibition ratios at different inhibitor concentrations. The structures of the two compounds are shown in the figure, and their modification sites are labeled. All the error bars show the S.D. of the results from three replicates. </caption>
