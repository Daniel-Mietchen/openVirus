  <p>Western blot analysis of the effects of GC376 on the replication of two PEDV strains in cell culture. (
   <bold>A</bold>,
   <bold>B</bold>) Vero cells were infected with one of two PEDV strains at an MOI of 0.01 and then treated with GC376 at different concentrations. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blotting for nucleocapsid expression, and GAPDH was used as an internal control. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Indirect immunofluorescence assays are shown. The white bar measure is 400 Î¼m. YN144 was used to infect cells at an MOI of 0.01, and GC376 was added to the cells at a series of concentrations. The cells were treated with primary antibody (anti PEDV N) and then a FITC-labeled secondary antibody. The cells infected by viruses were captured in green as shown in the picture.
