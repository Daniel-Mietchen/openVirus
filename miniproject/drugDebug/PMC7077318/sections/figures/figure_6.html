 <caption> Structure alignment between the PEDV 3CL pro–GC376 and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CL pro–GC376. ( A) The structure of PEDV 3CL pro–GC376 (red) is superimposed with the complex structure of TGEV 3CL pro–GC376 (blue). GC376 is shown as sticks with balls, and the residues of 3CL pro involved in binding with GC376 are labeled and shown as lines. The conserved residues between the two 3CL pros are labeled in black and nonconserved residues are labeled in different colors. The black arrows indicate the structural deviation of the Leu side chain and 6-membered aromatic ring of GC376 between the two structures and ( B) the root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for the residues involved in the GC376 binding of the two structures. </caption>
