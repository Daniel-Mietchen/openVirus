 <caption> Antiviral effects of GC376 on the replication of two PEDV strains in cell culture. ( A) CV777 was added at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 with a series of GC376 concentrations (0.78 μM, 1.56 μM, 3.13 μM, 6.25 μM, 12.5 μM, 25 μM, 50 μM and 100 μM). Cell viability was measured using Celltiter-Glo Luminescent Cell Viability Assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) at 36 h. Finally, the 50% maximal effect (EC 50) values were calculated using GraphPad Prism 5 to assess inhibition ratios at different inhibitor concentrations. The error bars show the S.D. of the results from three replicates. ( B) The EC 50 of YN144 was measured as above except that the cell viability was measured at 12h. The error bars show the S.D. of the results from three replicates. </caption>
