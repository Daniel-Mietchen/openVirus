 <caption> Structure of GC376 and the inhibitory effect of GC376 on the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) 3CL pro determined by FRET assays. ( A) GC376 is a dipeptidyl bisulfite adduct salt that showed excellent inhibitory effects on some picornaviruses and coronaviruses in enzymatic or cell-based assays and ( B) an enzyme (100 nM) and a fluorescent peptide substrate (40 μM) were used in the FRET assay, and the concentration of GC376 ranged from 0.03 μM to 80 μM. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was calculated using GraphPad Prism5 to assess inhibition ratios at different inhibitor concentrations. The error bars show the S.D. of the results from three replicates. </caption>
