<p>The crystal of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> for GC 376 soaking was obtained as described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. GC376 was dissolved in elution buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 200 mM NaCl) at a concentration of 6 mM and then added to the crystallization drop at an equal volume. The crystals were soaked for 16 h before being flash-frozen. The single crystals were first washed with 5%, 10%, 15% and 30% ethylene glycol (

All data collection was performed at beamline BL17U at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) using a MAR 225 CCD detector (MAR Research). The data sets were indexed, integrated and scaled using HKL-3000 (Charlottesville, VA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B41-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement with PHASER (Phenix, Berkeley, CA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B42-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] using the structure of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> (PDB identifier 4XFQ) as a starting model. Manual model building was performed using Coot (Oxon, UK) [
 <xref rid="B43-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], and the structure was refined with Phenix (Berkeley, CA, USA) [
 <xref rid="B44-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Refinement statistics are shown in 
 <xref rid="viruses-12-00240-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. All of the structural figures were drawn using PyMOL (Schr√∂dinger). Coordinate and structure factors have been submitted to the PDB (accession number 6L70).
