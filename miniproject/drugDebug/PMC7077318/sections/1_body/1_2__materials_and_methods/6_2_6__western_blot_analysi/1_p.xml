<p>Vero cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well. When cells had grown to 80%–90% confluence, the virus was inoculated into the cells at an MOI of 0.01 with the same GC376 concentrations as those used for the EC
 <sub>50</sub> measurements. After incubating at 37 °C for 12 h and 36 h for YN144 and CV777 respectively, the cells were lysed in a lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) on ice. The supernatants were used for Western blot assays. After SDS-PAGE, the proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). After blocking with 5% skimmed milk at room temperature for 3 h, the membranes were incubated with an anti-PEDV nucleocapsid (N) protein monoclonal antibody and an anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody (Proteintech, Rosemont, IL, USA) for 2 h. Then, the membranes were incubated with an HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Boster Biological Technology, Pleasanton, CA, USA) for 40 min. The membranes were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Imager 600, GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA), and the nucleocapsid protein level was normalized to the GAPDH protein level.
