<p>The strategy for plasmid construction, protein expression and purification of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> was described in a previous study [
 <xref rid="B40-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Briefly, the coding sequence (from the FJZZ strain) with a C-terminal His
 <sub>6</sub>-tag was inserted into the pET42b (+) vector. Proteins were induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 27 °C for 7 h. A His TrapTM HP column (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) and a 120-mL Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) column were used for protein purification.
