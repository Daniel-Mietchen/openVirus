<p>This strategy is also applicable to coronaviruses, which encode a 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> responsible for viral polyprotein cleavage. Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Î± coronavirus, is one of the major threats to the swine industry worldwide. The development of antiviral drugs targeting 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is an important strategy to prevent PEDV epidemics. The global outbreak of SARS in 2003 accelerated study on anti-coronavirus inhibitor development, and many researchers have been committed to developing broad-spectrum antiviral inhibitors against coronavirus 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>.
