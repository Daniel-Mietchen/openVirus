<p>Subsequently, we detected the anti-PEDV effect of GC376 on cells. Two PEDV strains were selected for evaluation of their antiviral effects. Sequence alignment of the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>s from the CV777 and YN144 strains revealed seven different residues. However, both EC
 <sub>50</sub> and Western blot assays showed similar antiviral effects for GC376 on the two virus strains (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f003">Figure 3</xref>). The seven residues that differ between the CV777 and YN144 strains were not involved in the binding pocket and thus had no obvious influence on the antiviral effect. GC376 exhibits potent antiviral activities with high nanomolar EC
 <sub>50</sub> values against TGEV and FIPV [

 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. However, we obtained low micromolar EC
 <sub>50</sub> values against both PEDV strains. We analyzed the binding details of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>-GC376 complex and another available 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>-GC376 structure from another coronavirus (TGEV). However, most of the residues involved in GC376 binding are conserved. Only the loop (46-49) and entrance size show some differences (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f006">Figure 6</xref>). However, considering that the activities of these proteins at the biochemical level are not as different as those at the cellular level, the structural differences may not be the only reason for the difference in GC376 antiviral activities between PEDV and TGEV (or FIPV) observed in the cellular assays. The antiviral effect is more complicated at the cellular level and may be affected by the expression level of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, other viral replication characteristics, or the pharmacokinetics of GC376 in different host cells.
