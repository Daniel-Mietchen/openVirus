<p>Further animal experiments are required to evaluate its therapeutic effects on porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in piglets. In general, GC376 exerted an excellent inhibitory effect on different PEDV strains by targeting its 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>, which has great potential, and could be modified to produce strong therapeutic effects on animals. Our study provides more information for the optimization of inhibitors.
