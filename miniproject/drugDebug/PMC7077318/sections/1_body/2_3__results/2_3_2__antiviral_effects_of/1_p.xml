<p>Before determining the inhibitory effects of GC376 on viruses in Vero cells, we tested the cytotoxicity of the compound. GC376 had no cytotoxicity up to a concentration of 200 μM (data not shown). GC376 at a series of concentrations was used to evaluate the suppression of two PEDV strains. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of GC376 against CV777 and YN144 were similar, namely, 11.18 μM and 14.63 μM, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The results imply that GC376 should efficiently inhibit the replication of different PEDV strains, possibly because of the conserved catalytic core of 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. It is also notable that YN144 caused a cytopathic effect (CPE) much faster than CV777 (12 h and 36 h respectively); however, GC376 showed similar inhibitory effects with different treatment times for the two viruses, which indicates that GC376 quickly enters the cell and blocks viral 3CL
