<p>To explore whether replacement of the P2-Leu of GC376 with different residues could improve the inhibitory effects, two GC376 variants were synthesized. In Target 1, Leu is replaced with Met, which has a longer side chain; in Target 2, Leu is replaced with Phe, which has a side chain with a larger volume. The EC
 <sub>50</sub> of the two compounds fir YN144 infection was measured to evaluate optimization effects. Targets 1 and 2 yielded EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 65.7 μM and 80.0 μM respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00240-f005">Figure 5</xref>C,D). Both showed higher EC
 <sub>50</sub> values compared to GC376, which has a leucine. As a consequence, GC376 with Leu shows the highest inhibitory effects on PEDV infection.
