<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which was first observed in Europe in 1971 [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and causes severe diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in neonatal piglets, resulting in severe agricultural loss [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Since PEDV was first identified, outbreaks have been reported in many swine-producing countries, notably in Europe and Asia. Before 2010, several commercial vaccines were widely used to control the spread of PEDV in Asia [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, since 2010, frequent outbreaks of highly virulent strains of PEDV have occurred in Asia, and these outbreaks have been particularly severe in China [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The vaccines based on classic strains failed to control infection [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Furthermore, a vaccine-resistant PEDV strain emerged in the United States for the first time and spread rapidly throughout the country, causing large economic losses in the swine industry [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Subsequently, North America, Europe and Asia have also been attacked by a new PEDV strain [
 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although newly developed vaccines provide efficient protection, vaccine resistance may still appear in the future due to the genetic diversity of epitopes among different virus genotypes [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Thus, it is necessary to develop other strategies to protect against PEDV infection.
