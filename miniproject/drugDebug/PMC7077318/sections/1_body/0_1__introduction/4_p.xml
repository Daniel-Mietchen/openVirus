<p>In this study, we detected the inhibitory effects of GC376 on the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>. The antiviral effects of the inhibitor were studied using two PEDV strains, namely, CV777 and YN144. Finally, we determined the structure of the PEDV 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> in complex with GC376 and compared this structure with other available 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> structures. Our study provides a structural model for the development of anti-PEDV drugs and further enriches structural knowledge for the optimization of broad-spectrum anticoronavirus drugs.
