<p>Like all the other coronaviruses (CoVs), PEDV has a RNA genome that encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The majority of synthesized polyproteins are cleaved by 3C-like protease (3CL
 <sup>pro</sup>; main protease, Nsp5) at 11 conserved sites, which are essential for viral replication [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Thus, 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> is an appealing target in the design of anticoronavirus therapies [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Notably, the 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> proteins of different coronaviruses share higher sequence identity and have a more conserved catalytic core than the spike proteins of the same coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], which makes 3CL
 <sup>pro</sup> an ideal broad-spectrum antiviral target [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,
 <xref rid="B25-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furthermore, two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), that both came from animals made people aware of the importance of the cross-species transmission of coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,
 <xref rid="B29-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,
 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00240" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Since people have easy access to swine, the potential for cross-species transmission of PEDV should not be ignored. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new anti-PEDV therapies.
