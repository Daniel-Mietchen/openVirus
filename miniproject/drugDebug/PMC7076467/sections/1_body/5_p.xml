<p>Tzeyung et al. made an interesting study whose aim was the development and evaluation of rotigotine-loaded chitosan nanoparticles for nose-to-brain delivery [
 <xref rid="B3-pharmaceutics-12-00138" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Rotigotine is a non-ergoline dopamine D1/D2/D3 agonist that is used in the therapy of Parkinson’s disease. The nanoparticles were prepared by the ionic gelation method and were in vitro characterized. Ex vivo permeation studies were carried out using goat nasal mucosa. The effect of the application of the nanoparticles on the structure of nasal mucosa was determined by a histopathological study of untreated goat mucosa and goat mucosa subjected to 24 h of the permeation test. The results obtained from in vitro release tests showed that the nanoparticles are characterized by a sustained drug release. The histopathological examination of nasal mucosa showed no toxicity or structural damages. The results obtained by this work show that rotigotine loaded chitosan nanoparticles represent a potential formulation for nose-to-brain delivery to be used in the therapy of Parkinson’s disease.
