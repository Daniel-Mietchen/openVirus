<p id="Par2">In December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus occurred in Wuhan, Hubei province, and has spread rapidly throughout China, with an ongoing risk of a pandemic

 </sup>. After virus identification and isolation, the pathogen for this pneumonia was originally called 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup> but has subsequently been officially named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirusÂ 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the WHO. On 30 January 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. Compared with the SARS-CoV that caused an outbreak of SARS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 has a stronger transmission capacity. The rapid increase in confirmed cases makes the prevention and control of COVID-19 extremely serious. Although the clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are dominated by respiratory symptoms, some patients have severe cardiovascular damage

 </sup>. In addition, some patients with underlying cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) might have an increased risk of death

 </sup>. Therefore, understanding the damage caused by SARS-CoV-2 to the cardiovascular system and the underlying mechanisms is of the greatest importance, so that treatment of these patients can be timely and effective and mortality reduced.
