<p id="Par11">Compounds consisting the carbon-phosphorous bond are rare in nature and were considered non-existent till recently. It was in 1924 that phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) was first synthesized and its antiviral activity was discovered almost 50 years later in 1973 (Shipkowitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1973</xref>). The discovery of PAA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">22.4</xref>) as an antiviral drug gave rise to intense research on its biological activities, which demonstrated PAA and its derivatives’ ability to inhibit the replication of a number of viruses such as immunodeficiency, hepatitis and herpes viruses. In animal studies it was shown that PAA is active against herpes keratitis in rabbits and herpes dermatitis in mice. PAA and its derivatives being analogues of antimetabolites of pyrophosphates have their action against herpes viruses, especially in Epstein–Barr virus, CMV and HSV, through inhibiting DNA polymerase, which is important in herpes virus replication (Alimbarova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2015</xref>; Overby et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1974</xref>). In addition, it was depicted in a study that polymerase activity was inhibited in lysed cultures of infected cells by PAA without affecting the enzyme in normal cells. Polymerases from both normal and infected cells were highly purified and investigated to verify their differential sensitivity towards PAA (Mao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1975</xref>).
