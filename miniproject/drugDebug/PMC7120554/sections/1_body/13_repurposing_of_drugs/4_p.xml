<p id="Par19">Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a complex lentivirus causing immunodeficiency disease in cats, manifested as the bodyâ€™s inability to develop normal immune response. As a retrovirus, it inserts copies of its genetic material into the DNA of a host cell, where it can replicate. The most commonly used antiretroviral drugs are reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs), in particular the ones acting as nucleoside analogues, which are similar in structure to intrinsic nucleosides and can therefore block enzymatic activity by binding to the active centre of the enzyme (Hartmann et al.

The first among them, zidovudine (AZT), has been reported to improve the immunologic and clinical status of FIV-infected cats, increase quality of life as well as prolong life expectancy. It has been shown to increase the CD4/CD8 ratio in naturally FIV-infected cats and acts by inhibiting RT but also cellular polymerases, which can lead to bone marrow suppression (Hartmann

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2014</xref>). Additionally, a combination of zidovudine and lamivudine has been investigated, resulting in synergistic anti-FIV effects in cell cultures. Also, a high-dose zidovudine/lamivudine combination was shown to protect from infection when treatment was initiated before virus inoculation (Arai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2002</xref>). Moreover, all of the above-mentioned antiviral agents are also effective against HIV infection.
