<p id="Par22">Antiviral drugs and vaccines are the most powerful tools to combat viral diseases. However, they mostly selectively target only a single virus, known as a “one drug–one bug” principle. On the contrary, broad-spectrum antivirals (BSAs) cover multiple viruses and genotypes, therefore reducing the likelihood of resistance development. They can, hence, reduce the complexity of the treatment, ensuring management of new or drug-resistant viral strains, first-line treatment or prophylaxis of acute infections, as well as co-infections (Zhu et al.

They act on NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors or NS5B inhibitors and ensure efficient, tolerable, safe and interferon-free oral therapies (Das and Pandya

Furthermore, further development of antiviral agents will not only focus on viral factors as the potential targets for inhibition but also on the host factors as well, such as cellular receptors, adhesion molecules, cyclophilins and microRNAs. Therefore, an effort will be put on the combination of viral and host inhibitors, eventually leading to interferon-free therapies for consistent clearing of infection (Bryan-Marrugo et al.
