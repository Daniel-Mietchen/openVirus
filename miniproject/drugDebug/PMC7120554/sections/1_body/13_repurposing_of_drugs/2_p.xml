<p id="Par17">Modification of specific or non-specific immune responses is a promising intervention for ongoing viral infections. The most suitable for immunotherapy are chronic viral infections (Hegde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). The first example is monoclonal antibodies, which are specific for one to one antigen or one epitope. In fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells, monoclonal antibodies specific for nucleoprotein and non-structural protein of the nucleocapsid have been shown to inhibit rabies virus, in a dose-dependent way, by impairing transcription of the genome or neutralizing newly translated proteins (Lafon and Lafage 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1987</xref>). In addition, another study found that monospecific antibody against rabies virus nucleoprotein recognizes lyssavirus-specific antigen (Inoue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2003</xref>). Monospecific antibodies have shown to be effective against non-capsid proteins of poliovirus (Pasamontes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1986</xref>) and various livestock diseases as rotaviral diarrhoea, bluetongue, classical swine fever, Hendra and Nipah viral infections (Deb et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2013</xref>). Neutralization by antibody can be mediated by different mechanisms such as destabilization of the virion structure, aggregation of virions, inhibition of virion attachment to target cells, inhibition of the virion lipid membrane fusion with the membrane of the host cell, inhibition of the entry of the genome of non-enveloped viruses into the cell cytoplasm and inhibition of a function of the virion core through a signal transduced by an antibody (Reading and Dimmock 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2007</xref>). Another therapeutic strategy for infectious viral diseases are recombinant antibodies, which, unlike monoclonal antibodies, do not need hybridomas and animals in the production process, but only synthetic antibody coding genes, and are delivered in high reproducibility, specificity and scalability (Echko and Dozier 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Examples include avian antibody against VP2 of infectious bursal disease virus protecting against viral infection in chicken (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2017</xref>), porcine circovirus type 2 (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2014</xref>), the E2 protein of classical swine fever virus (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2018</xref>) and capsid protein of bovine immunodeficiency virus (Bhatia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>).
