<p id="Par6">Penciclovir [9-(4-hydroxy-3-hydroxymethylbut-1-yl)] is guanosine analogue that resembles acyclovir in structure, mechanism of action and antiviral activity spectrum. Comparing to acyclovir, penciclovir-triphosphate accumulates in virus-infected cells in much higher concentrations and for longer half-life (10–20 times longer than acyclovir) (Salvaggio and Gnann

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1996</xref>). However, it is less potent than acyclovir triphosphate as it exhibits lower affinity for viral DNA polymerase enzyme, which would allow lower and less frequent dosage in clinical use. In vitro studies have proven its efficacy against FFHV-1 virus and hepatitis B virus (Dannaoui et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1996</xref>). Because of penciclovir’s poor oral bioavailability (&lt;5%), famciclovir was developed as the oral formulation (Salvaggio and Gnann
