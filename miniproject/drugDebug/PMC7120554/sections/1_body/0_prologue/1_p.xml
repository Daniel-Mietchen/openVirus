<p id="Par2">Vaccine development has long been the first and foremost approach in the control of viral diseases (Saminathan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2016</xref>). However, with the development of the first human antiviral drug, idoxuridine, and its later approval in 1963, a new era of antiviral treatment development began (De Clercq and Li 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>). Because of viral replication cycle, which involves usage of host cell biochemical machinery, antiviral drugs can also affect the function of the host’s pathways resulting in the great risk of toxicity. Therefore, the major concern in antiviral drug development is the identification of specific targets with increased selectivity and reduced side effects, which limit the therapeutic use of antiviral drugs in comparison to antibacterial agents (Dal Pozzo and Thiry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>). In the early 1900s, state-of-the-art review articles on antiviral chemotherapy in veterinary medicine listed several drawbacks of low antiviral drugs use in veterinary medicine. Those included usage restricted to a single virus and specific animal species, problems with high spectrum activity and low cytotoxicity, high costs of development of new chemical compounds and absence of rapid diagnostic techniques allowing prompt use of a specific antiviral agent in the course of an acute infection (Rollinson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1992a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">b</xref>). Most of the antiviral drugs used in animal medicine have been originally developed against human viral infections and their clinical use in veterinary medicine is not widespread and common. Nevertheless, several licensed human antiviral agents are being used with cascade principle for treatment of animal diseases (e.g. acyclovir, idoxuridine and trifluridine against feline herpesvirus-1 ocular infection in cats) (Thiry et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2009</xref>). Currently, the only licensed antiviral drug in veterinary medicine is feline interferon-omega (IFN-ω), whose mechanism of action involves a combination of antiviral and immunostimulatory activity (De Clercq and Li 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>; Bracklein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>). Most antiviral agents interfere with the synthesis or regulation of viral nucleic acids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">22.1</xref>) and act by nucleoside analogues that block elongation of newly synthetized DNA or RNA chain. Other antiviral agents used in veterinary medicine act as neuraminidase (oseltamivir) or amino acid (L-lysine) inhibitors, while novel treatment options such as small inhibitory RNAs are also under investigation (Dal Pozzo and Thiry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>; Sykes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">2013</xref>). In recent years, the use of antiviral agents in veterinary medicine has become more favourable with growing interest in its research. This is partially due to successful outcomes of antiviral therapy in some human diseases and partially due to advances in internal veterinary medicine with the development of novel and sophisticated diagnostic and treatment protocols. In addition to that, current measures for control of viral infections such as vaccination or removal of infected animals from breeding stock by culling have many limitations. Therefore, antiviral agents represent a promising alternative for the treatment of viral diseases in veterinary medicine (Dal Pozzo and Thiry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2014</xref>).
