<p id="Par13">The antiviral potential of antibacterial drugs has been studied on various drugs. Minocycline is among the well investigated for its actions against a number of ailments. It is a synthetic second-generation tetracycline derivative with immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory action and widely used for the treatment of acne, rheumatoid arthritis and UTIs. Potential antiviral action of minocycline against human immunodeficiency virus, Japanese encephalitis virus and West Nile virus has been reported. It was also found promising in reducing 
 <italic>dengue virus</italic> infection, with a prompt action against all the four serotypes of the virus. Minocycline generally diminished viral RNA synthesis, intracellular viral protein synthesis and thus infectious virus production. It was also found to decrease ERK1/2 phosphorylation, which is associated with intensifying pathogenesis and organ damage in 
 <italic>dengue virus</italic> infection (Leela et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2016</xref>). Furthermore, the quinolones have showed an antiviral activity towards HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in addition to their antibacterial and anticancer activity. Particularly the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and amodiaquine displayed activity against viruses like dengue virus, West Nile virus and Ebola virus by interfering with viral entry and replication (Savoia

 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> member, 
 <italic>Actinoplanes teichomyceticus</italic>, is a fermentation product that exerts bactericidal action through inhibiting bacterial cell wall biosynthesis. This semisynthetic glycopeptide teicoplanin showed a significant inhibitory activity against Ebola envelope pseudotyped viruses in Vero cells when used in the clinic. Besides, teicoplanin and other glycopeptide antibiotics, including dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin, but not vancomycin, had inhibitory action against the entry of Ebola virus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV transcription and replication-competent virus-like particles. With regard to teicoplaninâ€™s antiviral activity, various studies have reported about its action against HIV, hepatitis C virus, flaviviruses, coronaviruses, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza virus (Colson and Raoult
