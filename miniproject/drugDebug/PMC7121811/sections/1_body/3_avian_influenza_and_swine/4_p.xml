<p id="Par46">Formulation using calcium phosphate NPs vaccine adjuvant and delivery platform to formulate an inactivated whole virus pandemic influenza A/CA/04/2009 (H1N1pdm) vaccine as a potential dose-sparing strategy that was intramuscularly administered to BALI/c mice at doses 0.3, 1, or 3 μg (based on HA content) resulted in higher HAI, virus neutralization, and IgG antibody titers compared to the nonadjuvanted vaccine, providing equal protection with one-third of the antigen dose as compared to the nonadjuvanted or alum (hydrated double sulfate salts of aluminum with potassium, sodium, or ammonium)-adjuvanted vaccine (Morcol et al.

Solution of nanoscale scallop shell powder produced by calcination process showing a size of 500 nm inactivated AIV within 5 s, whereas the solution of greater powder particles (20 μm) could not even after 1 h incubation. Moreover, inactivation of Newcastle disease virus and goose parvovirus solution by nanopowder within 5 and 30 s, respectively, was observed as well (Thammakarn et al.
