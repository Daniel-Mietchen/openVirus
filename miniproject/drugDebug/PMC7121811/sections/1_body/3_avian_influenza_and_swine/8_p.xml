<p id="Par50">Mucosal vaccination of conserved matrix protein 2, fusion peptide of hemagglutinin HA
 <sub>2</sub> and cholera toxin subunit Al (CTAI) fusion protein with poly- γ-glutamate/CS NPs induced protection against divergent influenza subtypes and was found to induce a high degree of systemic immunity (IgG and IgA) at the site of inoculation and in challenge tests in BALI/c mice with several viruses (H5N1, H1N1, H5N2, H7N3, or H9N2) provided cross protection against divergent lethal influenza subtypes up to 6 months after vaccination (Chowdhury et al.

 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses after intramuscular or intradermal delivery in rhesus macaques (Liang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2017</xref>). The results of hemagglutination inhibition and micro-neutralization assays showed that lipid NP-formulated modified mRNA vaccines encoding HA proteins of H10N8 (A/Jiangxi-Donghu/346/2013) or H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/2013) generated rapid and robust immune responses in mice, ferrets, and nonhuman primates, and a single dose of H7N9 mRNA was able to protect mice from a lethal challenge and reduced lung viral titers in ferrets (Bahl et al.
