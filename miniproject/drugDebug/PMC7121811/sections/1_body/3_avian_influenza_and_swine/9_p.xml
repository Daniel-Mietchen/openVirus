<p id="Par51">Coated two-layer protein nanoclusters from recombinant trimeric HA from an avian-origin H7N9 influenza that were evaluated for the virus-specific immune responses and protective efficacy in mice immunized with these nanoclusters were found to be highly immunogenic; they were able to induce protective immunity and long-lasting humoral antibody responses to this virus without the use of adjuvants, suggesting that such coated nanoclusters also have great potential for influenza vaccine production not only in response to an emerging pandemic, but also as a replacement for conventional seasonal influenza vaccines (Wang et al.
