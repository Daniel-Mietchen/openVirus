<p id="Par72">HBsAg-loaded trimethyl CS (TMC)/hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (hypromellose) phthalate (HPMCP) NPs with particle size of 158 nm showing loading capacity and loading efficiency of 76.75% and 86.29%, respectively, at 300 μg/mL concentration of the antigen exhibited improved acid stability and better protection of entrapped HBsAg from gastric destruction in vitro, whereby the antigen showed efficacious activity also after loading. Based on these findings it could be suggested that TMC/HPMCP NPs have potential to be applied in the oral delivery of HBsAg vaccine (Farhadian et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2015</xref>) studied the inhibition of the replication of duck hepatitis B virus (DHBV), a reference model for human HBV infection, by peptide nucleic acid (PNA) conjugated to different cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) and found that the PNA-CPP conjugates administered to neonatal ducklings reached the liver and inhibited DHBV replication, and in mouse model conjugation of HBV DNA vaccine to modified CS ameliorated cellular and humoral responses to plasmid-encoded antigen and plasmid DNA uptake, whereby expression could also be notably increased using gene delivery systems such as CPP-modified CS or cationic NPs.
