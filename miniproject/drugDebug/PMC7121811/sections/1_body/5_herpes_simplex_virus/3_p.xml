<p id="Par59">ZnO micro-nano structures capped with multiple nanoscopic spikes mimicking cell induced filopodia and showing partially negatively charged oxygen vacancies on their nanoscopic spikes, after trapping the virions rendered them unable to enter into human corneal fibroblastsâ€”a natural target cell for HSV-1 infection and exhibited pronouncedly enhanced anti-HSV-1 effect creating additional oxygen vacancies under UV light illumination (Mishra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2011</xref>). Intravaginal ZnO tetrapod NPs with engineered oxygen vacancies, when used intravaginally, acted as a microbicide and were found to be an effective suppressor of HSV-2 genital infection in female BALB/c mice, suppressing also a reinfection, and exhibited strong adjuvant-like properties as well (Antoine et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>). The antiviral effects of ZnO tetrapods can be enhanced by illuminating with UV light (Antoine et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2012</xref>).
