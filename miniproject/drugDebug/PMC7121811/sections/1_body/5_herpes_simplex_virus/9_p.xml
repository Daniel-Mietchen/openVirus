<p id="Par65">Enhanced antiviral activity against a clinical isolate of HSV-1 was determined using ACV-loaded spherical carboxylated cyclodextrin-based nanosponges carrying carboxylic groups with the size of about 400 nm that exhibited prolonged release in comparison with that observed with nanosponges, without initial burst effect (Lembo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2013</xref>). The formulation of ACV-loaded flexible membrane vesicles with particle size and zeta potential of 453.7 nm and −11.62 mV, respectively, incorporated into a hydrogel enhanced retention of drug deep inside the skin layers indicating potentially reduced need of application frequency resulting in reducing of adverse effects and suitability of such formulation for topical application against HSV-1 infection (Sharma et al.
