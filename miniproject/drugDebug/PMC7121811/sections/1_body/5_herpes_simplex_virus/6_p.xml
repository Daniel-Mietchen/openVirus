<p id="Par62">Graphene sheets uniformly anchored with spherical sulfonated magnetic NPs were able to capture and photothermally destroy HSV-1 upon irradiation with near-infrared light (808 nm, 7 min) (Deokar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2017</xref>). Graphene sheets approx. 300 nm in size and with a degree of sulfation of approx. 10% were found to operate as effective viral inhibitor and inhibited HSV infection at an early stage during entry but did not affect cell-to-cell spread (Ziem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">2017</xref>). A multivalent 2D flexible carbon architecture fabricated using reduced GO functionalized with sulfated dendritic polyglycerol to mimic the HS-containing surface of cells and to compete with this natural binding site of viruses demonstrated excellent binding as well as efficient inhibition of the infection with orthopoxvirus possessing a HS-dependent cell entry mechanism (Ziem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR249">2016</xref>). Carbon nanodots surface-functionalized with 4-aminophenylboronic acid hydrochloride prevented HSV-1 infection on Vero and A549 cells and showed EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 80 and 145 ng/mL, respectively, specifically acting on the early stage of virus entry (Barras et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2016</xref>).
