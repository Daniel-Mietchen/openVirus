<p id="Par66">ACV entrapped in nanostructured lipid carriers coated with CS increased the corneal bioavailability in albino rabbits by 4.5-fold when compared to a commercially available ophthalmic ointment of drug, whereby this nanoformulation showed sustained release and improved antiviral properties of ACV through cell internalization (Seyfoddin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2016</xref>). The ACV-loaded CS NPs showing a spherical shape, a size approx. 200 nm, and a zeta potential approx. −40.0 mV showed improved in vitro skin permeation and higher antiviral activity than the free drug against both the HSV-1 and the HSV-2 strains (Donalisio et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2018</xref>). CS as an immunomodulating adjuvant on T cells and antigen-presenting cells in HSV-1 infected mice was reported by Choi et al. (

In the dendritic cell-based DNA vaccine (pRSC-NLDC145.gD-IL21) carried by CS NPs, the expressed glycoprotein D in the formulation effectively targeted corneal dendritic cells and significantly alleviated the symptoms of both primary and recurrent HSV keratitis in mice via eliciting strong humoral and cellular immune response suggesting that such vaccine could be successfully used in
