<p id="Par4">Recent findings related to development of virus-based nanoparticle (NP) systems as vaccines estimated for the prevention or treatment of infectious diseases, chronic diseases, cancer, and addiction were summarized by Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2016</xref>), while Jackman et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2016</xref>) focused their attention on the progress in application of nanomedicine strategies to control critical stages in the virus life cycle through either direct or indirect approaches involving membrane interfaces. For example, diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic applications of metal and metal oxide NPs in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis virus, influenza virus, and herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections were overviewed by Yadavalli and Shukla (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR236">2017</xref>) and Scherliess (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2019</xref>). Antiviral activity of the metal NPs, especially the mechanism of action of AgNPs against different viruses (HSV , HIV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) , metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ), was discussed by Rai et al. (
