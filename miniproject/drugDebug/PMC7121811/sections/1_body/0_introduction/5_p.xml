<p id="Par6">At the entry process of viruses into host cells, multivalent interactions with different cell surface receptors occur. Many human viruses attach to the cells through heparan sulfate (HS) proteoglycans and the attachment of the virus to HS on the cell surface start up a cascade of events ending with virus entry. Cagno et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>) designed antiviral NPs having long and flexible linkers mimicking HS proteoglycans, allowing for effective viral association with a binding that was simulated to be strong and multivalent to the viral attachment ligand repeating units, generating forces that eventually lead to irreversible viral deformation and showing nanomolar irreversible activity against HSV, human papilloma virus, RSV, dengue virus , and lentivirus in vitro and were active ex vivo in human cervicovaginal histocultures infected by HSV-2 and in vivo in mice infected with RSV. Nanogels with different degrees of flexibility based on dendritic polyglycerol sulfate to mimic cellular HS designed by Dey et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2018</xref>) were able to multivalently interact with viral glycoproteins, shield virus surfaces, and efficiently block infection and were found to act as robust inhibitors for human viruses. Dendritic cells are crucial during development of T cell-specific responses against bacterial and viral pathogens.
