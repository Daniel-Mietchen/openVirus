<p id="Par77">Marburg virus, similarly to Ebola virus, belongs to the family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> and causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates with very high mortality rates. The virus is transmitted from animals to humans by contact with bats or monkeys, or their bodily secretions or from person to person, although human-to-human contamination is rare (Sboui and Tabbabi

Formulation of LNPs delivering siRNAs that target the anti-Marburg virus nucleoprotein administered to rhesus monkeys challenged with a lethal dose of Marburg virus-Angola showed excellent therapeutic efficacy and secured survival of infected animals (Thi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">2014</xref>) and protection against lethal Marburg virus infection mediated by lipid encapsulated siRNA was also observed with virus-infected guinea pigs (Ursic-Bedoya et al.

Blocking of the infection of T-lymphocytes and human dendritic cells by Ebola virus using glyco-dendri-protein-NPs displaying quasi-equivalent nested polyvalency upon glycoprotein platforms, which consist of glycodendrimeric constructs (bearing up to 1620 glycans) with diameters up to 32Â nm, was observed already at picomolar concentrations (Ribeiro-Viana et al.
