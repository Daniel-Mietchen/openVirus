<p id="Par82">Dengue is an acute viral illness caused by RNA virus, dengue virus (DENV), a member of the genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>. DENV is an arthropode-borne virus that includes four different serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4) and spread by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes. Its presenting features may range from asymptomatic fever to dreaded complications such as hemorrhagic fever and shock and it is considered as a major global public health challenge in the tropic and subtropic nations (Hasan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2016</xref>). To achieve durable protective immunity against all four serotypes DENV vaccines must induce balanced, serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. A tetravalent DENV protein subunit vaccine, based on recombinant envelope protein (rE) adsorbed to the surface of PLGA NPs, was designed. Particulate rE induced higher neutralizing antibody titers compared to the soluble rE antigen alone and stimulated a more balanced serotype-specific antibody response to each DENV serotype compared to soluble antigens, suggesting that such vaccines might overcome unbalanced immunity observed for leading live attenuated vaccine candidates (Metz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2018</xref>). AgNPs showed in vitro antiviral activity against dengue serotype DEN-2 infecting Vero cells and the activity of AgNPs against the dengue vector 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> expressed by IC
 <sub>50</sub> values ranged from 10.24 ppm (I instar larvae) to 21.17 ppm (pupae) (Sujitha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR209">2015</xref>). AgNPs biosynthesized using the aqueous extract of 
 <italic>Bruguiera cylindrica</italic> leaves significantly inhibited the production of dengue viral envelope E protein in Vero cells and downregulated the expression of dengue viral E gene and they were found to be suitable for application at low doses to reduce larval and pupal population of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, without detrimental effects of predation rates of mosquito predators, such as 
 <italic>Carassius auratus</italic> (Murugan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2015</xref>). Stabile AgNPs (particle size from 7 to 32 nm and zeta potential −15.58 mV) biosynthesized using silver nitrate and 
 <italic>Carica papaya</italic> leaf extract demonstrated good binding affinity against dengue type 2 virus nonstructural protein 1 (Renganathan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2019</xref>). Treatment with a hybrid consisting of AuNPs functionalized with domain III of envelope glycoprotein derived from serotype 2 of DENV (EDIII) resulted in a high level of antibody, which mediates serotype-specific neutralization of DENV in BALB/c mice, was found to be size-dependent and according to researchers the hybrid concept could also be adopted for the development of a tetravalent vaccine against four serotypes of DENV (Quach et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2018</xref>). It is important to note that good antiviral activity against dengue virus exhibited also SeNPs (Ramya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2015</xref>).
