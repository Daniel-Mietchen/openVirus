<p id="Par83">Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that is the focus of an ongoing pandemic and public health emergency and represents a public health threat due to its teratogenic nature causing microcephaly in babies born to infected mothers and association with the serious neurological condition Guillain-Barre syndrome in adults (Plourde and Bloch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2016</xref>). Haque et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2018</xref>) proposed strategies to design effective and safe vaccines against ZIKV, including Toll-like receptors based NPs vaccines. The development of biomimetic nanodecoy (ND) that traps ZIKV and inhibits ZIKV infection was suggested by Rao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2019</xref>). The ND, which is composed of a gelatin nanoparticle core camouflaged by mosquito medium host cell membranes, effectively adsorbs ZIKV and inhibits ZIKV replication in ZIKV-susceptible cells. AgNPs fabricated using leaf extracts of 
 <italic>Cleistanthus collinus</italic> (triangular and pentagonal shape with sizes 66.27–75.09 nm) and 
 <italic>Strychnos nux-vomica</italic> (spherical and round shape with sizes 54.45–60.84 nm) can be applied as a natural biolarvicidal agent to vector control strategy as an eco-friendly approach to prohibit Zika, chikungunya, and dengue fever in the future (Jinu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2018</xref>). Insecticidal AgNPs prepared using 
 <italic>Suaeda maritima</italic> were found to be effective against the dengue vector 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> as well (Suresh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2018</xref>). Bacterial exopolysaccharide-coated ZnO NPs nanoparticles showed high antibiofilm activity and larvicidal toxicity against malaria and ZIKV vectors 
 <italic>Anopheles stephensi</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> with 100% mortality against third instars mosquito larvae at very low doses, whereby in the midgut of treated mosquito larvae presence of damaged cells and tissues was observed (Abinaya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2018</xref>). Promising toxic and repellent activity against ZIKV mosquito vectors showed also TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs prepared using an extract of 
 <italic>Argemone mexicana</italic> that were capped with poly(styrenesulfonate)/poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (Murugan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2018</xref>). Nanoscale silicate platelets modified with anionic sodium dodecyl sulfate significantly suppressed the plaque-forming ability of Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) at noncytotoxic concentrations and blocked infection with DENV and influenza A virus and also reduced the lethality of JEV and DENV infection in mouse challenge models (Liang et al.
