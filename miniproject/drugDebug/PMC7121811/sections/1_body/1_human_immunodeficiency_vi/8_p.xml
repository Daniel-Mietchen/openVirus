<p id="Par17">A novel NP-in-microparticle (MP) delivery system (NiMDS) comprised of pure NPs of the darunavir (DRV) and its boosting agent ritonavir (RTV) encapsulated within film-coated MPs was reported, in which pure NPs were encapsulated within calcium alginate/CS MPs that were film-coated with a series of poly(methacrylate) copolymers showing differential solubility in the gastrointestinal tract and enabling stability under gastric-like pH and sustained drug release under intestinal one. Using this formulation a 2.3-fold higher oral bioavailability of DRV with respect to both the unprocessed and the nanonized DRV/RTV combinations was estimated in albino Sprague-Dawley rats (Augustine et al.
