<p id="Par11">Based on the investigations of the antiretroviral (ARV) activity of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) using computational molecular approach, the strong molecular interactions suggested the efficacy of CNTs for targeting the HIV-mediated retroviral infections (Krishnaraj et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2014</xref>). Also, highly hydrophilic and dispersible carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) bearing ARV drugs and hydrophilic functionalities were found to exhibit anti-HIV activity (Iannazzo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2015</xref>). SiNPs (5–50 nm) prepared by grinding of porous silicon were found to act as efficient scavengers of HIV and RSV (Osminkina et al.
