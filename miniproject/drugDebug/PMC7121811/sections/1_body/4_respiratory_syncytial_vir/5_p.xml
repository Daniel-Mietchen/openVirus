<p id="Par56">Recent advances in prophylactic synthetic biodegradable microparticle and nanoparticle vaccines against RSV and the multiple factors that can affect vaccine efficacy were summarized by Jorquera and Tripp (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2016</xref>). Vaccination with a recombinant RSV F nanoparticle vaccine (60 or 90 g RSV F protein, with or without aluminum phosphate adjuvant) enhanced functional immunity to RSV in older adults (≥60 years), showed an acceptable safety profile, and additional immunogenicity benefit was observed with adjuvanted formulation compared to increasing antigen dose alone. Moreover, the RSV F vaccine co-administered with licensed inactivated trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) did not impact the serum HAI antibody responses to a standard-dose TIV, and TIV did not affect the immune response to the RSV F vaccine (Fries et al.
