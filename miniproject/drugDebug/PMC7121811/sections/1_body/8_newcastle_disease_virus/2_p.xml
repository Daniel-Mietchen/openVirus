<p id="Par79">Zhao et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">2016</xref>) designed a NDV F gene-containing DNA vaccine encapsulated in Ag@SiO
 <sub>2</sub> hollow NPs with an average diameter of 500 nm that following intranasal immunization of chickens induced high titers of serum antibody, notably stimulated lymphocyte proliferation and induced higher expression levels of interleukine-2 and interferon-Î³, suggesting that Ag@SiO
 <sub>2</sub> hollow NPs could be used as an efficient and safe delivery carrier for NDV DNA vaccine to induce mucosal immunity.
