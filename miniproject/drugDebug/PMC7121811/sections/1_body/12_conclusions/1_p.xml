<p id="Par95">Nanoscale science and nanotechnology have unambiguously demonstrated to have a great potential in providing novel and improved solutions. Nano-size materials change their physical and chemical properties in comparison with bulk materials and have helped to improve and innovate a variety of pharmaceutical, medical, industrial, and agricultural products. Thus, nanoformulations of antivirotics and antiviral vaccines have become an important tool in the fight against various types of viruses due to modified bioavailability, ability to target viral or cellular proteins and sustainable release of drugs. Also, other nanosized materials were found to exhibit antiviral activity, and their combinations with antivirotics thus could provide remarkable medicines, especially against resistant viral pathogens. However, in spite of these significant benefits of nanomaterials in drug development, an increased attention should be devoted to the potential “intrinsic” toxicity of these nanomedicines caused by particle size that is able, within side effects, to induce various pathological processes in cells/tissues, which can result in various adverse/hazardous effects on animals and humans.</p>
