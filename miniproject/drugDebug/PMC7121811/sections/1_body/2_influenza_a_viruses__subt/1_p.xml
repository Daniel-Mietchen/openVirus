 <italic>.</italic> All influenza viruses are negative-sense, single-stranded, segmented RNA viruses. Viruses of influenza A type occur in humans and animals, while types B and C can be found only in humans. Influenza A viruses are classified according to the type of hemagglutinin (H) and the type of neuroaminidase (N) into subtypes H1N1, H1N2, H2N2, H3N2, H5N1, and H8N4. Each virus subtype has mutated into a variety of strains with differing pathogenic profiles using humanized BLT mouse model (Taubenberger and Morens

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family of viruses. Type A influenza is a contagious viral infection that can have life-threatening complications if left untreated. An influenza could be pandemic, when an epidemic of an influenza virus spreads on a worldwide scale, e.g., “Spanish flu” of 1918 (Kuchipudi and Niessly
