<p id="Par29">Inhibition of A/Human/Hubei/3/2005 (H3N2) influenza virus infection by AgNPs in vitro and in vivo was reported by Xiang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR235">2013</xref>). Feng et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>) designed glycosylated metal (Ag and Au) NPs as potent influenza A virus hemagglutinin (HA) blockers. Inhibitory effects of AgNPs with particle size of 10 nm on H1N1 influenza A virus in vitro were also reported by Xiang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR234">2011</xref>). The effect of size dependence of the AgNPs (3.5, 6.5, and 12.9 nm average diameters) that were embedded into the CS matrix on antiviral activity against H1N1 influenza A virus was also observed showing generally stronger antiviral activity with smaller AgNPs in the composites (Mori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2013</xref>). Evaluation of the efficacy of AgNP-decorated silica hybrid composite (Ag30-SiO
 <sub>2</sub>) with particle size of 400 nm in diameter for inactivation of influenza A virus showed that even after 1Â h of exposure to these NPs &gt;80% of HA damage, 20% of neuraminidase activities, and reduction of the infection caused by the virus in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells was observed. The Ag30-SiO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs were found to interact with viral components situated at the membrane causing them nonspecific damage resulting in virus inactivation (Park et al.
