<p id="Par32">Nanocomposites, in which DNA fragments were electrostatically bound to TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NPs pre-covered with polylysine, efficiently inhibited human influenza A (subtype H3N2) (Levina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2014</xref>). Composites of peptide nucleic acids with TiO
 <sub>2</sub> NP-containing DNA/peptide nucleic acid duplexes inhibited reproduction of influenza A virus (H3N2 subtype) with an efficiency of 99% and they were shown to not only penetrate through cell membranes, but also exhibit a high specific antisense activity without toxic effects on the living cells (Amirkhanov et al.
