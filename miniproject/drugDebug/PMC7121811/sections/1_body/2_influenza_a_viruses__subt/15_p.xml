<p id="Par42"> Intranasal vaccination with NPs formed by 3-sequential repeats of M2e on the self-assembling recombinant human heavy chain ferritin cage could induce robust immune responses such as high titers of sera M2e-specific IgG antibodies, T cell immune responses, and mucosal secretory IgA antibodies in mice in the absence of an adjuvant. These NPs also confer complete protection against a lethal infection of homo-subtypic H1N1 and hetero-subtypic H9N2 virus and could be considered as a promising, needle-free, intranasally administered cross-protective influenza vaccine as being economical and suitable for large-scale production (Qi et al.
