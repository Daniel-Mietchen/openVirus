<p id="Par38">The initial adhesion of most viruses is quantitatively controlled by multivalent binding of proteins to glycan receptors on the host cell. Lin et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2018c</xref>) to mimic virus adhesion to cell surfaces attached protein-oligomer-coated NPs to fluidic glycolipid membranes with surface glycan density varying over four orders of magnitude and found that in the binding isotherms two regions could be estimated, which could be attributed to monovalent and multivalent protein/glycan interactions at low and high glycan densities, respectively.
