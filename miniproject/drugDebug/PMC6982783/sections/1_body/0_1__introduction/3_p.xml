<p>With such structural diversity of lignans being discovered, it is not surprising that many attractive pharmacological activities of the lignan family, such as antitumor [
 <xref rid="B7-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], antioxidant [
 <xref rid="B5-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], antibacterial [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], immunosuppressive [
 <xref rid="B9-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and antiasthmatic properties [
 <xref rid="B10-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] were reported. Pertinent to this review, many lignans have been identified with antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B11-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Tubulin binding, reverse transcriptase inhibition, integrase inhibition, and topoisomerase inhibition are included as the reported mechanisms of antiviral activities [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Here, we will highlight the antiviral activities and mechanisms of action (MOA) of different lignans and their derivatives.
