<p>Lignans are a large group of naturally occurring compounds that are derived from the shikimic acid biosynthetic pathway [
 <xref rid="B1-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Structurally, Lignans contain a basic scaffold of two or more phenylpropanoid units [
 <xref rid="B2-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and the monomers forming lignans are cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, propenyl benzene, and allyl benzene. When the molecular linkage of monomers occurs between positions β-β′ (also referred to as an 8-8′), these compounds are designated as “classical lignans”. In contrast, the compounds are grouped into “neolignans” if the main structural units are coupled in any other way (non β-β′ linkage). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00183-f001">Figure 1</xref> shows the monomers and the classification. Neolignans have more varied structures than classical lignans.
