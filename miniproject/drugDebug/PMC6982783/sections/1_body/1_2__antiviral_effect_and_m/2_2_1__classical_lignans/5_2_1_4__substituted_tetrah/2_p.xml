<p>The root of 
 <italic>Isatis indigotica</italic> Fort is a very famous antiviral traditional medicine in China and is called 
 <italic>Radix Isatidis</italic> (
 <italic>Banlangen</italic> in Chinese); during the prevalence of SARS in 2003, the traditional Chinese medicine products containing 
 <italic>Radix Isatidis</italic> were once out of stock in China. So far, lots of derivatives with LA structure were isolated from 
 <italic>Radix Isatidis</italic> and antiviral activities were demonstrated. For example, lariciresinol-4-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside was shown to inhibit the IAV-induced pro-inflammatory response [
 <xref rid="B62-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]; the underlying defense mechanism against IAV infection is from pharmacological actions on the immune system, signal transduction, cell cycle, and metabolism [
 <xref rid="B63-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]; (
 <italic>7′R</italic>,
 <italic>8S</italic>)-9′-lariciresinol-(alpha-methyl)-butanoate showed a low amount of activity to anti-HIV-1 [
 <xref rid="B64-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]; Isatindolignanoside A was shown to have antiviral activity against Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), with IC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of 25.9 μM and &gt;3.9, respectively [
 <xref rid="B65-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]; Clemastanin B (

 <italic>8R</italic>,
 <italic>8′R</italic>-(−)-lariciresinol-4,4′-bis-
 <italic>O</italic>-β-
 <sc>d</sc>-glucopyranoside), as the active ingredient of 
 <italic>Radix Isatidis</italic>, it showed to inhibit different subtypes of human IAVs (H1N1, H3N2, and influenza B) [
