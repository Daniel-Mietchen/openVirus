<p>Niranthin. This compound was first isolated from 
 <italic>Phyllanthus niruri Linn</italic>. (family Euphorbiaceae) [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], which has long been used in folk medicine for liver protection and anti-hepatitis B virus (HBV) in many Asian countries. Ray-L screened 25 compounds from 
 <italic>Phyllanthus</italic> Species in vitro and niranthin showed the best anti-HBsAg activity among them [
 <xref rid="B12-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. When evaluated for the anti-HBV activity in vitro, niranthin was found to significantly decrease the secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg with IC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 15.6 and 25.1 ÂµM in the human HBV-transfected cell line HepG2.2.15, respectively. In vivo, niranthin treatment of the DHBV-infected ducklings significantly reduced the serum DHBV DNA, HBsAg, HBeAg, ALT, and AST. Mechanistic studies showed that niranthin inhibited not only DHBV DNA replication, but also HBV antigen expression, which suggests that niranthin acts as an anti-HBV agent through at least two or more targets [
