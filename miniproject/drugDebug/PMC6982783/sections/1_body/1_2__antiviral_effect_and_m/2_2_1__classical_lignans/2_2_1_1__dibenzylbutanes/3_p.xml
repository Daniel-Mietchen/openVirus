<p>NDGA was isolated from the leaves of 
 <italic>Larrea tridentata</italic> (Zygophyllaceae); the plant was known as creosote bush, which has been traditionally used in folk medicine across different countries and regions for more than 50 different diseases [
 <xref rid="B17-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It was reported that NDGA exerts beneficial effects on diverse diseases, like cancer, renal damage, Alzheimerâ€™s disease, and other neurodegenerative pathologies [

 <xref rid="B20-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. At the molecular level, NDGA is a potent scavenger of reactive oxygen species [
 <xref rid="B21-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. NDGA has been identified to inhibit the replication of the related dengue virus (DENV); MOA showed that it inhibits DENV infection by targeting genome replication and viral assembly [
 <xref rid="B22-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Moreover, NDGA showed the effect against hepatitis C virus (HCV), West Nile Virus (WNV), and Zika Virus (ZIKV) in vitro [

 <xref rid="B24-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. For influenza A viruses (IAV), NDGA can suppress the replication of IAV and the induction of cytokines, trypsin, and MMP-9, with improved animal survival [
