<p>Dibenzylbutanes, which are also known as simple lignans, are the simplest classical lignans, which are the only lignan subtype without being cyclized. They are phenylpropane dimers that have a β-β′ linkage. Dibenzylbutane lignans also show an increased diversity due to multiple possible oxidation states along the butane chain [
