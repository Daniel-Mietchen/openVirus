<p>Dibenzylbutyrolactones, which are also known as lignans-β-β′-lactones(lignanolides), are based on dibenzylbutanes, with 9-9′epoxy and C9 carbonyl. Lignanolides are often found in the same plants as theirmonode- hydrogenated or didehydrogenated compounds and corresponding derivatives. The representative compounds with antiviral activities in this subclass are arctigenin (ATG), yatein, and hinokinin (
