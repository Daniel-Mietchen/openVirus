<p>ATG was initially isolated from 
 <italic>Arctium lappa</italic> L. (Compositae). So far, the research of antiviral activity has been mainly focused on IAV and HIV. The erythrocyte agglutination test showed that ATG can inhibit the replication of the IAV in vitro, and the inhibition was shown to be 100% with a concentration of 26.8 mM based on hemagglutination titer [

ATG and its glycoside arctiin were also shown to be orally effective, but less than oseltamivir, the results suggested that it is a good choice of the combined arctiin with oseltamivir for IAV in immunocompromised mice that were infected with IAV [
