<p>Rubrifloralignan A was isolated from another species of 
 <italic>Schisandraceae</italic> family—
 <italic>Schisandra rubriflora</italic>. It can not only inhibits the formation of syncytium induced by HIV-1IIIB and cell death induced by HIV-1, but it also inhibits the replication of HIV. Mechanistically, rubrifloralignan A was shown to inhibit the early stage in HIV-1 replication [
 <xref rid="B81-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. The derivative, (+/−)-Gomisin M1, exhibited the most potent anti-HIV activity, with EC
 <sub>50</sub> and SI values of &lt;0.65 μM and &gt;68, respectively [
 <xref rid="B82-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Halogenated gomisin J derivatives were shown to be a nonnucleoside inhibitor of HIV type 1 reverse transcriptase [
