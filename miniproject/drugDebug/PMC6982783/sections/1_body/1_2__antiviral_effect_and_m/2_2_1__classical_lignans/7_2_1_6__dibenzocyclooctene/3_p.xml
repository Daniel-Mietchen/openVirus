<p>Bicyclol(4,4′-dimethoxy-5,6,5′,6′-bis(methylenedioxy)-2-hydroxymethyl-2′-methoxycarbonyl biphenyl) is an analog of the active component schizandrin C from

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-00183-f009">Figure 9</xref>. Bicyclol was shown to have activities in vitro and in vivo. Clinical data showed that it could inhibit virus replication in patients that were infected with HBV, and the difference of the response to bicyclol therapy between HBV genotypes B and C was not statistically significant [

 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Mechanistic studies suggest that anti-hepatitis activity of bicyclol is through the modulation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="B76-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>], and by up-regulating the host restrictive factor (GLTP) for HCV replication and causing the spontaneous restriction of HCV replication [
 <xref rid="B79-molecules-25-00183" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Bicyclol is now used to treat the patients with chronic hepatitis B in China [
