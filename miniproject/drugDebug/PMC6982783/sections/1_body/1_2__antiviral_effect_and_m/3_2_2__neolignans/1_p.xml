<p>Neolignans are a class of lignans that do not contain the β-β′ (also referred to as an 8-8′) phenyl-propane linkage that are characteristic of classical lignans. They can be further grouped into different subtypes based on the nature and position of the linkage between the phenylpropane units. In contrast to classical lignans, there are only a few reports on the antiviral activities of neolignans.
