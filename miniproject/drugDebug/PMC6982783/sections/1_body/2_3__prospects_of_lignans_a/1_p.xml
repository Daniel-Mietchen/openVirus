<p>Lignans are traditionally defined as a class of secondary metabolites that are derived from the oxidative dimerization of two or more phenylpropanoid units. They boast a vast structural diversity, despite their common biosynthetic origins. It is also well-established that this class of compounds exhibit a range of potent biological activities. Owing to these factors, lignans have proven to be a challenging and desirable synthetic target that have instigated the development of some different synthetic methods, advancing our collective knowledge towards the synthesis of complex and unique structures.</p>
