 <caption> Bicyclol as an anti-HBV drug [ 76]. Schizandrin C was isolated from F. Schizandrae and verified as the most active compound in protection against liver injury in mice. DDB (Dimethyl dicarboxylate biphenyl) as an analog of schizandrin C has been widely used for the improvement of the abnormal liver function of CHB hepatitis in China. Bicyclol as a novel substitute for DDB was found to be more effective in protection against liver injury and was also showed to inhibit hepatitis virus replication in vitro and in vivo. </caption>
