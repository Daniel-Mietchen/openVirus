 <sub>d</sub> of ETV, if ETV was administered simultaneously with FZHY. The effect of FZHY on the pharmacokinetics of ETV was manifested mainly in absorption. However, the influence of FZHY on ETV pharmacokinetics was gradually reduced with the prolongation of intervals between them. The pharmacokinetics of ETV were virtually unaffected if the interval of administration was 2 h. Conversely, rats who had suffered DMN-induced hepatic fibrosis could prolong the

 <sub>1/2</sub> of ETV, suggesting that the elimination was slowed down. Although the FZHY interval was 2 h, the 
 <italic>t</italic>

 <sub>max</sub> and

 <sub>max</sub> of ETV decreased significantly.
