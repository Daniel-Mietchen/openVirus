<p>Forty-eight male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: control (
 <italic>n</italic> = 30) and model (
 <italic>n</italic> = 18). Rats in the model group were injected with DMN (10 mg/kg body weight, i.p.) every other day for 4 weeks according to the method of Yang et al. (
 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). At the end of modelling, six rats for each group were killed and used for biochemical and pathology studies. Blood samples were obtained from the inferior vena cava, and centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. After 3 h, the serum was maintained at –70 °C for liver function tests. The livers were removed rapidly. Liver tissue was taken from the right lobe, fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde, and processed for embedding in paraffin. The remainder of the rats were employed for the pharmacokinetics research.
