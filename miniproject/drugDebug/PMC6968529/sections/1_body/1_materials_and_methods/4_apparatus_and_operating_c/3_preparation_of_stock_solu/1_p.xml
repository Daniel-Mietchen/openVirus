<p>The stock solution of ETV (0.2 μg/mL) was prepared by dissolving the required amount of the reference standard in methanol and then diluted using acetonitrile to the working solutions ranging from 0.4 to 200 μg/L. The IS stock solution was prepared by dissolution in methanol. The IS working solution (40 μg/L) was prepared by diluting of the stock solution with acetonitrile. The ETV calibration standard was obtained by spiking blank plasma (50 μL), acetonitrile (50 μL) and deionized water (50 μL) with the appropriate working solutions (50 μL). Final concentrations of ETV in calibration samples were 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 μg/L. Quality control (QC) samples at low (0.5 μg/L), medium (5 μg/L) and high (50 μg/L) concentrations were prepared separately in the same fashion. All the solutions were stored at 4 °C and brought to room temperature before use.</p>
