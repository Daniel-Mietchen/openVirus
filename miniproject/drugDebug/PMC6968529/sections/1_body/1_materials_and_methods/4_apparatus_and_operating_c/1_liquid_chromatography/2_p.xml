<p>Chromatographic separation was achieved on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 μm) maintained at 40 °C with a flow rate set at 0.3 mL/min. A gradient elution programmer was used for chromatographic separation with mobile phase A (0.1% formic acid in water) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile) mixed as follows: 0–2.0 min (5–15% B); 2.0–2.5 min (15–30% B); 2.5–3.2 min (30–90% B); 2–4.2 min (90% B); 4.2–4.5 min (90–98% B); 4.5–4.6 min (98–5% B); 4.6–6 min (5% B). The flow rate of the mobile phase was set at 0.3 mL/min and the injection volume was 5 μL.</p>
