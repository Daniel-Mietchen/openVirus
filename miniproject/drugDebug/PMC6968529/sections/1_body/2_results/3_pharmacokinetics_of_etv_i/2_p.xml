<p>The mean (SD) plasma concentration time profiles of ETV after intragastric administration of ETV in normal rats are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>. A graph using a log–linear scale is shown in

 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> occurring, in general, at 0.75 h. Drug deposition appeared to be rapid, with mean plasma concentrations falling to ≤10% of the mean 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> 24 h after dosing. Comparatively speaking, the ETV plasma concentration–time curve in the EF-2 group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>) was similar to that in the ETV-N group, with no statistically significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters between the two groups. In contrast, the ETV plasma concentration–time curve in the EF-0 group increased slowly to a maximum value at 6 h, and then declined slowly to 1440 min (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>). There were no significant differences in the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>e</sub> and 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2e</sub> values for ETV between the ETV-N and EF-0 groups. However, the ETV 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> value was only 27.38 ± 7.52 μg/L in the EF-0 group, while it was 110.85 ± 24.25 μg/L in the ETV group, and the AUC
 <sub>0–</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> value (323.84 ± 44.63 μg·h/L) in the EF-0 group was approximately 0.73-fold less than that in the ETV-N group (236.67 ± 48.91 ng/h/mL). In addition, the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> and MRT values were increased to 6.00 ± 1.26 h and 8.42 ± 1.38 h, respectively. The 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> and CL values were significantly increased to 25.18 ± 10.73 L/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and 3.84 ± 0.91 L/h/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). In summary, the pharmacokinetics of ETV were altered significantly by co-administration with FZHY, as shown by a decrease in 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> of 75.30%, a decrease in AUC
 <sub>0–</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>t</sub>
 </italic> of 26.92% and a delay in 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> of 5.25 h. The pharmacokinetics profiles of ETV in the EF-1 group are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0004">Figure 4(A)</xref>. The ETV plasma concentration–time curve produced a peak at 4 h and then declined. Compared to the ETV-N group, the 
 <italic>C</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> value in the EF-1 group was significantly lower at 42.43 ± 3.15 μg/L (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01), while the 
 <italic>V</italic>
 <sub>d</sub> value increased to 32.71 ± 5.51 mL/kg (
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In addition, the 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>max</sub> (3.67 ± 0.82 h), 
 <italic>t</italic>
 <sub>1/2e</sub> (7.41 ± 1.22 h) and MRT (7.31 ± 2.23 h) values of ETV were significantly increased compared with the values in the ETV-N group.
