<p>No interference from endogenous substances was observed in quantification transitions of ETV and IS. The representative mass chromatograms of blank plasma sample (A), plasma sample spiked with IS (10 μg/L) (B) and IS (10 μg/L) spiked plasma after oral administration of ETV (0.9 mg/kg) (C) are shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0003">Figure 3</xref>. The ETV calibration curve was linear over the concentration range 0.5–50 μg/L. The calibration curve and correlation coefficient (
 <italic>r</italic>) of ETV were 
 <italic>y</italic> = 0.0265
 <italic>x</italic> – 0.0108 and 
 <italic>r</italic> = 0.9996. The LLOQ of ETV was 0.5 μg/L (S/N&gt; 10). The accuracy and precision data for the intra- and inter-day analysis are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The RSD values of the precision of ETV detection (intra-day and inter-day) at three QC levels ranged between 5.02% and 9.91%. The mean accuracy of ETV detection was 104.18 ± 9.46%. These results demonstrated that both the accuracy and the precision of the present method were acceptable. The extraction recovery and matrix effect for ETV are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The extraction recoveries of ETV at low, mid and high concentration levels (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5) were 99.48 ± 11.91%, 106.79 ± 3.35% and 120.53 ± 6.29%, respectively. These data indicated that the extraction recovery of ETV was efficient, consistent and reproducible. Matrix effects in the current method were also within acceptable limits (94.01–100.22%). Therefore, ion suppression and plasma enhancement effects were negligible for this method. The results of all stability tests are shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. ETV was stable under the four sets of storage conditions (room temperature for 4 h, in the auto-sampler at 10 °C for 24 h, three freeze–thaw cycles from –20 °C to 25 °C, and –20 °C for 2 weeks). The SD about the mean of the test responses was within –3.5 to 0.63% in all the stability tests of QC samples. These stabilities met this need of a routine pharmacokinetic study.
