        <span class="abst" title="Pandemic influenza has become a high priority item for all public health authorities. An influenza pandemic is believed to be imminent, and scientists agree that it will be a matter of when, where, and what will be the causative agent. Recently, most attention has been directed to human cases of avian influenza caused by a H5N1 avian influenza virus. An effective vaccine will be needed to substantially reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic. Current influenza vaccine manufacturing technology is not adequate to support vaccine production in the event of an avian influenza outbreak, and it has now become clear that new innovative production technology is required. Antiviral drugs, on the other hand, can play a very important role in slowing the disease spread but are in short supply and resistance has been a major issue. Here, we provide an update on the status of pandemic vaccine development and antiviral drugs. Finally, we conclude with some proposed areas of focus in pandemic vaccine preparedness.">

The present study was undertaken to determine the effect of combinations of HBPG and either ACV, phosphonoformate (PFA), or cidofovir (CDF) against HSV encephalitis. BALB/c mice were given ocular infections with HSV-1 or HSV-2, and treated twice daily intraperitoneally for five days with HBPG, alone or in combination with ACV, PFA, or CDF. Animals were observed daily for up to 30 days, and the day of death of each was recorded. All of the combinations showed additivity, and the combination of HBPG + ACV appeared to be synergistic, ie, protected more mice against HSV-1 encephalitis compared with each drug given alone. Delay of treatment with HBPG for up to two days was still effective in preventing HSV-2 encephalitis. The combination of the thymidine kinase inhibitor HBPG and the antiherpes drug ACV may have synergistic activity against HSV encephalitis. The development of a potent and safe combination therapy for the prevention and/or treatment of HSV infection of the central nervous system can improve the outcome of this infection in humans.">

SIGA Technologies, Inc. is a small biotech company committed to developing novel products for the prevention and treatment of severe infectious diseases, with an emphasis on products for diseases that could result from bioterrorism. Through trials and error SIGA has developed an approach to this problem in order to establish the infrastructure necessary to successfully advance new antiviral drugs from the discovery stage on through to licensure. The approach that we have taken to drug development is biology driven and dependent on a dispersive development model utilizing essential collaborations with academic, federal, and private sector partners. This consortium approach requires success in acquiring grants and contracts as well as iterative communication with the government and regulatory agencies. However, it can work as evidenced by the rapid progress of our lead antiviral against smallpox, ST-246, and should serve as the template for development of new antivirals against important biological pathogens.">

This poses the question of whether preparedness for a future pandemic should include plans to use antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission.Simulations using a standard transmission model that allows for infected arrivals and delayed vaccination show that attempts to contain transmission require relatively few antiviral doses. In contrast, persistent use of antiviral drugs when the reproduction number remains above 1 use very many doses and are unlikely to reduce the eventual attack rate appreciably unless the stockpile is very large. A second model, in which the community has a household structure, shows that the effectiveness of a strategy of dispensing antiviral drugs to infected households decreases rapidly with time delays in dispensing the antivirals. Using characteristics of past pandemics it is estimated that at least 80% of primary household cases must present upon show of symptoms to have a chance of containing transmission by dispensing antiviral drugs to households. To determine data needs, household outbreaks were simulated with 50% receiving antiviral drugs early and 50% receiving antiviral drugs late. A test to compare the size of household outbreaks indicates that at least 100-200 household outbreaks need to be monitored to find evidence that antiviral drugs can mitigate transmission of the newly emerged virus.Use of antiviral drugs in an early attempt to contain transmission should be part of preparedness plans for a future influenza pandemic. Data on the incidence of the first 350 cases and the eventual attack rates of the first 200 hundred household outbreaks should be used to estimate the initial reproduction number R and the effectiveness of antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission. Use of antiviral drugs to mitigate general transmission should cease if these estimates indicate that containment of transmission is unlikely.">

Currently, there is a need to develop antiviral agents, both from synthetic chemistry and Herbal sources. In the last decade, various novel HCV replication, helicase and entry inhibitors have been synthesized and some of which have been entered in different phases of clinical trials. Successful results have been acquired by executing combinational therapy of compounds with standard regime in different HCV replicons. Even though, diverse groups of compounds have been described as antiviral targets against HCV via Specifically Targeted Antiviral Therapy for hepatitis C (STAT-C) approach (in which compounds are designed to directly block HCV or host proteins concerned in HCV replication), still there is a need to improve the properties of existing antiviral compounds. In this review, we sum up potent antiviral compounds against entry, unwinding and replication of HCV and discussed their activity in combination with standard therapy. Conclusively, further innovative research on chemical compounds will lead to consistent standard therapy with fewer side effects.">

The currently available antiviral drugs target 3 main groups of viruses: herpes, hepatitis, and influenza viruses. With the exception of the antisense molecule fomivirsen, all antiherpes drugs inhibit viral replication by serving as competitive substrates for viral DNA polymerase. Drugs for the treatment of influenza inhibit the ion channel M(2) protein or the enzyme neuraminidase. Combination therapy with Interferon-α and ribavirin remains the backbone treatment for chronic hepatitis C; the addition of serine protease inhibitors improves the treatment outcome of patients infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1. Chronic hepatitis B can be treated with interferon or a combination of nucleos(t)ide analogues. Notably, almost all the nucleos(t) ide analogues for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B possess anti-human immunodeficiency virus properties, and they inhibit replication of hepatitis B virus by serving as competitive substrates for its DNA polymerase. Some antiviral drugs possess multiple potential clinical applications, such as ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C and respiratory syncytial virus and cidofovir for the treatment of cytomegalovirus and other DNA viruses. Drug resistance is an emerging threat to the clinical utility of antiviral drugs. The major mechanisms for drug resistance are mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene or in genes that encode for the viral kinases required for the activation of certain drugs such as acyclovir and ganciclovir. Widespread antiviral resistance has limited the clinical utility of M(2) inhibitors for the prevention and treatment of influenza infections. This article provides an overview of clinically available antiviral drugs for the primary care physician, with a special focus on pharmacology, clinical uses, and adverse effects.">

Due to historical delays in access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) on a worldwide basis, the vast majority of reports on drug resistance deal with subtype B infections in developed countries. However, both enzymatic and virological data support the concept that naturally occurring polymorphisms among different nonB subtypes can affect HIV-1 susceptibility to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), the magnitude of resistance conferred by major mutations, and the propensity to acquire some resistance mutations. Tools need to be optimized to assure accurate measurements of drug susceptibility of non-B subtypes. Furthermore, there is a need to recognize that each subtype may have a distinct resistance profile and that differences in resistance pathways may also impact on cross-resistance and the selection of second-line regimens. It will be essential to pay attention to newer drug combinations in well designed long-term longitudinal studies involving patients infected by viruses of different subtypes.">

        <span class="abst" title="Increasing antiviral drug resistance is a major concern for treating influenza, especially in a pandemic setting when the availability of a protective vaccine is uncertain. Resistance is often an issue with drugs directed at viral proteins and for small RNA viruses; there are also a limited number of viral proteins that are amenable to inhibition by a small molecule. A new approach that is gaining support is that cellular proteins, which facilitate virus replication, may be used as alternative targets. Whereas drugs directed at viral proteins tend to be virus-specific, drugs directed at host targets have the potential to have broad-spectrum antiviral activity as many viruses may share a dependency on that host function. For influenza virus, we have very limited knowledge of which cellular factors are involved in virus replication, let alone which of these have suitable properties to serve as drug targets. Through the use of high-throughput RNA interference screens, several studies have addressed this gap in our knowledge. The resulting datasets provide new insight into host pathways that are involved in the influenza virus replication cycle and identify specific host factors in these pathways that may serve as potential targets for future antiviral drug development.">

This study aims to describe the range of methods used by local health departments (LHDs) in California to manage antiviral activities and to gain a better understanding of the related challenges experienced by health departments and their community partners.This research employed a mixed-methods approach. First, a multi-disciplinary focus group of pandemic influenza planners from key stakeholder groups in California was convened in order to generate ideas and identify critical themes related to the local implementation of antiviral activities during the H1N1 influenza response. These qualitative data informed the development of a web-based survey, which was distributed to all 61 LHDs in California for the purpose of assessing the experiences of a representative sample of local health agencies in a large region.Forty-four LHDs participated in this study, representing 72% of the local public health agencies in California. While most communities dispensed a modest number of publicly purchased antivirals, LHDs nevertheless drew on their previous work and engaged in a number of antiviral activities, including: acquiring, allocating, distributing, dispensing, tracking, developing guidance, and communicating to the public and clinical community. LHDs also identified specific antiviral challenges presented by the H1N1 pandemic, including: reconciling multiple sources and versions of antiviral guidance, determining appropriate uses and recipients of publicly purchased antivirals, and staffing shortages.The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic presented an unusual opportunity to learn about the role of local public health in the management of antiviral response activities during a real public health emergency. Results of this study offer an important descriptive account of LHD management of publicly purchased antivirals, and provide practitioners, policy makers, and academics with a practice-based assessment of these events. The issues raised and the challenges faced by LHDs should be leveraged to inform public health planning for future pandemics and other emergency events that require medical countermeasure dispensing activities.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND: While ribavirin mono-therapy regimens have minimal effect on patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections, they can be efficacious when combined with interferon. Clinical studies show that interferon-free combination therapies containing ribavirin are also efficacious, suggesting that an interferon-free therapy could be adopted in the near future. However, generation of drug resistant mutants and cross resistance to other drugs could impair the efficacy of the treatment. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of HCV resistance to ribavirin and cross resistance to other antiviral drugs could be of major importance. METHODS: We tested the ability of a J6/JFH1 derived HCV ribavirin resistant mutant to grow in tissue cultured Huh7D cells in the presence of the mutagen 5-Fluorouracil and the nucleoside analog 2'-C-Methylcytidine. Virus replication was assessed by detecting HCV antigens by immunofluorescence and by titrating virus present in the supernatants. Recovered viruses were amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. RESULTS: The sensitivity of HCV-RR relative to parental J6/JFH1 to the tested drugs varied. HCV-RR was more resistant than J6/JFH1 to 5-Fluorouracil but was not more resistant than J6/JFH1 to 2'-C-Methylcytidine. Growth of HCV-RR in 5-Fluorouracil allowed the selection of an HCV-RR derived mutant resistant to 5-Fluorouracil (HCV-5FU). HCV-5FU grows to moderate levels in the presence of high concentrations of 5-Fluorouracil and to parental levels in the absence of the drug. Sequence of its genome shows that HCV-5FU accumulated multiple synonymous and non-synonymous mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that determinants of resistance to ribavirin could also confer resistance to other anti-HCV drugs, shedding light toward understanding the mechanism of action of ribavirin and highlighting the importance of combination drug selection for HCV treatment. The results also show that it is possible to select a 5-Fluorouracil HCV resistant mutant that replicates to levels similar to parental virus when grown in the absence of 5-Fluorouracil.">

We investigated to what extent antiviral prescriptions in primary care practices were in accordance with the recommendations, what proportion of patients diagnosed with influenza had been prescribed antiviral drugs, and to what extent prescriptions related to the stated indications for antiviral treatment. METHODS: We used data from routine electronic medical records of practices participating in the Netherlands Information Network of General Practice LINH in the period August-December 2009. We considered patient and practice characteristics, clinical diagnoses and drug prescriptions of all patients who contacted their general practitioner in the given period and who had been prescribed antiviral medication (n=351) or were diagnosed with influenza (n=3293). RESULTS: Of all antiviral prescriptions, 69% were in accordance with the recommendations. Only 5% of patients diagnosed with influenza were prescribed antiviral drugs. This percentage increased to 12% among influenza patients belonging to the designated high risk groups. On the other hand, 2.5% of influenza patients not at high risk of complications received antiviral treatment. In addition to the established high risk factors, the total number of drug prescriptions for a patient in this year was a determinant of antiviral prescriptions. Information on time since onset of symptoms and the clinical presentation of patients was not available. CONCLUSIONS: General practitioners in the Netherlands have been restrictive in prescribing antiviral drugs during the influenza pandemic, even when patients met the criteria for antiviral treatment.">

The main aim of this study was to determine the availability and use of influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs as well as to describe existing related guidelines and policies in Africa. METHODS:A self-administered survey was distributed among key influenza experts in 40 African countries. RESULTS:Of the 40 countries surveyed, 31 (78%) responded; 14/31 (45%) reported availability of seasonal influenza vaccine, and 19/31 (65%) reported availability of antiviral drugs for the treatment of influenza. Vaccine coverage data were only available for 4/14 (29%) countries that reported availability of seasonal influenza vaccine and ranged from &lt;0.5% to 2% of the population. CONCLUSIONS:Influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs are available in many countries in Africa but coverage estimates are low and remain largely unknown. Describing the local burden of disease and identifying funding are essential to encourage countries to use influenza vaccine more widely.">

        <span class="abst" title="The herpes simplex virus type 1 origin-binding protein, OBP, is a DNA helicase encoded by the UL9 gene. The protein binds in a sequence-specific manner to the viral origins of replication, two OriS sites and one OriL site. In order to search for efficient inhibitors of the OBP activity, we have obtained a recombinant origin-binding protein expressed in Escherichia coli cells. The UL9 gene has been amplified by PCR and inserted into a modified plasmid pET14 between NdeI and KpnI sites. The recombinant protein binds to Box I and Box II sequences and possesses helicase and ATPase activities. In the presence of ATP and viral protein ICP8 (single-strand DNA-binding protein), the initiator protein induces unwinding of the minimal OriS duplex (≈80 bp). The protein also binds to a single-stranded DNA (OriS*) containing a stable Box I-Box III hairpin and an unstable AT-rich hairpin at the 3'-end. In the present work, new minor groove binding ligands have been synthesized which are capable to inhibit the development of virus-induced cytopathic effect in cultured Vero cells. Studies on binding of these compounds to DNA and synthetic oligonucleotides have been performed by fluorescence methods, gel mobility shift analysis and footprinting assays. Footprinting studies have revealed that Pt-bis-netropsin and related molecules exhibit preferences for binding to the AT-spacer in OriS. The drugs stabilize structure of the AT-rich region and inhibit the fluctuation opening of AT-base pairs which is a prerequisite to unwinding of DNA by OBP. Kinetics of ATP-dependent unwinding of OriS in the presence and absence of netropsin derivatives have been studied by measuring the efficiency of Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between fluorophores attached to 5'- and 3'- ends of an oligonucleotide in the minimal OriS duplex. The results are consistent with the suggestion that OBP is the DNA Holiday junction (HJ) binding helicase. The protein induces conformation changes (bending and partial melting) of OriS duplexes and stimulates HJ formation in the absence of ATP. The antiviral activity of bis-netropsins is coupled with their ability to inhibit the fluctuation opening of АТ base pairs in the А + Т cluster and their capacity to stabilize the structure of the АТ-rich hairpin in the single-stranded oligonucleotide corresponding to the upper chain in the minimal duplex OriS. The antiviral activities of bis-netropsins in cell culture and their therapeutic effects on HSV1-infected laboratory animals have been studied.">

This review focuses on some newly identified SARS-CoV inhibitors, with known mechanisms of action and their potential to inhibit the novel MERS-CoV.

Although a variety of new drugs have been developed for HIV, HCV and influenza virus, the optimal combinations of multiple drugs are incompletely understood. To optimize the benefits of multi-drugs combinations, we must investigate the interactions between the combined drugs and their target viruses. Mathematical models of viral infection dynamics provide an ideal tool for this purpose. Additionally, whether drug combinations computed by these models are synergistic can be assessed by two prominent drug combination theories, Loewe additivity and Bliss independence. By combining the mathematical modeling of virus dynamics with drug combination theories, we could show the principles by which drug combinations yield a synergistic effect. Here, we describe the theoretical aspects of multi-drugs therapy and discuss their application to antiviral research.">

Optimized distribution networks increased expected access to 91% overall and 60% in hard-to-reach regions, and 2 or 3 major pharmacy chains achieved near maximal coverage in well-populated areas. Independent pharmacies were essential for reaching ZIP code areas containing &lt;1,000 underinsured persons.

In solid organ transplant and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients, cytomegalovirus infection is associated with high morbidity and preventable mortality. Prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus with currently approved antiviral drugs is often associated with side effects that sometimes preclude their use. Moreover, cytomegalovirus has developed mutations that confer resistance to standard antiviral drugs. During the last decade, there have been calls to develop novel antiviral drugs that could provide better options for prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus. Letermovir (AIC246) is a highly specific antiviral drug that is currently undergoing clinical development for the management of cytomegalovirus infection. It acts by inhibiting the viral terminase complex. Letermovir is highly potent in vitro and in vivo against cytomegalovirus. Because of a distinct mechanism of action, it does not exhibit cross-resistance with other antiviral drugs. It is predicted to be active against strains that are resistant to ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir. To date, early-phase clinical trials suggest a very low incidence of adverse effects. Herein, we present a comprehensive review on letermovir, from its postulated novel mechanism of action to the results of most recent clinical studies.">

OBJECTIVES: The current randomized controlled clinical trials aimed to evaluate the efficacy of combinations of antiviral and non-antiviral hepatoprotective agents on indexes of liver function and liver fibrosis in patients with hepatitis B. DATA SOURCES: Published literatures in Chinese and English on hepatoprotective treatment strategies for chronic hepatitis B and liver fibrosis were searched in three databases and randomized controlled clinical trials were selected. STUDY SELECTION: Data were extracted according to a variety of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis was employed to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 22 randomized controlled trials encompassing 1,714 cases were considered in the meta-analysis. The obtained results indicated that the combination of antiviral drug and hepatoprotective agent was better than antiviral drug alone to improve liver function. Similarly, regarding liver fibrosis, using two different hepatoprotective agents was better than using one agent. The normalization rates of Aminotransferase (ALT) and total Bilirubin (TBil) were improved 25.7% by two hepatoprotective agents compared to the single agent. Acetylcysteine was superior to ursodeoxycholic acid or silibinin to reduce ALT. Ursodeoxycholic acid was superior to acetylcysteine or silibinin to reduce TBIL. CONCLUSIONS: Hepatoprotective agents combined with antiviral drugs can significantly improve liver function and liver fibrosis parameters in patients with hepatitis B.">

        <span class="abst" title="Endoretroviruses account for circa 8 % of all transposable elements found in the genome of humans and other animals. They represent a genetic footprint of ancestral germ-cell infections of exoviruses that is transmittable to the progeny by Mendelian segregation. Traces of human endogenous retroviruses are physiologically expressed in ovarial, testicular and placental tissues as well as in stem cells. In addition, a number of these fossil viral elements have also been related to carcinogenesis. However, a relation between endoretroviruses expression and chemoresistance has not been reported yet.Twenty colorectal carcinoma patient samples were scrutinized for HERV-WE1 and HERV-FRD1 endoretroviruses using immunohistochemical approaches. In order to search for differential expression of these elements in chemotherapy refractory cells, a resistant HCT8 colon carcinoma subline was developed by serial etoposide exposure. Endoretroviral elements were detected by immunocytochemical staining, qPCR and ELISA. IC50-values of antiviral and cytostatic drugs in HCT8 cells were determined by MTT proliferation assay. The antivirals-cytostatics interaction was evaluated by the isobologram method.In this work, we show for the first time that HERV-WE1, HERV-FRD1, HERV-31, and HERV-V1 are a) simultaneously expressed in treatment-naïve colon carcinoma cells and b) upregulated after cytostatic exposure, suggesting that these retroviral elements are intimately related to chemotherapy resistance. We found a number of antiviral drugs to have cytotoxic activity and the ability to force the downregulation of HERV proteins in vitro. We also demonstrate that the use of different antiviral compounds alone or in combination with anticancer agents results in a synergistic antiproliferative effect and downregulation of different endoretroviral elements in highly chemotherapy-resistant colorectal tumor cells.Enhanced HERV-expression is associated with chemoresistance in colon carcinomas which can be overcome by antiviral drugs alone or in combination with anticancer drugs. Therefore, the introduction of antiviral compounds to the current chemotherapy regimens potentially improves patient outcomes.">

        <span class="abst" title="A small number of individuals with B-cell-related primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) may exhibit long-term (prolonged or chronic) excretion of immunodeficiency-associated vaccine-derived polioviruses (iVDPVs) following infection with oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV). These individuals pose a risk of live poliovirus reintroduction into the population after global wild poliovirus eradication and subsequent OPV cessation. Treatment with polio antiviral drugs may potentially stop excretion in some of these individuals and thus may reduce the future population risk.We developed a discrete event simulation model to characterize the global prevalence of long-term iVDPV excretors based on the best available evidence. We explored the impact of different assumptions about the effectiveness of polio antiviral drugs and the fraction of long-term excretors identified and treated.Due to the rarity of long-term iVDPV excretion and limited data on the survival of PID patients in developing countries, uncertainty remains about the current and future prevalence of long-term iVDPV excretors. While the model suggests only approximately 30 current excretors globally and a rapid decrease after OPV cessation, most of these excrete asymptomatically and remain undetected. The possibility that one or more PID patients may continue to excrete iVDPVs for several years after OPV cessation represents a risk for reintroduction of live polioviruses after OPV cessation, particularly for middle-income countries. With the effectiveness of a single polio antiviral drug possibly as low as 40% and no system in place to identify and treat asymptomatic excretors, the impact of passive use of a single polio antiviral drug to treat identified excretors appears limited. Higher drug effectiveness and active efforts to identify long-term excretors will dramatically increase the benefits of polio antiviral drugs.Efforts to develop a second polio antiviral compound to increase polio antiviral effectiveness and/or to maximize the identification and treatment of affected individuals represent important risk management opportunities for the polio endgame. Better data on the survival of PID patients in developing countries and more longitudinal data on their exposure to and recovery from OPV infections would improve our understanding of the risks associated with iVDPV excretors and the benefits of further investments in polio antiviral drugs.">

The simplest theories of counterproductive behavioral responses to such interventions tend to focus on single feedback mechanisms: for instance, HAART optimism makes infection less scary and thus promotes risky sexual behavior. Here, we develop an agent based, age-structured model of HIV transmission, risk perception, and partner selection in a core group to explore behavioral responses to interventions. We find that interventions can activate not one, but several feedback mechanisms that could potentially influence decision-making and HIV prevalence. In the model, HAART increases the attractiveness of unprotected sex, but it also increases perceived risk of infection and, on longer timescales, causes demographic impacts that partially counteract HAART optimism. Both HAART and vaccination usually lead to lower rates of unprotected sex on the whole, but intervention effectiveness depends strongly on whether individuals over- or under-estimate intervention coverage. Age-specific effects cause sexual behavior and HIV prevalence to change in opposite ways in old and young age groups. For complex infections like HIV-where interventions influence transmission, demography, sexual behavior and risk perception-we conclude that evaluations of behavioral responses should consider multiple feedback mechanisms.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVES:Recent decades have witnessed the development of highly innovative new antiviral drug therapies. However, there are concerns that rising costs and lengthening development times could have implications for future patient access to innovative new drugs. We sought to establish whether the time taken for the clinical development of new antiviral drugs launched in the UK had increased since the 1980s. DESIGN AND SETTING:Retrospective observational study of all new antiviral drugs licensed for use in the UK. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES:Duration of clinical development (from initiation of studies in humans to receipt of Marketing Authorisation), subdivided into clinical trial and regulatory approval periods by the date of Marketing Authorisation Application. RESULTS:48 new antiviral drugs were licensed for use in the UK between 1981 and 2014 (inclusive), over half (54%) initially for HIV infection. The overall mean duration of clinical development was 77.2 months, of which 64.6 months was spent in clinical trials before regulatory submission. The total time in clinical development increased from 41.7 months for drugs licensed 1981-1992 to 91.7 months for drugs licensed 2004-2014. This increase was accounted for by an increase in the clinical trials period and not the regulatory approval period, for which there was no observable trend. Drugs initially licensed to treat hepatitis C had a longer duration of clinical development than those indicated for other viral infections. However, the, initially shorter clinical development durations of drugs indicated for HIV infection increased more rapidly across the study period than those indicated for other viral infections. CONCLUSIONS:The time spent by antiviral drugs in clinical development has increased markedly in recent decades despite many initiatives to speed access to innovative new drugs. However, this represents only one part of the translational research pathway, and a complete picture of development timeframes is lacking.">

We analyse the cellular pathways in which human proviral genes are involved and identify druggable targets. Twenty-one small-molecule inhibitors, some of which are FDA approved, targeting six proviral factors or pathways, have high antiviral activity in vitro, with low toxicity. Three identified inhibitors have prophylactic antiviral effects in mouse models of chikungunya infection. Two of them, the calmodulin inhibitor pimozide and the fatty acid synthesis inhibitor TOFA, have a therapeutic effect in vivo when combined. These results demonstrate the value of loss-of-function screening and pathway analysis for the rational identification of small molecules with therapeutic potential and pave the way for the development of new, host-directed, antiviral agents.">

We studied the comparative safety, effectiveness, and treatment costs of the two first generation direct-acting antiviral agents (DAA), boceprevir and telaprevir as uncertainty existed regarding the drug of choice between these two seemingly equally Hepatitis-C treatment options.We randomly assigned 50 patients in an open-label, pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) at a VA Medical Center to either boceprevir or telaprevir in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin, stratified by the presence of cirrhosis and prior treatment experience. Tolerability was assessed at each visit and reasons for discontinuation of treatment and severity of adverse events due to PI treatment were adjudicated using a blinded adjudication committee. The primary outcome was difference in tolerability between boceprevir vs. telaprevir. Secondary outcomes included viral response rates and cost-per cure achieved.Higher rates of treatment discontinuations and/or severe DAA associated adverse events were seen in 10/25 (40%) patients randomized to telaprevir compared to 2/25 (8%) patients randomized to boceprevir (RR: 5; 95% CI: 1.2, 20; p&lt;0.01). Cure rates did not appear to be significantly different between groups (telaprevir vs. boceprevir: RR 1.23; 95% CI: 0.76, 1.99; p = 0.39). On an intention-to-treat basis, total cost per cure was $44,329 for boceprevir vs. $57,115 for telaprevir. The significant side effect profile of telaprevir combined with the availability of highly efficacious second generation DAAs led to the early discontinuation of the trial.Telaprevir is associated with a significantly higher rate of severe adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations, hospitalizations or severe anemia and a substantially higher cost per SVR when compared to boceprevir. Real-time, point of care, pragmatic randomized controlled trials are necessary for guidance beyond just acquisition costs and to make evidence-based formulary selections when multiple effective treatments are available.

This study undertaken to identify suitable candidates for peg-interferon plus ribavirin (PEG-IFN/RBV) treatment by evaluating hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in patients with chronic HCV treated or not with PEG-IFN/RBV.This large-scale retrospective study was conducted on 1176 patients with chronic HCV without a history of HCC (treatment group [n = 489] and no-treatment group [n = 687]). In the treatment group, patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV were dichotomized based on the achievement of sustained virologic response (SVR) into SVR (+) and SVR (-) groups.Median follow-up for all study subjects was 31 months (range 6-144 months). Three-year cumulative HCC development rates in the SVR (+) (1.1%) and SVR (-) (8.6%) subgroups were significantly lower than in the no-treatment group (13.5%) (P &lt; 0.01 and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). In all study subjects, presence of cirrhosis (hazard ratio [HR], 9.92, P &lt; 0.01), age (HR 1.03, P &lt; 0.01), SVR (-) (HR 7.02, P &lt; 0.01), and no-treatment (HR 6.76, P &lt; 0.01) were found to be independent risk factors of HCC development. In the treatment group, age, the presence of cirrhosis, and SVR (-) were predictors of HCC development. In the no-treatment group, age, male, and the presence of cirrhosis were independent predictors for HCC development.HCC risk increased in patients with chronic HCV with older age, cirrhosis, SVR (-) after PEG-IFN/RBV treatment, and no PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. Active antiviral therapy based on highly effective oral drugs needs to be considered in these patients.">

        <span class="abst" title="Adenovirus infections of immunocompromised patients can cause a severe multi-organ disease that often results in the patients' death. Presently, there are no drugs specifically approved to treat adenovirus infections, and clinicians resort to the off-label use of antivirals that are approved to treat other DNA virus infections, most frequently cidofovir (CDV). CDV, however, has considerable nephrotoxicity, thus it is recommended only for the most severe cases of adenovirus infections. To facilitate the development of effective, non-toxic antivirals against adenovirus, we have developed a permissive animal model based on the Syrian hamster that can be used to test the efficacy of antiviral compounds. Here, we show that in the hamster model, HAdV-C6 is a more useful challenge virus than the previously described HAdV-C5, because it is filtered out by tissue macrophages to a lesser extent. HAdV-C6 has a 10-fold lower LD50 in hamsters than HAdV-C5 and the pathology is caused by virus replication to a larger extent. We show that valganciclovir (VGCV), a drug that was shown to be active against intravenous HAdV-C5 infection previously, is efficacious against HAdV-C6 when administered either prophylactically or therapeutically. Further, we show for the first time that VGCV, and to a lesser extent CDV, can be used to treat respiratory adenovirus infections in the hamster model. These results extend the utility of the hamster model, and demonstrate the efficacy of two drugs available for clinicians to treat adenovirus infections.">

Most of the rejections occurred within the first year of the transplantation and none resulted in immediate loss of the graft. In post-transplantation period, 14 patients developed clinical hepatic disease, 10 manifested new-onset diabetes after transplantation, and 4 had de novo neoplasia, none of them had hepatocellular carcinoma. The outcomes of the different variables analyzed were similar between patients with HCV-infection and those with HCV and HBV co-infection. The median survival time was 13.4 (95% CI: 10.7-16.1) years; the median survival time of patients without HCV infection was 14.6 (95% CI: 13.8-15.4) years (p=0.23).In the era before the availability of new anti-HCV drugs, our experience with HCV-infected renal transplant recipients revealed similar post-transplantation complications, graft and patient survival as those not infected with HCV.">

Experimentally infected cats have measurable immune suppression, which sometimes progresses to an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. A transient initial state of infection is followed by a long latent stage with low virus replication and absence of clinical signs. In the terminal stage, both viruses can cause severe immunosuppression. Thus, FIV infection in cats has become an important natural model for studying HIV infection in humans, especially for evaluation of antiviral compounds. Of particular importance for chemotherapeutic studies is the close similarity between the reverse transcriptase (RT) of FIV and HIV, which results in high in vitro susceptibility of FIV to many RT-targeted antiviral compounds used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients. Thus, the aim of this article is to provide an up-to-date review of studies on antiviral treatment of FIV, focusing on commercially available compounds for human or animal use.">

So far, the potency of treatment of DENV via antiviral drugs is still under investigation. Recently, increasing evidences suggest the potential role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in regulating DENV. The present study focused on the function of miRNAs in innate insusceptible reactions and organization of various types of immune cells and inflammatory responses for DENV. Three drugs were tested including antiviral herbal medicine ReDuNing (RDN), Loratadine (LRD) and Acetaminophen. RESULTS:By the microarray expression of miRNAs in 165 Patients. Results showed that 89 active miRNAs interacted with 499 potential target genes, during antiviral treatment throughout the critical stage of DENV. Interestingly, reduction of the illness threats using RDN combined with LRD treatment showed better results than Acetaminophen alone. The inhibitions of DENV was confirmed by decrease concentrations of cytokines and interleukin parameters; like TNF-α, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-17; after treatment and some coagulants factors increased. CONCLUSIONS:This study showed a preliminary support to suggest that the herbal medicine RDN combined with LRD can reduce both susceptibility and the severity of DENV.">

Nucleoside analogs generally interfere with cellular nucleos(t)ide synthesis pathways, resulting in the depletion or imbalance of (d)NTP pools. Intriguingly, a few recent reports have shown that some nucleoside analogs, including gemcitabine, activated innate immunity, inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes, through nucleos(t)ide synthesis inhibition. The precise crosstalk between these two independent processes remains to be determined. Nonetheless, we summarize the current knowledge of nucleos(t)ide synthesis inhibition-related innate immunity and propose it as a newly emerging antiviral mechanism of nucleoside analogs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Although several viruses can easily infect the central nervous system (CNS), antiviral drugs often show dramatic difficulties in penetrating the brain from the bloodstream since they are substrates of active efflux transporters (AETs). These transporters, located in the physiological barriers between blood and the CNS and in macrophage membranes, are able to recognize their substrates and actively efflux them into the bloodstream. The active transporters currently known to efflux antiviral drugs are P-glycoprotein (ABCB1 or P-gp or MDR1), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (ABCC1 or MRP1, ABCC4 or MRP4, ABCC5 or MRP5), and breast cancer resistance protein (ABCG2 or BCRP). Inhibitors of AETs may be considered, but their co-administration causes serious unwanted effects. Nasal administration of antiviral drugs is therefore proposed in order to overcome the aforementioned problems, but innovative devices, formulations (thermoreversible gels, polymeric micro- and nano-particles, solid lipid microparticles, nanoemulsions), absorption enhancers (chitosan, papaverine), and mucoadhesive agents (chitosan, polyvinilpyrrolidone) are required in order to selectively target the antiviral drugs and, possibly, the AET inhibitors in the CNS. Moreover, several prodrugs of antiretroviral agents can inhibit or elude the AET systems, appearing as interesting substrates for innovative nasal formulations able to target anti-Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) agents into macrophages of the CNS, which are one of the most important HIV Sanctuaries of the body.">

Comparatively, various natural or plant products have shown similar or even better efficacy. Hence, new antiviral strategies must focus not only on synthetic molecules but also on potential natural compounds. In this report, we have combined the in vitro cell culture and in silico molecular docking methods to assess the novel anti-HBV activity and delineate the inhibitory mechanism of selected plant-derived pure compounds of different classes. Of the tested (2.5-50 μg/ml) twelve non-cytotoxic compounds, ten (10 μg/ml) were found to maximally inhibit HBsAg production at day 5. Compared to quercetin (73%), baccatin III (71%), psoralen (67%), embelin (65%), menisdaurin (64%) and azadirachtin (62%) that showed high inhibition of HBeAg synthesis, lupeol (52%), rutin (47%), β-sitosterol (43%) and hesperidin (41%) had moderate efficacies against HBV replication. Further assessment of quercetin in combination with the highly active compounds, enhanced its anti-HBV activity up to 10%. Being the most important drug target, a 3-D structure of HBV polymerase (Pol/RT) was modeled and docked with the active compounds, including lamivudine as standard. Docking of lamivudine indicated strong interaction with the modeled HBV Pol active-site residues that formed stable complex (∆G = -5.2 kcal/mol). Similarly, all the docked antiviral compounds formed very stable complexes with HBV Pol (∆G = -6.1 to -9.3 kcal/mol). Taken together, our data suggest the anti-HBV potential of the tested natural compounds as novel viral Pol/RT inhibitors.">

Despite its recent establishment as a serious global public health concern there are no licensed therapeutics to control this virus. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop methods for the high-throughput screening of antiviral agents. We describe here a fluorescence-based method to monitor the real-time polymerization activity of Zika virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). By using homopolymeric RNA template molecules, de novo RNA synthesis can be detected with a fluorescent dye, which permits the specific quantification and kinetics of double-strand RNA formation. ZIKV RdRp activity detected using this fluorescence-based assay positively correlated with traditional assays measuring the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides. We also validated this method as a suitable assay for the identification of ZIKV inhibitors targeting the viral polymerase using known broad-spectrum inhibitors. The assay was also successfully adapted to detect RNA polymerization activity by different RdRps, illustrated here using purified RdRps from hepatitis C virus and foot-and-mouth disease virus. The potential of fluorescence-based approaches for the enzymatic characterization of viral polymerases, as well as for high-throughput screening of antiviral drugs, are discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Antiviral compounds targeting cellular metabolism instead of virus components have become an interesting issue for preventing and controlling the spread of virus infection, either as sole treatment or as a complement of vaccination. Some of these compounds are involved in the control of lipid metabolism and/or membrane rearrangements. Here, we describe the effect of three of these cell-targeting antivirals: lauryl gallate (LG), valproic acid (VPA), and cerulenin (CRL) in the multiplication of viruses causing important porcine diseases. The results confirm the antiviral action in cultured cells of LG against African swine fever virus (ASFV), foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and swine vesicular disease virus (SVDV), as well as the inhibitory effect of VPA and CRL on ASFV infection. Other gallate esters have been also assayed for their inhibition of FMDV growth. The combined action of these antivirals has been also tested in ASFV infections, with some synergistic effects when LG and VPA were co-administered. Regarding the mode of action of the antivirals, experiments on the effect of the time of its addition in infected cell cultures indicated that the inhibition by VPA and CRL occurred at early times after ASFV infection, while LG inhibited a late step in FMDV infection. In all the cases, the presence of the antiviral reduced or abolished the induction of virus-specific proteins. Interestingly, LG also reduced mortality and FMDV load in a mouse model. The possible use of cell-targeted antivirals against porcine diseases is discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a common etiological agent of acute enteritis, which occurs globally in domestic and wild carnivores. Despite the widespread use of inactivated or live attenuated vaccines, the emergence of antigenic variants and the influence of maternal antibodies have raised some concerns regarding the efficacy of commercial vaccines. While no specific antiviral therapy for CPV infection exists, the only treatment option for the infection is supportive therapy based on symptoms. Thus, there is an urgent medical need to develop antiviral therapeutic options to reduce the burden of CPV-related disease. In this study, a cytopathic effect (CPE)-based high-throughput screening assay was used to screen CPV inhibitors from a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug library. After two rounds of screening, seven out of 1430 screened drugs were found to have &gt;50% CPE inhibition. Three drugs-Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel-with higher anti-CPV effects were further evaluated in F81 cells by absolute PCR quantification and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The inhibitory effects of all three drugs were dose-dependent. Time of addition assay indicated that the drugs inhibited the early processes of the CPV replication cycle, and the inhibition effects were relatively high within 2 h postinfection. Western blot assay also showed that the three drugs had broad-spectrum antiviral activity against different subspecies of three CPV variants. In addition, antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells regardless of CPV infection, while Closantel Sodium- or Closantel-treated cells had no pro- or antiapoptotic effects. In conclusion, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel can effectively inhibit different subspecies of CPV. Since the safety profiles of FDA-approved drugs have already been extensively studied, these three drugs can potentially become specific and effective anti-CPV drugs.">

However, poor availability, variation between batches and ethical issues regarding PHHs limit their applications. The discovery of human sodium taurocholate co‑transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) as a functional HBV receptor has enabled the development of a surrogate model to supplement the use of PHHs. In the present study, the evolutionary distance of seven species was assessed based on single‑copy homologous genes. Based on the evolutionary distance and availability, PHHs and primary rabbit hepatocytes (PRHs) were isolated and infected with hNTCP‑recombinant lentivirus, and susceptibility to HBV infection in the two cell types was tested and compared. In addition, HBV infection efficiency of hNTCP‑expressing PPHs with pooled HBV‑positive serum and purified particles was determined. The potential use of HBV‑infected hNTCP‑expressing PPHs for drug screening was assessed. The results demonstrated that pigs and rabbits are closer to humans in the divergence tree compared with mice and rats, indicating that pigs and rabbits were more likely to facilitate the HBV post‑entry lifecycle. Following hNTCP complementation and HBV infection, PPHs and Huh7D human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, but not PRHs, exhibited increased hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B e‑antigen secretion, covalently closed circular DNA formation and infectious particle secretion. hNTCP‑expressing PPHs were susceptible to infection with HBV particles purified from pooled HBV‑positive sera, but were poisoned by raw HBV‑positive sera. The use of HBV‑infected hNTCP‑expressing PPHs for viral entry inhibitor screening was revealed to be applicable and reproducible. In conclusion, hNTCP‑expressing PPHs may be valuable tool for investigating HBV infection and antiviral drugs.">

To date, no specific therapeutics have been developed that can prevent or treat infections resulting from this pathogen. DENV utilizes numerous host molecules and factors for transcribing the single-stranded ~11 kb positive-sense RNA genome. For example, the glycosylation machinery of the host is required for viral particles to assemble in the endoplasmic reticulum. Since a variety of host factors seem to be utilized by the pathogens, targeting these factors may result in DENV inhibitors, and will play an important role in attenuating the rapid emergence of other flaviviruses. Many experimental studies have yielded findings indicating that host factors facilitate infection, indicating that the focus should be given to targeting the processes contributing to pathogenesis along with many other immune responses. Here, we provide an extensive literature review in order to elucidate the progress made in the development of host-based approaches for DENV viral infections, focusing on host cellular mechanisms and factors responsible for viral replication, aiming to aid the potential development of host-dependent antiviral therapeutics.">

In this study, lithium chloride (LiCl) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG), which are host-acting antivirals (HAAs), were tested against PDCoV. We found that LiCl and DG inhibited PDCoV replication in LLC-PK1 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The antiviral effects of LiCl and DG occurred at the early stage of PDCoV replication, and DG also inhibited virus attachment to the cells. Moreover, both drugs inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis in LLC-PK1 cells. This study suggests LiCl and DG as new drugs for the treatment of PDCoV infection.">

In this study, we established the first ICR mouse model of CVA4 infection for the evaluation of inactivated vaccines and antiviral drug screening. The CVA4 YT226R strain was selected to infect the neonatal mice and three infectious factors were optimized to establish the infection model. The 3-day-old neonatal mice exhibited clinical symptoms such as hind limb paralysis and death. The severe inflammatory reactions were closely related to the abnormal expression of the acute phase response proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and an imbalance in the IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio. Importantly, the inactivated CVA4 whole-virus vaccine induced humoral immune responses in adult females and the maternal antibodies afforded mice complete protection against lethal dose challenges of homologous or heterologous CVA4 strains. Both IFN-α2a and antiserum inhibited the replication of CVA4 and increased the survival rates of neonatal mice during the early stages of infection. This neonatal murine model of CVA4 infection will be useful for the development of prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines and for screening of antiviral drugs targeting CVA4 to decrease morbidity and mortality.">

We infected lung slices of house-dust mite (HDM)-sensitized asthmatic mice ex vivo with human rhinovirus (RV) and investigated the effect of the antiviral drug rupintrivir on RV-induced cytokine response in lung tissue of HDM-sensitized mice ex vivo. METHODS:Mice were sensitized with HDM. Precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) were prepared from HDM-sensitized or non-sensitized mice. Lung slices were infected ex vivo with RV or RV together with rupintrivir. Modulation of immune responses was evaluated by cytokine secretion 48 h post infection. RESULTS:In vivo HDM sensitization resulted in a TH-2/TH-17-dominated cytokine response that persisted in PCLS ex vivo. RV infection of PCLS from non-sensitized mice resulted in the induction of an antiviral and pro-inflammatory immune response, as indicated by the secretion of IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-γ, TNF-α, MCP-1, IP-10, IL-10, and IL-17A. In contrast, PCLS from HDM-sensitized mice showed an attenuated antiviral response, but exaggerated IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 secretion upon infection. Rupintrivir inhibited exaggerated pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 and TH-2 cytokine IL-4 in HDM-sensitized mice. CONCLUSIONS:In summary, this study demonstrates that treatment with rupintrivir influences virus-induced IL-4 and IL-6 cytokine release under experimental conditions ex vivo.">

        <span class="abst" title="AbstractBackgroundNorovirus can cause chronic infections with serious morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. While there are no FDA-approved medications for these infections, nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and enterally administered pooled immunoglobulin (IVIG) are used off-label on the basis of expert opinion. Nitazoxanide and ribavirin show antiviral activity in a murine norovirus infection model and an in vitro replicon model of genotype GI.I human norovirus RNA expression, respectively. However, these drugs have not been evaluated in in vitro infections with GII.4 human noroviruses, responsible for most human norovirus disease. We used the stem cell-derived nontransformed human intestinal enteroid (HIE) system, which supports GII.4 human norovirus replication, to evaluate the antiviral activities of nitazoxanide, ribavirin, and IVIG.MethodsWe inoculated HIEs with GII.4 human norovirus in the presence of half-log dilutions of nitazoxanide (3 µM to 100 µM), ribavirin (10 µM to 10 mM), or IVIG (1:100 to 1:3,000) and a media control. One and 48 hours after inoculation, we extracted and quantified GII.4 norovirus RNA from the HIEs. To demonstrate that replication inhibition was not due to cytotoxicity, we performed quantitative lactate dehydrogenase release assays on the HIEs across the therapeutic range of each compound.ResultsNitazoxanide reduced GII.4 replication at 48 hours in a dose-dependent manner, achieving a &gt;90% reduction in viral replication at 10 µM without cytotoxicity. These findings were confirmed in multiple HIE lines representing different intestinal segments and established from different donors. IVIG completely inhibited GII.4 replication at up to a 1:1,000 dilution and was not cytotoxic at therapeutic concentrations. Ribavirin did not reduce GII.4 replication at concentrations up to 10 mMµM, well in excess of levels achieved in human sera with standard doses.ConclusionNitazoxanide and IVIG, but not ribavirin, potently inhibit GII.4 human norovirus replication in a biologically relevant in vitro model of human norovirus infection. These data highlight the use of HIEs as a new pre-clinical model for developing therapeutics for human norovirus disease.Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.">

We compared the percentage of participants in each arm linked to HCV care (defined as one visit with HCV treatment provider), and initiated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) treatment within 6 months of enrollment.ResultsAmong the 65 participants, the mean age is 41.2 years; 28% are females; 73% homeless; 6% black, 51% Latina/o and 39% white. 82% of participants had injected drugs in the last 30 days, with an average of 13.2 injections/month (median 10). Nearly all participants had health insurance, 88% public insurance, 6% uninsured. Thirty-two participants were randomized to the Accessible Care arm. Within 6 months of enrollment 79% of the Accessible Care arm and 25% of the Usual Care arm had linked to HCV care, and 69% and 13% had been started on DAA therapy, respectively. Of the 26 participants in the Accessible Care arm started on DAA therapy, the median time from enrollment to treatment initiation was 87.5 days [range 22–180].ConclusionAmong HCV-infected PWID enrolled at a syringe service program, higher rates of linkage to care and treatment initiation were seen in the Accessible Care arm where stigma- and shame-free treatment was located within a community-based location.Disclosures All authors: No reported disclosures.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Antiviral drugs are widely used in populations with viral infection caused by immunologic inadequacy. Because these drugs are mainly metabolized by the kidneys, patients with renal failure undergoing renal replacement therapy are prone to drug adverse effects and poisoning. Severe neurotoxicity caused by antiviral drugs is a rare but life-threatening complication. CASE SUMMARY:This study reported one male patient on peritoneal dialysis who suffered from severe mental disorders after receiving an overdose of acyclovir and valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The literature review suggested that hemodialysis is better than peritoneal dialysis to clear acyclovir from the circulation. The patient died after his consciousness deteriorated despite peritoneal dialysis and continuous blood purification. CONCLUSION:This case emphasizes cautiousness when using anti-retroviral drugs in patients with uremia. Hemodialysis is optimal method to remove the drugs.">

We have used this system to characterize enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. Single-cell analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can be distinguished by principal component analysis.

        <span class="abst" title="While efforts to control malaria with available tools have stagnated, and arbovirus outbreaks persist around the globe, the advent of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-based gene editing has provided exciting new opportunities for genetics-based strategies to control these diseases. In one such strategy, called &quot;population replacement&quot;, mosquitoes, and other disease vectors are engineered with effector genes that render them unable to transmit pathogens. These effector genes can be linked to &quot;gene drive&quot; systems that can bias inheritance in their favor, providing novel opportunities to replace disease-susceptible vector populations with disease-refractory ones over the course of several generations. While promising for the control of vector-borne diseases on a wide scale, this sets up an evolutionary tug-of-war between the introduced effector genes and the pathogen. Here, we review the disease-refractory genes designed to date to target Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmitted by Anopheles gambiae, and arboviruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti, including dengue serotypes 2 and 3, chikungunya, and Zika viruses. We discuss resistance concerns for these effector genes, and genetic approaches to prevent parasite and viral escape variants. One general approach is to increase the evolutionary hurdle required for the pathogen to evolve resistance by attacking it at multiple sites in its genome and/or multiple stages of development. Another is to reduce the size of the pathogen population by other means, such as with vector control and antimalarial drugs. We discuss lessons learned from the evolution of resistance to antimalarial and antiviral drugs and implications for the management of resistance after its emergence. Finally, we discuss the target product profile for population replacement strategies for vector-borne disease control. This differs between early phase field trials and wide-scale disease control. In the latter case, the demands on effector gene efficacy are great; however, with new possibilities ushered in by CRISPR-based gene editing, and when combined with surveillance, monitoring, and rapid management of pathogen resistance, the odds are increasingly favoring effector genes in the upcoming evolutionary tug-of-war.">

With the availability of highly effective and well tolerated direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy, treatment of chronic HCV infection has rapidly evolved, making HCV treatment less burdensome. However, the high cost of DAA and lack of clinical expertise are still important barriers for providing DAA therapy to rural patients, highlighting the urban-rural disparities in managing many chronic diseases for aging populations. Telehealth could serve as effective care-model to improve management of HCV infection for older, rural populations. This talk will present work that examines multi-level factors affecting HCV DAA treatment (focusing on urban-rural disparities), evaluates changes in urban-rural disparities in DAA utilization over time, and explores the role of a telehealth-based intervention in reducing urban-rural disparities in HCV DAA treatment in Medicare patients.">

        <span class="abst" title="Approximately 80% of adults are infected with a member of the herpesviridae family. Herpesviruses establish life-long latent infections within neurons, which may reactivate into lytic infections due to stress or immune suppression. There are nine human herpesviruses (HHV) posing health concerns from benign conditions to life threatening encephalitis, including cancers associated with viral infections. The current treatment options for most HHV conditions mainly include several nucleoside and nucleotide analogs targeting viral DNA polymerase. Although these drugs help manage infections, their common mechanism of action may lead to the development of drug resistance, which is particularly devastating in immunocompromised patients. Therefore, new classes of drugs directed against novel targets in HHVs are necessary to alleviate this issue. We analyzed the conservation rates of all proteins in herpes simplex virus 1 (HHV-1), a representative of the HHV family and one of the most common viruses infecting the human population. Furthermore, we generated a full-length structure model of the most conserved HHV-1 protein, the DNA packaging terminase pUL15. A series of computational analyses were performed on the model to identify ATP and DNA binding sites and characterize the dynamics of the protein. Our study indicates that proteins involved in HHV-1 DNA packaging and cleavage are amongst the most conserved gene products of HHVs. Since the packaging protein pUL15 is the most conserved among all HHV-1 gene products, the virus will have a lower chance of developing resistance to small molecules targeting pUL15. A subsequent analysis of the structure of pUL15 revealed distinct ATP and DNA binding domains and the elastic network model identifies a functionally important hinge region between the two domains of pUL15. The atomic information on the active and allosteric sites in the ATP- and DNA-bound model of pUL15 presented in this study can inform the structure-based drug discovery of a new class of drugs to treat a wide range of HHVs.">

The rapid emergence of resistance, and high costs, as well as the related side effects of synthetic antiviral drugs, raise the need to identify novel, effective, and safe alternatives against viral diseases. Nature has been of the most exceptional help and source of inspiration for developing novel multi-target antiviral compounds, affecting several steps of the viral life cycle and host proteins. For that matter and due to safety and efficacy limitations, as well as high resistance rate of conventional therapies, hundreds of natural molecules are preferred over the synthetic drugs. Besides, natural antiviral agents have shown acceptable antiviral value in both preclinical and clinical trials.This is the first review regarding molecular and cellular pathways of the virus life cycle, treatment strategies, and therapeutic targets of several viral diseases with a particular focus on anthocyanins as promising natural compounds for significant antiviral enhancements.

In our work, the antiviral effect of the compounds isolated from the aerial parts of Marcetia taxifolia was evaluated against Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Herpes Simplex Virus type 1 (HSV-1), and Poliovirus type 1 (PV-1). The cytopathic effect and viral quantification by qPCR were determined as indicative of antiviral activity. Our data show that myricetin rhamnoside (MyrG), myricetin-3-α-O-ramnosil (1→6)-α-galactoside (MyrGG), 5,3'-dihydroxy-3,6,7,8,4'-pentamethoxyflavone (PMF), 5-hydroxy-3,6,7,3',4'pentamethoxyflavone (PMF-OH) had antiviral activity without cytotoxic effects. The methoxyflavones PMF and PMF-OH were the most active compounds, showing an antiviral effect against all the evaluated viruses. Computational studies showed that these compounds could interact with the Reverse Transcriptase. Altogether, these results suggest that the flavonoids (related to myricetin and methoxyflavones) are the main antiviral compounds present in the aerial parts of Marcetia taxifolia. Furthermore, our results showed that the methoxyflavones have a broad antiviral activity, which represents an opportunity to evaluate these flavonoids as lead molecules to develop new antiviral compounds.">

The interaction of the three flavonoids was confirmed using a tryptophan-based fluorescence method, too. An induced-fit docking analysis indicated that S1, S2 and S3' sites are involved in binding with flavonoids. The comparison with previous studies showed that Triton X-100 played a critical role in objecting false positive or overestimated inhibitory activity of flavonoids. With the systematic analysis, the three flavonoids are suggested to be templates to design functionally improved inhibitors.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Commercially available antiviral drugs, when used in the treatment of viral infections, do not always result in success. This is an urgent problem currently that needs to be addressed because several viruses including influenza and paramyxoviruses are acquiring multi-drug resistance. A potential solution for this emerging issue is to create new antiviral drugs from available compounds of natural products. It is known that the majority of drugs have been developed using compounds derived from actinomycetes, which are naturally occurring gram-positive bacteria. The purpose of this study was to investigate the antiviral properties of extremophilic actinomycetes extracts from strains that were isolated from extreme environments in Kazakhstan. METHODS:Five strains of extremophilic actinomycetes isolated from the unique ecosystems of Kazakhstan were extracted and tested for antiviral activity against influenza viruses (strains H7N1, H5N3, H1N1 and H3N2) and paramyxoviruses (Sendai Virus and Newcastle Disease Virus). The antiviral activity of these selected extracts was tested by checking their effect on hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities of the studied viruses. Additionally, actinomycetes extracts were compared with commercially available antiviral drugs and some plant preparations that have been shown to exhibit antiviral properties. RESULTS:The main findings show that extracts from strains K-192, K-340, K-362, K-522 and K525 showed antiviral activities when tested using influenza viruses, Sendai Virus, and Newcastle Disease Virus. These activities were comparable to those shown by Rimantadine and Tamiflu drugs, and &quot;Virospan&quot; and &quot;Flavovir&quot; plant preparations. CONCLUSIONS:We identified several extracts with antiviral activities against several strains of influenza viruses and paramyxoviruses. Our research findings can be applied towards characterization and development of new antiviral drugs from the active actinomycetes extracts.">

HSV-1 causes numerous infection-related diseases, some of which are severely life-threatening. There are antiviral medications with activity against HSV-1. However, with the emergence of drug-resistant mutant strains of HSV-1, there is an urgent need to develop new effective anti-HSV-1 agents. METHODS:Therefore, we screened a chemical library of approximately 1500 compounds to identify inhibitors of HSV-1-induced toxicity for further drug development. Moreover, we performed several experiments, including western blot analysis, Q-PCR analysis and luciferase activity assay, to explore the antiviral mechanism of the candidates. RESULTS:Here, we identified a small molecule, mitoxantrone dihydrochloride, with potency against HSV-1-induced toxicity. Furthermore, the viral titers and expression levels of HSV-1 viral proteins were potently reduced by the presence of MD in many cell lines. Using Q-PCR analysis, we found that MD efficiently reduced the transcription of viral genes that are essential for DNA synthesis, namely, UL5, UL9, UL29, UL30, UL42 and UL52. Notably, MD also significantly inhibited the transcription of the immediate early genes ICP0, ICP22, ICP27 and ICP47, all of which are required for the expression of early and late viral gene products. Using immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, we found that the antiviral effect of MD was independent of the activation of the NF-κB and MAPK pathways. Furthermore, we found that the reduction in the transcription of viral immediate early genes was not related to the promoter activities of ICP0. CONCLUSIONS:Therefore, the identification of compound MD as an inhibitor of toxicity induced by HSV-1 highlights its potential use in the development of novel anti-HSV-1 drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Omeprazole was shown to improve the anti-cancer effects of the nucleoside analogue 5-fluorouracil. Here, we combined omeprazole with the antiviral nucleoside analogues ribavirin and acyclovir. Omeprazole did not affect the antiviral effects of ribavirin in non-toxic concentrations up to 80 μg/mL but increased the acyclovir-mediated effects on herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2) replication in a dose-dependent manner. Omeprazole alone reduced HSV-1 and -2 titers [but not HSV-induced formation of cytopathogenic effects (CPE)] at concentrations ≥40 μg/mL. However, it exerted substantially stronger effects on acyclovir activity and also increased acyclovir activity at lower concentrations that did not directly interfere with HSV replication. Omeprazole 80 μg/mL caused a 10.8-fold (Vero cells) and 47.7-fold (HaCaT cells) decrease of the acyclovir concentrations that reduced HSV-1-induced CPE formation by 50% (IC50). In HSV-2-infected cells, omeprazole 80 μg/mL reduced the acyclovir IC50 by 7.3- (Vero cells) and 12.9-fold (HaCaT cells). In HaCaT cells, omeprazole 80 μg/mL reduced the HSV-1 titer in the presence of acyclovir 1 μg/mL by 1.6 × 105-fold and the HSV-2 titer in the presence of acyclovir 2 μg/mL by 9.2 × 103-fold. The proton pump inhibitors pantoprazole, rabeprazole, lansoprazole, and dexlansoprazole increased the antiviral effects of acyclovir in a similar fashion as omeprazole, indicating this to be a drug class effect. In conclusion, proton pump inhibitors increase the anti-HSV activity of acyclovir and are candidates for antiviral therapies in combination with acyclovir, in particular for topical preparations for the treatment of immunocompromised individuals who are more likely to suffer from severe complications.">

Current treatment options for KSHV infection and virus associated diseases are sometimes ineffective, therefore, more effectively antiviral agents are urgently needed. As a herpesvirus, lytic replication is critical for KSHV pathogenesis and oncogenesis. In this study, we have established a high-throughput screening assay by using an inducible KSHV+ cell-line, iSLK.219. After screening a compound library that consisted of 1280 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 15 hit compounds that effectively inhibited KSHV virion production were identified, most of which have never been reported with anti-KSHV activities. Interestingly, 3 of these drugs target histamine receptors or signaling. Our data further confirmed that antagonists targeting different histamine receptors (HxRs) displayed excellent inhibitory effects on KSHV lytic replication from induced iSLK.219 or BCBL-1 cells. In contrast, histamine and specific agonists of HxRs promoted viral lytic replication from induced iSLK.219 or KSHV-infected primary cells. Mechanistic studies indicated that downstream MAPK and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways were required for histamine/receptors mediated promotion of KSHV lytic replication. Direct knockdown of HxRs in iSLK.219 cells effectively blocked viral lytic gene expression during induction. Using samples from a cohort of HIV+ patients, we found that the KSHV+ group has much higher levels of histamine in their plasma and saliva than the KSHV- group. Taken together, our data have identified new anti-KSHV agents and provided novel insights into the molecular bases of host factors that contribute to lytic replication and reactivation of this oncogenic herpesvirus.">

        <span class="abst" title="Present-day drug therapies provide clear beneficial effects as many diseases can be driven into remission and the symptoms of others can be efficiently managed; however, the success of many drugs is limited due to both patient non-compliance and adverse off-target or toxicity-induced effects. There is emerging evidence that many of these side effects are caused by drug-induced impairment of mitochondrial function and eventual mitochondrial dysfunction. It is imperative to understand how and why drug-induced side effects occur and how mitochondrial function is affected. In an aging population, age-associated drug toxicity is another key area of focus as the majority of patients on medication are older. Therefore, with an aging population possessing subtle or even more dramatic individual differences in mitochondrial function, there is a growing necessity to identify and understand early on potentially significant drug-associated off-target effects and toxicity issues. This will not only reduce the number of unwanted side effects linked to mitochondrial toxicity but also identify useful mitochondrial-modulating agents. Mechanistically, many successful drug classes including diabetic treatments, antibiotics, chemotherapies and antiviral agents have been linked to mitochondrial targeted effects. This is a growing area, with research to repurpose current medications affecting mitochondrial function being assessed in cancer, the immune system and neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's disease. Here, we review the effects that pharmacological agents have on mitochondrial function and explore the opportunities from these effects as potential disease treatments. Our focus will be on cancer treatment and immune modulation.">

Methods:In this multicenter nationwide study a total of 971 HCT procedures (741 allo-HCT; 230 auto-HCT) over a period of 6 years were analyzed. Results:During this period 801 episodes of viral infections were diagnosed in 442 patients. The incidence of viral infections was 57.9% in allo-HCT and 4.8% in auto-HCT patients. The most frequent infections after allo-HCT were caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV), polyoma BK virus (BKV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The majority of infections occurred within the first 4 months after allo-HCT and over 80% required pharmacotherapy or symptomatic therapy. The median time of treatment of specific viral infection ranged from 7 (for EBV) to 24 (for CMV) days. The highest mortality was observed in case of CMV infection. The risk factors for viral infections were allo-HCT, acute leukemia, acute and chronic graft versus host disease (a/cGVHD), and matched unrelated donor (MUD)/mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD)-HCT. The risk factor for death from viral infection were CMV-IgG seropositivity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia recipient, and MUD/MMUD-HCT. The incidence of EBV infection requiring pre-emptive treatment with rituximab in allo-HCT children was 19.3%. In 30.8% cases of EBV infection, these episodes were preceded by other viral infection and treated with antivirals, which did not prevent development of EBV-DNA-emia with need of rituximab treatment in 81.5% cases. In 47.7% of these cases, GVHD was a factor enabling development of significant EBV-DNA-emia during antiviral therapy of other infection. Conclusion:We have shown that antiviral drugs do not prevent EBV reactivation in allo-HCT pediatric patients.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVES:To assess the potency of anti-viral treatment for hepatitis B virus-associated glomerulonephritis (HBV-GN). Method: We searched for controlled clinical trials on anti-viral therapy for HBV-GN in MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and PubMed from inception to March 11th 2019. Seven trials, including 182 patients met the criteria for evaluating. The primary outcome measures were proteinuria and changes in the estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the secondary outcome measure was hepatitis B e-antigen clearance. A fixed or random effect model was established to analyze the data. Subgroup analyses were performed to explore the effects of clinical trial type, anti-viral drug type, age, and follow-up duration. RESULTS:The total remission rate of proteinuria (OR = 10.48, 95% CI: 4.60-23.89, I2 = 0%), complete remission rate of proteinuria (OR = 11.64, 95% CI: 5.17-26.21, I2 = 23%) and clearance rate of Hepatitis Be Antigen (HBeAg) were significantly higher in the anti-viral treatment group than in the control group (OR = 27.08, 95% CI: 3.71-197.88, I2 = 63%). However, antiviral therapy was not as effective regarding the eGFR (MD = 5.74, 95% CI: -4.24-15.73). In the subgroup analysis, age and drug type had significant impacts on proteinuria remission, and study type and follow-up duration only slightly affected the heterogeneity. CONCLUSION:Antiviral therapy induced remission of proteinuria and increased HBeAg clearance but failed to improve the eGFR. Pediatric patients were more sensitive to antiviral therapy than adults. IFNs seem more effective but are accompanied by more adverse reactions than NAs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Pseudorabies virus (PRV), a member of the Herpesviridae, is the causative agent of an acute infectious disease in a variety of animals. The emergence of a novel variant strain brought huge economic losses to the pig industry since classical vaccine strains were not completely effective against variant strains. Therefore, the development of new anti-pseudorabies virus drugs and vaccines is of great significance for the treatment and prevention of pseudorabies. In this study, we found that germacrone, one of the major components of the essential oils extracted from Rhizoma Curcuma, was able to effectively inhibit PRV replication in a dose-dependent manner in vitro. Germacrone showed antiviral activity against PRV in the early phase of the viral replication cycle. Moreover, we found that germacrone does not directly kill the virus, nor does it affect the expression of the PRV receptor protein nectin-1, nectin-2, and CD155. Our results suggest germacrone could be used as an efficient microbicide or immunomodulatory agent in the control of the emerging variant PRV.">

        <span class="abst" title="Glomerular disease is an extra-hepatic manifestation of hepatitis C virus infection (HCV) and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is the most frequent glomerular disease associated with HCV. It occurs commonly in patients with HCV-related mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. Patients with HCV-related glomerular disease have been historically a difficult-to-treat group. The therapeutic armamentarium for HCV-related glomerular disease now includes antiviral regimens, selective or non-specific immunosuppressive drugs, immunomodulators, and symptomatic agents. The treatment of HCV-associated glomerular disease is dependent on the clinical presentation of the patient. The recent introduction of all-oral, interferon (IFN)-free/ribavirin (RBV)-free regimens is dramatically changing the course of HCV in the general population, and some regimens have been approved for HCV even in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease. According to a systematic review of the medical literature, the evidence concerning the efficacy/safety of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) of HCV-induced glomerular disease is limited. The frequency of sustained virological response was 92.5% (62/67). Full or partial clinical remission was demonstrated in many patients (n = 46, 68.5%) after DAAs. There were no reports of deterioration of kidney function in patients on DAAs. Many patients (n = 29, 43%) underwent immunosuppression while on DAAs. A few cases of new onset or relapsing glomerular disease in patients with HCV successfully treated with DAAs have been observed. In summary, DAA-based combinations are making easier the management of HCV. However, patients with HCV-induced glomerular disease are still a difficult-to-treat group even at the time of DAAs.">

It has many biological activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, antiviral, hypoglycemic, anti-tumor and inducing apoptosis. However, its solubility and bioavailability are poor and there are a few studies on it in vivo. In this study, to improve its solubility and bioavailability, the nanomicelles were prepared with TPGS and soluplus as carriers for the first time. The particle size, Zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, drug loading, stability, cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and metabolites in rats were studied. Cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and metabolites in rats of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles were compared with those of AMF. As a result, AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles with a particle size of 67.33 ± 2.01 nm and Zeta potential of -0.84133 ± 0.041405 mV were successfully prepared. The encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of the mixed nanomicelles were 99.18 ± 0.76% and 2.47 ± 0.01%, respectively. The physical and chemical properties of the mixed micelles were stable within 60 d, and the cytotoxicity of the mixed micelles was much greater than that of AMF monomers. Thirty-four kinds of metabolites of AMF were identified in rats. The metabolites were mainly distributed in rat feces. No metabolites were detected in bile and plasma. 14 kinds of metabolites of the mixed micelles in rats were detected, including 11 in feces, 6 in urine, and 3 in plasma, which indicated that the bioavailability of AMF has been improved. And the toxicity to cancer cells was enhanced, which laid a foundation for the development of new drugs.">

Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was used to determine the blood concentration of ETV. Pharmacokinetic characteristics of ETV (0.9 mg/kg) were investigated after co-administration with FZHY (0.55 g/kg) at certain time intervals in normal and model rats.Results: The analytical method for ETV was validated at 0.5-50 μg/L with a correlation coefficient = 0.9996, lower limit of quantitation of 0.5 μg/L and mean accuracy of 104.18 ± 9.46%. Compared with the ETV-N group, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the EF-2 group did not change significantly, but that of the EF-0 group decreased in Cmax to 27.38 μg/L, in AUC0-t from 323.84 to 236.67 μg/h/L, and a delay in Tmax from 0.75 to 6.00 h; that of the EF-0 group presented a decrease in Cmax of 61.92%, delay in t1/2 of 2.45 h and delay in Tmax of 2.92 h. The t1/2e and Vd/F of ETV were increased significantly to 8.01 h and 24.38 L/kg in the ETV-M group.Conclusions: The effects of FZHY on ETV pharmacokinetics were diminished with an increase of interval time. The best time to administer both drugs is &gt;2 h apart.">

Purpose:To assess medical students' and physicians' knowledge of drug prescribing recommendations in older patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2. Patients and Methods:A survey comprising a list of 64 drugs conducted in 183 medical students (Students), and 138 post-graduate trainees in internal medicine (Physicians). The respondents were asked to classify each drug into one of three categories: 1) no renal precautions; 2) dose should be reduced; and 3) medication should be avoided. Results:A range of 16.9-68.3% students and 14.5-81.2% physicians correctly classified drugs in the category &quot;No renal precautions.&quot; Drugs requiring dose reduction were correctly classified by 6-67.2% students, and 24.6-85.5% physicians. For drugs that should be avoided in subjects with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m2, the range was 6-44.8% in the Students, and 8.7-76.1% in the Physicians. The Physicians did better than the Students by classifying five drugs that do not require renal precautions, 12 drugs requiring dose reduction, and six medications that should be avoided. The Students had a higher percentage of correct answers for seven drugs in the category &quot;no renal precautions,&quot; and one drug requiring dose reduction. Conclusion:Medical students and post-graduate trainees in internal medicine have poor knowledge of drug prescribing recommendations in older patients with renal impairment.">

Oseltamivir carboxylate (OC) is the active prodrug of the NAI oseltamivir. There is lack of information on the use of embryonated chicken eggs for studying susceptibility of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 viruses to antiviral drugs. The aim of the present study was to assess the use of 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs for studying antiviral susceptibility of HPAI H5N1 viruses. Methods:Two HPAI H5N1 viruses isolated from India were used in the study. Fluorescence-based NAI assay was performed to determine antiviral susceptibility of these viruses. In ovo antiviral assays were carried out using 10 day old embryonated chicken eggs. The virus dilutions were incubated with 14 μg/ml of OC and inoculated in the allantoic cavity. In the eggs, 50 per cent egg infectious dose (EID50) titres as well as mortality were quantitated. Results:The two viruses used were susceptible to OC in the NAI assay. It was found that there was a significant drop in EID50titres; however, no significant protection from mortality after OC treatment was observed. Interpretation &amp; conclusions:By measuring viral titres, the egg model was suitable to study the susceptibility of HPAI viruses to antiviral drugs along with NAI assay. The present study highlights the use of eggs as a model to study susceptibility of HPAI viruses to OC.">

We identified the γ-pyrone polyketides Aureothin/Neoaureothin as potent hits by anti-HIV screening of an extensive natural compound collection. Total synthesis of a structurally diverse group of Aureothin-derivatives successfully identified a lead compound (#7) superior to Aureothin that combines strong anti-HIV activity (IC90&lt;45 nM), photostability and improved cell safety. Compound #7 inhibited de novo virus production from integrated proviruses by blocking the accumulation of HIV RNAs that encode the structural components of virions and include viral genomic RNAs. Thus, the mode-of-action displayed by compound #7 is different from those of all current clinical drugs. Proteomic analysis indicated that compound #7 does not affect global protein expression in primary blood cells and may modulate cellular pathways linked to HIV infection. Compound #7 inhibited multiple HIV genotypes, including HIV-type 1 and 2 and synergistically inhibited HIV in combination with clinical reverse transcriptase and integrase inhibitors. We conclude that compound #7 represents a promising new class of HIV inhibitors that will facilitate the identification of new virus-host interactions exploitable for antiviral attack and holds promise for further drug development.">

Materials and Methods:In this study, the antiviral effects of ZrO2 on H5N1 virus were assessed in vivo, and the molecular mechanism responsible for this protection was investigated. Results:Mice treated with 200 nm positively-charged NPs at a dose of 100 mg/kg showed higher survival rates and smaller reductions in weight. 200 nm ZrO2 activated mature dendritic cells and initially promoted the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. In the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, ZrO2 treatment led to less pathological lung injury, significant reduction in influenza A virus replication, and overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusion:This antiviral study using zirconia NPs shows protection of mice against highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and suggests strong application potential for this method, introducing a new tool against a wide range of microbial infections.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Porcine β-defensin 2 (PBD-2), produced by host cells, is an antimicrobial cysteine-rich cationic peptide with multi-functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that PBD-2 can kill various bacteria, regulate host immune responses and promote growth of piglets. However, the antiviral role of PBD-2 is rarely investigated. This study aimed to reveal the antiviral ability of PBD-2 against pseudorabies virus (PRV), the causative pathogen of Aujeszky's disease, in PK-15 cells and in a PBD-2 expressing transgenic (TG) mouse model. METHODS:In this study, the cytotoxicity of PBD-2 on PK-15 cells was measured by CCK-8 assay. PK-15 cells were incubated with PRV pre-treated with different concentrations of PBD-2 and PRV titers in cell culture supernatants were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). TG mice and wild-type (WT) mice were intraperitoneally injected with PRV and the survival rate was recorded for 10 days. Meanwhile, tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver of infected mice were observed and the viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung were analyzed by RT-qPCR. RESULTS:PBD-2 at a maximum concentration of 80 μg/mL displayed no significant cytotoxicity on PK-15 cells. A threshold concentration of PBD-2 at 40 μg/mL was required to inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells. The survival rate in PBD-2 TG mice was 50% higher than that of WT mice. In addition, TG mice showed alleviated tissue lesions in brain, spleen and liver compared with their WT littermates after PRV challenge, while viral loads of PRV in brain, liver and lung of TG mice were significantly lower than that of WT mice. CONCLUSIONS:PBD-2 could inhibit PRV proliferation in PK-15 cells and protect mice from PRV infection, which confirmed the antiviral ability of PBD-2 both in vitro and in vivo. The application of PBD-2 in developing anti-viral drugs or disease-resistant animals can be further investigated.">

        <span class="abst" title="Viral infections are responsible for many illnesses, and recent outbreaks have raised public health concerns. Despite the availability of many antiviral drugs, they are often unsuccessful due to the generation of viral mutants and less effective against their target virus. Identifying novel antiviral drugs is therefore of critical importance and natural products are an excellent source for such discoveries. Coumarin is one such natural compound that is a potential drug candidate owing to its properties of stability, solubility, and low toxicity. There are numerous evidences showing its inhibitory role against infection of various viruses such as HIV, Influenza, Enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16). The mechanisms involve either inhibition of proteins essential for viral entry, replication and infection or regulation of cellular pathways such as Akt-Mtor (mammalian target of rapamycin), NF-κB (nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells), and anti-oxidative pathway including NrF-2 (The nuclear factor erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2). This review summarizes the present state of understanding with a focus on coumarin's antiviral effect and their possible molecular mechanisms against Influenza virus, HIV, Hepatitis virus, Dengue virus and Chikungunya virus.">

We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of kushenin (KS) combined with entecavir (ETV) for chronic hepatitis B. METHODS:Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of KS combined with ETV for CHB will be identified from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Chinese Biomedical Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chongqing VIP, Wangfang Data. Literature screening and data extraction will be independently performed by 2 researchers. The cochrane collaboration tool for assessing risk of bias will be applied to evaluate the risk of bias of the RCTs included. The extracted data will be analyzed by Rev-man 5.3.0 software.

A total of 157 subjects were enrolled, of these 107 were HBV-infected patients, 54 receiving nucleoside analogues (NAs, Group A), 53 naive to antivirals (Group B) and 50 age-sex matched controls (Group C). All HBV-treated patients had negative HBV-DNA. Twenty (37,0%) received lamivudine + adefovir, 20 (37.0%) tenofovir, 2 (3.7%) lamivudine and 12 (22.2%) entecavir. Therapy median duration was 38 months (IQR 20-60) in NA-treated patients. Group A showed significantly higher mtDNA/nuclear (n) DNA ratio (p = 0.000008) compared to Group C and Group B (p = 0.002). Group B showed significantly higher mtDNA/nDNA ratio compared to Group C (p = 0.017). Group A and B had significantly lower mtRNA/nRNA ratio compared to Group C (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.00006, respectively).

The potential use of these peptides for various therapeutic purposes is increasing per diem. In order to excel in this research, the community requires web repositories that provide reliable and accurate information about these phyto-peptides. This work is an attempt to bridge the gaps in plant-based peptide research. PlantPepDB is a manually curated database that consists of 3848 plant-derived peptides among which 2821 are experimentally validated at the protein level, 458 have experimental evidence at the transcript level, 530 are predicted and only 39 peptides are inferred from homology. Incorporation of physicochemical properties and tertiary structure into PlantPepDB will help the users to study the therapeutic potential of a peptide, thus, debuts as a powerful resource for therapeutic research.

The introduction of new direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs) in 2014 has substantially improved hepatitis C treatment outcomes. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term cost effectiveness of DAAs in health care personnel (HP) with confirmed occupational diseases in Germany. A standardised database from a German statutory accident insurance was used to analyse the cost-effectiveness ratio for the DAA regimen in comparison with interferon-based triple therapies. Taking account of the clinical progression of the disease, a Markov model was applied to perform a base case analysis for a period of 20 years. The robustness of the results was determined using a univariate deterministic sensitivity analysis. The results show that treatment with DAAs is more expensive, but also more effective than triple therapies. The model also revealed that the loss of 3.23 life years can be averted per patient over the 20 years. Compared to triple therapies, DAA treatment leads to a higher sustained virologic response (SVR). Although this results in a decrease of costs in the long term, e.g., pension payments, DAA therapy will cause greater expense in the future due to the high costs of the drugs.">

The alteration of host cells Ca2+ homeostasis is one of the strategies that viruses use to modulate host cells signal transduction mechanisms in their favor. Host calcium-permeable channels and pumps (including voltage-gated calcium channels, store-operated channels, receptor-operated channels, transient receptor potential ion channels, and Ca2+-ATPase) mediate Ca2+ across the plasma membrane or subcellular organelles, modulating intracellular free Ca2+. Therefore, these Ca2+ channels or pumps present important aspects of viral pathogenesis and virus-host interaction. It has been reported that viruses hijack host calcium channels or pumps, disturbing the cellular homeostatic balance of Ca2+. Such a disturbance benefits virus lifecycles while inducing host cells' morbidity. Evidence has emerged that pharmacologically targeting the calcium channel or calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) can obstruct virus lifecycles. Impeding virus-induced abnormal intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis is becoming a useful strategy in the development of potent antiviral drugs. In this present review, the recent identified cellular calcium channels and pumps as targets for virus attack are emphasized.">

While antiviral drugs are available, in many cases, they are prone to the development of drug resistance. A way to overcome drug resistance associated with common antiviral therapies is to develop antivirals targeting host cellular co-factors critical to viral replication, such as DEAD-box helicase 3 X-linked (DDX3X), which plays key roles in RNA metabolism and the antiviral response. Here, we use biochemical/biophysical approaches and infectious assays to show for the first time that the small molecule RK-33 has broad-spectrum antiviral action by inhibiting the enzymatic activities of DDX3X. Importantly, we show that RK-33 is efficacious at low micromolar concentrations in limiting infection by human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV) or West Nile virus (WNV)-for all of which, no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapeutic is widely available. These findings establish for the first time that RK-33 is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that blocks DDX3X's catalytic activities in vitro and limits viral replication in cells.">

These effects were ascribed to the effects of eltrombopag on megakaryocytes. Here, we tested whether eltrombopag may also exert direct antiviral effects. Therapeutic eltrombopag concentrations inhibited HCMV replication in human fibroblasts and adult mesenchymal stem cells infected with six different virus strains and drug-resistant clinical isolates. Eltrombopag also synergistically increased the anti-HCMV activity of the mainstay drug ganciclovir. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that eltrombopag interfered with HCMV replication after virus entry. Eltrombopag was effective in thrombopoietin receptor-negative cells, and the addition of Fe3+ prevented the anti-HCMV effects, indicating that it inhibits HCMV replication via iron chelation. This may be of particular interest for the treatment of cytopenias after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as HCMV reactivation is a major reason for transplantation failure. Since therapeutic eltrombopag concentrations are effective against drug-resistant viruses, and synergistically increase the effects of ganciclovir, eltrombopag is also a drug-repurposing candidate for the treatment of therapy-refractory HCMV disease.">

Primary or reactivated HCMV infections cause severe disease in immunosuppressed patients and congenital defects in children. There is no vaccine for HCMV, and the currently approved antivirals come with major limitations. Most approved HCMV antivirals target late molecular processes in the viral replication cycle including DNA replication and packaging. &quot;Bright and early&quot; events in HCMV infection have not been exploited for systemic prevention or treatment of disease. Initiation of HCMV replication depends on transcription from the viral major immediate-early (IE) gene. Alternative transcripts produced from this gene give rise to the IE1 and IE2 families of viral proteins, which localize to the host cell nucleus. The IE1 and IE2 proteins are believed to control all subsequent early and late events in HCMV replication, including reactivation from latency, in part by antagonizing intrinsic and innate immune responses. Here we provide an update on the regulation of major IE gene expression and the functions of IE1 and IE2 proteins. We will relate this insight to experimental approaches that target IE gene expression or protein function via molecular gene silencing and editing or small chemical inhibitors.">

CMV may cause opportunistic infections, congenital infections and central nervous system infections. CMV infections are difficult to treat due to their specific life cycles, mutation, and latency characteristic. Despite recent advances, current drugs used for treating active CMV infections are limited in their efficacy, and the eradication of latent infections is impossible. Current antiviral agents which target the UL54 DNA polymerase are restricted because of nephrotoxicity and viral resistance. CMV also cannot be prevented or eliminated with a vaccine. Fortunately, letermovir which targets the human CMV (HCMV) terminase complex has been recently approved to treat CMV infections in humans. The growing point is developing antiviral agents against both lytically and latently infected cells. The nucleic acid-based therapeutic approaches including the external guide sequences (EGSs)-RNase, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are being explored to remove acute and/or latent CMV infections. HCMV vaccine is being developed for prophylaxis. Additionally, adoptive T cell therapy (ACT) has been experimentally used to combate drug-resistant and recurrent CMV in patients after cell and/or organ transplantation. Developing antiviral agents is promising in this area to obtain fruitful outcomes and to have a great impact on humans for the therapy of CMV infections.">

When transmitted to humans, they cause hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) in Asia and Europe and hantavirus (cardio) pulmonary syndrome (HPS) in the Americas. Clinical studies have shown that early treatments of HFRS patients with ribavirin (RBV) improve prognosis. Nevertheless, there is the need for urgent development of specific antiviral drugs. In the search for new RNA virus inhibitors, we recently identified a series of variously substituted 5,6-dichloro-1(2)-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazole derivatives active against the human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). Interestingly, several 2-phenyl-benzotriazoles resulted in fairly potent inhibitors of the Hantaan virus in a chemiluminescence focus reduction assay (C-FRA) showing an EC50 = 4-5 µM, ten-fold more active than ribavirin. Currently, there are no FDA approved drugs for the treatment of orthohantavirus infections. Antiviral activities and cytotoxicity profiles suggest that 5,6-dichloro-1(2)-phenyl-1(2)H-benzo[d][1,2,3]triazoles could be promising candidates for further investigation as a potential treatment of hantaviral diseases.">

The iron chelation therapy has improved the life expectancy of these patients and, consequently, a decrease in death due to heart disease may be observed, as well as an increase in liver disease due to the iron overload and HCV infection that lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Until few years ago, the recommended therapy for HCV treatment consisted of pegylated-interferon alpha plus ribavirin, a therapy with important side effects. This treatment has been severely limited to thalassemic and SCD patients due to the hemolytic anemia induced by ribavirin causing an increase in the number of blood transfusions. The development of highly effective Direct-acting Antiviral Agents toward different viral genotypes has led to a real HCV eradication with negative viremia and sustained viral response between 90 and 98%. At the beginning some indications of Direct-acting Antiviral Agents administration were available for those patients exhibiting advanced cirrhosis or needing liver transplantation over time for the high costs of the new drugs. Recently, all treatment regimens can be used for patients with various HCV genotypes, different stages of liver disease, and comorbidities. The HCV eradication has also led to a marked improvement in the parameters of martial accumulation, demonstrating a synergic action also between the effect of antiviral therapy and iron chelation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) are highly prevalent within the human population and are characterized by lifelong infections and sporadic recurrences due to latent neuron infection. Upon reactivations, HSVs may manifest either, symptomatically or asymptomatically and be shed onto others through mucosae body fluids. Although, HSVs can produce severe disease in humans, such as life-threatening encephalitis and blindness, the most common symptoms are skin and mucosal lesions in the oro-facial and the genital areas. Nucleoside analogs with antiviral activity can prevent severe HSV infection, yet they are not very effective for treating skin manifestations produced by these viruses, as they only reduce in a few days at most the duration of lesions. Additionally, HSV variants that are resistant to these antivirals may arise, especially in immunosuppressed individuals. Thus, new antivirals that can reduce the severity and duration of these cutaneous manifestations would certainly be welcome. Here, we review currently available anti-herpetic therapies, novel molecules being assessed in clinical trials and new botanical compounds reported in the last 20 years with antiviral activities against HSVs that might represent future treatments against these viruses.">

        <span class="abst" title="Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), which is a novel bunyavirus. SFTSV was first isolated from patients who presented with fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and multiorgan dysfunction in China. Subsequently, it was found to be widely distributed in Southeast Asia (Korea, Japan, and Vietnam). SFTSV can be transmitted not only from ticks but also from domestic animals, companion animals, and humans. Because the case fatality rate of SFTS is high (6-30%), development of specific and effective treatment for SFTS is required. Studies of potential antiviral drugs for SFTS-specific therapy have been conducted on existing or newly discovered agents in vitro and in vivo, with ribavirin and favipiravir being the most promising candidates. While animal experiments and retrospective studies have demonstrated the limited efficacy of ribavirin, it was also speculated that ribavirin would be effective in patients with a viral load &lt;1 × 106 copies/mL. Favipiravir showed higher efficacy than ribavirin against SFTSV in in vitro assays and greater efficacy in animal models, even administrated 3 days after the virus inoculation. Although clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of favipiravir in SFTS patients in Japan are underway, this has yet to be confirmed. Other drugs, including hexachlorophene, calcium channel blockers, 2'-fluoro-2'-deoxycytidine, caffeic acid, amodiaquine, and interferons, have also been evaluated for their inhibitory efficacy against SFTSV. Among them, calcium channel blockers are promising because in addition to their efficacy in vitro and in vivo, retrospective clinical data have indicated that nifedipine, one of the calcium channel blockers, reduced the case fatality rate by &gt;5-fold. Although further research is necessary to develop SFTS-specific therapy, considerable progress has been achieved in this area. Here we summarize and discuss recent advances in antiviral drugs against SFTSV.">

Moreover, patients with chronic hepatitis C have a higher risk of haematological malignancies than general population. An electronic alert system was developed to promote screening of hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) in patients starting haematological therapies. The system included screening and linkage to care and a request for testing in those without data. From March, 2017 to March, 2018 data from 420 consecutive patients with haematological diseases were included. At first prescription before the alerts, the HCV and HBV screening rate was 60.5%. Following the alerts, an additional 115 were screened, increasing the overall screening rate to 87.9%. Anti-HBc alone was detected in 57, anti-HCV in 13, and HBsAg in 2 patients. Overall, 68% of patients with any viral hepatitis markers were previously not know, and the impact was particularly important for anti-HBc detection (47/57 unknown). Nucleoside analogues were prescribed in 28 (49.1%) anti-HBc-positive and the 2 HBsAg-positive patients. Prospective follow-up with HBV DNA and HBsAg testing showed no cases of HBV reactivation. An estimated 1.2 HBV reactivations were avoided as consequence of the alert system. In summary, an electronic alert system increased viral hepatitis screening in patients receiving haematological treatment and led to improvements in the management of these patients, including avoided HBV reactivation.">

        <span class="abst" title="Background:With the introduction of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, drug-drug interactions (DDIs) emerged as significant challenge. Since then, HCV therapy and the infected population have rapidly changed. So far, very limited data are available regarding the clinical relevance of DDIs when using most modern DAA regimens. We aimed to assess how the importance of DDIs has evolved over time. Methods:From January 2014 to July 2018, 668 consecutive HCV patients were evaluated for their outpatient medication and assessed for DDIs with DAAs. Different time periods were defined based on market approval of key DAAs: A (01/2014-11/2014), B (11/2014-08/2016), and C (08/2016-07/2018). Results:The frequency of patients with real-world DDIs was highest in period B (A: 37.1%, B: 49.6%, C: 38.8%). The recently approved DAAs (period C) theoretically showed a lower DDI risk profile. However, real-world DDIs were still comparable to period A, as HCV patients' characteristics changed (eg, age ≥75 years: A: 3.1%, B: 9.8%, C: 5.6%; polypharmacy/patients with ≥8 drugs: A: 11.1%, B: 15.2%, C: 17.2%). Furthermore, although DDIs via CYP 3A4 became less important for some modern regimens, other mechanisms like an altered pH value in the stomach, causing reduced bioavailability, evolved. Relevant DDIs most frequently occurred with proton pump inhibitors, metamizole, statins, and carvedilol. Conclusions:DDIs during antiviral treatment still affect about 40% of HCV patients. The lower DDI potential of modern DAA regimens is partly counteracted by changing patient characteristics. Therefore, DDIs should not be underestimated.">

We recently treated a patient who developed parapsoriasis en plaque-like lesions after ingestion of various drugs. She showed hypersensitivity to multiple drugs after interferon therapy. Her clinical course was complicated by flares of parapsoriasis-like lesions which returned at precisely the same sites. The flares had begun within hours of ingesting nicardipine hydrochloride, amlodipine besilate, candesartan cilexetil and atenolol for the first time despite showing a low level of HCV RNA. Interestingly, the flares gradually subsided during continued treatment with these drugs while her HCV RNA level paradoxically increased: thus, there was an inverse correlation between flares and HCV RNA level. The eruptions were eventually diagnosed as fixed drug eruption, although the clinical manifestations mimicked parapsoriasis en plaque. Our results suggest that multiple drug hypersensitivity could be induced by antiviral immune responses that are cross-reactive to multiple drugs, but not by HCV per se.">

The results indicated that ouabain and digoxin blocked the JEV infection at the replication stage by targeting the Na+/K+-ATPase. Furthermore, it was proven that ouabain significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality caused by JEV in a BALB/c mouse model.

        <span class="abst" title="Influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (vRdRp) does not have capping activity and relies on the capped RNAs produced by the host RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). The viral polymerases process the capped RNAs to produce short capped RNA fragments that are used as primers to initiate the transcription of viral mRNAs. This process, known as cap-snatching, can be targeted by antiviral therapeutics. Here, anthralin was identified as an inhibitor against influenza a virus (IAV) infection by targeting the cap-snatching activity of the viral polymerase. Anthralin, an FDA-approved drug used in the treatment of psoriasis, shows antiviral activity against IAV infection in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, anthralin significantly reduces weight loss, lung injury, and mortality caused by IAV infection in mice. The mechanism of action study revealed that anthralin inhibits the cap-binding function of PB2 subunit and endonuclease activity of PA. As a result, viral mRNA transcription is blocked, leading to the decreases in viral RNA replication and viral protein expression. In conclusion, anthralin has been demonstrated to have the potential of an alternative antiviral against influenza virus infection. Also, targeting the captive pocket structure that includes the N-terminus of PA endonuclease domain and the C-terminal of PB2 cap-binding domain of IAV RdRp may be an excellent strategy for developing anti-influenza drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="INTRODUCTION:After infection, herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV1) becomes latent in the trigeminal ganglion and can enter the brain via retrograde axonal transport. Recurrent reactivation of HSV1 may lead to neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. HSV1 (oral herpes) and HSV2 (genital herpes) can trigger amyloid beta-protein (Aβ) aggregation and HSV1 DNA is common in amyloid plaques. Anti-HSV drugs reduce Aβ and phosphorylated tau accumulation in cell-culture models. Cognitive impairment is greater in patients with HSV seropositive, and antiviral drugs show robust efficacy against peripheral HSV infection. Recent studies of electronic health records databases demonstrate that HSV infections increase dementia risk, and that antiviral medication treatment reduces this risk. The generic antiviral drug valacyclovir was superior to placebo in improving memory in a schizophrenia pilot trial but has not been tested in AD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS:In patients with mild AD who test positive for HSV1 or HSV2 serum antibodies, valacyclovir, repurposed as an anti-AD drug, will be compared with placebo (lactose pills) in 130 patients (65 valacyclovir and 65 placebo) in a randomised, double-blind, 78-week phase II proof-of-concept trial. Patients on valacyclovir, dose-titrated from 2 g to a targeted oral dose of 4 g daily, compared with placebo, are hypothesised to show smaller cognitive and functional decline, and, using 18F-Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and 18F-MK-6240 PET imaging, to show less amyloid and tau accumulation, respectively. In the lumbar puncture subsample, cerebrospinal fluid acyclovir will be assayed to assess central nervous system valacyclovir penetration. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION:The trial is being overseen by the New York State Psychiatric Institute Institutional Review Board (protocol 7537), the National Institute on Ageing, and the Data Safety Monitoring Board. Written informed consent is obtained for all subjects. Results will be disseminated via publication, clinicaltrials.gov, media and conferences.

Our goal was to evaluate antagonism of the HCV NS3-4A protease by a variety of common porphyrins and characterize structure-activity relationships that may be useful for future drug design of HCV and related Flaviviruses. Methods:Using fluorometric assays, common metalloprotoporphyrins (MPP) all inhibited NS3-4A protease with IC50 values in low micromolar ranges [CoPP (1.4 µM) &lt; ZnPP = MnPP = SnPP &lt; CuPP &lt; FePP (6.5 µM) = protoporphyrin]. Results:Lineweaver-Burk plots confirmed that MPP: NS3 inhibition was basically competitive. All tested MPPs inhibited HCV genotype 1A, 1B, 2A and 3A recombinant proteases with the same fidelity suggesting wide antagonistic capabilities. However, when the MPPs were tested in cellular incubations with HCV replicons only Zn, Fe and free-base protoporphyrin showed comparable EC50 and IC50 values suggesting that there may be critical differences in MPP uptake and intracellular availability. Meso, deutero, and isohematoporphyrin derivatives, with or without metal substitution, all showed less anti-protease and antiviral activities as compared to protoporphyrins, suggesting that the planar, vinyl side chains are important for protease active site binding. MPPs were also active against three common protease mutants (T54A, A156T, and V36M) with equivalent or better IC50 values as compared to wild type enzyme. Conclusion:These findings document the versatility of MPPs as antiviral agents with an expanded sensitivity for HCV genotypes and resistance to some common viral mutations. The results also suggest that further study of MPP structure and function will be useful for the development of new antiviral agents.">

There are concerns regarding lower response rates among PWID in real life. We evaluated the outcome of DAA therapy in PWID in a real-world setting and the factors that affect it. Methods:We performed a retrospective analysis of 174 PWID with chronic hepatitis C who started DAAs in a Greek liver clinic in collaboration with an addiction program. Patients who did not return for reassessment were considered as lost to follow up (LTFU). A logistic regression model was used to assess factors associated with a sustained virological response 12 weeks after treatment completion (SVR12) and LTFU. Results:Patients' mean age was 48±9.2 years and 91/174 (52.3%) were attending opioid substitution treatment programs. Overall, 144/174 (82.8%) patients completed therapy and presented for SVR12 testing, 8/174 (4.6%) did not complete treatment and 22/174 (12.6%) were LTFU. Overall SVR12 was 79.9% (139/174). For those with an available SVR12 test the response rate reached 96.5% (139/144). Regression analysis did not indicate any significant association between patient characteristics and SVR12. Age &lt;45 years and genotype 3 were independent predictors of LTFU. Parallel use was found to have a trend towards LTFU. Conclusions:HCV treatment by hepatologists and addiction specialists is feasible, effective and safe in a real-world setting. However, as 12% of patients appear to be LTFU, more emphasis should be placed on interventions guaranteeing follow up for SVR testing and general care.">

Many viruses have evolved to inhibit pathogen sensors to suppress host innate immune responses. In the case of influenza, nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) suppresses RIG-I function, leading to viral replication, morbidity, and mortality. We show that silencing NS1 with in-vitro-transcribed 5'-triphosphate containing NS1 short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (5'-PPP-NS1shRNA), designed using the conserved region of a number of influenza viruses, not only prevented NS1 expression but also induced RIG-I activation and type I interferon (IFN) expression, resulting in an antiviral state leading to inhibition of influenza virus replication in vitro. In addition, administration of 5'-PPP-NS1shRNA in prophylactic and therapeutic settings resulted in significant inhibition of viral replication following viral challenge in vivo in mice with corresponding increases of RIG-I, IFN-β, and IFN-λ, as well as a decrease in NS1 expression.">

        <span class="abst" title="The past decade has seen transformation in the strategies for identifying and managing viral hepatitis, most dramatically the transformation of hepatitis C virus from a mostly chronic affliction to a curable disease that is accessible to wide populations through direct-acting antiviral therapies. More recently, shifting of hepatitis C virus burden to younger patients driven by intravenous drug use has shaped screening recommendations. Future work focusing on effective screening, linkage to care, treatment initiation, and post-cure management will allow countries to work toward meeting goals of eliminating viral hepatitis as a major public health threat. Concurrently, hepatitis B virus has also seen advances in management using oral nucleos(t)ide therapies with high-resistance barriers. However, virologic cure remains elusive in the setting of viral genetic persistence within the hepatocyte nucleus, even with suppressive antiviral therapy. Future directions include a refined definition of &quot;cure,&quot; new biomarkers, and development of therapies targeting multiple pathways in the viral pathogenic and replication pathway. Progress is additionally being made on the management of hepatitis D infection. This review summarizes the recent evolution in disease characteristics, associated affected population, and changes in our understanding of management for these infections. We also discuss future directions in the management of viral hepatitis, including discussion on issues related to management before and after antiviral therapy. Conclusion: We summarize recent advances in the identification and management of viral hepatitis, which hold the potential to markedly reduce disease burden and therefore associated liver-related complications. However further work is needed to adequately identify and manage these diseases.">

        <span class="abst" title="Coronaviruses are the well-known cause of severe respiratory, enteric and systemic infections in a wide range of hosts including man, mammals, fish, and avian. The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) outbreaks in 2002-2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). This decade's first CoV, named 2019-nCoV, emerged from Wuhan, China, and declared as 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern' on January 30th, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO). As on February 4, 2020, 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China (Philippines). In a short span of time, the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries. The zoonotic transmission (animal-to-human) is suspected as the route of disease origin. The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019-nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus. The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well. The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas.">

        <span class="abst" title="Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a major global health concern, affecting more than 350 million people worldwide. Its management in the setting of cancer treatment can be problematic, particularly with the use of immunological treatment modalities, but also with chemotherapy. Immunological perturbations by chemo or immunotherapy have the potential to permit viral hepatitis reactivation and acute hepatic failure. HBV management algorithms have evolved, based on host tumor factors, viral serological factors, and the specific antitumor agents planned. As new agents enter the antitumor armamentarium, their impact on HBV infection needs to be defined. Zhang et al provide data on the utility of antiviral therapy in the management of HBV antigen positive patients receiving checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) in preventing hepatitis reactivation, and offers guidance for such management in endemic areas, suggesting that prophylaxis is highly effective in preventing reactivation. This is pertinent to Western cancer therapy also, as a recent study has documented the silent existence of positive hepatitis antigenemia among newly diagnosed cancer patients. Whereas antigen and viral DNA screening is standard of care in Asia and Western Pacific oncology practice, evaluation for latent hepatitis may become a necessary part of management worldwide as CPIs continue to expand their role.">

The aim of the study is to assess safety and outcome of DAAs in patients with psychiatric comorbidities. METHODS:This retrospective, observational, single-centre study enrolled patients treated with psychiatric drugs who initiated DAAs between 2015 and 2018. Patients were classified into two groups: A (on anxiolitycs/antidepressant) and B (on antipsychotics). Week-12 sustained virological response (SVR-12) and adverse events (AEs) were evaluated. RESULTS:One hundred forty-four patients were included (A:101; B:43). Patients were 49.3% males, mean age 60 years (SD ± 13.5); 31.9% cirrhotic; 125 (86.8%) HCV-monoinfected and 19 (13.2%) HCV /HIV-coinfected. Twenty patients (13.8%) required a change of psychiatric therapy before initiation of DAA. Overall, SVR-12 was achieved in 88.2% of subjects in intention-to-treat(ITT)-analysis. Lower SVR rates were observed in group B vs A (79% vs 92%, p = 0.045) and in those changing psychiatric drugs vs others (8% vs 30%, p = 0.015). According to per-protocol (PP)-analysis, SVR-12 was achieved in 93/95 (97.9%) in group A versus 34/36 (94.4%) in group B (p = 0.30). At least one AE occurred in 60 patients (41.6%), including 10 severe AEs, leading to 3 discontinuations. AEs were more frequently reported in group A (p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS:The study confirms effectiveness and safety of DAA-based treatment also in this special population, even if a careful evaluation of history and drug-drug interactions is warranted.">

Yet, real life data regarding DAA treatment in people who inject drugs (PWIDs) are scarce. We evaluated the effectiveness of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) in difficult-to-treat PWIDs with presumed high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy using the concept of directly observed therapy involving their opioid substitution therapy (OST) facility. METHODS:N = 145 patients (m/f: 91/54; median age: 41.1 (IQR 19.5) years; HCV-genotype (GT) 1/2/3/4: 82/1/56/5, GT3: 38.6%; cirrhosis: n = 6; 4.1%) treated with G/P were included. PWIDs at high risk for non-adherence to DAA therapy received HCV treatment together with their OST under the supervision of medical staff (&quot;directly observed therapy&quot;, DOT). The effectiveness of G/P given as DOT in PWIDs with presumed high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy was compared to patients with suspected &quot;excellent compliance&quot; in the &quot;standard setting&quot; (SS) of G/P prescription at a tertiary care center and self-managed G/P intake at home. Treatment duration was 8-16 weeks according to the G/P drug label. RESULTS:DOT-patients (n = 74/145; 51.0%) were younger than SS-patients (median 38.7, IQR 12.5 vs. median 50.6, IQR 20.3 years), all had psychiatric co-morbidities and most had a poor socioeconomic status. 50/74 (67.6%) reported ongoing intravenous drug use (IDU). SVR was achieved in n = 70/74 (94.6%) patients with n = 3 being lost to follow-up (FU) and n = 1 showing nonresponse to therapy. SS-patients achieved SVR in 97.2% (69/71) with n = 1 patient being lost to FU and n = 1 patient with GT3 showing HCV relapse. CONCLUSION:G/P given as DOT along with OST in PWIDs with high risk of non-adherence to DAA therapy resulted in similarly high SVR rates (94.6%) as in patients with presumed &quot;excellent compliance&quot; under standard drug intake.">

Very early administration of ibuprofen and GS-561937, a fusion protein inhibitor (FPI), have separately been shown to decrease the severity of bovine RSV. Our aims were to determine how long after RSV inoculation ibuprofen and GS-561937 can be administered with clinical benefit and whether using both was better than monotherapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS:We conducted a blinded randomized placebo controlled trial of ibuprofen, GS-561937 (FPI), or combinations of the two initiated at 3 or 5 days after artificial infection with bovine RSV in 36 five to six-week-old Holstein calves (Bos taurus). We measured clinical scores, respiratory rate, and viral shedding daily for 10 days following inoculation. We estimated the average effect for each drug and compared treatment arms using mixed effects models. RESULTS:We found a significant decrease in clinical scores only in the combined treatment arms. This benefit was greater when treatment was initiated at 3 days rather than 5 days post infection with decreased clinical scores and lower respiratory rates at both time points. Ibuprofen alone started on day 3 increased, and FPI with ibuprofen started on day 3 decreased, viral shedding. CONCLUSION:Dual therapy with Ibuprofen and FPI, on average, decrease clinical severity of illness in a bovine model of RSV when started at 3 and 5 days after infection.">

DDX3 belongs to the DEAD-box proteins, a large family of RNA helicases that participate in all aspects of cellular processes, such as cell cycle progression, apoptosis, innate immune response, viral replication, and tumorigenesis. DDX3 has a variety of functions in the life cycle of different viruses. DDX3 helicase is required to facilitate both the Rev-mediated export of unspliced/partially spliced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) RNA from nucleus and Tat-dependent translation of viral genes. DDX3 silencing blocks the replication of HIV, HCV, and some other viruses. On the other hand, DDX displays antiviral effect against Dengue virus and hepatitis B virus through the stimulation of interferon beta production. The role of DDX3 in different types of cancer is rather controversial. DDX3 acts as an oncogene in one type of cancer, but demonstrates tumor suppressor properties in other types. The human DDX3 helicase is now considered as a new attractive target for the development of novel pharmaceutical drugs. The most interesting inhibitors of DDX3 helicase and the mechanisms of their actions as antiviral or anticancer drugs are discussed in this short review.">

CMV may cause opportunistic infections, congenital infections, and brain diseases (e.g., mental retardation and glioblastoma). The etiology of brain diseases associated with human CMV (HCMV) infections is usually complex and it is particularly difficult to treat because HCMV has a life-long infection in its hosts, high mutation rate, and latent infections. Moreover, it is almost impossible to eradicate latent viruses in humans. Although there has been progress in drug discovery recently, current drugs used for treating active CMV infections are still limited in efficacy due to side effects, toxicity, and viral resistance. Fortunately, letermovir which targets the HCMV terminase complex rather than DNA polymerase with fewer adverse reactions has been approved to treat CMV infections in humans. The researchers are focusing on developing approaches against both productive and latent infections of CMV. The gene or RNA targeting approaches including the external guide sequences (EGSs)-RNase, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) system and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are being investigated to remove acute and/or latent CMV infections. For the treatment of glioblastoma, vaccine therapy through targeting specific CMV antigens has improved patients' survival outcomes significantly and immunotherapy has also emerged as an alternative modality. The advanced research for developing anti-CMV agents and approaches is promising to obtain significant outcomes and expecting to have a great impact on the therapy of brain diseases associated with CMV infections.">

However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2. Drug repurposing, representing as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 shares the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%). Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV. Using network proximity analyses of drug targets and HCoV-host interactions in the human interactome, we prioritize 16 potential anti-HCoV repurposable drugs (e.g., melatonin, mercaptopurine, and sirolimus) that are further validated by enrichment analyses of drug-gene signatures and HCoV-induced transcriptomics data in human cell lines. We further identify three potential drug combinations (e.g., sirolimus plus dactinomycin, mercaptopurine plus melatonin, and toremifene plus emodin) captured by the &quot;Complementary Exposure&quot; pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. In summary, this study offers powerful network-based methodologies for rapid identification of candidate repurposable drugs and potential drug combinations targeting 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2.">

The increased drug resistance and constant viral replication have been the trigger for important studies regarding the use of nanotechnology in antiviral therapies. Nanomaterials offer unique physico-chemical properties that have linked benefits for drug delivery as ideal tools for viral treatment. Currently, different types of nanomaterials namely nanoparticles, liposomes, nanospheres, nanogels, nanosuspensions and nanoemulsions were studied either in vitro or in vivo for drug delivery of antiviral agents with prospects to be translated in clinical practice. This review highlights the drug delivery nanosystems incorporating the major antiviral classes and their transport across specific barriers at cellular and intracellular level. Important reflections on nanomedicines currently approved or undergoing investigations for the treatment of viral infections are also discussed. Finally, the authors present an overview on the requirements for the design of antiviral nanotherapeutics.">

Therefore, the aim of our research was to investigate the activity of polyphenol-rich extracts of natural shelled (NPRE) pistachios kernels (Pistacia vera L.) on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication. The Vero cell line was used to assess the cytotoxicity and antiviral activity. The cell viability was calculated by detection of cellular ATP after treatment with various concentrations of NPRE. For antiviral studies, five nontoxic-concentrations (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL) were tested. Our study demonstrated that treatment with NPRE (0.4, 0.6, 0.8 mg/mL) reduced the expression of the viral proteins ICP8 (infected cell polypeptide 8), UL42 (unique long UL42 DNA polymerase processivity factor) , and US11 (unique short US11 protein), and resulted in a decrease of viral DNA synthesis. The 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC50), 50% inhibitory concentration (EC50), and the selectivity index (SI) values for NPRE were 1.2 mg/mL, 0.4mg/mL, and 3, respectively. Furthermore, we assessed the anti-herpetic effect of a mix of pure polyphenol compounds (NS MIX) present in NPRE. In conclusion, our findings indicate that natural shelled pistachio kernels have remarkable inhibitory activity against HSV-1.">

Because HBVr is easily preventable with appropriate screening and monitoring strategies, and, when indicated, prophylactic antiviral treatment, awareness of this complication is of the utmost importance, especially in the era of biologic treatments. As a condition, it continues to be topical, in view of the emergence of novel classes of immunosuppressive drugs (i.e. Janus kinase inhibitors) acquiring licenses for a variety of rheumatic diseases. The class-specific risk of these agents for HBVr has not yet been determined. Moreover, ambiguity still exists for the management of patients planned to be treated with traditional agents, such as cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids, particularly in the setting of resolved HBV infection. Clinicians in the field of rheumatic diseases should be tailoring their practice according to the host's profile and treatment-specific risk for HBVr.

MTT assays were used to determine the preventive effect, inhibitory effect and antiviral effect of Radix isatidis polysaccharide on PRV in vitro. RESULTS:This study found that different concentrations of polysaccharides from this plant can inhibit PRV replication by 14.674-30.840%, prevent infection at rates of 6.668-14.923%, and kill this virus at rates of 32.214-67.422%. CONCLUSION:These results broaden the understanding of this traditional Chinese herb and provide a theoretical basis for further research.

When TMR-001 was added to cell monolayers 24 h preinfection, rabies virus release was inhibited for all cell types at three time points postinfection. TMR-001 treatment simultaneous with infection and 24 h postinfection effectively inhibited rabies virus release in the supernatant and cell-to-cell spread with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.2-2 nM and 20-600 nM, respectively. TMR-001 was administered at 0.1 mg/kg via intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or intravenous routes to Syrian hamsters beginning 24 h before a lethal rabies virus challenge and continuing once per day for up to 10 days. TMR-001 at this dose, formulation, and route of delivery did not prevent rabies virus transit from the periphery to the central nervous system in this model (n = 32).

        <span class="abst" title="Influenza A viruses (IAV) have been a major public health threat worldwide, and options for antiviral therapy become increasingly limited with the emergence of drug-resisting virus strains. New and effective anti-IAV drugs, especially for highly pathogenic influenza, with different modes of action, are urgently needed. The influenza virus glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) plays critical roles in the early stage of virus infection, including receptor binding and membrane fusion, making it a potential target for the development of anti-influenza drugs. In this study, we show that OA-10, a newly synthesized triterpene out of 11 oleanane-type derivatives, exhibited significant antiviral activity against four different subtypes of IAV (H1N1, H5N1, H9N2 and H3N2) replications in A549 cell cultures with EC50 ranging from 6.7 to 19.6 μM and a negligible cytotoxicity (CC50 &gt; 640 μM). It inhibited acid-induced hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner, with an IC50 of 26 µM, and had a weak inhibition on the adsorption of H5 HA to chicken erythrocytes at higher concentrations (≥40 µM). Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis showed that OA-10 interacted with HA in a dose-dependent manner with the equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) of the interaction of 2.98 × 10-12 M. Computer-aided molecular docking analysis suggested that OA-10 might bind to the cavity in HA stem region which is known to undergo significant rearrangement during membrane fusion. Our results demonstrate that OA-10 inhibits H5N1 IAV replication mainly by blocking the conformational changes of HA2 subunit required for virus fusion with endosomal membrane. These findings suggest that OA-10 could serve as a lead for further development of novel virus entry inhibitors to prevent and treat IAV infections.">

Whether EGCG also inhibits the infectivity of circovirus remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrated the antiviral effect of EGCG on porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). EGCG targets PCV2 virions directly and blocks the attachment of virions to host cells. The microscale thermophoresis assay showed EGCG could interact with PCV2 capsid protein in vitro with considerable affinity (Kd = 98.03 ± 4.76 μM), thereby interfering with the binding of the capsid to the cell surface receptor heparan sulfate. The molecular docking analysis of capsid-EGCG interaction identified the key amino acids which formed the binding pocket accommodating EGCG. Amino acids ARG51, ASP70, ARG73 and ASP78 of capsid were found to be critical for maintaining the binding, and the arginine residues were also essential for the electrostatic interaction with heparan sulfate. The rescued mutant viruses also confirm the importance of the key amino acids of the capsid to the antiviral effect of EGCG. Our findings suggest that catechins could act as anti-infective agents against circovirus invasion, as well as provide the basic information for the development and synthesis of structure-based anti-circovirus drugs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), being highly virulent and contagious in piglets, has caused significant damage to the pork industries of many countries worldwide. There are no commercial drugs targeting coronaviruses (CoVs), and few studies on anti-PEDV inhibitors. The coronavirus 3C-like protease (3CLpro) has a conserved structure and catalytic mechanism and plays a key role during viral polyprotein processing, thus serving as an appealing antiviral drug target. Here, we report the anti-PEDV effect of the broad-spectrum inhibitor GC376 (targeting 3Cpro or 3CLpro of viruses in the picornavirus-like supercluster). GC376 was highly effective against the PEDV 3CLpro and exerted similar inhibitory effects on two PEDV strains. Furthermore, the structure of the PEDV 3CLpro in complex with GC376 was determined at 1.65 Å. We elucidated structural details and analyzed the differences between GC376 binding with the PEDV 3CLpro and GC376 binding with the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) 3CLpro. Finally, we explored the substrate specificity of PEDV 3CLpro at the P2 site and analyzed the effects of Leu group modification in GC376 on inhibiting PEDV infection. This study helps us to understand better the PEDV 3CLpro substrate specificity, providing information on the optimization of GC376 for development as an antiviral therapeutic against coronaviruses.">

Previous reports showed that HIV-1 protease inhibitors could block SARS-CoV main protease. Based on that and using an in silico approach, we evaluated SARS-CoV-2 main protease as a target for HIV-1 protease inhibitors to reveal the structural features related to their antiviral effect. Our results showed that several HIV inhibitors such as lopinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir produce strong interaction with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, broad library protease inhibitors obtained from PubChem and ZINC (www.zinc.docking.org) were evaluated. Our analysis revealed 20 compounds that could be clustered into three groups based on their chemical features. Then, these structures could serve as leading compounds to develop a series of derivatives optimizing their activity against SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. Altogether, the results presented in this work contribute to gain a deep understanding of the molecular pharmacology of SARS-CoV-2 treatment and validate the use of protease inhibitors against SARS-CoV-2.">

These viruses are causative agents of the widest spectrum of severe and deadly epidemic diseases of higher vertebrates, including humans. Their ubiquitous distribution and high pathogenicity motivate active search to counteract enterovirus infections. There are no sufficiently effective drugs targeted against enteroviral diseases, thus treatment is reduced to supportive and symptomatic measures. This makes it extremely urgent to develop drugs that directly affect enteroviruses and hinder their development and spread in infected organisms. In this review, we cover the classification of enteroviruses, mention the most common enterovirus infections and their clinical manifestations, and consider the current state of development of anti-enteroviral drugs. One of the most promising targets for such antiviral drugs is the viral Internal Ribosome Entry Site (IRES). The classification of these elements of the viral mRNA translation system is also examined.">

All these viruses are of concern for public health services when they occur in natural outbreaks or emerge in unvaccinated populations. Recent events and intelligence reports point to a growing risk of dangerous biological agents being used for nefarious purposes. Public health responses effective in natural outbreaks of infectious disease may not be sufficient to deal with the severe consequences of a deliberate release of such agents. One important aspect of countermeasures against viral biothreat agents are the antiviral treatment options available for use in post-exposure prophylaxis. These issues were adressed by the organizers of the 16th Medical Biodefense Conference, held in Munich in 2018, in a special session on the development of drugs to treat infections with viruses currently perceived as a threat to societies or associated with a potential for misuse as biothreat agents. This review will outline the state-of-the-art methods in antivirals research discussed and provide an overview of antiviral compounds in the pipeline that are already approved for use or still under development.">

Until today &gt;2700 deaths from the 80,000 confirmed cases reported mainly in China and 40 other countries. Human to human transmission is confirmed for COVID-19 by China a month ago. Based on the World Health Organization (WHO) reports, SARS HCoV is responsible for &gt;8000 cases with confirmed 774 deaths. Additionally, MERS HCoV is responsible for 858 deaths out of about 2500 reported cases. The current study aims to test anti-HCV drugs against COVID-19 RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). MATERIALS AND METHODS:In this study, sequence analysis, modeling, and docking are used to build a model for Wuhan COVID-19 RdRp. Additionally, the newly emerged Wuhan HCoV RdRp model is targeted by anti-polymerase drugs, including the approved drugs Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin. KEY FINDINGS:The results suggest the effectiveness of Sofosbuvir, IDX-184, Ribavirin, and Remidisvir as potent drugs against the newly emerged HCoV disease. SIGNIFICANCE:The present study presents a perfect model for COVID-19 RdRp enabling its testing in silico against anti-polymerase drugs. Besides, the study presents some drugs that previously proved its efficiency against the newly emerged viral infection.">

In the absence of a proven clinical FcR blocker, the use of intravenous immunoglobulin to block FcR activation may be a viable option for the urgent treatment of pulmonary inflammation to prevent severe lung injury. Such treatment may also be combined with systemic anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. However, these strategies, as proposed here, remain to be clinically tested for effectiveness.">

        <span class="abst" title="Influenza and pneumonia independently lead to high morbidity and mortality annually among the human population globally; however, a glaring fact is that influenza pneumonia coinfection is more vicious and it is a threat to public health. Emergence of antiviral resistance is a major impediment in the control of the coinfection. In this paper, a deterministic mathematical model illustrating the transmission dynamics of influenza pneumonia coinfection is formulated having incorporated antiviral resistance. Optimal control theory is then applied to investigate optimal strategies for controlling the coinfection using prevalence reduction and treatment as the system control variables. Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal control. The derived optimality system is solved numerically using the Runge-Kutta-based forward-backward sweep method. Simulation results reveal that implementation of prevention measures is sufficient to eradicate influenza pneumonia coinfection from a given population. The prevention measures could be social distancing, vaccination, curbing mutation and reassortment, and curbing interspecies movement of the influenza virus.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Influenza viruses (IVs) have become increasingly resistant to antiviral drugs that target neuraminidase and matrix protein 2 due to gene mutations that alter their drug-binding target protein regions. Consequently, almost all recent IV pandemics have exhibited resistance to commercial antiviral vaccines. To overcome this challenge, an antiviral target is needed that is effective regardless of genetic mutations. MAIN BODY:In particular, hemagglutinin (HA), a highly conserved surface protein across many IV strains, could be an effective antiviral target as it mediates binding of IVs with host cell receptors, which is crucial for membrane fusion. HA has 6 disulfide bonds that can easily bind with the surfaces of gold nanoparticles. Herein, we fabricated porous gold nanoparticles (PoGNPs) via a surfactant-free emulsion method that exhibited strong affinity for disulfide bonds due to gold-thiol interactions, and provided extensive surface area for these interactions. A remarkable decrease in viral infectivity was demonstrated by increased cell viability results after exposing MDCK cells to various IV strains (H1N1, H3N2, and H9N2) treated with PoGNP. Most of all, the viability of MDCK cells infected with all IV strains increased to 96.8% after PoGNP treatment of the viruses compared to 33.9% cell viability with non-treated viruses. Intracellular viral RNA quantification by real-time RT-PCR also confirmed that PoGNP successfully inhibited viral membrane fusion by blocking the viral entry process through conformational deformation of HA. CONCLUSION:We believe that the technique described herein can be further developed for PoGNP-utilized antiviral protection as well as metal nanoparticle-based therapy to treat viral infection. Additionally, facile detection of IAV can be achieved by developing PoGNP as a multiplatform for detection of the virus.">

Syndromes of infected people range from asymptomatic infections to severe neurological disorders, such as Guillain-Barré syndrome and microcephaly. Screening anti-ZIKV drugs derived from Chinese medicinal herbs is one method of identifying antiviral agents. In this paper, we report that (1) Cephalotaxine (CET), an alkaloid isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea, was effective in inhibiting ZIKV activity in vitro (i.e., in Vero and A549 cell lines) and (2) the mechanisms which underlie these effects involve virucidal activity and a decrease in viral replication. Specifically, CET was found to decrease ZIKV RNA and viral protein expression, inhibit ZIKV replication, and inhibit ZIKV mRNA/protein production. We also determined that CET is effective in inhibiting dengue virus 1-4 (DENV1-4). Taken together, our findings indicate that CET could be an effective lead compound in the treatment of ZIKV and also suggest that further investigation and development of CET-derived drugs may lead to a new class of anti-Flavivirus medications.">

Although several antiviral drugs are currently available, there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral therapies with different mechanisms of action due to emergence of drug resistance. In this study, two related compounds, chebulagic acid (CHLA) and chebulinic acid (CHLI), were identified as novel inhibitors against IAV replication. A reporter virus-based infection assay demonstrated that CHLA and CHLI exhibit no inhibitory effect on IAV entry or RNA replication during the virus replication cycle. Results of viral release inhibition assay and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assay indicated that CHLA and CHLI exert their inhibitory effect on the NA-mediated viral release. Moreover, oseltamivir-resistance mutation NA/H274Y of NA is susceptible to CHLA or CHLI, suggesting a different mechanism of action for CHLA and CHLI. In summary, CHLA and CHLI are promising new NA inhibitors that may be further developed as novel antivirals against IAVs.">

        <span class="abst" title="Human adenovirus (HAdV) is the most common cause of infectious conjunctivitis, accounting for up to 75% of all conjunctivitis cases and affecting people of all ages and demographics. In addition to ocular complications, it can cause systemic infections in the form of gastroenteritis, respiratory disease, and dissemination in immunocompromised individuals. HAdV causes lytic infection of the mucoepithelial cells of the conjunctiva and cornea, as well as latent infection of lymphoid and adenoid cells. Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) is the most severe ocular manifestation of HAdV infection, in which the presence of subepithelial infiltrates (SEIs) in the cornea is a hallmark feature of corneal involvement. SEIs have the tendency to recur and may lead to long-term visual disability. HAdV persistence and dissemination are linked to sporadic outbreaks of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. There is no FDA-approved antiviral for treating adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis, and as such, solutions should be proffered to handle the challenges associated with viral persistence and dissemination. Several treatment modalities have been investigated, both systemically and locally, to not only mitigate symptoms but reduce the course of the infection and prevent the risk of long-term complications. These options include systemic and topical antivirals, in-office povidone-iodine irrigation (PVI), immunoglobulin-based therapy, anti-inflammatory therapy, and immunotherapy. More recently, combination PVI/dexamethasone ophthalmic formulations have shown favorable outcomes and were well tolerated in clinical trials for the treatment of EKC. Possible, future treatment considerations include sialic acid analogs, cold atmospheric plasma, N-chlorotaurine, and benzalkonium chloride. Continued investigation and evaluation of treatment are warranted to reduce the economic burden and potential long-term visual debilitation in affected patients. This review will focus on how persistence and dissemination of HAdV pose a significant challenge to the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis. Furthermore, current and future trends in prophylactic and therapeutic modalities for adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis will be discussed.">

        <span class="abst" title="Cathelicidins (CATHs) are host defense peptides (HDPs) that play an important role in the innate immune response against infections. Although multiple functions of cathelicidins have been described, including direct antimicrobial activity and several immunomodulatory effects on the host, relatively little is known about their antiviral activity. Therefore, in vitro antiviral activity of chicken cathelicidins and the underlying mechanism was investigated in this study against different influenza A virus (IAV) strains. Our results show that chicken CATH-B1 has broad anti-IAV activity compared to other cathelicidins (CATH-1, -2, -3, LL-37, PMAP-23, and K9CATH) with an inhibition of viral infection up to 80% against three tested IAV strains (H1N1, H3N1, and H5N1). In agreement herewith, CATH-B1 affected virus-induced inflammatory cytokines expression (IFN-β, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8). Incubation of cells with CATH-B1 prior to or after their inoculation with virus did not reduce viral infection indicating that direct interaction of virus with the peptide was required for CATH-B1's antiviral activity. Experiments using combined size exclusion and affinity-based separation of virus and peptide also indicated that CATH-B1 bound to viral particles. In addition, using electron microscopy, no morphological change of the virus itself was seen upon incubation with CATH-B1 but large aggregates of CATH-B1 and viral particles were observed, indicating that aggregation might be the mechanism of action reducing IAV infectivity. Neuraminidase (NA) activity assays using monovalent or multivalent substrates, indicated that CATH-B1 did not affect NA activity per se, but negatively affected the ability of virus particles to interact with multivalent receptors, presumably by interfering with hemagglutinin activity. In conclusion, our results show CATH-B1 has good antiviral activity against IAV by binding to the viral particle and thereby blocking viral entry.">

While commonly used antivirals often show limited efficacy and serious adverse effects, herbal extracts have been in use for medicinal purposes since ancient times and are known for their antiviral properties and more tolerable side effects. Thus, naturally based pharmacotherapy may be a proper alternative for treating viral diseases. With that in mind, various pharmaceutical formulations and delivery systems including micelles, nanoparticles, nanosuspensions, solid dispersions, microspheres and crystals, self-nanoemulsifying and self-microemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS and SMEDDS) have been developed and used for antiviral delivery of natural products. These diverse technologies offer effective and reliable delivery of medicinal phytochemicals. Given the challenges and possibilities of antiviral treatment, this review provides the verified data on the medicinal plants and related herbal substances with antiviral activity, as well as applied strategies for the delivery of these plant extracts and biologically active phytochemicals.

More recently we have identified additional promising antiviral activities against Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Chikungunya, Ebola and Marburg which highlights that this old drug may have other uses against new viruses. This may in turn inform the types of drugs that we need for virus outbreaks such as for the new coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).

In addition to further improving vaccine prophylaxis, disease management through antiviral therapeutics constitutes an important component of the current intervention strategy to prevent advance to complicated disease and reduce case-fatality rates. Standard-of-care is treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors that prevent viral dissemination. In 2018, the first mechanistically new influenza drug class for the treatment of uncomplicated seasonal influenza in 2 decades was approved for human use. Targeting the PA endonuclease subunit of the viral polymerase complex, this class suppresses viral replication. However, the genetic barrier against viral resistance to both drug classes is low, pre-existing resistance is observed in circulating strains, and resistant viruses are pathogenic and transmit efficiently. Addressing the resistance problem has emerged as an important objective for the development of next-generation influenza virus therapeutics. This review will discuss the status of influenza therapeutics including the endonuclease inhibitor baloxavir marboxil after its first year of clinical use and evaluate a subset of direct-acting antiviral candidates in different stages of preclinical and clinical development.">

        <span class="abst" title="OBJECTIVE:In this study we execute a rational screen to identify Chinese medical herbs that are commonly used in treating viral respiratory infections and also contain compounds that might directly inhibit 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), an ongoing novel coronavirus that causes pneumonia. METHODS:There were two main steps in the screening process. In the first step we conducted a literature search for natural compounds that had been biologically confirmed as against sever acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Resulting compounds were cross-checked for listing in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database. Compounds meeting both requirements were subjected to absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) evaluation to verify that oral administration would be effective. Next, a docking analysis was used to test whether the compound had the potential for direct 2019-nCoV protein interaction. In the second step we searched Chinese herbal databases to identify plants containing the selected compounds. Plants containing 2 or more of the compounds identified in our screen were then checked against the catalogue for classic herbal usage. Finally, network pharmacology analysis was used to predict the general in vivo effects of each selected herb. RESULTS:Of the natural compounds screened, 13 that exist in traditional Chinese medicines were also found to have potential anti-2019-nCoV activity. Further, 125 Chinese herbs were found to contain 2 or more of these 13 compounds. Of these 125 herbs, 26 are classically catalogued as treating viral respiratory infections. Network pharmacology analysis predicted that the general in vivo roles of these 26 herbal plants were related to regulating viral infection, immune/inflammation reactions and hypoxia response. CONCLUSION:Chinese herbal treatments classically used for treating viral respiratory infection might contain direct anti-2019-nCoV compounds.">

(2017). The goal of this study is to demonstrate the antiviral activity of LH against the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and its potential effect in regulating host immune response. METHODS:The antiviral activity of LH against SARS-CoV-2 was assessed in Vero E6 cells using CPE and plaque reduction assay. The effect of LH on virion morphology was visualized under transmission electron microscope. Pro-inflammatory cytokine expression levels upon SARS-CoV-2 infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. RESULTS:LH significantly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells and markedly reduced pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL-2/MCP-1 and CXCL-10/IP-10) production at the mRNA levels. Furthermore, LH treatment resulted in abnormal particle morphology of virion in cells. CONCLUSIONS:LH significantly inhibits the SARS-COV-2 replication, affects virus morphology and exerts anti-inflammatory activity in vitro. These findings indicate that LH protects against the virus attack, making its use a novel strategy for controlling the COVID-19 disease.">

Additionally, favipiravir is being stockpiled for 2 million people as a countermeasure for novel influenza strains. This drug functions as a chain terminator at the site of incorporation of the viral RNA and reduces the viral load. Favipiravir cures all mice in a lethal influenza infection model, while oseltamivir fails to cure the animals. Thus, favipiravir contributes to curing animals with lethal infection. In addition to influenza, favipiravir has a broad spectrum of anti-RNA virus activities in vitro and efficacies in animal models with lethal RNA viruses and has been used for treatment of human infection with life-threatening Ebola virus, Lassa virus, rabies, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome. The best feature of favipiravir as an antiviral agent is the apparent lack of generation of favipiravir-resistant viruses. Favipiravir alone maintains its therapeutic efficacy from the first to the last patient in an influenza pandemic or an epidemic lethal RNA virus infection. Favipiravir is expected to be an important therapeutic agent for severe influenza, the next pandemic influenza strain, and other severe RNA virus infections for which standard treatments are not available.">

In view of recent studies and discussion on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), we aimed to review existing literature and relevant websites regarding these drugs and COVID-19, adverse effects related to drugs, and related guidelines. AIMS AND METHODS:We systematically searched the PubMed database up till March 21, 2020 and retrieved all the articles published on chloroquine and HCQ and COVID-19. RESULTS:Two small human studies have been conducted with both these drugs in COVID-19, and have shown significant improvement in some parameters in patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION:Considering minimal risk upon use, a long experience of use in other diseases, cost-effectiveness and easy availability across India, we propose that both these drugs are worthy of fast track clinical trial for treatment, and may be carefully considered for clinical use as experimental drugs. Since HCQ has been approved for treatment of diabetes in India, it should be further researched in diabetes and COVID-19, a subgroup where significant mortality has been shown.">

Type B3 coxsackievirus (CVB3), a non-enveloped positive-strand RNA virus of the Enterovirus genus, is one of most common agent of viral myocarditis. Till now, effective treatments for VMC are lacking due to lack of drugs or vaccine. Lithium chloride (LiCl) is applied in the clinical management of manic depressive disorders. Accumulating evidence have demonstrated that LiCl, also as an effective antiviral drug, exhibited antiviral effects for specific viruses. However, there are few reports of evaluating LiCl's antiviral effect in mice model. Here, we investigated the inhibitory influence of LiCl on the CVB3 replication in vitro and in vivo and the development of CVB3-induced VMC. We found that LiCl significantly suppressed CVB3 replication in HeLa via inhibiting virus-induced cell apoptosis. Moreover, LiCl treatment in vivo obviously inhibited virus replication within the myocardium and alleviated CVB3-induced acute myocarditis. Collectively, our data demonstrated that LiCl inhibited CVB3 replication and negatively regulated virus-triggered inflammatory responses. Our finding further expands the antiviral targets of LiCl and provides an alternative agent for viral myocarditis.">

        <span class="abst" title="AIMS:A new human coronavirus (HCoV), which has been designated SARS-CoV-2, began spreading in December 2019 in Wuhan City, China causing pneumonia called COVID-19. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 has been faster than any other coronaviruses that have succeeded in crossing the animal-human barrier. There is concern that this new virus will spread around the world as did the previous two HCoVs-Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)-each of which caused approximately 800 deaths in the years 2002 and 2012, respectively. Thus far, 11,268 deaths have been reported from the 258,842 confirmed infections in 168 countries. MAIN METHODS:In this study, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of the newly emerged coronavirus is modeled, validated, and then targeted using different anti-polymerase drugs currently on the market that have been approved for use against various viruses. KEY FINDINGS:The results suggest the effectiveness of Ribavirin, Remdesivir, Sofosbuvir, Galidesivir, and Tenofovir as potent drugs against SARS-CoV-2 since they tightly bind to its RdRp. In addition, the results suggest guanosine derivative (IDX-184), Setrobuvir, and YAK as top seeds for antiviral treatments with high potential to fight the SARS-CoV-2 strain specifically. SIGNIFICANCE:The availability of FDA-approved anti-RdRp drugs can help treat patients and reduce the danger of the mysterious new viral infection COVID-19. The drugs mentioned above can tightly bind to the RdRp of the SARS-CoV-2 strain and thus may be used to treat the disease. No toxicity measurements are required for these drugs since they were previously tested prior to their approval by the FDA.">

The M2 protein of influenza A virus (IAV) is a proton-gated, proton-selective ion channel that is required for virus replication and is an established antiviral target. While licensed adamantane-based M2 antivirals have been historically used, M2 mutations that confer major adamantane resistance are now so prevalent in circulating virus strains that these drugs are no longer recommended. Here we review the current understanding of IAV M2 structure and function, mechanisms of inhibition, the rise of drug resistance mutations, and ongoing efforts to develop new antivirals that target resistant forms of M2.">

Efforts have been made to develop vaccines against human coronavirus (CoV) infections such as MERS and SARS in the past decades. However, to date, no licensed antiviral treatment or vaccine exists for MERS and SARS. Most of the efforts for developing CoV vaccines and drugs target the spike glycoprotein or S protein, the major inducer of neutralizing antibodies. Although a few candidates have shown efficacy in in vitro studies, not many have progressed to randomized animal or human trials, hence may have limited use to counter COVID-19 infection. This article highlights ongoing advances in designing vaccines and therapeutics to counter COVID-19 while also focusing on such experiences and advances as made with earlier SARS- and MERS-CoVs, which together could enable efforts to halt this emerging virus infection.">

Furthermore, he observes the significant abnormality of coagulation function and proposes that the early intravenous immunoglobulin and low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation therapy are very important. Professor Hongzhou Lu, a leader in China to try various anti-viral drugs, expresses concern on the quality of the ongoing clinical trials as most trials are small in scale and repetitive in nature, and emphasizes the importance of the quick publication of clinical trial results. Regarding the traditional Chinese medicine, Professor Lu suggests to develop a creative evaluation system because of the complicated chemical compositions. Professor Wenhong Zhang is responsible for Shanghai's overall clinical management of the COVID-19 cases. He introduces the team approach to manage COVID-19 patients. For severe or critically ill patients, in addition to the respiratory supportive treatment, timely multiorgan evaluation and treatment is very crucial. The medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each patient.">

This review focuses on the effects of these drugs on host immunity against COVID-19. Using Ovid MEDLINE, we reviewed current evidence for immune-suppressing or -stimulating drugs: cytotoxic chemotherapy, low-dose steroids, tumour necrosis factorα (TNFα) blockers, interlukin-6 (IL-6) blockade, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, IL-1 blockade, mycophenolate, tacrolimus, anti-CD20 and CTLA4-Ig. 89 studies were included. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has been shown to be a specific inhibitor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in in vitro studies, but no specific studies exist as of yet for COVID-19. No conclusive evidence for or against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the treatment of COVID-19 patients is available, nor is there evidence indicating that TNFα blockade is harmful to patients in the context of COVID-19. COVID-19 has been observed to induce a pro-inflammatory cytokine generation and secretion of cytokines, such as IL-6, but there is no evidence of the beneficial impact of IL-6 inhibitors on the modulation of COVID-19. Although there are potential targets in the JAK-STAT pathway that can be manipulated in treatment for coronaviruses and it is evident that IL-1 is elevated in patients with a coronavirus, there is currently no evidence for a role of these drugs in treatment of COVID-19. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to challenging decision-making about treatment of critically unwell patients. Low-dose prednisolone and tacrolimus may have beneficial impacts on COVID-19. The mycophenolate mofetil picture is less clear, with conflicting data from pre-clinical studies. There is no definitive evidence that specific cytotoxic drugs, low-dose methotrexate for auto-immune disease, NSAIDs, JAK kinase inhibitors or anti-TNFα agents are contraindicated. There is clear evidence that IL-6 peak levels are associated with severity of pulmonary complications.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) results in economic losses in the swine industry globally. Several studies have investigated the use of plant extracts in the prevention and control of PRRS outbreaks. Thai medicinal plants may be useful for treating PRRSV infection in pigs. Therefore, we investigated the in vitro anti-PRRSV and antioxidant properties of seven Thai medicinal plants: Caesalpinia sappan Linn., Garcinia mangostana Linn., Houttuynia cordata, Perilla frutescens, Clinacanthus nutans, Phyllanthus emblica, and Tiliacora triandra. RESULTS:Using antiviral screening, we observed that T. triandra extract strongly inhibited PRRSV infectivity in MARC-145 cells [virus titer 3.5 median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml (log10)] at 24 h post-infection, whereas C. sappan extract strongly inhibited PRRSV replication [virus titer 2.5 TCID50/ml (log10)] at 72 h post-infection. C. sappan extract had the highest total phenolic content [220.52 mM gallic acid equivalent/g] and lowest half-maximal inhibitory concentration [1.17 mg/ml in 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 2.58 mg/ml in 2,2-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazo-line-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium salt]. CONCLUSION:T. triandra extract could inhibit PRRSV infectivity, whereas C. sappan extract was the most effective in inhibiting PRRSV replication in MARC-145 cells. This study elucidates the antiviral activities of Thai medicinal plant extracts in vivo. The results promise that Thai medicinal plant extracts, particularly T. triandra and C. sappan extracts, can be developed into pharmaceutical drugs for the prevention of PRRS in pigs.">

        <span class="abst" title="BACKGROUND:The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) first broke out in Wuhan (China) and subsequently spread worldwide. Chloroquine has been sporadically used in treating SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hydroxychloroquine shares the same mechanism of action as chloroquine, but its more tolerable safety profile makes it the preferred drug to treat malaria and autoimmune conditions. We propose that the immunomodulatory effect of hydroxychloroquine also may be useful in controlling the cytokine storm that occurs late-phase in critically ill SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Currently, there is no evidence to support the use of hydroxychloroquine in SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS:The pharmacological activity of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine was tested using SARS-CoV-2 infected Vero cells. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic models (PBPK) were implemented for both drugs separately by integrating their in vitro data. Using the PBPK models, hydroxychloroquine concentrations in lung fluid were simulated under 5 different dosing regimens to explore the most effective regimen whilst considering the drug's safety profile. RESULTS:Hydroxychloroquine (EC50=0.72 μM) was found to be more potent than chloroquine (EC50=5.47 μM) in vitro. Based on PBPK models results, a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily of hydroxychloroquine sulfate given orally, followed by a maintenance dose of 200 mg given twice daily for 4 days is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 infection, as it reached three times the potency of chloroquine phosphate when given 500 mg twice daily 5 days in advance. CONCLUSIONS:Hydroxychloroquine was found to be more potent than chloroquine to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.">

Despite significant efforts to address influenza, it remains a major threat to human public health. This issue is partially due to the lack of antiviral drugs with potent antiviral activity and broad reactivity against all influenza virus strains and the rapid emergence of drug-resistant variants. Moreover, designing a universal influenza vaccine that is sufficiently immunogenic to induce universal antibodies is difficult. Some novel epitopes hidden in the hemagglutinin (HA) trimeric interface have been discovered recently, and a number of antibodies targeting these epitopes have been found to be capable of neutralizing a broad range of influenza isolates. These findings may have important implications for the development of universal influenza vaccines and antiviral drugs. In this review, we focused on the antibodies targeting these newly discovered epitopes in the HA domain of the influenza virus to promote the development of universal anti-influenza antibodies or vaccines and extend the discovery to other viruses with similar conformational changes in envelope proteins.">

We discovered two antiviral drug combinations act on distinct signaling pathways, either STAT1 or S6 phosphorylation, to block HSV-1 infection. We focused on upregulation of S6 phosphorylation by HSV-1 infection, and our subsequent finding that ribavirin antagonizes this upregulation of S6 phosphorylation. We go on to show that the S6 kinase inhibitor SL0101 blocks HSV-1 replication in vitro and in an in vivo animal model of HSV-1 infection. Overall, we have used an unbiased analysis of cellular signaling pathways during treatment by antiviral drug combinations to discover a novel antiviral drug target against HSV-1 infection. The outcomes of the approach we present highlight the importance of analyzing how antiviral drugs modulate cellular and pathogen-induced signaling as a method to discover new drug therapy targets.">

Here, we verified the replication ability and pathogenicity of a reporter HCoV-OC43 strain expressing Renilla luciferase (Rluc; rOC43-ns2DelRluc) in mice with different genetic backgrounds (C57BL/6 and BALB/c). Additionally, we monitored the spatial and temporal progression of HCoV-OC43 through the central nervous system (CNS) of live BALB/c mice after intranasal or intracerebral inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. We found that rOC43-ns2DelRluc was fatal to suckling mice after intranasal inoculation, and that viral titers and Rluc expression were detected in the brains and spinal cords of mice infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. Moreover, viral replication was initially observed in the brain by non-invasive bioluminescence imaging before the infection spread to the spinal cord of BALB/c mice, consistent with its tropism in the CNS. Furthermore, the Rluc readout correlated with the HCoV replication ability and protein expression, which allowed quantification of antiviral activity in live mice. Additionally, we validated that chloroquine strongly inhibited rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in vivo. These results provide new insights into the temporal and spatial dissemination of HCoV-OC43 in the CNS, and our methods provide an extremely sensitive platform for evaluating the efficacy of antiviral therapies to treat neuroinvasive HCoVs in live mice.">

To find small molecules with anti-feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) properties, we utilized a virtual screening technique to identify the active site on the viral protease for the binding of the available natural compounds. The protease 3CL (3CLpro) plays an important role in the replication cycle of FIPV and other viruses within the family Coronaviridae. The 15 best-ranked candidate consensus compounds, based on three docking tools, were evaluated for further assays. The protease inhibitor assay on recombinant FIPV 3CLpro was performed to screen the inhibitory effect of the candidate compounds with IC50 ranging from 6.36 ± 2.15 to 78.40 ± 2.60 μM. As determined by the cell-based assay, the compounds NSC345647, NSC87511, and NSC343256 showed better EC50 values than the broad-spectrum antiviral drug ribavirin and the protease inhibitor lopinavir, under all the test conditions including pre-viral entry, post-viral entry, and prophylactic activity. The NSC87511 particularly yielded the best selective index (&gt;4; range of SI = 13.80-22.90). These results indicated that the natural small-molecular compounds specifically targeted the 3CLpro of FIPV and inhibited its replication. Structural modification of these compounds may generate a higher anti-viral potency for the further development of a novel therapy against FIP.">

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) -specific direct-acting antiviral agents that directly inhibit the growth process of HCV have been approved since 2011. However, in the early post-marketing vigilance phase of ledipasvir acetonate/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), there were reports of interstitial lung disease in 4 out of 32,700 cases with death in 1 case; the onset mechanism is unknown. Treatment for hepatitis C was deemed to be necessary, and the patient was referred to our hospital. Oral administration of LDV/SOF was started. On day 8 of administration, a fever of 38-39 °C and coughing were observed followed by the gradual appearance of shortness of breath. As there was no improvement, the patient visited her primary care physician on day 16 of administration and the patient was brought urgently to our hospital on the same day. Blood tests and imaging tests were conducted at our hospital on the day of emergency transport; inflammatory response markers showed abnormal values, and sialylated carbohydrate antigen Krebs von den Lungen-6 was within the normal value range at 303 U/mL. Because the possibility of infection was low based on results of imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage, drug-induced lung disease was suspected, LDV/SOF administration was discontinued, and steroid administration was started. Following steroid pulse therapy, treatment with oral prednisolone tablets was gradually tapered. The patient's symptoms were relieved and she was discharged. The patient's medication history in this case indicated that there were no drugs taken before or after administration of LDV/SOF until the adverse reaction occurred, and there were no supplements or dietary supplements taken. Therefore, LDV/SOF has been proposed as the cause of the suspected adverse effect. Pharmacists should try to collect adverse effect reports to identify adverse effects early.">

        <span class="abst" title="Common respiratory viruses are now recognised as true opportunistic respiratory pathogens in patients with haematological malignancies. The epidemiology of these viruses has not been extensively studied in immunocompromised hosts, but is probably closely related to viral activity in immunocompetent hosts, who constitute the virus reservoir for immunocompromised patients. In these patients, common respiratory viruses may cause severe infections with higher rates of progression to pneumonia and mortality compared to immunocompetent individuals. Prolonged high-titre viral shedding is common in patients with haematological malignancies and may enhance not only viral transmission, but also the selection of resistant strains. Influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections have been particularly well studied. They are associated with pneumonia rates of about one-third for influenza and 30–40% for RSV. Both viruses are responsible for mortality rates ranging from 15% to 30%. The exact mechanisms of pneumonia related to these viruses remains unknown, but bacterial and fungal co-infections are frequent and must be carefully investigated. Parainfluenza viruses (PIV) and RSV have also been linked to late airflow obstruction in haematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Neuraminidase inhibitor therapy has been suggested for influenza, ribavirin for RSV, and cidofovir for adenovirus infections. However, there is no evidence supporting the use of these drugs, and randomised controlled trials are urgently needed to better define the optimal management of common viral pneumonia in patients with haematological malignancies. The absence of proven effective treatments highlights the critical importance of prevention. Viral transmission may be interrupted by contact isolation with droplet precautions for infected patients and by having patients and health care workers with suspected infection, and their relatives, refrain from visits and work. Immunisation remains the cornerstone of influenza prevention and is recommended for patients with haematological malignancies, their relatives, and health care workers.">

Developing new drugs from scratch is a lengthy process, thus impractical to face the immediate global challenge. Drug repurposing is an emerging strategy where existing medicines, having already been tested safe in humans, are redeployed to combat difficult-to-treat diseases. While using such repurposed drugs individually may ultimately not yield a significant clinical benefit, carefully combined cocktails could be very effective, as was for HIV in the 1990s; the urgent question now being which combination.">

Dose-dependent inhibition of Ebola trVLP replication was induced by 15 hit compounds, which primarily target different types of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Based on the chemical structure, the compounds were divided into three groups, diphenylmethane derivatives, promazine derivatives and chemicals with no conserved skeletons. The third group included sertindole, raloxifene, and ibutamoren showing prominent antiviral effects in cells. They downregulated the expression of viral proteins, including the VP40 matrix protein and the envelope glycoprotein. They also reduced the amount of EBOV-derived tetracistronic minigenome RNA incorporated into progeny trVLPs in the culture supernatant. Particularly, ibutamoren, which is a known agonist of growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR), showed the most promising antiviral activity with a 50% effective concentration of 0.2 μM, a 50% cytotoxic concentration of 42.4 μM, and a selectivity index of 222.8. Here, we suggest a strategy for development of anti-EBOV therapeutics by adopting GHSR agonists as hit compounds. [BMB Reports 2020; 53(3): 166-171].">

The viral outbreak has aroused panic and a public-health emergency around the world, and the number of infections continues to rise. However, the causes and consequences of the pneumonia remain unknown. To effectively implement epidemic prevention, early identification and diagnosis are critical to disease control.

Due to the lack of effective treatment options for SARS-CoV-2, various strategies are being tested in China, including drug repurposing. In this study, we used our pre-trained deep learning-based drug-target interaction model called Molecule Transformer-Drug Target Interaction (MT-DTI) to identify commercially available drugs that could act on viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The result showed that atazanavir, an antiretroviral medication used to treat and prevent the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is the best chemical compound, showing an inhibitory potency with Kd of 94.94 nM against the SARS-CoV-2 3C-like proteinase, followed by remdesivir (113.13 nM), efavirenz (199.17 nM), ritonavir (204.05 nM), and dolutegravir (336.91 nM). Interestingly, lopinavir, ritonavir, and darunavir are all designed to target viral proteinases. However, in our prediction, they may also bind to the replication complex components of SARS-CoV-2 with an inhibitory potency with Kd  &lt; 1000 nM. In addition, we also found that several antiviral agents, such as Kaletra (lopinavir/ritonavir), could be used for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. Overall, we suggest that the list of antiviral drugs identified by the MT-DTI model should be considered, when establishing effective treatment strategies for SARS-CoV-2.">

In particular, the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has quickly intensified interest in developing treatment options to mitigate impact on human life. Remdesivir (GS-5734™) is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug that is now being tested as a potential treatment for COVID-19 in international, multi-site clinical trials. Currently available evidence about the antiviral effects of remdesivir against coronaviruses is primarily based on in vitro and in vivo studies (including some on a chemically related compound, GS-441524™), which have demonstrated largely favorable findings. As the pandemic progresses, information from human compassionate use cases will continue to accumulate before the clinical trials are concluded. It is imperative for public health practitioners and the One Health community to stay up to date on the most promising potential therapeutic options that are under investigation. Thus, the purpose of this review is to synthesize the knowledge to date about remdesivir as a therapeutic option for coronaviruses, with a special focus on information relevant to the One Health community.">

The efforts of international health authorities have since focused on rapid diagnosis and isolation of patients as well as the search for therapies able to counter the most severe effects of the disease. In the absence of a known efficient therapy and because of the situation of a public-health emergency, it made sense to investigate the possible effect of chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine against SARS-CoV-2 since this molecule was previously described as a potent inhibitor of most coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-1. Preliminary trials of chloroquine repurposing in the treatment of COVID-19 in China have been encouraging, leading to several new trials. Here we discuss the possible mechanisms of chloroquine interference with the SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle.">

Brassinosteroids (BRs), a class of plant-specific steroid hormones, control many of the developmental and physiological processes like their animal counterparts, including regulation of gene expression, cell division and expansion, differentiation, programmed cell death, and homeostasis. Recent studies have indicated that these hormones have antiviral, antifungal, antiproliferative, antibacterial, neuroprotective and immunomodulatory properties in animal system. BRs analogues have been reported to have antiviral activity against herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), arenaviruses as well as against replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in Vero cells. Also, antiherpetic activities both in a human conjunctive cell line (IOBA-NHC) and murine herpetic stromal keratitis (HSK) experimental models have been reported. In human cells, anticancer structure-activity relationship of natural BRs revealed their high cytotoxic activity. Since, BRs and their analogues are reported to inhibit cell growth in cancer cell lines, they may be considered as promising phytohormones for potential anticancer drugs. The use of pollens in folk medicine also indicates scope of steroids of plant pollens in medicines. An attempt has been made in this paper to document the information available on the prospects of BRs in therapeutics.">

Among these are Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), human herpes viruses (HHV) 6, 7, and 8, human parvovirus B19, and adenoviruses (Table 11.1). The clinical presentation of infections with these viruses may be indistinguishable from that associated with infection with classic hepatotropic viruses. The presentation ranges from mild and transient elevation of aminotransferases to acute hepatitis and can also lead to acute liver failure [1]. These viruses should be considered as possible etiologic agents in patients who have acute liver injury and whose serologic markers for the classic hepatotropic viruses are not indicative of an active infection [1]. In the present chapter, we review the clinical manifestations and the potential for immune-mediated liver injury associated with several of these viruses (see summary Table 11.2).">

        <span class="abst" title="Viral diseases are leading cause of deaths worldwide as WHO report suggests that hepatitis A virus (HAV) infects more than 80 % of the population of many developing countries. Viral hepatitis B (HBV) affects an estimated 360 million people, whereas hepatitis C affects 123 million people worldwide, and last but not least, at current, India has an HIV/AIDS population of approximately 2.4 million people and more than 30 million in whole world and now it has become a reason for 1.8 million death globally; thus, millions of people still struggle for their lives.The progress in medical science has made it possible in overcoming the various fatal diseases such as small pox, chicken pox, dengue, etc., but human immunodeficiency viruses, influenza, and hepatitis virus have renewed challenge surprisingly. The obstacles and challenges in therapy include existence of antibiotic resistance strains of common organisms due to overuse of antibiotics, lack of vaccines, adverse drug reaction, and last but not least the susceptibility concerns. Emergence of pharmacogenomics and pharmacogenetics has shown some promises to take challenges. The discovery of human genome project has opened new vistas to understand the behaviors of genetic makeup in development and progression of diseases and treatment in various viral diseases. Current and previous decade have been engaged in making repositories of polymorphisms (SNPs) of various genes including drug-metabolizing enzymes, receptors, inflammatory cells related with immunity, and antigen-presenting cells, along with the prediction of risks. The genetic makeup alone is most likely an adequate way to handle the therapeutic decision-making process for previous regimen failure. With the introduction of new antiviral therapeutic agents, a significant improvement in progression and overall survival has been achieved, but these drugs have shown several adverse responses in some individuals, so the success is not up to the expectations. Research and acquisition of new knowledge of pharmacogenomics may help in overcoming the prevailing burden of viral diseases. So it will definitely help in selecting the most effective therapeutic agents, effective doses, and drug response for the individuals. Thus, it will be able to transform the laboratory research into the clinical bench side and will also help in understanding the pathogenesis of viral diseases with drug action, so the patients will be managed more properly and finally become able to fulfill the promise of the future.">

Antiviral drugs not just penetrate to disrupt the virus’ cellular divisions but also have a negative impact on normal physiological pathways in the host. Due to these issues, antiviral agents have a narrow therapeutic index than antibacterial drugs. Nephrotoxicity is the main adverse reaction of antiviral drugs in human and animals.

Based on the number of isoprene units they have, they are classified as mono, di, tri, tetra, and sesquiterpenes. They are mostly found in plants and form the major constituent of essential oils from plants. Among the natural products that provide medical benefits for an organism, terpenes play a major and variety of roles. The common plant sources of terpenes are tea, thyme, cannabis, Spanish sage, and citrus fruits (e.g., lemon, orange, mandarin). Terpenes have a wide range of medicinal uses among which antiplasmodial activity is notable as its mechanism of action is similar to the popular antimalarial drug in use—chloroquine. Monoterpenes specifically are widely studied for their antiviral property. With growing incidents of cancer and diabetes in modern world, terpenes also have the potential to serve as anticancer and antidiabetic reagents. Along with these properties, terpenes also allow for flexibility in route of administration and suppression of side effects. Certain terpenes were widely used in natural folk medicine. One such terpene is curcumin which holds anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiseptic, antiplasmodial, astringent, digestive, diuretic, and many other properties. Curcumin has also become a recent trend in healthy foods and open doors for several medical researches. This chapter summarizes the various terpenes, their sources, medicinal properties, mechanism of action, and the recent studies that are underway for designing terpenes as a lead molecule in the modern medicine.">

Current applications include: (1) The detection of (unknown) viral infections in clinical samples. (2) Quantitative monitoring of viral load. (3) Genotyping of viral strains. (4) Detection of mutations in the viral genome that are associated with viral resistance. Proper sample acquisition and sample transport, as well as accurate DNA or RNA isolation are a prerequisite for reliable test results in molecular diagnostics of viral infections. In-house as well as commercial assays can be used for the amplification of viral DNA or RNA for the detection of viral infections and viral load monitoring. Many virus species consist of several subspecies, genotypes or variants. This molecular variation has to be taken into account when applying molecular diagnostics. More complicated diagnostics for genotyping or the detection of mutations related to therapy failure often rely on sequencing, although for some viral targets commercial assays are available. In this chapter, applications are described in which molecular methods have become the most important form of viral diagnostics. Molecular test results have a direct impact on patient management and as such, results have to be reliable, standardized and reproducible.

In fact, spontaneous behavioral changes could develop as a defensive response during the spread of an epidemic, thereby impacting the epidemic dynamics and affecting timing and overall number of cases. In this chapter, a model coupling the classic SIR disease transmission model with an imitation dynamics process is introduced which accounts for the diffusion of different behaviors in the population as a response to the epidemic threat. A detailed analysis of the model identifies the main determinants leading to remarkable alterations in infection dynamics in both risk perception and diffusion of human behavioral patterns. Empirical evidence points to the need of incorporating human behavior in prediction models informing public health decisions.">

        <span class="abst" title="Various viruses can be considered as one of the most frequent causes of human diseases, from mild illnesses to really serious sicknesses that end fatally. Numerous viruses are also pathogenic to animals and plants, and many of them, mutating, become pathogenic also to humans. Several cases of affecting humans by originally animal viruses have been confirmed. Viral infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans, the increase of which is caused by general immunosuppression of the world population, changes in climate, and overall globalization. In spite of the fact that the pharmaceutical industry pays great attention to human viral infections, many of clinically used antivirals demonstrate also increased toxicity against human cells, limited bioavailability, and thus, not entirely suitable therapeutic profile. In addition, due to resistance, a combination of antivirals is needed for life-threatening infections. Thus, the development of new antiviral agents is of great importance for the control of virus spread. On the other hand, the discovery and development of structurally new antivirals represent risks. Therefore, another strategy is being developed, namely the reformulation of existing antivirals into nanoformulations and investigation of various metal and metalloid nanoparticles with respect to their diagnostic, prophylactic, and therapeutic antiviral applications. This chapter is focused on nanoscale materials/formulations with the potential to be used for the treatment or inhibition of the spread of viral diseases caused by human immunodeficiency virus, influenza A viruses (subtypes H3N2 and H1N1), avian influenza and swine influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, herpes simplex virus, hepatitis B and C viruses, Ebola and Marburg viruses, Newcastle disease virus, dengue and Zika viruses, and pseudorabies virus. Effective antiviral long-lasting and target-selective nanoformulations developed for oral, intravenous, intramuscular, intranasal, intrarectal, intravaginal, and intradermal applications are discussed. Benefits of nanoparticle-based vaccination formulations with the potential to secure cross protection against divergent viruses are outlined as well.">

        <span class="abst" title="The replication of numerous pathogenic viruses depends on host proteases, which therefore emerged as potential antiviral drug targets. In some cases, e.g., for influenza viruses, their function during the viral propagation cycle is relatively well understood, where they cleave and activate viral surface glycoproteins. For other viruses, e.g., Ebola virus, the function of host proteases during replication is still not clear. Host proteases may also contribute to the pathogenicity of virus infection by activating proinflammatory cytokines. For some coronaviruses, human proteases can also serve in a nonproteolytical fashion simply as receptors for virus entry. However, blocking of such protein-protein contacts is challenging, because receptor surfaces are often flat and difficult to address with small molecules. In contrast, many proteases possess well-defined binding pockets. Therefore, they can be considered as well-druggable targets, especially, if they are extracellularly active. The number of their experimental crystal structures is steadily increasing, which is an important prerequisite for a rational structure-based inhibitor design using computational chemistry tools in combination with classical medicinal chemistry approaches. Moreover, host proteases can be considered as stable targets, and their inhibition should prevent rapid resistance developments, which is often observed when addressing viral proteins. Otherwise, the inhibition of host proteases can also affect normal physiological processes leading to a higher probability of side effects and a narrow therapeutic window. Therefore, they should be preferably used in combination therapies with additional antiviral drugs. This strategy should provide a stronger antiviral efficacy, allow to use lower drug doses, and minimize side effects. Despite numerous experimental findings on their antiviral activity, no small-molecule inhibitors of host proteases have been approved for the treatment of virus infections, so far.">

The key to success lies in the availability and accessibility of essential medicines. Pushed by developing countries and international nongovernmental organizations, the conflicts regarding public access to essential medicines and protection of patented drugs have gained global attention.This chapter briefly introduces the history of the global response to the above challenges, beginning with the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement through the adoption of the Doha declaration and the protocol amending the World Trade Organization’s (WTO) agreement on TRIPS. Then, it discusses the practice of compulsory licenses in both developing and developed countries and describes the huge market demand for generic drugs against infectious disease in developing countries. Finally, the chapter describes the capacity of generic drug production in major developing countries, such as India and China, as well as the roles of these countries in providing generic drugs to patients at home and to other developing countries.History has repeated itself many times due to a continued lack of essential medicines; the initial epidemic of infectious disease in developing countries has become pandemic, spreading throughout the globe. Therefore, any efforts taken by developing countries to increase access to essential medicines against infectious disease are beneficial to people in both developing and developed countries. The developing countries with the capacity and experience to develop generic drugs for public use should learn from each other and collaborate in the research, production, and distribution of generic drugs under the rights granted by the WTO agreement. Developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies should be allies rather than opponents for the ultimate goal of health promotion for all of mankind.">

These agents are effective at treating the signs and symptoms of influenza in patients infected with susceptible viruses. Clinical failure has been demonstrated in patients infected with viruses with primary resistance, i.e., antivirals can be present in the virus initially infecting the patient, or resistance may emerge during the course of therapy [3–5]. NA inhibitors are active against all nine NA subtypes recognized in nature [6], including highly pathogenic avian influenza A/H5N1 and recent low-pathogenic avian influenza A/H7N9 viruses [7]. Since seasonal influenza is usually an acute, self-limited illness in which viral clearance usually occurs rapidly due to innate and adaptive host immune responses, the emergence of drug-resistant variants would be anticipated to have limited effect on clinical recovery in otherwise healthy patients, as has been demonstrated clinically [3, 8, 9]. Unfortunately, immunocompromised or immunologically naïve hosts, such as young children and infants or those exposed to novel strains, are more likely to have mutations that confer resistance emergence during therapy; such resistant variants may also result in clinically significant adverse outcomes [10–13].">

Therefore, they offer a significant opportunity to inform the development of novel therapeutics for treating viral infections by either directly targeting the pathogen or by enhancing the innate immune response.

The latter also includes naturally occurring mutations that are the source of various diseases; this is an important feature for the understanding and curing of such diseases.For many of the transporters the amino acid sequence and the possible orientation of the protein in the membrane, or even the three-dimensional structures have been determined. In this chapter on Examples of Applications of Electrophysiology, we will illustrate the strategy of an electrophysiologist in investigating structure, function and regulation of membrane transport using as an example the Na+,K+-ATPase, the neurotransmitter transporter GAT (Na+-dependent GABA transporter), and the nucleotide receptors that form channels in the presence of extracellular ATP.For an understanding of drug action as well as the development of new drugs for the treatment of diseases, electrophysiology is a powerful method to elucidate drug receptor interaction. As an example, this will be illustrated for viral ion channels that are essential for virus reproduction.">

        <span class="abst" title="There are various ways in which new drugs can be developed. One approach is in silico drug design based on our existing knowledge of the biology of a specific disease and the specific target site binding chemistry. Based on this knowledge, a range of molecules will be designed and synthesised after which they will be tested in in vitro bioassays for activity and toxicity. The best candidates, called lead compounds, will then be “fine-tuned” by chemical derivatisation in order to improve their activity and/or to reduce their toxicity. Lead compounds are then tested in various animal models before entering clinical trials in people. Another approach is to screen a large number of biological samples (plants, bacteria and fungi) for activity against a specific disease. Any active extract, consisting of many compounds, will be fractionated by chromatographic techniques, and each fraction will be tested for in vitro activity. Active fractions will again be fractionated until the active compound is identified. This process, also called bioguided fractionation, can go through a number of fractionation cycles before the active compound is identified. The active compound will be chemically derivatised in order to improve its properties before in vivo animal studies will be conducted. Based on these test results, the most promising lead compounds will then be tested in clinical trials in people. There are however a number of shortcomings with both approaches. It is expensive, time consuming, makes use of in vitro bioassays and it suffers from a very low success rate. Due to these shortcomings, it is currently estimated that the development of one new drug costs around $1–1.5 billion, simply because so many lead compounds fail during clinical trials. Keeping these high costs in mind, one would think that all registered drugs are effective and importantly non-toxic. Unfortunately, this is not the case, as there are a number of drugs currently on the market that are causing severe side effects and whose efficacy should be questioned. This holds true particularly for cancer chemotherapeutics. It was estimated that cancer chemotherapy improves the average 5-year survival rate of patients (for all cancer types) by only 2 % (Morgan et al. 2004). Another relatively unknown fact is that each year, 200,000 people die in the EU due to adverse drug reactions (all types of drugs), highlighting the severe shortcomings of the drug development and drug licensing pipelines (Archibald and Coleman 2012). To put this into perspective, there are a large number of drugs that work perfectly well and are safe to use, but we have to concede that our approach to drug discovery and our overall approach to health care suffers from some major problems.">

Similarly, antibodies used to prevent or treat viral infections attach to epitopes on virions or on viral proteins expressed on the surface of infected cells. Such drugs and antibodies can therefore be thought of as probes for the detection of viral infections, suggesting that they might be used as radiolabeled tracers to visualize sites of viral replication by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. A current example of this approach is the PET imaging of herpes simplex virus infections, in which the viral thymidine kinase phosphorylates radiolabeled thymidine analogues, trapping them within infected cells. One of many possible future applications might be the use of a radiolabeled hepatitis C protease inhibitor to image infection in animals or humans and provide a quantitative measure of viral burden. This article reviews the basic features of radionuclide imaging and the characteristics of ideal tracer molecules, and discusses how antiviral drugs and antibodies could be evaluated for their suitability as virus-specific imaging probes. The use of labeled drugs as low-dose tracers would provide an alternative application for compounds that have failed to advance to clinical use because of insufficient in vivo potency, an unsuitable pharmacokinetic profile or hepato- or nephrotoxicity.">

JZ-1 also has preventive and therapeutic effects on Trichomonas vaginitis, Candida albicans vaginitis and GH in vitro and in vivo experiments. AIM OF STUDY:The effect and mechanism of JZ-1 on anti-herpes simplex virus type 2(HSV-2) in vitro focusing on adhesion and penetration stages were investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS:A model of HSV-2 infection of VK2/E6E7 was developed. In order to explore JZ-1's anti-HSV-2 effect in vitro, cell morphology, ultrastructural pathology, cell viability and expression of viral glycoprotein D (gD) were assessed at 6 h, 12 h, 18 h, and 24 h of JZ-1 treatment. Then we measured the exact time required for adhesion and penetration of HSV-2 into VK2/E6E7 among a series of times at room temperature and under temperature control techniques. We treated VK2/E6E7 with JZ-1, penciclovir, or berberine and explored the mechanism of JZ-1 in blocking HSV-2 adhesion and penetration of host cells by assessing the cell ultrastructural pathology, viability, viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4 and host cell proteins HVEM, Nectin-1, and Nectin-2. RESULTS:HSV-2 can fully adhere and penetrate into VK/E6E7 within 5 mins at room temperature while it takes 60mins under temperature control techniques. JZ-1 and penciclovir showed significant anti-HSV-2 effects, with improved host cell morphologies and increased host cell viabilities observed after treatment for 24 h. The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 can be detected after treatment for 6 h while that of penciclovir was not obvious until treatment for 12 h. JZ-1 showed distinct effect on HSV-2 adhesion and penetration stages by significantly reducing the expression of viral proteins gB, gD, VP16, ICP5, and ICP4, improving cell morphology and increasing cell viability. However, these effects were not exerted via downregulated expression of membrane fusion-related proteins such as HVEM, Nectin-1, or Nectin-2. The specific anti-HSV-2 mechanism of JZ-1 need to be further explored. CONCLUSION:The anti-HSV-2 effect of JZ-1 was superior to that of penciclovir and berberine in vitro, and was mainly mediated by enhancing host cell defense and blocking adhesion and penetration of HSV-2.">

For centuries, the herb has been employed in clinical practice for treatment of virus infection and inflammation. However, its active ingredients remain unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY:In the present study, the anti-influenza virus activity of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin, the Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products, was firstly evaluated in vitro and in ovo and their mechanism of action was investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS:Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin were isolated from Isatidis Radix by chiral separation. In vitro and in ovo evaluations were performed on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and embryonated eggs respectively, both using protocols including prevention, treatment and virus neutralization. Hemagglutination (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) inhibition assays were performed for further understanding of the antiviral mechanism. RESULTS:Isatidis Radix derived glucosinolate isomers and their breakdown products all exhibited dose-dependent inhibition effect against influenza A virus (H1N1) without toxicity. The antiviral potency of the components was in the order of progoitrin &gt; goitrin &gt; epigoitrin &gt; epiprogoitrin. The attachment of the constituents to the viral envelope conduced to the mechanism of their antiviral action without disturbing viral adsorption or budding. CONCLUSION:Taken together, these results are promising for further development of Isatidis Radix and may contribute an adjunct to pharmacotherapy for influenza virus infection.">

        <span class="abst" title="The Coronavirus-associated disease, that was first identified in 2019 in China (CoViD-19), is a pandemic caused by a bat-derived beta-coronavirus, named SARS-CoV2. It shares homology with SARS and MERS-CoV, responsible for past outbreaks in China and in Middle East. SARS-CoV2 spread from China where the first infections were described in December 2019 and is responsible for the respiratory symptoms that can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome. A cytokine storm has been shown in patients who develop fatal complications, as observed in past coronavirus infections. The management includes ventilatory support and broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, empirically utilized, as a targeted therapy and vaccines have not been developed. Based upon our limited knowledge on the pathogenesis of CoViD-19, a potential role of some anti-rheumatic drugs may be hypothesized, acting as direct antivirals or targeting host immune response. Antimalarial drugs, commonly used in rheumatology, may alter the lysosomal proteases that mediates the viral entry into the cell and have demonstrated efficacy in improving the infection. Anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 may interfere with the cytokine storm in severe cases and use of tocilizumab has shown good outcomes in a small cohort. Baricitinib has both antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. Checkpoints inhibitors such as anti-CD200 and anti-PD1 could have a role in the treatment of CoViD-19. Rheumatic disease patients taking immunosuppressive drugs should be recommended to maintain the chronic therapy, prevent infection by avoiding social contacts and pausing immunosuppressants in case of infection. National and international registries are being created to collect data on rheumatic patients with CoViD-19.">

Unfortunately, there is currently no effective antiviral drug or vaccine against the virus. Identification of new anti-ASFV drugs is urgently needed. Here, an up-to-date set of protein-protein interactions between ASFV and swine were curated by integration of protein-protein interactions from multiple sources. Thirty-eight swine proteins were observed to interact with ASFVs and were defined as ASFV-interacting swine proteins. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins were found to play a central role in the swine protein-protein interaction network, with significant larger degree, betweenness and smaller shortest path length than other swine proteins. Some of ASFV-interacting swine proteins also interacted with several other viruses and could be taken as potential targets of drugs for broad-spectrum effect, such as HSP90AB1. Finally, the antiviral drugs which targeted ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins were predicted. Several drugs with either broad-spectrum effect or high specificity on ASFV-interacting swine proteins were identified, such as Polaprezinc and Geldanamycin. Structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulation showed that Geldanamycin could bind with swine HSP90AB1 stably. This work could not only deepen our understanding towards the ASFV-swine interactions, but also help for the development of effective antiviral drugs against the ASFVs.">

When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID-19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeutics targeting SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.">

The optimal management of COVID-19 infected patients is still unclear, although the consensus is moving towards the need of a biphasic approach. During the first phase of the disease (from onset of the symptoms up to 7-10 days) viral-induced effects are prominent with the opportunity to institute antiviral therapy. In the second inflammatory phase of the disease, immunosuppressive strategies (for example with glucocorticoids or anti-cytokines drugs)may be considered. This latter stage is characterized by the development of progressive lung involvement with increasing oxygen requirements and occasionally signs of the haemophagocitic syndrome. The management of the disease in patients with kidney disease is even more challenging, especially in those who are immunosuppressed or with severe comorbidities. Here we present the therapeutic approach employed in Brescia (Italy) for managing kidney transplant and hemodialysis patients with COVID-19. Furthermore, we provide some clinical and physiopathological background, as well as preliminary outcome data of our cohort, in order to better clarify the pathogenesis of the disease and clinical management.">

However, patients with advanced liver disease and those after liver transplantation represent vulnerable patient cohorts with an increased risk of infection and/or a severe course of COVID-19. In addition, the current pandemic requires unusual allocation of healthcare resources which may negatively impact the care of patients with chronic liver disease that continue to require medical attention. Thus, the challenge hepatologists are facing is to promote telemedicine in the outpatient setting, prioritise outpatient contacts, avoid nosocomial dissemination of the virus to patients and healthcare providers, and at the same time maintain standard care for patients who require immediate medical attention.">

        <span class="abst" title="The recent emergence of the novel pathogenic SARS-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is responsible for a worldwide pandemic. Given the global health emergency, drug repositioning is the most reliable option to design an efficient therapy for infected patients without delay. The first step of the viral replication cycle [i.e. attachment to the surface of respiratory cells, mediated by the spike (S) viral protein] offers several potential therapeutic targets. The S protein uses the angiotension-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptor for entry, but also sialic acids linked to host cell surface gangliosides. Using a combination of structural and molecular modelling approaches, this study showed that chloroquine (CLQ), one of the drugs currently under investigation for SARS-CoV-2 treatment, binds sialic acids and gangliosides with high affinity. A new type of ganglioside-binding domain at the tip of the N-terminal domain of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was identified. This domain (111-158), which is fully conserved among clinical isolates worldwide, may improve attachment of the virus to lipid rafts and facilitate contact with the ACE-2 receptor. This study showed that, in the presence of CLQ [or its more active derivative, hydroxychloroquine (CLQ-OH)], the viral S protein is no longer able to bind gangliosides. The identification of this new mechanism of action of CLQ and CLQ-OH supports the use of these repositioned drugs to cure patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. The in-silico approaches used in this study might also be used to assess the efficiency of a broad range of repositioned and/or innovative drug candidates before clinical evaluation.">

        <span class="abst" title="An outbreak related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. An extremely high potential for dissemination resulted in the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020. Despite the worsening trends of COVID-19, no drugs are validated to have significant efficacy in clinical treatment of COVID-19 patients in large-scale studies. Remdesivir is considered the most promising antiviral agent; it works by inhibiting the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A large-scale study investigating the clinical efficacy of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1, followed by 100 mg once daily) is on-going. The other excellent anti-influenza RdRp inhibitor favipiravir is also being clinically evaluated for its efficacy in COVID-19 patients. The protease inhibitor lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) alone is not shown to provide better antiviral efficacy than standard care. However, the regimen of LPV/RTV plus ribavirin was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in vitro. Another promising alternative is hydroxychloroquine (200 mg thrice daily) plus azithromycin (500 mg on day 1, followed by 250 mg once daily on day 2-5), which showed excellent clinical efficacy on Chinese COVID-19 patients and anti-SARS-CoV-2 potency in vitro. The roles of teicoplanin (which inhibits the viral genome exposure in cytoplasm) and monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 are under investigation. Avoiding the prescription of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II type I receptor blockers is advised for COVID-19 patients.">

        <span class="abst" title="The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has attracted increasing worldwide attention. Cases of liver damage or dysfunction (mainly characterized by moderately elevated serum aspartate aminotransferase levels) have been reported among patients with COVID-19. However, it is currently uncertain whether the COVID-19-related liver damage/dysfunction is due mainly to the viral infection per se or other coexisting conditions, such as the use of potentially hepatotoxic drugs and the coexistence of systemic inflammatory response, respiratory distress syndrome-induced hypoxia, and multiple organ dysfunction. Based on the current evidence from case reports and case series, this review article focuses on the demographic and clinical characteristics, potential mechanisms, and treatment options for COVID-19-related liver dysfunction. This review also describes the geographical and demographic distribution of COVID-19-related liver dysfunction, as well as possible underlying mechanisms linking COVID-19 to liver dysfunction, in order to facilitate future drug development, prevention, and control measures for COVID-19.">

        <span class="abst" title="Halophilic archaea are a promising natural source of carotenoids. However, little information is available about the biological impacts of these archaeal metabolites. Here, carotenoids of Natrialba sp. M6, which was isolated from Wadi El-Natrun, were produced, purified and identified by Raman spectroscopy, GC-mass spectrometry, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, LC-mass spectrometry and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The C50 carotenoid bacterioruberin was found to be the predominant compound. Because cancer and viral hepatitis are serious diseases, the anticancer, anti-HCV and anti-HBV potentials of these extracted carotenoids (pigments) were examined for the first time. In vitro results indicated that the caspase-mediated apoptotic anticancer effect of this pigment and its inhibitory efficacy against matrix metalloprotease 9 were significantly higher than those of 5-fluorouracil. Furthermore, the extracted pigment exhibited significantly stronger activity for eliminating HCV and HBV in infected human blood mononuclear cells than currently used drugs. This antiviral activity may be attributed to its inhibitory potential against HCV RNA and HBV DNA polymerases, which thereby suppresses HCV and HBV replication, as indicated by a high viral clearance % in the treated cells. These novel findings suggest that the C50 carotenoid of Natrialba sp. M6 can be used as an alternative source of natural metabolites that confer potent anticancer and antiviral activities.">

We aimed to conduct a network meta-analysis to statistically differ the efficacy and safety of each antiviral agents initiating on different timings in preventing mother-to-infant transmission of HBV. METHODS:Studies were included from PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases through July 1, 2019. Eligible studies recruited randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized studies reporting about infant or/and maternal efficacy and safety outcomes and were screened by two investigators independently. Extracted data were analyzed by pair-wised and network meta-analysis, respectively. RESULTS:3 Randomized and 32 nonrandomized studies enrolling 6738 pregnant female were included. Using network analysis, any antiviral agent interrupted HBV vertical transmission much more effectively than placebo. No agent showed significant efficacy different from others, but a strong trend toward significance was found in telbivudine and tenofovir, of which had the highest probability of being ranked the first- or second-best treatment for reducing MTCT of HBV. The treatment applied in the first and second trimester had a similar efficacy in preventing MTCT. Compared with the initiation during the third trimester, lower rate of MTCT was revealed when antiviral therapy was administrated before third trimester, (RR = 0.045, 95% CI 0.0053 to 0.20); a similar effect at delivery on suppressing maternal HBV DNA level and converting serum HBeAg were achieved if the timing of antiviral treatment started prior, but an obvious improvement of normalizing ALT flare was calculated out; no statistically differences among maternal and fetal safety outcomes were found if mothers received antiviral agents before pregnant 28 weeks. CONCLUSION:This network meta-analysis recommended the earlier use of telbivudine or tenofovir, tends to be better to prevent MTCT of HBV in pregnancy with no increased adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.">

The epidemic has affected various regions of China in different degrees. As the situations evolve, the COVID-19 had been confirmed in many countries, and made a assessment that it can be characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020. Drugs are the main treatment of COVID-19 patients. Pharmaceutical service offers drug safety ensurance for COVID-19 patients. According to COVID-19 prevention and control policy and requirements, combined with series of diagnosis and treatment plans, pharmacists in the first provincial-level COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment unit in Jilin Province in Northeast China have established the management practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical care from four aspects: personnel, drugs supply management, off-label drug use management and pharmaceutical care. During the outbreak, the pharmaceutical department of THJU completed its assigned workload to ensure drug supply. So far, no nosocomial infections and medication errors have occurred, which has stabilized the mood of the staff and boosted the pharmacists' confidence in fighting the epidemic. For the treatment of COVID-19, pharmacists conducted adverse reaction monitoring and participated in the multidisciplinary consultation of COVID-19. Up to now, the COVID-19 patients admitted to THJU have not shown any new serious adverse reactions and been cured finally. The hospital pharmacy department timely adjusted the work mode, and the formed management practices is a powerful guarantee for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic. This paper summarized the details and practices of drug supply and pharmaceutical services management to provide experience for the people who involving in COVID-19 prevention and contain in other abroad epidemic areas.">

Replicons are self-amplifying recombinant RNA molecules expressing proteins sufficient for their own replication but which do not produce infectious virions. Replicons can persist in cells and are passed on during cell division, enabling quick, efficient and high-throughput testing of drug candidates that act on viral transcription, translation and replication.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [previously provisionally known as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)]. At present, the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 has caused a large number of deaths with tens of thousands of confirmed cases worldwide, posing a serious threat to public health. However, there are no clinically approved vaccines or specific therapeutic drugs available for COVID-19. Intensive research on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2 is urgently needed to elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms and epidemiological characteristics and to identify potential drug targets, which will contribute to the development of effective prevention and treatment strategies. Hence, this review will focus on recent progress regarding the structure of SARS-CoV-2 and the characteristics of COVID-19, such as the aetiology, pathogenesis and epidemiological characteristics.">

Among the virus-contracted hosts, their different metabolic status, as determined by their diet, nutrition, age, sex, medical conditions, lifestyle, and environmental factors, govern the personal fate toward different clinical severity of COVID-19, from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, to death.

        <span class="abst" title="Sterile alpha motif and histidine-aspartic acid domain-containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) is a dNTP triphosphohydrolase involved in the regulation of the intracellular dNTP pool, linked to viral restriction, cancer development and autoimmune disorders. SAMHD1 function is regulated by phosphorylation through a mechanism controlled by cyclin-dependent kinases and tightly linked to cell cycle progression. Recently, SAMHD1 has been shown to decrease the efficacy of nucleotide analogs used as chemotherapeutic drugs. Here, we demonstrate that SAMHD1 can enhance or decrease the efficacy of various classes of anticancer drug, including nucleotide analogues, but also anti-folate drugs and CDK inhibitors. Importantly, we show that selective CDK4/6 inhibitors are pharmacological activators of SAMHD1 that act by inhibiting its inactivation by phosphorylation. Combinations of a CDK4/6 inhibitor with nucleoside or folate antimetabolites potently enhanced drug efficacy, resulting in highly synergic drug combinations (CI &lt; 0.04). Mechanistic analyses reveal that cell cycle-controlled modulation of SAMHD1 function is the central process explaining changes in anticancer drug efficacy, therefore providing functional proof of the potential of CDK4/6 inhibitors as a new class of adjuvants to boost chemotherapeutic regimens. The evaluation of SAMHD1 expression in cancer tissues allowed for the identification of cancer types that would benefit from the pharmacological modulation of SAMHD1 function. In conclusion, these results indicate that the modulation of SAMHD1 function may represent a promising strategy for the improvement of current antimetabolite-based treatments.">
