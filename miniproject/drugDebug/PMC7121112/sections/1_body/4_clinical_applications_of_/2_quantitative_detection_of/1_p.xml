<p id="Par31">Molecular techniques have made it possible to obtain a quantitative or semi quantitative result that can be related to a viral load. To obtain a reliable quantitative test result that can be compared with other test results, the amount (or input) of the clinical sample has to be standardized. Preferably, the test result relates to an international standard to calculate the viral load. Viral load is used to monitor herpes virus reactivation after transplantation and in some chronic viral infections like hepatitis B, hepatitis C and HIV. Since virus detection and viral monitoring have become essential in patient care, it is necessary that these techniques are performed frequently and on a regular basis in molecular diagnostic laboratories. Automation of the workflow from nucleic acid isolation, amplification, detection and processing of the results is essential for laboratories to maintain a high degree of standardization, to ensure that test results are reproducible.</p>
