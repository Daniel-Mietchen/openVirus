<p id="Par37">Some conditions influence the reliability of the quantification of a viral load. First, the sampling procedure and the handling of samples may influence the test results. For example, varicella zoster virus is a cell-associated virus. In vesicle fluid, the virus load can be low and may result in a false-negative PCR test result. Scraping of the bottom of the vesicle, where most virus-infected cells are present, may result in a very high viral load. Second, the viral load may not fluctuate too much in relation to the time that is needed to generate a quantitative test result. In acute viral infections, the virus load increases quickly to very high levels and decreases after that. For many acute viral respiratory infections it is not possible to show a relation between the viral load and the seriousness of the respiratory disease. Third, variation in virus load that is caused by the procedure has to be avoided. There are many factors that influence the outcome of the viral load: sample handling and freeze thawing, pipetting deviations, sample viscosity, batch-differences in reagent preparation and PCR-kits, etc. To obtain reliable quantitative test results, these factors have to be avoided.</p>
