<p id="Par51">Direct-acting antivirals (DAAâ€™s, nucleotide-or nucleoside-analogues) that are available for the treatment of an infection with the hepatitis B virus are lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, tenofovir and entecavir. One mutation, called the YMDD motive, is associated with resistance to lamivudine. The YMDD motive is a conserved sequence in the RNA-dependent DNA polymerase gene of hepatitis B virus consisting of tyrosine (Y), methionine (M), and two aspartates (DD). Replacement of the methionine by isoleucine (YIDD) or valine (YVDD) leads to resistance. Since the polymerase and hepatitis B surface antigen genes overlap, replacement of nucleotides may also lead to changes in the surface antigen. Therefore, the mutations also have an impact on the production and secretion of the HBsAg. Lamivudine has long been the only treatment option for hepatitis B, but now has been replaced by other more potent antivirals, like entecavir and tenofovir. Entecavir, however, is less effective in patients who have been pretreated with lamivudine and who carry the YMDD variant of hepatitis B. Genotyping and resistance testing of hepatitis B can be performed by sequencing and comparing the sequence to reference strains, but LiPA assays have also been developed for genotyping and for the detection of mutations associated with resistance.</p>
