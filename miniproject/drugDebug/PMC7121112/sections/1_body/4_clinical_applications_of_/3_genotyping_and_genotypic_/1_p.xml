<p id="Par39">Due to a combination of sloppy replication, immune pressure and other factors, viruses have evolved into different geno-or subtypes. Clinical features of genotypes may differ and sometimes even influence the choice of therapy. Viral resistance can occur during treatment and determines the course of the infection and the choice of medication. Often, only small variations, or even single nucleotide point mutations (SNP), may have a great impact on the pathogenicity, replicative activity and/or susceptibility for treatment. Mutations are usually represented as the amino acid that is replaced and the position, e.g. Q151Â M is a mutation in the reverse transcriptase gene of HIV, in which the glutamine at position 151 in the protein is replaced by a methionine. A few examples are discussed in the following subsections.</p>
