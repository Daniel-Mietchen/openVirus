<p id="Par62">In viral diagnostics, a pan-influenza PCR is used, with primers that detect influenza species A (Matrix gene segment) and a different PCR to detect influenza B. To monitor influenza activity during the winter season and to estimate the effectiveness of the vaccine, viral strains are typed for H and N-gene segments every year. Typing can be performed by reverse transcriptase qPCR with type-specific primers and probes. Some commercial assays are also available. Strain typing is used to predict upcoming strains and to determine the strains that need to be included in the vaccine. The virus mutates from year to year, making existing vaccines ineffective.</p>
