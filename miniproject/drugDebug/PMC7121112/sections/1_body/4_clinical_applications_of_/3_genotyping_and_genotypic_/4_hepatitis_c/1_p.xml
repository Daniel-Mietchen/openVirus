<p id="Par52">As an alternative to HIV and hepatitis B treatment, which aims at long-term suppression of the virus, the treatment of the hepatitis C virus aims to totally clear the virus from the host. In the past decades, hepatitis C was treated with a combination of interferon-alpha and ribavirin. Nowadays, an increasing number of direct-acting antivirals (DAAâ€™s) are available. Several viral proteins involved in the HCV lifecycle, such as the non-structural (NS) 3/4A serine protease, the NS5B RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the NS5A protein, are targets for these drugs. NS5A plays a role in the formation of a replication complex of the virus and in the release of new viral particles. The Hepatitis C virus has 7 major genotypes, all with different prevalence and different responses to treatment. Genotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4 are most prevalent in western countries. Genotyping can be performed with a LiPA assay, but sequence-based assays have also been developed. First-generation protease-inhibitors telaprevir and boceprevir are active against hepatitis C genotype 1, but they are less effective and therefore not registered for other genotypes. New NS3-protease-inhibitors are registered for treatment of genotype 1 and 4. Polymerase inhibitors and NS5A inhibitors show less genotypic specificity. Since treatment with one antiviral is often ineffective, combination therapy is always given. The choice of medicine largely depends on the hepatitis C genotype.</p>
