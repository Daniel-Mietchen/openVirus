<p id="Par53">Antiviral resistance does not appear to be a serious problem in treatment with NS5B polymerase-inhibitors. For NS5A-inhibitors, some clinically relevant mutations have been described, like M28T, Q30E/H/R, L31 M/V and Y93H. Drug resistance to protease-inhibitors seems more complex. Q80 K is a mutation that is related to resistance to simeprevir, but only in genotype 1a-infected patients (Fig.
