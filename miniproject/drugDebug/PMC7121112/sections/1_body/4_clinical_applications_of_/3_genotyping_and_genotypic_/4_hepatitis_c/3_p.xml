<p id="Par54">R155 K/T is a mutation that appears to invoke resistance to almost all protease-inhibitors, including to protease-inhibitors still in development in genotype 1a-infected patients. The D168 V mutation seems to be prevalent mostly in genotype 1b-infected patients and is related to resistance. Mutations associated with resistance may be present before treatment or develop during treatment. Pretreatment sequence analysis and monitoring of response to antiviral treatment will give more information that may be of help in future therapy development.</p>
