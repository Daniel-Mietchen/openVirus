<p id="Par29">In clinical diagnostics, the question is often: “which virus is causing this disease?” When using molecular diagnostics to answer this question, the symptoms of the disease and patient characteristics also give directions to the most likely etiological agents. For instance, respiratory diseases can be caused by a number of viruses like influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses and human metapneumo virus, but in children, the respiratory syncytial virus is also a common cause. Infections of the upper respiratory tract may have different causes than infections of the lower respiratory tract. Additionally, patient-related factors like asthma or other chronic diseases, or medication, may influence the type and seriousness of the infection. Most diagnostic laboratories and diagnostic companies have developed specific respiratory panels to detect the most common causes of respiratory infections. Also for gastroenteritis and meningitis, there are multiple causes and usually a panel of viruses is tested. The most frequent cause of viral meningitis are enteroviruses, but occasionally, viral meningitis can be caused by other viruses like the herpes simplex virus, the mumps virus or arboviruses, which may require other precautions and treatment. Examples of viral causes of diseases are shown in Table
