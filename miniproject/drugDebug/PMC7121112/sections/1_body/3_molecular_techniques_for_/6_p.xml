<p id="Par28">Sequencing provides more information about the viral genome. Direct sequencing of a PCR product with the Sanger method does not yield information about variants that are present in low percentages in the total viral population. Variants that are present in less than ~25% of the total viral population are not detected. Next generation sequencing methods are more sensitive for the detection of minor viral populations. LiPA-assays also tend to be better in the detection of minority strains when compared to Sanger-sequencing methods.</p>
