<p id="Par26">Sequences of viral genomes can be uploaded into online databases (e.g. NCBI) to determine the genotype of the virus. For some viruses, tools are available on the internet, e.g. the NCBI genotyping tool, Geno2Pheno or HIV-GRADE, either for genotyping or to quickly determine mutations associated with antiviral resistance. These tools are not available for all viruses. For other viruses, sequences can be uploaded into online databases and compared to viral sequences retrieved from GenBank or the Los Alamos database. Programs like NCBI blast or SeqScape can be used to compare sequences to detect mutations.</p>
