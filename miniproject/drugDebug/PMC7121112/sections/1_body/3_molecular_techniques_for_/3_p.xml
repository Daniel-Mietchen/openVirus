<p id="Par25">A few techniques are available to detect viral variation. The most frequently used and also the most informative one, is sequencing (part of) the viral genome. Sequencing can be used for several purposes, like genotyping (detection of variation) and the detection of mutations associated with resistance. A disadvantage is, however, that it is also the most time-consuming procedure. With the development of sequencing technology, it has become less expensive and more feasible for diagnostic laboratories (see Vol. 1, Chap. 8).</p>
