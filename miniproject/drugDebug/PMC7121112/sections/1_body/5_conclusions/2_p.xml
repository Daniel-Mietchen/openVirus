<p id="Par65">By applying molecular techniques we have learned more about viral variation and the different genotypes that exist within virus species. This variation has clinical impact. For some viruses, specific mutations in the viral genome can be related to resistance to antiviral medication. More rapid and cheaper molecular techniques, like next generation sequencing, will be of aid in exploring this field more extensively.</p>
