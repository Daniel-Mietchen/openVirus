<p id="Par8">Extraction of viral nucleic acids can be done manually or automatically. Commercial manufacturers have developed a number of manual extraction kits. These kits vary in the method they use, the time required for extraction, the samples they are suitable for and the costs. In most methods, DNA or RNA is bound to a solid phase of glass fibres or silica, washed, released and precipitated. Manual extraction requires multiple manipulations and with the increasing number of samples, automated extraction is indispensable in diagnostic laboratories. Automated extraction instruments are manufactured by a number of different companies. By automation and standardization, the recovery of DNA and RNA from clinical samples is consistent and reproducible. More samples can be processed within a shorter period of time as compared with manual isolation, depending on the capacity of the instrument.</p>
