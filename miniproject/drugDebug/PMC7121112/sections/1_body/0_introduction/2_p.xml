<p id="Par3">Screening for persisting viruses is usually performed by serological methods. The detection of antibodies is, however, an indirect method to detect an infection and there is usually no correlation with the severity of the disease. Viral load is generally a more accurate indicator of the severity of infection. Molecular techniques for quantitative viral load monitoring are applied to monitor (chronic) infections and to measure the effect of antiviral therapy.</p>
