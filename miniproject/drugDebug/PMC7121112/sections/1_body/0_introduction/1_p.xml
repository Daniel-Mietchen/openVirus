<p id="Par2">In the past, viral culturing techniques were used for the detection of viruses in clinical samples. Most of these culture methods have been replaced by molecular detection of viruses. The advantages of molecular detection, when compared to virus culture, are the higher diagnostic sensitivity and the much shorter time-to-result. A limitation of the molecular detection of viruses, when compared to conventional culture, is that the assays will only detect known viruses that were included in the search panel.</p>
