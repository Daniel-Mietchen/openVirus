<p id="Par13">The target sequence for the design of primers and probes for the detection of viruses must be unique to the target. Preferably, the PCR primers should be able to identify the target region with high efficiency and specificity (see Vol. 1, Chap. 3). In the development of primers and probes for the detection of viruses, however, the variation of the viral genome has to be taken into account. Especially RNA-viruses, which lack proofreading in the replication of the virus, have high variability. A search in a DNA database, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database (

For clinical applications, it is necessary to validate the assay in the clinical material to which it will be applied, for instance faecal samples, to confirm absence of cross reactivity to normal flora in those specific samples. Mutations in the viral genome situated in the binding region of the primers and probe affect the binding efficiency of the primers and probes and consequently influence the efficiency of the amplification reaction. Both the location of the mutations and the number of mutations are important for the binding of the primers and probes and the amplification efficiency.
