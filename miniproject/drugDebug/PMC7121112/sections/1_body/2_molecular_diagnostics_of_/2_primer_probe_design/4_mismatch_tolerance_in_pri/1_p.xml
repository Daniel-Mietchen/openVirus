<p id="Par16">Not much literature is available about the effect of mismatches in primers on amplification-efficiency. Mismatch-tolerance is dependent on the type of mismatch (T/A or G/C), the T
 <sub>m</sub> of the primer and the percentage G/C compared to A/T. The effect of mutations on qPCR efficiency also depends on the number and location of the mutations.
