<p id="Par10">Other techniques are based on signal-amplification. One of these techniques is the branched-DNA (bDNA) assay. This technique is based on binding of the denatured target DNA or RNA on sequence-specific capture probes (bound to a micro well) and capture extenders. Second probes, called label extenders, also bind specifically and include a sequence that also binds to pre-amplifier probes. Multiple amplifiers bind to each pre-amplifier probe, amplifying the signal. This technique is also described in Chap. 7 of Volume 1. The advantages of signal amplifying techniques are that these methods are sensitive, specific, obtain a quantitative result and can be automated. However, these techniques are available for only a few targets (like HIV, hepatitis B and C) and are not suitable for development in your own laboratory.</p>
