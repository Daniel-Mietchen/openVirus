<p id="Par11">The most popular technique in many of the virology laboratories is probably real-time PCR (qPCR). Commercially available qPCR based techniques are mainly developed for the most frequently detected targets in diagnostic laboratories. The advantage of qPCR for a molecular diagnostic (virology) laboratory is that the laboratory can develop its own tests for targets for which no CE-marked in vitro diagnostic (IVD) assays are available. qPCR can be used for the qualitative and quantitative detection of viruses. (Multiplex) qPCR can be used for the detection of many different viruses in one assay, for example for the detection of respiratory viruses like influenza virus, para-influenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumo virus and coronaviruses (respiratory viral panel) in samples from patients with respiratory disease or for the detection of norovirus, rotavirus, enteroviruses and parechovirus (gastrointestinal viral panel) in patients with gastrointestinal disease.</p>
