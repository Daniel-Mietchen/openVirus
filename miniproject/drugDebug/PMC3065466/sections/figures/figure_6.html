 <caption> Power of a test to determine whether antiviral drugs are effective. Power of a test to compare the mean outbreak size in households who receive antiviral drugs early and households who do not, for each of the household sizes 2, 3 and 4 (i.e. observations on household outbreaks). A modified version of the Alexander-Govern test is used and power is estimated by applying the test to each of 500 data sets for each and each effect scenario. In curves (a), (b) and (c) the simulations assume that antiviral drugs partially reduce infectivity and their effect on susceptibility is to induce full, partial and zero protection, respectively. Simulations for curve (d) assume no effect on infectivity and a partial effect on susceptibility. </caption>
