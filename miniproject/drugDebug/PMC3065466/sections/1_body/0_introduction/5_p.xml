<p>Here we use simple models that contain the key features needed to assess the impact of using antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission. The aim is to clarify the potential benefit of timely use of antivirals for prophylaxis and its limitations. Specifically, we ask whether use of antiviral drugs should be included in an attempt to contain an emerged pandemic, we provide guidance on the size of stockpile needed for an attempt at containment and consider what data need to be collected at the start of a pandemic to assess the prophylactic effectiveness of antiviral drugs against the new virus strain.</p>
