<p>Our aim was to see whether antiviral drugs should be used to mitigate general transmission following emergence of a future pandemic influenza strain. The main conclusion is a strong recommendation that liberal and timely use of antiviral drugs should be part of an attempt at local containment of transmission. The case for this lies in the substantial benefits of successful containment and the fact that the accumulated use of antiviral drugs over a period of successful containment is modest, even when the immigration rate of infected arrivals is high. The recommended plan for the attempt at containment must include abandoning prophylactic use of antiviral drugs once there is strong empirical evidence that containment is unlikely to succeed, because continued use of antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission when early containment fails is likely to use a very sizable supply of antiviral drugs with little benefit. The likelihood of successful containment should be evident by the time 350 cases have been reported and we have data on 200 household outbreaks.</p>
