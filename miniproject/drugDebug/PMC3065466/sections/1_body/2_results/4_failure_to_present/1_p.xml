 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017764-g004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates that failure to present early can reduce the effectiveness of using antiviral drugs to mitigate transmission. People might fail to present because their clinical symptoms are not severe or present late due to delayed access to health services. It seems likely that use of antiviral drugs to contain transmission of pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 was not successful because the fraction of infected individuals who failed to present, or presented late, was too high. It is useful to have a way of determining how the fraction of primary household cases who do not present, or present late, limits the chance of containing transmission.
