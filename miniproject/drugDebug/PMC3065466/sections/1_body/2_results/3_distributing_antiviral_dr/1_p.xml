<p>Consider now transmission through a community of households. Suppose that every infection that an individual generates outside their own household is of a randomly selected community member. During the containment phase of the pandemic, the force of infection acting on a susceptible from outside the household is negligible relative to the force of infection exerted by an infectious household member. Using this we can show that, in a community of households, the number of doses of antiviral drugs dispensed per community member is
