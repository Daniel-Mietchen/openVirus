<p>When considering the results in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0017764-g006">Figure 6</xref> it is useful to keep in mind that monitoring infected households for cases is labour-intensive. In practice, monitoring more than 300 household outbreaks during the busy early stages of a pandemic would be very challenging. We would therefore like

 </inline-formula> household outbreaks has a power of at least 80% of detecting an antiviral effect if there is also a moderate effect on susceptibility, but many more households are needed if susceptibility is not reduced. Comparing curves (b) and (d), which are generated by including a moderate effect on susceptibility, illustrates that a total of
