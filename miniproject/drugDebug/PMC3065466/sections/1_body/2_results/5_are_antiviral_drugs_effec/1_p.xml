<p>The motivation to create a stockpile of antiviral drugs is based on their demonstrated effectiveness against currently circulating influenza strains. There is no guarantee that these drugs will be equally effective, or even effective at all, against a newly emerged pandemic strain of influenza. Informed decisions about the use of antiviral drugs in a pandemic require effectiveness for reducing transmission to be established from incidence data collected early in a pandemic. In preparation we need to know what data, and how much, are required to establish effectiveness. Glass and Becker 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> consider this question by estimating two specific parameters, one quantifying the effect on susceptibility and the other the effect on infectivity. Here we look at establishing effectiveness by comparing mean outbreak size in households that receive antiviral drugs early and households that receive them late. We have to allow for different household sizes. Households of size one provide no information for our comparison and we restrict attention to households of sizes two, three and four. The Australian census data indicate that the relative frequency of households of size 2, 3 and 4 is about 50%, 25% and 25%. Allowing for size-biased sampling we expect to observe roughly an equal number of outbreaks in households of size 2, 3 and 4. Accordingly, we assume that we observe
