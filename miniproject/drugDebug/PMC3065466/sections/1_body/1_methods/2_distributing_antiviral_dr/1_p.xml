<p>It is natural that individuals responsible for distributing antiviral drugs are concerned about wastage in attempts to reduce transmission, when these drugs are thought necessary to treat severe cases and to protect essential-service personnel, such as health care workers and police, 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Barnes1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Faced with competing demands it is tempting to limit community distribution of antiviral drugs to cases with laboratory-confirmed infection and individuals with confirmed exposure. Unfortunately, laboratory confirmation and contact tracing are time consuming and insistence on such confirmation makes it impossible to administer antiviral drugs quickly enough to contain transmission. A strategy of dispensing antiviral drugs quickly and liberally to household members as soon as the first household case presents seems to be what is needed. A focus on households helps to clarify who is targeted for antiviral prophylaxis and the co-location of its members makes timely dispensing to exposed individuals feasible. We therefore look at transmission in a community of households with a focus on timeliness and transmission characteristics that make containment of transmission feasible. For such a community is useful to work with the reproduction number for infected households,
