<p>To incorporate the effect of antiviral drugs on transmission into the calculation of

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e062.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> and the mean number of eventual cases, we adopt the effect formulation of Glass and Becker 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. They model the effect of antiviral drugs by a change in the population dynamics of the virus population within the host and translate this to the corresponding change in 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e063.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>, the probability that a susceptible individual avoids being infected by a single infected household member of generation 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e064.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>. Infectives of one generation are the individuals infected by the infectives of the previous generation, where household generation 0 contains only the primary household case. For our purpose we also include the corresponding effect on 
 <inline-formula>
  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e065.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>, the mean number of cases a generation-

 </inline-formula> infective generates outside their household. As in 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, individuals who are not infectives of generations 0 and 1 are assumed to receive antiviral drugs before being infected and therefore derive the full protective effect of these drugs. Then the values of the probabilities

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e067.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e068.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula>. As in 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Glass1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, we use a Reed-Frost model, 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Bailey1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pone.0017764-Becker2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, for within-household transmission with the modification that the probability of avoiding infection is generation-dependent. The 2001 Australian census data was used to allocate a distribution to household size. With these specifications we compared the value of the reproduction number

  <inline-graphic xlink:href="pone.0017764.e069.jpg" mimetype="image" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
 </inline-formula> for three different settings, namely when (i) no antiviral drugs are dispensed, (ii) doses are dispensed to household members two days after the primary case is infected, and (iii) doses are dispensed four days after the primary case is infected.
