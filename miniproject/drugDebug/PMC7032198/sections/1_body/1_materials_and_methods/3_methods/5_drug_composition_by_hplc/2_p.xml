<p id="p0070">Drug loading and drug release were measured using an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC system, which consisted of a quaternary pump, online degasser, manual injector with a 20-µl sample loop and Agilent Chemstation LC 3D software. Chromatography was conducted in reverse mode using acetonitrile and phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 5.65). A gradient at 40% for 1 min, raised to 60% in 14 min, was reduced to 40% in 1 min and held at 40% for 4 min. Total analysis time was 20 min. Mobile phase flow rate was 1.5 ml/min, with a column temperature at 30 °C and a sample injection volume of 5 µl. Detection was performed with a diode array detector at 240 nm for RTV and EFV. The drug concentration was obtained from calibration curves for RTV and EFV.</p>
