<p id="p0095">Morphology was investigated using a differential scanning calorimeter (Perkin Elmer, DSC-4000, 2013). The sample (1.5 – 3.5 mg), in an aluminum Tzero pan, was heated at a scanning rate of 10 °C/min from –85 °C to 180 °C, quenched and then heated again. Dry N
 <sub>2</sub> was used as the purge gas at 50 ml/min. The instrument was equilibrated at –85 °C. Calibration of temperature and the cell constant was performed with indium. T
 <sub>g</sub> was recorded as the mid-point of the endothermic step transition from the 2
 <sup>nd</sup> heat scan. Thermal transitions were viewed and analyzed using the analysis software Universal Analysis 2000.
