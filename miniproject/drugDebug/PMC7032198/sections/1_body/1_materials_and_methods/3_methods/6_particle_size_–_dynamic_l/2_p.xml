<p id="p0075">The particle size and polydispersity index were found with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) technique using Zetasizer (ModelZEN 3602, Malvern Corp, UK) equipped with Zetasizer software. The measurements were made at a fixed light scattering angle of 173°. Distilled water was used as the dispersing solvent for dilution before every measurement. Zeta potential measurements were also conducted in the same cuvette cells. The Smoluchowski approximation was selected as the f(Ka) parameter because particles are dispersed in aqueous medium. The temperature for all measurements was set as 25 °C. All measurements were carried out 12 times per sample.</p>
