<p id="p0085">Field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) images of the microparticles were obtained using an LEO (Zeiss) 1550 instrument at a 5 kV accelerating voltage in the conventional high vacuum mode. The microparticles were sonicated at 0.01 mg/ml in DI water. Approximately 100 µl of the prepared samples was placed on imaging tape and allowed to dry at room temperature. Samples for SEM were mounted on metal stubs and coated with gold prior to analysis.</p>
