<p id="p0055">Flash nanoprecipitation of polymer-drug complexes was performed in a four-jet Multi-Inlet Vortex Mixer that accommodates four streams, as described in our previous study 
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The polymer and drug (RTV/EFV) were dissolved in THF (organic stream), which was injected into the mixer with three other water streams. The four inlet streams were tangential to the mixing chamber and the exit stream emerged from the center of the chamber. The nanoparticles formed at a nominal Reynolds number of 5000. The injected volume ratio of THF to Millipore water was 1:10 v/v. The polymer concentration in THF was 10â€‰mg/ml. The effect of the loading of the RTV and EFV was investigated with a target loading of 25 wt% of total solids on a dry basis. The effect of drug loading on the release of drug from the polymer nanoparticles was explored.
