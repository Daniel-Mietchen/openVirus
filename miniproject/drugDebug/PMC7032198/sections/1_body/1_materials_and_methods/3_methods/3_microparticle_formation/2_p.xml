<p id="p0060">Ritonavir drug/polymer microparticles were prepared for comparison. Polymers (150 mg) in 40 ml acetone were stirred at room temperature until the polymer was completely dissolved (approximately 2 h). Ritonavir (50 mg) was added to this solution and stirred for 10 min. The acetone solution containing the dissolved polymer and drug was added dropwise to 150 ml of water. The organic solvent was removed from the resulting suspension using a rotary evaporator. The resulting aqueous solution was then freeze-dried to yield microparticles of amorphous solid dispersions of ritonavir/polymers.</p>
