<p id="p0035">Recently, cellulose esters have been shown to be very promising for oral drug delivery, due to their affinity for complexing with a variety of drugs, ability to suppress crystallization of the drugs, relatively high glass transition temperatures and biocompatibility 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. Recently, another interesting polysaccharide, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS), has been shown to have interesting properties and to form amorphous matrix formulations

 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, natural polysaccharides have not been explored as anti-HIV nanocarrier systems. In our work, for the first time, an amorphous solid dispersion of polymer-drug nanoparticles was prepared using a rapid precipitation process. It was hypothesized that the effect of synergy between ASD and particle size reduction will lead to a high release rate in the small intestine, which could further improve the solution concentration and bioavailability and reduce the required dose.
