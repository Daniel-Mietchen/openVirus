<p id="p0040">In this work, two poorly soluble antiviral drugs, ritonavir (RTV) and efavirenz (EFV), with solubility of 1.2 µg/L and 8.85 µg/L at pH 6.8, respectively, were chosen for the study. Comparatively novel cellulose acetate-based polymers were chosen to prepare the nanoparticles. All contain pendant carboxyl groups and are thus pH-sensitive and water-swellable when partially ionized at pH 6–7 but insoluble at pH ~ 3–4 
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. No previous study has reported these drugs complexed with these polysaccharides to form nanoparticles. The effect of processing conditions on the particle size and drug loading of nanoparticles of RTV and EFV, made with these polysaccharides using the flash nano-precipitation method, was investigated
