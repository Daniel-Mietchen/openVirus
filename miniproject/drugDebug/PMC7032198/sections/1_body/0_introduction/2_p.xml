<p id="p0010">Oral administration of therapeutic agents is the easiest, and often most preferred, mode of drug delivery, as there is no requirement for hospitalization that requires medical infrastructure, a critical issue in underdeveloped countries. In addition, patient compliance in taking oral medications is greater than for injected formulations
