<p id="p0020">Many polymeric materials have been used for this purpose, such as poly(lactic acid), poly(glycolic acid), polycaprolactone, polysaccharides, the poly(acrylic acid) family, proteins and polypeptides (e.g., gelatin) 
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Among these, polysaccharides are recently the most popular nanoparticle materials for drug delivery. Polysaccharides are complex carbohydrate polymers consisting of more than 2 monosaccharides linked together covalently by glycosidic linkages in a condensation reaction. Cellulose is the most abundant polysaccharide found in nature. It is a linear polymer consisting of 6-member ether rings (D-glucose or dextrose) linked together covalently by ether groups, the so-called glycosidic bonds. Usually, many thousand glucose repeat units make up a cellulose polymer. Cellulose derivatives are chosen as they are amenable to chemical modification and are biologically compatible, and particular derivatives have been shown to improve the amount of drug solubilized through stabilizing the amorphous form.
