<p id="p0185">The particle sizes were compared after each processing step to observe any significant changes in size due to individual processing steps. The particle sizes measured by DLS from all three processing steps for all drug compositions were 100–200 nm, with a polydispersity index of approximately 0.2. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> shows the particle sizes after each processing step. The particle sizes were comparable after mixing and dialysis, with a standard deviation of approximately ±30 nm. Significant agglomeration was observed during freeze-drying, as observed in the sample without cryoprotectant. Several theories have been proposed to explain this effect, such as the crystal bridge theory, capillary pressure theory, hydrogen bond theory and chemical bond theory 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>. The aggregation of particles in this work is possibly due to ice crystal formation that repels foreign particles from the interstitials. During sublimation, the ice crystals leave microscopic pores. Another cause could be the drying of water, during which loss of electrostatic stabilization leads to particle–particle aggregation. Nanoparticles may become attached as a result of hydrogen bonds and/or connecting of surface hydroxyl groups. This can be reduced by using cryoprotectors such as glucose, sucrose, trehalose and mannitol. In this study, addition of trehalose before freezing at a weight ratio trehalose:nanoparticles of 1:10 resulted in a significant reduction in particle size and polydispersity index. It was observed that higher concentrations of trehalose resulted in smaller polydispersity index (PDI) values. It is important to note that trehalose was only used for particle size experiments and not for the drug dissolution experiments.
