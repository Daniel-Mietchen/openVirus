 <xref rid="f0025" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C and 3D</xref>). The X-ray diffraction pattern for pure RTV drug showed numerous strong distinctive peaks at ~ 16°, 18°, 20°, 22° at 2θ, indicating a highly crystalline nature. The X-ray diffraction pattern for pure EFV drug also showed numerous strong distinctive peaks at 10°, 12°, 20°, 22°, 25°, 28° at 2θ, indicating its crystallinity. The polymers were amorphous in nature. Finally, the PXRD of the solid dispersions of the nanoparticles showed no diffraction peaks, indicating that they contained amorphous drug.
