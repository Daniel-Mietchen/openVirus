<p id="p0220">The solubility parameters (SP) shown in 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> dictate the relative hydrophobicities of the novel polymers. The method proposed by Fedors was used to estimate the SP 
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, which provides a numerical assessment of the intermolecular forces within a material and can be a good indication of solubility 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> . Higher SP indicates a more hydrophilic material. For hydrophobic polymers (CAP Adp 0.33, CAP Adp 0.85 and CA 320S Seb), the SP lies between 20.56–22.36 MPa
