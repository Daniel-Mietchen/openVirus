<p id="p0245">The rate of dissolution for solid drug products can be enhanced by particle size reduction, thereby increasing the surface area per unit mass available for solvation. Particle size reduction techniques are routinely used to improve the oral bioavailability of drugs with poor water solubility 
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In this study, the increase in surface area generated due to formation of nanoparticles increases dissolution and therefore potentially increases the bioavailability for drugs where exposure after oral administration is limited by dissolution rate. Drug release can be correlated to polymer solubility parameters. CAP Adp 0.33 has the lowest solubility parameter among the four cellulose derivatives studied and therefore is more hydrophobic, whereas CMCAB is comparatively more hydrophilic, as it has a higher solubility parameter and provides higher RTV solution concentrations. These polymers have been shown to be effective in inhibiting RTV recrystallization 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> . Polymers with solubility parameters between 20–23 MPa
 <sup>1/2</sup> could inhibit crystal growth in solution, whereas polymers with a solubility parameter below 20 were mostly ineffective. Hydrophobicity is likely to affect the extent of adsorption of polymer to the crystal surface, which in turn influences its effectiveness. If the polymer is very hydrophobic, it is expected to interact more favorably with other monomer units to form a more condensed globule. This globule may not adsorb onto the crystal, or if it adsorbs, may not have high surface coverage. If the polymer is very hydrophilic, it can interact more with water and comparatively less with the drug. Therefore, an optimal hydrophobicity for inhibiting crystallization may exist. Previous work has shown that ionizable carboxylic acids (evaluated by DS) are effective inhibitors of RTV crystallization 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref> . The substituent group here such butyryl, acetyl, propionate imparts amphiphilic nature to the polymer depending on the ionic groups, hydrogen bonding present in them. DS is not solely responsible for dissolution or inhibition of crystallinity, but combined factors such as hydrophobicity, rigidity and amphiphilic nature of the novel cellulose-based polymers on crystal growth inhibition. Our findings had similar characteristics in accord with previous studies.
