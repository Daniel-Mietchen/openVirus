<p id="p0240">Drug release was studied for up to five hours as shown for RTV (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6A</xref>) and EFV (
 <xref rid="f0040" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6B</xref>). CAP Adp 0.33 released approximately 20% of RTV, CAP Adp 0.85 released 27% of RTV and CA 320S Seb released 30% of RTV within five hours. There was not much difference in the release profile of EFV from the polymer. However, CMCAB showed the highest release (up to 40%) of the drugs.
