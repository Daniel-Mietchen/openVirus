<p id="p0250">The solubility characteristics and percent drug release of RTV from nanoparticles and microparticles (prepared by co-precipitation) of representative cellulose adipate derivatives (CAP Adp 0.33 and CAP Adp 0.85) are compared. The solution concentration of the drug was enhanced approximately six-fold and eight-fold for CAP Adp 0.33 and CAP Adp 0.85, respectively, compared to crystalline RTV. The solution concentration of RTV from nanoparticles was slightly higher than from corresponding microparticles, but within the margin of error.</p>
