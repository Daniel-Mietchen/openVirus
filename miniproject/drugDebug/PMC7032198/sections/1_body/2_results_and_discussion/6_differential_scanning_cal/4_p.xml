<p id="p0210">It is helpful to study the amorphous forms of the drugs (RTV and EFV) in the solid dispersions by measuring the glass transition temperature of the solid dispersion. Such measurements can establish whether the drug and polymer form a single miscible phase (i.e., a single 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> value, solid dispersion) or immiscible phases (i.e., multiple 
 <italic>T</italic>
 <sub>g</sub> values, glassy suspension)

 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> show the presence of a single glass transition temperature, suggesting that the drug and polymer formed a miscible amorphous phase. However, the glass transition temperatures of some of the drug-containing nanoparticles are similar to those of the drugs. This can pose storage problems, as it is known that storage temperatures 50 °C below the Tg reduce mobility sufficiently to allow acceptable physical stability

 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. In the absence of polymer, indomethacin recrystallized in less than six weeks at storage temperatures 20 °C below the T
 <sub>g</sub>. However, when the drug was molecularly dispersed in PVP solid dispersions, the difference between the Tg of indomethacin in the formulations and the storage temperature increased to 40–50 °C, and recrystallization of indomethacin was suppressed 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. Such low glass transitions may not be suitable for storage. Even though the nanoparticles did not show much of an increase in T
 <sub>g</sub> compared to the pure drug, they did not show phase separation in the solid state (DSC, XRD) or drug re-crystallization upon storage in three weeks before the characterizations were performed. CMCAB proved to be the best polymer for drug stabilization from recrystallization and was suitable for storage.
