 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. Glass transitions for the nanoparticles were between those of the polymers (between 105 °C–122 °C) and pure RTV (50° C) or EFV (34 °C). The intermediate T
 <sub>g</sub> suggested that the drugs were homogeneously and molecularly dispersed in the amorphous polymer matrix.
