 <xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>. Ritonavir showed a sharp melting peak at 126° C. During scanning of RTV-containing nanoparticles, no endotherm was observed near the melting point of ritonavir, indicating that ritonavir was present in an amorphous state. Similar results were obtained for polymer-EFV particles (not shown). The DSC curve with CMCAB was shown in a previous study
