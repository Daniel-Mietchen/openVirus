 <title>Graphical Abstract</title>
 <p>Polymeric nanoparticles of two poorly soluble anti-viral drugs were prepared using a rapid precipitation process. The nanoparticles are extensively characterized and the structure-property relationship is studied. These amorphous nanoparticles showed enhanced dissolution of drugs compared to their pure crystalline drugs.</p>
