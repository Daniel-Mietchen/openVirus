<p>Changes in the epidemiology of the HCV population might furthermore affect the frequency of the most relevant mechanisms of DDIs. Additionally, the individual chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of each DAA play a substantial role as well. Indeed, the present work emphasizes that the pathways involved in DDIs in the real world are distinct for each regimen. Statins interact more frequently with ELB/GRZ, and VEL-containing regimens show a majority of DDIs via pH elevation in the stomach. When looking at the newer, mainly PPI-caused mechanisms, certainly more data are needed [
