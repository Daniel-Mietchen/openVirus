<p>Our analysis demonstrates that HCV patients’ characteristics have indeed changed during the different treatment periods. The frequency of treated patients with cirrhosis has significantly decreased. In addition, the mean age of the patients decreased, but, importantly, the proportion of patients aged ≥75 years or/and with polypharmacy increased. One may assume that this is a result of treatment policy over the last years. Patients with advanced stages of liver disease were treated first at our and several other centers [

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Many of these patients were infected before the introduction of anti-HCV testing in the early 1990s. However, the most complicated cases (ie, severe contraindications, decompensated cirrhosis, and renal impairment) or those without advanced disease, and in particular those with older age, were frequently deferred [

 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As a result, the overall HCV population we are now facing in HCV therapy has been getting younger (lower likelihood for advanced liver disease). However, at the same time, the proportion of the subgroup of highly complicated patients (eg, old age, polypharmacy) has been increasing, as modern DAA regimens have significantly improved on safety and efficacy in this group [

 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35–37</xref>]. Putting the focus for example on immunosuppressive drugs, we recorded a significant increase due to new treatment options for renal transplant recipients (ie, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and elbasvir/grazoprevir). The excellent treatment options available started an intensive debate about the use of HCV-positive donor organs for HCV-negative recipients. It seems likely that the treatment of transplant recipients may remain particularly relevant in the near future [
