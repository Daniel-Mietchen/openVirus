<p>In the PEG-IFN Î±/RBV era, DDIs were of little concern. DDIs mainly emerged as a new challenge with the approval of DAAs for the treatment of HCV infection [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although this work for the first time provides extensive data on DDIs with the most recent DAA regimens, it also allows a detailed comparison between each step of HCV therapy evolution over the last years. We here show that the different DAA regimens that were used over the last decade widely differ in their general potential to cause DDIs with the outpatient medications of HCV patients. Currently, the most widely used DAAs demonstrate a moderate DDI risk profile, which is significantly lower compared with first-generation PIs used from 2011 or the combinations with ritonavir booster used from 2014 [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, our work also demonstrates that despite these advantages, the overall frequency of DDIs in the real-world analysis remained more or less stable over the treatment periods, with about 40% of HCV patients affected. Advantages in HCV therapy were accompanied by a change in the epidemiology of HCV patients, mainly due to treatment eligibility and expansion [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some of these changes (ie, higher frequency of polypharmacy) at least partly counteracted the lower potential risk for DDI with the newer DAA regimens. Thus, we conclude that DDIs remain relevant, should not be underestimated, and still need to be considered in the management of HCV patients.
