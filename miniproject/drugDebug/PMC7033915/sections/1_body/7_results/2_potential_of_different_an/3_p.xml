<p>Compared with previous treatment periods, the current most-used regimens, GLE/PIB, ELB/GRZ, VEL/SOF ± VOX, did not greatly differ in their potential for DDIs. The frequency of potential DDIs with outpatient medications ranged from 12.2% to 19.8%. Contraindications due to DDIs (category 4) appeared with up to 4.5% of the concomitant medications, up to 10.5% of the concomitant medications had a potential significant DDI (category 3) with the antivirals, and up to 5.1% showed a potential weak DDI (category 2). Overall, the potential for DDIs was lower compared with most of the older IFN-free regimens (
