<p>In the second step of our analysis, only the actually received HCV therapy and concomitant medications were considered for each patient in the assessment of DDIs: Overall, the frequency of DDIs in period B (49.6%) was significantly higher compared with periods A (37.1%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .012) and C (38.8%; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .014). A similar picture was documented when exclusively focusing on potential significant DDIs (category ≥3). Moreover, the incidence of contraindications because of DDIs (category 4) stayed constant over all periods, with a slight increase in period B (A: 3.7%, B: 4.7%, C: 3.6%; A–B 
 <italic>P</italic> = .629, B–C 
 <italic>P</italic> = .540, and A–C 
 <italic>P</italic> = .956) (
