<p>Patients with cirrhosis and those aged ≥65 years used significantly more concomitant medications (mean number of drugs, no cirrhosis vs cirrhosis: 3.2 vs 4.3, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001; &lt;65 years vs ≥65 years: 3.4 vs 5.0, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). Both of these subgroups showed an increased risk of DDIs (cirrhosis: relative risk [RR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14–1.63; age ≥65 years: RR, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.52–2.11). Among patients with cirrhosis (n = 301), 42.5% had potential significant DDIs (category 3) with the respective DAA therapy, in comparison with 28.9% of patients without cirrhosis (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The frequency of contraindicated outpatient medication was similar between both groups. Among patients with an age of 18–64 years (n = 525), 29.0% were at risk for potential significant DDIs (category 3), whereas this was the case in 56.6% and 59.1% (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001) of patients aged 65–74 and ≥75 years, respectively. The frequency of contraindicated concomitant medication was also higher in those aged ≥65 years (
