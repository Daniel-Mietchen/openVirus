<p>Overall, 668 patients were included in the analysis; 45.1% were female, and 45.1% had liver cirrhosis. The median number of drugs in the regular outpatient medication (range) was 3 (0–19). The mean age (range) was 55.5 (18–85) years. Furthermore, 44 patients (6.6%) were ≥75 years old. The mean age of the patients fluctuated over time, with a lower mean age of the patients in the most recent period (mean age in years: A: 55.3, B: 58.2, C: 52.9; A–B 
 <italic>P</italic> = .011, B–C 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, and A–C 
 <italic>P</italic> = .033). However, the proportion of patients aged ≥75 years increased from the first to the third observation period (A: 3.1%, B: 9.8%, C: 5.6%; A–B 
 <italic>P</italic> = .010, B–C 
 <italic>P</italic> = .079, and A–C 
 <italic>P</italic> = .235). Of note, the frequency of cirrhosis among the patients receiving antiviral treatment declined significantly over the years (A: 80.2%, B: 44.1%, C: 23.2%; A–B

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001, and A–C 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). In contrast, patients with kidney transplantation receiving sirolimus, everolimus, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus increased over time (A: 0.0%, B: 2.3%, C: 4.0%; A–C

Although there was no remarkable change in the median number of drugs over the different time periods (A: 3, B: 3, C: 2), we documented a numerical, continuous increase in the proportion of patients using ≥8 drugs as outpatient medications (A: 11.1%, B: 15.2%, C: 17.2%; A–B 
 <italic>P</italic> = .231, B–C 
 <italic>P</italic> = .549, and A–C
