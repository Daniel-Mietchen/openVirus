<p>Laboratory testing for albumin, bilirubin, and quick/international normalized ratio (INR) was performed due to standard procedures at Hannover Medical School. HCV genotype setting was performed with the INNO-LiPA by Innogenetics according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Liver cirrhosis in patients was calculated using transient elastography. The applied cutoff value for cirrhosis was &gt;13 kPa [
