<p>Before treatment, all patients included in this retrospective analysis were routinely asked for all their regular outpatient medication. All types of medication were documented, including over-the-counter drugs and other nonprescription drugs, herbal drugs, and nutritional supplements. Due to the fact that herbal drugs and nutritional supplements more often contain several (active) ingredients, these were only counted as 1 medication. In case of other combination preparations, for example, sitagliptin/metformin, each active ingredient was counted separately. In some cases, the regular outpatient medication was modified before treatment due to the risk of DDI with the selected DAA therapy. Concerning this matter, we included the unmodified outpatient medication in the analysis.</p>
