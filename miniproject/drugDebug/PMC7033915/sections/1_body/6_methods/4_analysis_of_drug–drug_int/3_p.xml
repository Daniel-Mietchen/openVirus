<p>Potential DDIs were assessed between all regular outpatient medications used in the total cohort and each individual antiviral that was available for the treatment of HCV infection in the last decade. Administration of a fixed-dose combination was analyzed as a single medication. The following DAAs were assessed: boceprevir (BOC), telaprevir (TVR), daclatasvir (DAC), simeprevir (SIM), sofosbuvir (SOF), ombitasvir + paritaprevir + ritonavir ± dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r ± DSV), ledipasvir (LDV) + sofosbuvir (SOF), glecaprevir (GLE) + pibrentasvir (PIB), elbasvir (ELB) + grazoprevir (GRZ), velpatasvir (VEL) + sofosbuvir (SOF) ± voxilaprevir (VOX). DAAs already withdrawn from the market (BOC, TVR, DAC, and SIM) were only analyzed to compare the frequencies of potential DDIs with the more modern regimens. In addition, DDIs were analyzed for pegylated interferon α (PEG-IFN α) and ribavirin (RBV).</p>
