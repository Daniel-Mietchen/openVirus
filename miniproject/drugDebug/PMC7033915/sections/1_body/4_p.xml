<p>Until now, almost all previous limitations of HCV treatment have been overcome. Currently available DAA regimens achieve SVR in &gt;98% of patients and are very well tolerated [
 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24–30</xref>]. It is widely believed that with today’s treatment options the risk for DDI via, for example, CYP 3A4 or P-gp is significantly lower as compared with previously used regimens. However, it has to be considered that other interaction mechanisms might have become relevant [
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, as almost all HCV patients are now eligible for the pangenotypic regimens and HCV elimination has been declared as the ultimate goal, it is to be expected that the diversity of HCV patients who receive antiviral treatment has increased over the last years. This includes patients with significant comorbidities, older age, and polypharmacy [
 <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although some studies have investigated DDIs with older DAA regimens in the past, almost no data are available regarding the relevance and most important mechanisms of DDIs when using the most modern DAA regimens. Furthermore, no study has addressed how the changes in the HCV-infected and -treated populations, which were accompanied by rapid improvements in HCV therapy, affected the risk for significant DDIs.
