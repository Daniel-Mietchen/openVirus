Since then, HCV therapy and the infected population have rapidly changed. So far, very limited data are available regarding the clinical relevance of DDIs when using most modern DAA regimens. We aimed to assess how the importance of DDIs has evolved over time.</p></sec><sec id="s0101"><title>Methods</title><p>From January 2014 to July 2018, 668 consecutive HCV patients were evaluated for their outpatient medication and assessed for DDIs with DAAs. Different time periods were defined based on market approval of key DAAs: A (01/2014&#x02013;11/2014), B (11/2014&#x02013;08/2016), and C (08/2016&#x02013;07/2018).</p></sec><sec id="s0102"><title>Results</title><p>The frequency of patients with real-world DDIs was highest in period B (A: 37.1%, B: 49.6%, C: 38.8%). The recently approved DAAs (period C) theoretically showed a lower DDI risk profile. However, real-world DDIs were still comparable to period A, as HCV patients&#x02019; characteristics changed (eg, age&#x02005;&#x02265;75 years: A: 3.1%, B: 9.8%, C: 5.6%; polypharmacy/patients with&#x02005;&#x02265;8 drugs: A: 11.1%, B: 15.2%, C: 17.2%). Furthermore, although DDIs via CYP 3A4 became less important for some modern regimens, other mechanisms like an altered pH value in the stomach, causing reduced bioavailability, evolved. Relevant DDIs most frequently occurred with proton pump inhibitors, metamizole, statins, and carvedilol.</p></sec><sec id="s0103"><title>Conclusions</title><p>DDIs during antiviral treatment still affect about 40% of HCV patients.

Currently the World Health Organization (WHO) is calling for a reduction of new infections by 90% and mortality by 65% by 2030, with the ultimate aim of HCV elimination [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This ambitious goal is driven by the tremendous improvements in HCV therapy that have been achieved due to the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs).</p><p>The first DAAs, the protease inhibitors (PIs) boceprevir (BOC) and telaprevir (TVR), were approved in 2011 but had several limitations. Both PIs were accompanied by considerable adverse events like anemia or skin rash; their usage was mainly restricted to HCV genotype 1, and their efficacy was rather limited [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref>]. Combination with pegylated interferon &#x003b1; (PEG-IFN &#x003b1;) was still required [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, a significant proportion of patients (eg, those with advanced cirrhosis, significant comorbidities) were not eligible for therapy, and many of those with mild disease chose to defer treatment [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7&#x02013;9</xref>]. Furthermore, drug&#x02013;drug interactions (DDIs) emerged as a new important challenge [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. BOC and TVR are substrates and inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 pathways that are frequently involved in DDIs [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>In various fields of medicine, DDIs are a common but often neglected cause of drug-associated adverse events. In general, ~1% of all hospital admissions are caused by DDIs, with a higher risk in patients on polypharmacy [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].</p><p>Since 2011, several new DAAs have been developed. Approval of the polymerase inhibitor sofosbuvir (SOF) in January 2014 allowed for IFN-free therapy, which facilitated treatment eligibility [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In 2014&#x02013;2015, the first fixed-dose combination of SOF and the NS5A inhibitor ledipasvir (LDV) was approved, as well as the combination of omb-itasvir&#x02005;+&#x02005;paritaprevir&#x02005;+&#x02005;ritonavir&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;dasabuvir (OBV/PTV/r&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;DSV), which increased the rates of sustained virological response (SVR) [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref>]. However, DDIs still had to be considered, especially in the ritonavir-based regimen [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref>]. When looking at ritonavir in particular, a strong inhibition of CYP 3A4 affects the metabolism of various concomitant medications, leading to multiple clinical relevant DDIs. Finally, in 2016&#x02013;2017, velpatasvir&#x02005;+&#x02005;sofosbuvir (VEL/SOF), elbasvir&#x02005;+&#x02005;grazoprevir (ELB/GRZ), glecaprevir&#x02005;+&#x02005;pibrentasvir (GLE/PIB), and velpatasvir&#x02005;+&#x02005;sofosbuvir&#x02005;+&#x02005;voxilaprevir (VEL/SOF/VOX) were marketed, which resulted in further improvements such as pangenotypic efficacy and the re-treatment of DAA failures [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;30</xref>].</p><p>Until now, almost all previous limitations of HCV treatment have been overcome. Currently available DAA regimens achieve SVR in&#x02005;&#x0003e;98% of patients and are very well tolerated [<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24&#x02013;30</xref>]. It is widely believed that with today&#x02019;s treatment options the risk for DDI via, for example, CYP 3A4 or P-gp is significantly lower as compared with previously used regimens. However, it has to be considered that other interaction mechanisms might have become relevant [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Furthermore, as almost all HCV patients are now eligible for the pangenotypic regimens and HCV elimination has been declared as the ultimate goal, it is to be expected that the diversity of HCV patients who receive antiviral treatment has increased over the last years. This includes patients with significant comorbidities, older age, and polypharmacy [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although some studies have investigated DDIs with older DAA regimens in the past, almost no data are available regarding the relevance and most important mechanisms of DDIs when using the most modern DAA regimens. Furthermore, no study has addressed how the changes in the HCV-infected and -treated populations, which were accompanied by rapid improvements in HCV therapy, affected the risk for significant DDIs.</p><p>The aim of this work was to analyze the relevance and most frequent mechanisms of DDIs in the rapidly changing field of HCV therapy. A particular focus was put on the current situation using the most modern DAA regimens in the remaining HCV population.</p><sec sec-type="materials" id="s1"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Cohort</title><p>Overall, 668 consecutive patients with chronic HCV infection who were treated with a DAA regimen at the hepatitis outpatient clinic of Hannover Medical School from January 2014 to July 2018 were included. To analyze the changing epidemiology and frequency of potential DDIs within the evolving field of DAA therapies, 3 different time periods were defined based on the approval of key DAA regimens that significantly changed HCV therapy at our center: (A) January 22, 2014 (first patient treated with SOF, and therefore IFN-free therapy became available), to November 28, 2014; (B) November 29, 2014 (first patient treated with LDV/SOF or OBV/PTV/r&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;DSV, and therefore fixed-dose regimens became available), to August 14, 2016; and (C) August 15, 2016 (first patient treated with velpatasvir [VEL], elbasvir/grazoprevir [ELB/GRZ], or glecaprevir/pibrentasvir [GLE/PIB], and therefore pangenotypic therapies as well as highly effective re-treatment options became available), to July 31, 2018.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Assessment of Baseline Characteristics and Patients&#x02019; Regular Outpatient Medications</title><p>Laboratory testing for albumin, bilirubin, and quick/international normalized ratio (INR) was performed due to standard procedures at Hannover Medical School. HCV genotype setting was performed with the INNO-LiPA by Innogenetics according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Liver cirrhosis in patients was calculated using transient elastography. The applied cutoff value for cirrhosis was&#x02005;&#x0003e;13 kPa [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In case of failed transient elastography, additional clinical and laboratory parameters (ie, albumin, bilirubin, quick, INR, sonographic proof of ascites, and stage of encephalopathy) were used to determine the stage of liver cirrhosis.</p><p>Before treatment, all patients included in this retrospective analysis were routinely asked for all their regular outpatient medication. All types of medication were documented, including over-the-counter drugs and other nonprescription drugs, herbal drugs, and nutritional supplements. Due to the fact that herbal drugs and nutritional supplements more often contain several (active) ingredients, these were only counted as 1 medication. In case of other combination preparations, for example, sitagliptin/metformin, each active ingredient was counted separately. In some cases, the regular outpatient medication was modified before treatment due to the risk of DDI with the selected DAA therapy. Concerning this matter, we included the unmodified outpatient medication in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Evaluation of Drug&#x02013;Drug Interactions</title><p>DDIs were evaluated using <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hep-druginteractions.org">www.hep-druginteractions.org</ext-link> (as of July 2019). In case of missing information, a clinical pharmacist and clinical pharmacologist were consulted. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between the antiviral substances and the regular outpatient medications were considered.

When examining the different time periods in detail, it became obvious that in every treatment period DAAs with a considerable potential for DDIs were to be found. As expected, the first-wave PIs BOC and TVR had much higher potential for DDIs, affecting 37.1% and 36.3% of outpatient medications, respectively. In the following period, starting with the approval of SOF, the potential for DDIs widely differed between the individual drugs that were available. SOF, SIM, and DAC showed potential for DDIs with 2.8%, 25.2%, and 12.5% of the outpatient medication, respectively. Risk for DDIs increased in the era of the first DAA fixed-dose combinations.

The frequency of potential DDIs with outpatient medications ranged from 12.2% to 19.8%. Contraindications due to DDIs (category 4) appeared with up to 4.5% of the concomitant medications, up to 10.5% of the concomitant medications had a potential significant DDI (category 3) with the antivirals, and up to 5.1% showed a potential weak DDI (category 2).

More precise information on relevant DDIs and their respective mechanisms can be found in the Supplementary Data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Table 7</xref>).</p><p>DDIs between regular outpatient medications and specific antiviral regimens were not uniform, but were dependent on the possible interaction mechanisms of each antiviral regimen and the concomitant medication. Overall, compared with the older regimens, interactions with the most modern DAAs were less frequently caused by CYP and P-gp pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). GLE/PIB (n&#x02005;=&#x02005;46) DDIs were distributed between DDIs facilitated by organic anion transporting protein (OATP; 23.5%), pH-change (15.7%), P-gp (27.5%), and the CYP pathways (27.5%). ELB/GRZ (n&#x02005;=&#x02005;73) interactions were mediated via CYP enzymes (49.0%) and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; 27.5%) most of the time. This was mainly caused by interactions with statins. Some statins are metabolized by CYP enzymes and may also be transported via OATP1B1/3 and/or BCRP. ELB/GRZ is a weak CYP 3A inhibitor in vivo and blocks intestinal BCRP. Concomitant use may cause higher statin blood levels, and the risk for adverse events like rhabdomyolysis increases. In contrast to that, VEL/SOF&#x02005;&#x000b1;&#x02005;VOX (without VOX: n&#x02005;=&#x02005;58; with VOX: n&#x02005;=&#x02005;9) interactions, in &#x0003e;50% of cases (VEL/SOF: 56.8%; VEL/SOF&#x02005;+&#x02005;VOX: 60.0%), were due to a PPI increasing gastric pH, thereby causing lower absorption rates of mainly VEL.

DDIs mainly emerged as a new challenge with the approval of DAAs for the treatment of HCV infection [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although this work for the first time provides extensive data on DDIs with the most recent DAA regimens, it also allows a detailed comparison between each step of HCV therapy evolution over the last years. We here show that the different DAA regimens that were used over the last decade widely differ in their general potential to cause DDIs with the outpatient medications of HCV patients. Currently, the most widely used DAAs demonstrate a moderate DDI risk profile, which is significantly lower compared with first-generation PIs used from 2011 or the combinations with ritonavir booster used from 2014 [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, our work also demonstrates that despite these advantages, the overall frequency of DDIs in the real-world analysis remained more or less stable over the treatment periods, with about 40% of HCV patients affected. Advantages in HCV therapy were accompanied by a change in the epidemiology of HCV patients, mainly due to treatment eligibility and expansion [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Some of these changes (ie, higher frequency of polypharmacy) at least partly counteracted the lower potential risk for DDI with the newer DAA regimens. Thus, we conclude that DDIs remain relevant, should not be underestimated, and still need to be considered in the management of HCV patients.</p><p>Our analysis demonstrates that HCV patients&#x02019; characteristics have indeed changed during the different treatment periods. The frequency of treated patients with cirrhosis has significantly decreased. In addition, the mean age of the patients decreased, but, importantly, the proportion of patients&#x02005;aged &#x02265;75 years or/and with polypharmacy increased. One may assume that this is a result of treatment policy over the last years. Patients with advanced stages of liver disease were treated first at our and several other centers [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Many of these patients were infected before the introduction of anti-HCV testing in the early 1990s. However, the most complicated cases (ie, severe contraindications, decompensated cirrhosis, and renal impairment) or those without advanced disease, and in particular those with older age, were frequently deferred [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. As a result, the overall HCV population we are now facing in HCV therapy has been getting younger (lower likelihood for advanced liver disease). However, at the same time, the proportion of the subgroup of highly complicated patients (eg, old age, polypharmacy) has been increasing, as modern DAA regimens have significantly improved on safety and efficacy in this group [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35&#x02013;37</xref>]. Putting the focus for example on immunosuppressive drugs, we recorded a significant increase due to new treatment options for renal transplant recipients (ie, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir and elbasvir/grazoprevir). The excellent treatment options available started an intensive debate about the use of HCV-positive donor organs for HCV-negative recipients. It seems likely that the treatment of transplant recipients may remain particularly relevant in the near future [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These patients often receive highly complex polypharmacy with the immunosuppressive drugs (ie, sirolimus, everolimus, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus) themselves being potential partners for relevant DDIs [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Changes in the epidemiology of the HCV population might furthermore affect the frequency of the most relevant mechanisms of DDIs. Additionally, the individual chemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics of each DAA play a substantial role as well. Indeed, the present work emphasizes that the pathways involved in DDIs in the real world are distinct for each regimen. Statins interact more frequently with ELB/GRZ, and VEL-containing regimens show a majority of DDIs via pH elevation in the stomach. When looking at the newer, mainly PPI-caused mechanisms, certainly more data are needed [<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Due to the variety of DAAs available, DDI assessment has become more complex.</p><p>Individualized management, especially in complex patients, remains highly important. However, it also has to be noted that strict contraindications due to DDIs were quite rare when using modern DAAs and the remaining significant DDIs seemed very manageable by dose modifications or monitoring interventions. First of all, awareness of DDIs still represents the most important step. Tools like <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hep-druginteractions.org">www.hep-druginteractions.org</ext-link> provide the involved health care professionals with reliable resources to identify and handle potential DDIs.</p><p>The present work has some limitations. First, it is a single-center analysis from a tertiary referral center. Thus, a higher frequency of patients with more advanced liver disease is likely, as indicated by the higher-than-average rate of patients with cirrhosis. However, it should be noted that it was not patients with cirrhosis but rather elderly patients who showed a comparably higher risk for DDIs, as shown in our analysis and as previously reported [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Second, with the restrictions for elderly patients for clinical trials and the low likelihood for liver transplantation, we would not expect that elderly patients were over-represented in our institution. The same affects patients with current intravenous drug use (PWID). For PWID, we would rather quote that they were under-represented due to the fact that active drug users are more frequently treated at other centers. Third, under-reporting of concomitant medication and nonadherence to recommendations on DDI management cannot be excluded, as the collection of medication data was based on patient self-report and letters of referral from physicians. Additionally, physicians may have changed the concomitant medication in anticipation of antiviral therapy. Therefore, we tracked changes to the concomitant medication back before initiation of antiviral therapy to include any changes due to suspected DDI.</p><p>Further research on DDIs in HCV therapy will be required to ensure a safe upscaling of HCV treatments, which is essential to meet World Health Organization goals and ultimately achieve HCV elimination. The HCV population will certainly see further changes over the next years that will affect the risk for DDIs, as well as the most relevant drugs and mechanisms involved. Unrestricted treatment of high-risk populations like PWID will require general considerations and strategies for how to handle the most relevant potential DDIs in this specific group, as adequate monitoring during therapy might not always be possible.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first work that assesses the risk of DDIs with various regimens in various time periods and also the first that considers the most recent DAA regimens as well as relevant DDI mechanisms. It shows that despite improved newer antiviral regimens, the frequency of significant real-world DDIs in a changing epidemiology of HCV patients has not declined, but remained stable. Therefore, careful assessment of patients&#x02019; regular outpatient medications and individual evaluation for potential DDIs seem as important as ever.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s14"><title>Supplementary Data</title><p>Supplementary materials are available at <italic>Open Forum Infectious Diseases</italic> online.
