<p id="para0003">Regarding viruses, for reasons probably partly identical involving alkalinisation by chloroquine of the phagolysosome, several studies have shown the effectiveness of this molecule, including against coronaviruses among which is the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated coronavirus 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0013" ref-type="bibr">13]</xref> (
 <xref rid="tbl0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). We previously emphasised interest in chloroquine for the treatment of viral infections in this journal 
 <xref rid="bib0001" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, predicting its use in viral infections lacking drugs. Following the discovery in China of the in vitro activity of chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2, discovered during culture tests on Vero E6 cells with 50% and 90% effective concentrations (EC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>90</sub> values) of 1.13 μM and 6.90 μM, respectively (antiviral activity being observed when addition of this drug was carried out before or after viral infection of the cells) 
 <xref rid="bib0003" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, we awaited with great interest the clinical data 
 <xref rid="bib0014" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. The subsequent in vivo data were communicated following the first results of clinical trials by Chinese teams 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref> and also aroused great enthusiasm among us. They showed that chloroquine could reduce the length of hospital stay and improve the evolution of COVID-19 pneumonia 
 <xref rid="bib0004" ref-type="bibr">[4</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0006" ref-type="bibr">6]</xref>, leading to recommend the administration of 500 mg of chloroquine twice a day in patients with mild, moderate and severe forms of COVID-19 pneumonia. At such a dosage, a therapeutic concentration of chloroquine might be reached. With our experience on 2000 dosages of hydroxychloroquine during the past 5 years in patients with long-term treatment (&gt;1 year), we know that with a dosage of 600 mg/day we reach a concentration of 1 μg/mL 
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The optimal dosage for SARS-CoV-2 is an issue that will need to be assessed in the coming days. For us, the activity of hydroxychloroquine on viruses is probably the same as that of chloroquine since the mechanism of action of these two molecules is identical, and we are used to prescribe for long periods hydroxychloroquine, which would be therefore our first choice in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. For optimal treatment, it may be necessary to administer a loading dose followed by a maintenance dose.
