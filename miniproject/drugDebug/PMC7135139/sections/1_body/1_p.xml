<p id="para0002">There is a strong rationality for the use of chloroquine to treat infections with intracellular micro-organisms. Thus, malaria has been treated for several decades with this molecule 
 <xref rid="bib0007" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. In addition, our team has used hydroxychloroquine for the first time for intracellular bacterial infections since 30 years to treat the intracellular bacterium 
 <italic>Coxiella burnetii</italic>, the agent of Q fever, for which we have shown in vitro and then in patients that this compound is the only one efficient for killing these intracellular pathogens 
 <xref rid="bib0008" ref-type="bibr">[8</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0009" ref-type="bibr">9]</xref>. Since then, we have also shown the activity of hydroxychloroquine on 
 <italic>Tropheryma whipplei</italic>, the agent of Whipple's disease, which is another intracellular bacterium for which hydroxychloroquine has become a reference drug 
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">[10</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0011" ref-type="bibr">11]</xref>. Altogether, one of us (DR) has treated ~4000 cases of 
 <italic>C. burnetii</italic> or 
 <italic>T. whipplei</italic> infections over 30 years (personal data).
