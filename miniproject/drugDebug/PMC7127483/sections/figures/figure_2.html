 <caption> The protein–protein interaction network between ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV infection-associated proteins, and the topological analysis of these proteins. (A) The protein–protein interaction network between ASFV-interacting swine proteins (AIPs) and ASFV infection-associated proteins (AAPs). (B–D) Distribution of the betweenness centrality, degree and shortest path length for all proteins (ALL), ASFV-interacting swine proteins (AIPs) and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins (AAPs) in the swine protein–protein interaction network. </caption>
