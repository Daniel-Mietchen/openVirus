 <caption> Predicted drugs targeting the ASFV-interacting swine proteins (AIPs) and ASFV proteins. The interactions above and below the dotted line referred to those between drugs and ASFV-interacting swine proteins, and those between drugs and ASFV proteins, respectively. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins were represented as red and cyan circles, respectively. Drugs of protein or peptide, and those of small molecule, were represented as squares and ellipses, respectively. Drugs in the stage of approved, investigational and experimental were colored in orange, purple and light green, respectively. Drugs which specifically targeted one ASFV-interacting swine protein were highlighted in black-edge. Two drugs which targeted both the ASFV-interacting swine protein and ASFV protein were highlighted in red-edge. </caption>
