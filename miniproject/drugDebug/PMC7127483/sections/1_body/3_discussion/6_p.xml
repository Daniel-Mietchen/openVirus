<p>There were two limitations to this study. Firstly, the protein–protein interactions between swine and ASFV are far from complete. The ASFV encodes more than 150 proteins (
 <xref rid="ref-49" ref-type="bibr">Rodríguez &amp; Salas, 2013</xref>). Only 16 of them were involved in the protein–protein interactions analyzed here. Much more efforts are needed to generate a comprehensive protein–protein interaction network between swine and ASFV. Fortunately, based on the limited protein–protein interactions between swine and ASFV, several antiviral drugs were predicted and had the potential for further development. Secondly, the drugs predicted here need further experimental validations. Several drugs with high specificity on ASFV-interacting swine proteins, or with broad-spectrum effect, such as Polaprezinc and Geldanamycin, could be prioritized for validation.
