<p>Most antiviral drugs target the viral proteins. Drug resistance frequently appears due to rapid mutation of viruses. On the contrary, the drugs targeting the host protein may have the advantage of stable effect since the host proteins generally evolve far slower than viral proteins (

 <xref rid="ref-57" ref-type="bibr">Tavassoli, 2011</xref>). Besides, some host proteins may interact with multiple viruses, such as HSP90AB1 mentioned above. The drugs targeting them may have broad-spectrum antiviral effect. Bioinformatics analysis of the accumulated protein–protein interactions between virus and host cell can facilitate the identification host proteins which are vital for viral infection. As the accumulation of protein–protein interactions and the rapid development of bioinformatics methods, several antiviral molecules with reduced side effects have been proposed and validated (

The ASFV-interacting swine proteins could be taken as potential antiviral-drug targets. The candidate drugs identified here may facilitate further development of effective drugs against the virus.
