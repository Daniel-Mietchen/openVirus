<p>Both the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were enriched in the functions of cell death, apoptosis or necroptosis. This suggested that these processes may play an important role in viral infections. Previous studies have shown that ASFV infection induced TNF-alpha production which further induced apoptosis in the infected cell (

It encodes several anti-apoptotic proteins such as A179L and A224L to delay the execution step of the apoptotic pathway. The virus also has the capacity of regulating the unfolded protein response to prevent early apoptosis and ensure viral replication (
