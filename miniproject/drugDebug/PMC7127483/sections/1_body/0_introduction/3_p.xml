<p>Although most antiviral drugs target the viral proteins, in recent years several studies have attempted to develop antiviral drugs which targeted the host proteins (

 <xref rid="ref-61" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Compared to the drugs which target viral proteins, the drugs targeting host proteins have more targets in the host cell since the number of host proteins is much larger than that of viral proteins. Besides, they may be more mutant-insensitive since the host proteins evolve much slower than viral proteins (

 <xref rid="ref-50" ref-type="bibr">Rozenblatt-Rosen et al., 2012</xref>). With the rapid development of high-throughput assays, a large amount of protein–protein interactions between virus and host has been accumulated. Analysis of these protein–protein interactions in the perspective of network can help identify host proteins of importance for viral infection, which could be taken as potential targets for antiviral research (

 <xref rid="ref-30" ref-type="bibr">Han et al. (2017)</xref> predicted several antiviral drugs against human enterovirus 71 by systematic identification and analysis of protein–protein interactions between the virus and the host, suggesting the important role of protein–protein interaction analysis on developing antiviral drugs targeting host proteins.
