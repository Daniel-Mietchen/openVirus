<p>Vaccine and antiviral drugs are believed to be the best tool for prevention and control of viral infection and spread (
 <xref rid="ref-41" ref-type="bibr">Monto, 2006</xref>). Unfortunately, all the attempts to develop effective vaccines against ASFVs had failed (
 <xref rid="ref-54" ref-type="bibr">Sánchez, Pérez-Núñez &amp; Revilla, 2019</xref>). In the absence of vaccines against ASFVs, the antiviral drugs could not only improve host survival, but also help control the epidemic area (
 <xref rid="ref-63" ref-type="bibr">Zakaryan &amp; Revilla, 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is in great need to develop effective antiviral drugs against ASFVs. Several studies have identified multiple compounds which could inhibit ASFV infections. They could be classified into two groups (
 <xref rid="ref-6" ref-type="bibr">Arabyan et al., 2019</xref>). The first group of antiviral drugs has identified targets and known mechanisms, and includes five kinds of drugs: (i) nucleoside analogs, such as iododeoxyuridine (
 <xref rid="ref-26" ref-type="bibr">Gil-Fernández et al., 1979</xref>), (S)-HPMPA (
 <xref rid="ref-25" ref-type="bibr">Gil-Fernández et al., 1987</xref>) and Rigid amphipathic fusion inhibitors (
 <xref rid="ref-29" ref-type="bibr">Hakobyan et al., 2018</xref>); (ii) interferons (IFNs) and small peptides, such as IFN-alpha (
 <xref rid="ref-44" ref-type="bibr">Paez, Garcia &amp; Fernandez, 1990</xref>), IFN-gamma (
 <xref rid="ref-17" ref-type="bibr">Esparza, González &amp; Viñuela, 1988</xref>) and small peptide inhibitors which could disrupt the interaction between cytoplasmic dynein and viral p54 protein (
 <xref rid="ref-33" ref-type="bibr">Hernáez et al., 2010</xref>); (iii) plant-derived compounds, such as genistein (
 <xref rid="ref-5" ref-type="bibr">Arabyan et al., 2018</xref>) and genkwanin (
 <xref rid="ref-28" ref-type="bibr">Hakobyan et al., 2019</xref>). The former interferes with viral type II topoisomerase and the latter disrupts the virus movement along microtubules; (iv) antibiotics, such as Rifampicin (
 <xref rid="ref-15" ref-type="bibr">Dardiri, Bachrach &amp; Heller, 1971</xref>) and fluoroquinolone (
 <xref rid="ref-19" ref-type="bibr">Freitas et al., 2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="ref-42" ref-type="bibr">Mottola et al., 2013</xref>). They inhibit viral DNA-dependent RNA polymerase and type II topoisomerases, respectively; (v) small interfering RNA and CRISPR/Cas9. For example, some siRNAs (
 <xref rid="ref-36" ref-type="bibr">Keita, Heath &amp; Albina, 2010</xref>) which targeted viral genes such as A151R and B646L could significantly reduce the virus titer and RNA transcripts. The other group of antiviral drugs have unknown targets and unknown mechanism, such as Apigenin (
 <xref rid="ref-27" ref-type="bibr">Hakobyan et al., 2016</xref>), resveratrol (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Galindo et al., 2011</xref>) and oxyresveratrol (
 <xref rid="ref-23" ref-type="bibr">Galindo et al., 2011</xref>). However, all the antiviral drugs mentioned above have not been taken forward for commercial production. More candidate drugs are needed for further development.
