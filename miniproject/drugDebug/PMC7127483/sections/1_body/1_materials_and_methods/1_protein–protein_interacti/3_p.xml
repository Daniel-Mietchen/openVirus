<p>Thirdly, three protein–protein interactions between ASFV and swine proteins were inferred based on sequence homology. This was conducted by firstly collecting viral proteins (except the ASFV) which interacted with swine proteins based on the database of Viruses.STRING. Then, 159 ASFV proteins encoded by BA71V, which were downloaded from NCBI RefSeq database (
 <xref rid="ref-45" ref-type="bibr">Pruitt, Tatusova &amp; Maglott, 2005</xref>), were blast (
 <xref rid="ref-4" ref-type="bibr">Altschul et al., 1990</xref>) against these viral proteins. The hits with 
 <italic>e</italic>-value smaller than 0.001, coverage greater than 40%, and sequence identity greater than 30%, were considered as homologs of ASFV proteins. The swine proteins which interacted with the hits were predicted to interact with the ASFV proteins. The obtained three protein–protein interactions overlapped with those from Viruses.STRING (
