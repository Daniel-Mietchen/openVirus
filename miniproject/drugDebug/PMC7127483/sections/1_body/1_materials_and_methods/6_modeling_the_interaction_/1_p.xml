<p>The 3D structure of swine HSP90AB1 was predicted using homology modeling method (
 <xref rid="ref-18" ref-type="bibr">Eswar et al., 2006</xref>). The modeling template was the crystal structure of the Geldanamycin-binding domain of a heat shock protein 90-alpha (HSP90AA1) from 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (PDB code: 1YET). Sequence alignment showed that the identity between swine HSP90AB1 and human HSP90AA1 was 92.3% in the Geldanamycin-binding domain (208 residues). Besides, only amino acid substitutions but no gaps were observed in the alignment. The highly similar and gap-free alignment indicated that the predicted structure is reliable. In addition, 1YET is the complex structure of Geldanamycin and HSP90AA1, which allowed us to transfer the binding conformation of Geldanamycin from 1YET to the predicted structure of swine HSP90AB1. To validate the binding conformation between Geldanamycin and swine HSP90AB1, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed for 10 ns using GROMACS (
