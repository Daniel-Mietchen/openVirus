<p>We also predicted drugs targeting the ASFV proteins. Twenty-nine small molecules were predicted to target 10 ASFV proteins. Among them, both the proteins of F778R and A240L were targeted by eight drugs. However, these ten ASFV proteins were not involved in the proteinâ€“protein interactions between ASFV and swine. Interestingly, the Gallium nitrate (DrugBank ID: DB05260), a drug used for treating hyper-calcemia and Rifabutin (DrugBank ID: DB00615), a antibiotic with potent antimycobacterial properties, were observed to both target the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV proteins. Both of them (highlighted in red-edge) were approved for use, suggesting their potential use for treating the ASFVs.</p>
