<p>The wide involvement of ASFV-interacting swine proteins in protein–protein interactions between swine and multiple viruses, and the central role of ASFV-interacting swine proteins in swine protein–protein interaction network, suggested the possibility of their use as broad-spectrum host-dependent antiviral drug targets. Therefore, we attempted to predict drugs targeting the ASFV-interacting swine proteins with the help of DrugBank (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-5">Table S3</xref>). As was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig-5">Fig. 5A</xref> total of 142 drugs (in ellipse or square) were predicted to target 21 ASFV-interacting swine proteins (pink circles). Most of the drugs were small molecules (colored ellipses); the other drugs were protein or peptide (colored squares). Some ASFV-interacting swine proteins were targeted by multiple drugs, such as the heat shock protein 90 alpha family class A member 1 (HSP90AA1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). HSP90AA1 was targeted by more than 30 drugs, most of which were small molecules and were in experimental; while TNF were also targeted by more than 30 drugs, most of which were approved or investigational.
