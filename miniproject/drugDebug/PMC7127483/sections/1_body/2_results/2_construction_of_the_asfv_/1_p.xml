<p>To investigate the role of ASFV-interacting swine proteins in the swine, a swine protein–protein interaction network was constructed from the STRING database, which contained 731,174 non-redundant protein–protein interactions between 18,683 swine proteins. 35 (94%) ASFV-interacting swine proteins were found to interact with 4,184 other swine proteins. The latter 4,184 swine proteins were defined as ASFV infection-associated swine proteins. The ASFV-interacting swine proteins together with ASFV infection-associated swine proteins formed a protein interaction network with 9,305 non-redundant interactions (
