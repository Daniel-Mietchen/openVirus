<p>Since the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins were observed to play a central role in swine protein–protein interaction network, we next investigated their functions. Functional enrichment analysis was conducted on the ASFV-interacting swine proteins and ASFV infection-associated swine proteins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S2</xref>). Only a few GO terms in the domain of Molecular Function were enriched. Interestingly, nearly 50 KEGG pathways were enriched in the ASFV-interacting swine proteins (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp-4">Table S2</xref>). The pathways of Necroptosis and Alcoholism were two of the most enriched pathways, both of which included more than 20% of all ASFV-interacting swine proteins. Besides, three pathways related to virus infection, such as “Herpes simplex virus 1 infection”, were also enriched.
