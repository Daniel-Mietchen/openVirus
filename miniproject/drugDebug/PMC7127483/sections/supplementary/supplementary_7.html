 <caption> Binding energy of receptor-ligand complex for the template (A) and modeled complex between Geldanamycin and swine HSP90AB1 (B) during MD simulations (10 ns). ΔE vdw refer to Van der Waal energy, ΔE elec refer to electrostatic energy, ΔE mm refer to total potential energy between the protein and ligand (ΔE mm = ΔE vdw + ΔE elec), ΔE pol refer to polar solvation energy, ΔE apol refer to non-polar solvation energy and ΔE binding refer to the total binding energy (ΔE binding = ΔE mm + ΔE pol + ΔE apol). </caption>
