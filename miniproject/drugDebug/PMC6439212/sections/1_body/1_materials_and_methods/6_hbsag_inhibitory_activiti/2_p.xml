<p id="p0045">The HepG2.2.15 cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96 well plates (0.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well in triplicate) and incubated overnight. Based on the cytotoxicity results, and previously reported assays, the treatment dose of 10 μg/ml was chosen for all pure compounds in anti-HBV experiments. Lamivudine (2 μM) prepared in DMSO and RMPI, was included as positive control (

 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">Arbab et al., 2017</xref>). Culture supernatants were replaced with fresh dose every alternate day and samples collected on day 1, 3, and 5 were saved at −20 °C. The viral HBsAg production in the culture supernatant was analyzed using Monolisa HBsAg ULTRA Elisa Kit (BioRad, USA) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. All data were presented as % inhibition of HBsAg expression in relation to the untreated control. The experiment was repeated to confirm the reproducibility.
