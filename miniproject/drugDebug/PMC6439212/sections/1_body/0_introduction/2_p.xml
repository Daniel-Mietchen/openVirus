 <xref rid="b0240" ref-type="bibr">Teo and Locarnini, 2010</xref>). Of these, an estimated 240 million individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) live in high to moderate endemic regions in Asia, sub-Sharan Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America (
 <xref rid="b0260" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 2017</xref>). HBV is the smallest known DNA virus with a circular, double-stranded genome (∼3.2 kb) having four overlapped open reading frames encoding surface or envelope (S), core (C), pre-core (pre-C/e), polymerase/reverse-transcriptase (Pol/RT) and X proteins (
