<p id="p0225">In the present study, our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> anti-HBV assessment of plant-derived non-cytotoxic compounds showed promising inhibitory effects on HBsAg and HBeAg expressions. Of these, quercetin, baccatin III, psoralen, embelin, menisdaurin and azadirachtin showed high anti-HBV activity whereas lupeol, rutin, Î²-sitosterol and hesperidin had moderate effects. Moreover, a combination of quercetin with highly active compounds enhanced the therapeutic efficacy. This was further supported by 
 <italic>in silico</italic> molecular docking analysis where all tested anti-HBV molecules strongly interacted with the modeled HBV Pol active site residues. Taken together, our data suggested the novel anti-HBV potential of these natural compounds as viral pol/RT-inhibitors. Nonetheless, further experimental and pre-clinical studies on the most active compounds are warranted.
