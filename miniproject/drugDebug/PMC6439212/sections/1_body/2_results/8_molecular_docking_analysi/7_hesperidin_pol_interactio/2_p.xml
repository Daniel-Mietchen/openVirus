 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>E) interacted with HBV Pol by forming seven hydrogen bonds with Glu39, Ser40, Ser85 and Ser117, and one carbon hydrogen bond with His156 (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>E). It also formed two Pi-Pi stacked hydrophobic interactions with Trp3, one alkyl hydrophobic interaction with Leu147 and one Pi-alkyl hydrophobic interaction with Ala86. Other residues that surrounded hesperidin were Glu1, Asp2, Gly4, Pro5, Arg15, Ala86, Asn118, Ser119, Arg120, Leu147, Arg153, His156, Leu157 and Tyr158. The Gibb's free energy of hesperidin-HBV Pol interaction was predicted to be −9.3 kcal/mol, corresponding to a binding constant of 6.6 × 10
