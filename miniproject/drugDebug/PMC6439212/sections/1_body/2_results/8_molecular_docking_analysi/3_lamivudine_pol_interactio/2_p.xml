 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>A) is the first generation nucleot(s)ide-based anti-retroviral drug generally used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS and CHB. Docking of lamivudine (as control) to HBV Pol indicated that it was bound at the active site mainly through hydrophobic (alkyl) interactions. It interacted strongly with HBV Pol by forming four hydrophobic interactions with Pro59 and Ala181 (

Other residues that surrounded lamivudine were Gln182 and Ser185 as well as Tyr203 and Met204 of the ‘YMDD’ motif. Molecular docking study revealed that lamivudine-HBV Pol complex was stabilized by an estimated free energy of −5.2 kcal/mol, corresponding to the binding affinity of 6.5 × 10
