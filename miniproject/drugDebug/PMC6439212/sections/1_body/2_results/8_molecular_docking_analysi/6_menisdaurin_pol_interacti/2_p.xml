<p id="p0130">Menisdaurin (
 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>D) interacted with HBV Pol by forming three hydrogen bonds with Asn248, Met250 and Gln267. It also formed one alkyl hydrophobic interaction with Lys241 (
 <xref rid="f0035" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>D). Other residues that surrounded menisdaurin were Asn33, Asn36, Ser81, Leu82, Asp83, Asp206 of YMDD motif, Lys239, Lys241, Leu247, Phe249, Trp259, Gly251. The Gibb's free energy of menisdaurin-Pol interaction was predicted to be −6.5 kcal/mol which corresponded to a binding constant of 8.9 × 10
