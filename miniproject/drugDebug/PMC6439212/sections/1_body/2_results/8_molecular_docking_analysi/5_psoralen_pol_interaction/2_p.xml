 <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C) interacted with HBV Pol by forming one hydrogen bond with Lys32 and two hydrogen bonds with Arg41. It also formed one Pi-cation electrostatic interaction with His160. Notably, His160 was also involved in forming one Pi-Pi T-shaped hydrophobic interaction with Psoralen. Moreover, the complex of psoralen and HBV Pol was stabilized by one Pi-alkyl hydrophobic interactions with Pro5 and Met171 while Ala86 formed three Pi-alkyl hydrophobic interactions (
