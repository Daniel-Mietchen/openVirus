 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>), the mechanism of action is not reported. In line with this, our 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data confirmed the high anti-HBV potential of quercetin. The docking of quercetin with HBV Pol revealed formation of bonds with Lys32, Asn36, Arg41, Ala86, Ala87, Phe88, Asp83 and Val84 that stabilized the quercetin-pol complex with an estimated free energy of −7.4 kcal/mol. Notably therein, Asp205 belonging to the Pol ‘YMDD’ motif was among the quercetin surrounding residues.
