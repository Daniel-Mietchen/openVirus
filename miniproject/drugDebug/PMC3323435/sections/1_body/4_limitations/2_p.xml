<p>A second limitation is the number of LHDs represented in the study. While this sample includes health departments that represent nearly three-quarters of the 40 million residents in California - our unit of analysis is the health department, resulting in a small absolute number of cases. Furthermore, the communities served by these LHDs differ dramatically with respect to organizational and demographic factors. For example, the smallest health department in California represents 1,200 individuals and the largest serves over 8 million. Because of these differences, we present some of our results stratified by the size of the population served by the LHD. However, once the data are divided by population size (or any other community characteristics of interest), the number of health departments represented in each stratum is very small, recommending caution in making strong inferences about any of the observed differences.</p>
