<p>The focus group took place by phone in July 2010 and lasted 120 minutes. Twenty-three advisory group members participated in the teleconference, including representatives from state and local public health departments, federal agencies, private sector associations, academic institutions, hospitals, law enforcement agencies, and non-governmental organizations. The focus group was facilitated by one primary and one secondary facilitator. Notes were taken by the facilitators and an additional note taker, and were transcribed and merged into one document for review before being provided to focus group participants for participant validation. The focus group notes were reviewed to distill any relevant information that could be used to improve and strengthen the survey.</p>
