<p>All LHDs within the state of California were recruited for participation in the survey, with the goal of obtaining a representative sample of LHDs' experiences managing antivirals during the H1N1 influenza response. A complete list of current LHD Health Officers and SNS Coordinators for each of the 61 LHDs in California (58 county health departments and 3 independent municipal health departments) was obtained from the California Department of Public Health. Based on the focus group discussion, persons in these two functional roles were expected to be most knowledgeable about the antiviral response at the local level.</p>
