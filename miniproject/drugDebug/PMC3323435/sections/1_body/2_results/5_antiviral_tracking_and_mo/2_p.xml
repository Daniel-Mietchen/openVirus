<p>Twenty-four LHDs received antiviral utilization data from dispensing sites with varying degrees of frequency. Half of these LHDs received antiviral utilization reports weekly or more frequently. Some health departments received basic utilization data, such as number of courses dispensed or lot numbers, while others received more specific data, including demographic information, intended use of antivirals (e.g. treatment, PEP), or reason that public stockpiles were utilized (e.g. shortages, uninsured recipient). These data were primarily used for making allocation decisions, surveillance, future antiviral planning, reaching target populations, and providing data to other agencies. Utilization data were received primarily by fax, but also by email, phone calls, face-to-face meetings, and mail.</p>
