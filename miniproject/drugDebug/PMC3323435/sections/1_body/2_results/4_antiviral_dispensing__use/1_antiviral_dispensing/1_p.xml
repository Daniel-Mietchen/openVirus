<p>Thirty-one LHDs reported that publicly purchased antivirals were dispensed for patient use in their jurisdiction (70%). Of these LHDs, approximately 90% dispensed fewer than 250 doses of antivirals (ranging from less than 100 doses to more than 10,000 doses). On average, the reported number of antiviral doses dispensed in a community increased with population size. For small LHDs serving fewer than 50,000 residents, the modal number of antiviral doses dispensed was 0 doses (ranging from 0 to 250 doses); for medium LHDs serving a population of 50,000-499,999, the modal number of antiviral doses dispensed was less than 250 doses (ranging from 0 to 1,000 doses); and for large LHDs serving a population of 500,000 and more, the modal number was less than 250 doses (ranging from 0 to more than 10,000 doses). For those LHDs reporting that publicly stockpiled antivirals were not dispensed in their jurisdiction, many reported that they had few influenza cases and demand for antivirals was low. Others indicated that their strategy was to use publicly purchased antivirals when shortages were reported in the local commercial market, which did not occur in their communities.</p>
