<p>Public health systems researchers have noted that variations in availability of community resources and community preferences will influence how public health services will be implemented [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In this study we observed great variability in the approaches used by LHD to manage publicly purchased antiviral drugs. It is expected that some of this variability is attributable to differences in the circumstances faced by LHDs (e.g. influenza illness incidence, community demographics, availability of antivirals in the retail market) while other variation is due to differences in disease control and prevention strategies. It is beyond the scope of this study to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches; however, the findings may inform preparedness conversations regarding which variations in practice are seen as beneficial and adaptive and which areas might benefit from uniformity. State and local health departments, in California and elsewhere, can study these variations in practice and select models and promising practices to be included in their response planning.
