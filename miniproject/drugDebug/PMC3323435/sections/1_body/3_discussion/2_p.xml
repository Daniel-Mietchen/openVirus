<p>This study also documents specific challenges presented by the H1N1 pandemic that were faced, and overcome, by LHDs. Our research corroborates and compliments a recent qualitative investigation on this topic, conducted by National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO) researchers [

Using different methods, both studies find that LHDs had difficulty reconciling multiple sources and versions of antiviral guidance from state and federal agencies, and that this was a major challenge at the local level. This was not only the most commonly reported difficulty in our respondents; it was also one of the most likely to be characterized as "very challenging." NACCHO researchers aptly describe two potential contributors to confusion at the local level that appear to be supported by our findings. First, federal antiviral guidance during the H1N1 response primarily focused on clinical recommendations for antiviral use, and did not directly address how public stockpiles should be used. Second, clinical antiviral guidance changed during the course of the pandemic, which placed a greater emphasis on the use of antivirals for early treatment rather than post-exposure prophylaxis later in the pandemic [
