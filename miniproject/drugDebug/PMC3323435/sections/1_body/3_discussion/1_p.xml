<p>While recent research has demonstrated the clinical importance of antivirals during the H1N1 influenza response [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the role public health agencies in the management of these drugs at the local level has not been well studied. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the antiviral activities carried out by LHDs during the H1N1 influenza response using a representative sample from a large geographic area. A major finding of this report is that, while the number of publicly purchased antivirals dispensed was limited in most communities (fewer than 10% of LHDs reported that more than 250 courses were dispensed in their jurisdiction), LHDs nevertheless drew on their previous work and engaged in a number of antiviral activities. LHDs successfully coordinated with the state health department to receive antivirals from the SNS, made decisions regarding when and where these antivirals would be dispensed within their community, determined which groups would be eligible for these antivirals, allocated and distributed antivirals to dispensing sites for the purpose of reaching target groups, developed systems for verifying eligibility for antivirals and tracking antiviral utilization, and provided guidance to the clinical community.
