<p>Once the pandemic virus is available, a rapid evaluation will be needed to address questions of dosage, need for adjuvants, and booster vaccination. However, this evaluation will need to be done quickly, especially for regions of the world close to the pandemic origin, so as much work as possible should be done before the pandemic. First, though, a virus for vaccine production will need to be created from the pandemic strain, with appropriate manipulation to make it high yielding. In the process, the molecular and antigenic differences between this virus and those of the same subtype already available will need to be defined. With luck, the pandemic virus may be similar enough to one already studied so that any available concentrates can be used. However, similarity is unlikely because of the antigenic variation of influenza strains within a subtype. Rather than stockpiling, another strategy needs to be considered for vaccines containing a virus such as A (H5N1) for which vaccine development has already begun. That virus can be included in vaccines in use before the pandemic. Although influenza A (H5N1) virus has been evolving, even a poorly matched vaccine might provide some protection, especially against a variant with such high lethality (

An A (H5N1) vaccine might initially be directed for use in areas such as Southeast Asia, which are experiencing continued avian transmission and occasional spread to humans.
