<p>Major challenges are presented in controlling a pandemic with vaccine and antiviral drugs, particularly one caused by an A (H5N1) virus similar to those currently circulating. Some are specific to the particular intervention, but others are more generic. Long-term needs exist, such as developing innovative technologies for vaccine prevention and designing antiviral drugs to affect different targets. However, immediate attention for vaccines must be directed to a coordinated international approach to vaccine evaluation, paying attention to ways in which the least amount of virus can immunize the largest number of persons. Use of a possibly unmatched A (H5N1) vaccine for priming should be considered, especially in Southeast Asia, or other areas with the most pressing need. In those regions, antiviral strategies need to be evaluated; drug studies in animal models will be necessary, given the sporadic nature of the disease in humans. Overall, developing countries will have limited access to vaccines and antiviral drugs, and their needs must not be forgotten. With marginal healthcare infrastructures, they will suffer the most, whatever the severity of the pandemic.</p>
