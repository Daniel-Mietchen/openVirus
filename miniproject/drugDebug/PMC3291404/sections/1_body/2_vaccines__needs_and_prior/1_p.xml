<p>Key to the ability to have vaccines ready is early detection of the pandemic virus. Improved surveillance networks are vital for this purpose. While the specific variant that emerges will probably be different antigenically from any recognized, much can be learned by studying the known variants of likely subtypes. An example of what needs to be done before the pandemic is the concerted evaluation in 1976 of a virus variant thought to have pandemic potential (

 </xref>). The swine influenza virus, detected in humans in that year, was viewed as a pandemic threat. Because the pandemic never occurred, researchers had time to complete a large range of pediatric and adult studies. We learned that those who had no previous experience with that subtype needed to be vaccinated twice with a split preparation. The whole-virus vaccine then commonly used could not be given to those persons without frequent systemic reactions, but the whole-virus vaccine was more immunogenic and might be acceptable if rapid response was desired. In persons previously exposed to the influenza virus subtype, the whole-virus vaccine was much less reactogenic and appeared more immunogenic than the split product (
