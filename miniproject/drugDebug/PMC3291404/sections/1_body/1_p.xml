<p>A pandemic virus will likely spread so rapidly from the source that vaccine availability may be delayed for months after major outbreaks begin. In addition, much of the population will be totally susceptible. We will likely not be able to prepare stockpiles of virus concentrates well matched with the pandemic strain for vaccine production before the strain has actually shown itself. In contrast, antiviral drugs, particularly the neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs), will be effective against any pandemic virus, and stockpiling is possible (
