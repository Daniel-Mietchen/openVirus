<p>Considerable evidence indicates that both classes of drugs work well in prophylaxis against susceptible seasonal influenza viruses and that prophylaxis does not increase resistance. In fact, amantadine prophylaxis has been tested in a pandemic situation, and while efficacy may be reduced in persons with no previous exposure, which seems to increase protection, it is still 70%â€“80% (

This characteristic is actually desirable, since it provides protection against the next wave of the pandemic virus. However, in some cases, infection is prevented completely, so vaccine should be used when available.
