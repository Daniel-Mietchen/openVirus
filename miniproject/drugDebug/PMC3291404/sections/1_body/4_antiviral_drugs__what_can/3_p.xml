<p>In treatment, adamantanes and NAIs diverge in their efficacy. No reliable data on use in pandemics exists, and no head-to-head studies have been carried out. Studies of treatment with amantadine and rimantadine did not allow firm estimates of how much they shortened duration of illness but were sufficient to conclude that they produced more rapid resolution than symptomatic therapy, such as aspirin (

 </xref>). While resistance occurs when oseltamivir is used in treatment, it is far less frequent than with the adamantanes, and the mutant viruses may be less infectious and transmissible than wild type (

 </xref>). This conclusion cannot be viewed as absolute; with high-volume use, which has occurred thus far only in Japan, resistant viruses could begin to circulate. Emergence of resistance has apparently occurred with adamantanes, and the more recent type A (H5N1) virus, as well as some currently circulating seasonal viruses, are not susceptible to this drug class.
