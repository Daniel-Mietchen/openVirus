<p>Scientific questions that have been raised concerning the various priority potential pandemic viruses are different, depending on the specific subtypes. The goal in all cases is production of an immune response with the least amount of antigen, so that more doses can be available. Perhaps the simplest situation is that of A (H2N2), a known quantity, because of its presence from 1957 to 1968, in terms of immune response, population likely to be infected, and expected disease characteristics. Also, that virus presents the fewest issues about vaccine production, for the same reasons. However, the basic question relates to producing the best immune response with the least amount of antigen and avoiding if possible the need for a second injection, which would use additional antigen and delay production of protective immunity. One approach, already studied, is to leave the harvested virus particles intact, the modern equivalent of the whole-virus vaccines evaluated in 1976 (

In persons without prior infection with this virus, 1 injection of as little as 3.8 Î¼g with alum, a widely used adjuvant, produced some antibody response, as determined by the hemagglutination-inhibition (HAI) test, traditionally used to assess protection afforded by inactivated vaccines. A second injection produced high titers. Positive features of this approach are that vaccine could be produced more quickly, and antigen would be spared. A possible negative feature would be reactogenicity in children. However, we do not know whether, with modern purification methods, these vaccines would have the reactogenicity of those produced in 1976. Less work has been done with avian influenza, A (H9N2), but similar approaches might be used with these nonhighly pathogenic avian viruses (
