<p id="Par30">At present, 588 human proteases are listed in the degradome database (Quesada et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2009</xref>), which can be further divided into five classes based on their catalytic mechanism. The majority belongs to the family of metallo (192 members), serine (184 enzymes), and cysteine proteases (164 members); in addition, 27 threonine and 21 aspartyl proteases are known, so far. Proteases are well-druggable targets and numerous small-molecule protease inhibitors have been approved in the past. The more than ten inhibitors of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (Turk 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2006</xref>), as well as the neprilysin (enkephalinase) inhibitor prodrugs sacubitril (Howell and Cameron 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2016</xref>) and racecadotril (acetorphan) target Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>-dependent metalloproteases. The ACE blockers and sacubitril are suitable for long-term usage as antihypertensive drugs, whereas racecadotril is approved as an antidiarrheal drug. Despite limited use, treatment of high blood pressure is also possible with aliskiren, a small-molecule inhibitor of the aspartate protease renin (Wood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">2003</xref>). Numerous synthetic inhibitors of the trypsin-like serine proteases (TLSP) thrombin (argatroban, dabigatran etexilate, bivalirudin) and factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban, betrixaban) can be used as anticoagulants (Straub et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2011</xref>). Except argatroban and bivalirudin, all of these clotting protease inhibitors are orally available and suited for long-term use in the prevention of stroke, e.g., in patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. Meanwhile, more than ten gliptins have been approved in various countries. The gliptins are a class of oral hypoglycemic drugs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus type 2 targeting the serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4, thereby reducing the degradation of incretin hormones leading to an enhanced insulin secretion (Scheen 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2015</xref>). The proteasome inhibitors bortezomib (Adams 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2004</xref>) and carfilzomib (Kortuem and Stewart 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2013</xref>) are used in patients with multiple myeloma and the first approved drugs targeting threonine proteases. Meanwhile, two additional proteasome inhibitors, ixazomib and oprozomib, obtained orphan drug status (Manasanch and Orlowski 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2017</xref>). Besides addressing human proteases, numerous inhibitors of the aspartyl protease of HIV (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2016</xref>) and the NS3/4A serine protease of the hepatitis C virus (McCauley and Rudd 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2016</xref>) are on the market. With few exceptions, most of these inhibitors are routinely used in combination with other drugs and not as single agents. Despite large efforts, no cysteine protease inhibitor has been approved, so far. One of the most advanced inhibitors of the papain-like bone-degrading protease cathepsin K is the nitrile derivative odanacatib, which was developed for the treatment of osteoporosis. Based on a clinical phase III trial, a high efficacy with increasing bone mineral density and reduced risk of fractures was initially reported, as well as a good safety profile (Chapurlat 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2015</xref>). However, its further development was stopped at the end of 2016 due to a slightly increased risk of stroke (Mullard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2016</xref>). Other cathepsin K inhibitors, like the nitrile balicatib, failed in phase II due to complications with skin fibrosis (Br√∂mme et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>; Runger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2012</xref>). Despite the lack of approved cysteine protease inhibitors, many other examples confirm the suitability of at least some proteases as excellent drug targets.
