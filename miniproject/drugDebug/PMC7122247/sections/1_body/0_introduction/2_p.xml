<p id="Par31">This should also apply to numerous host proteases, which are involved at various steps during the propagation cycle of certain viruses. The inhibition of host enzymes could be advantageous compared to the classical addressing of viral targets due to a low risk for rapid drug resistances. However, side effects may occur by targeting host enzymes, which are required for normal physiological processes. Moreover, most host proteases belong to families of structurally closely related enzymes, and therefore it might be challenging to address a single target without affecting other family members. In order to avoid side effects and a narrow therapeutic window, it is therefore advisable to develop such host protease inhibitors mainly for combination therapies, which should enable the use of lower drug doses.</p>
