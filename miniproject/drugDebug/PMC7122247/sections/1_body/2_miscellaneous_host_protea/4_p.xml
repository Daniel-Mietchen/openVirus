<p id="Par89">Zinc-dependent host metalloproteases from the MMP (matrix metalloproteases) or the ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) families might also be involved in the entry and fusion of certain viruses, as recently described for a neurovirulent murine CoV strain (Phillips et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2017</xref>). Moreover, a considerable amount of the EboV GP is shed by the metalloprotease TACE (ADAM17) (Dolnik et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2004</xref>). The soluble GP activates dendritic cells and macrophages and causes the release of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and affects vascular permeability. The dysregulated inflammatory host response seems to contribute to the high virus pathogenicity (Escudero-Perez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2014</xref>). These results suggest that inhibitors of metalloproteases may have antiviral activity. Although more than 50 clinical trials with metalloprotease inhibitors for the treatment of various cancers failed, their broad anti-inflammatory potential has aroused new interest (Vandenbroucke and Libert
