<p id="Par83">With the role of SKI-1/S1P in the cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis in mind, a high-throughput screen was conducted to identify lead structures lowering plasma cholesterol and triglycerides (Hay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2007</xref>). Based on screening results, improved derivatives were prepared. The most potent compound from this study (

 <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">11.21</xref>) inhibits SKI-1/S1P with an

 <sub>50</sub> value of 8 nM. However, the less potent analogue PF-429242 (
 <bold>56</bold>) was used for further evaluation because of its lower molecular weight and lipophilicity. PF-429242 is a reversible, competitive inhibitor of SKI-1/S1P with an

 <sub>50</sub> value of 170 nM. Furthermore, it is highly selective for SKI-1/S1P; other serine proteases like trypsin, plasmin, kallikrein, or furin are not inhibited by this compound. However, PF-429242 suffers from rapid clearance and poor oral bioavailability in rats. Inhibition of SKI-1/S1P by PF-429242 blocks the cleavage of the glycoprotein of the old-world arenaviruses LASV and LCMV, resulting in reduced virus replication in infected cell cultures (Urata et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2011</xref>). Interestingly, no escape variants could be detected during or after the treatment with this SKI-1/S1P inhibitor. These studies were extended to several new-world arenaviruses like Junin or Guanarito virus, where PF-429242 also efficiently blocked glycoprotein processing and virus production (Pasquato et al.
