<p id="Par85">Several known serine protease inhibitors, among them AEBSF (4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzene sulfonylfluoride) and 
 <italic>p</italic>-aminobenzamidine (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">11.4</xref>) as well as inhibitors of furin or furin-related PCs like Dec-RVKR-CMK, were tested against SKI-1/S1P. A significant inhibition was only found for DCI (3,4-dichloroisocoumarin, compound 
 <bold>58</bold>, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">11.21</xref>), which exhibited a slow irreversible binding mode with an apparent inhibition constant of 6.8 Î¼M (Bodvard et al.
