 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2002</xref>). In case of furin and furin-like PCs, two cleavages are needed to gain full enzymatic activity. After the removal of the signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum, a first cleavage leads to a conformational change of the enzyme, which is then the latent form. Enzymatic activity is obtained after a second cleavage in the prosegment, which leads to a release of the prosegment. The cleavages depend on the pH in the respective organelles. With exception of PC2 and SKI-1/S1P, the prosegments act as inhibitors of their respective enzyme. In case of SKI-1/S1P , three cleavages are required for full enzymatic activity. The subcellular localization of the PCs differs. Furin , PC5B , and PC7 have sorting signals in their cytosolic tails, which mediate recycling between the TGN and the cell surface. SKI-1/S1P shows also a broad distribution and is found in the ER, Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and lysosomes. In contrast, PC1 and PC2 are primarily found in dense-core vesicles of the secretory pathway, and PC4 is localized only in the plasma membrane of male and female germ cells. Furin, PC7, and SKI-1/S1P are ubiquitously distributed, and PC5 and PACE4 are widely distributed. In contrast, the expression of PC1 and PC2 is limited to neural and endocrine cells. PCSK9 can be found predominantly in the liver, intestine, and kidney.
