<p id="Par63">Like OMTKY3, inter-alpha-inhibitor protein (IαIp) is known to be a potent serine protease inhibitor, e.g., against trypsin, chymotrypsin, or acrosin. IαIp was first isolated from human plasma and is a multicomponent complex, consisting of two heavy and one light chain, called bikunin, which are linked via a chondroitin linker. Bikunin possesses two protease domains of the Kunitz-type that are likely to inhibit furin, because treatment with IαIp provided a significant protection against anthrax toxin in cell culture studies and in mice (Opal et al.

Insertion of a multibasic recognition site by mutation of P42-V-T-L45 to R42-V-K-R45 resulted in a strong furin inhibitor with a
