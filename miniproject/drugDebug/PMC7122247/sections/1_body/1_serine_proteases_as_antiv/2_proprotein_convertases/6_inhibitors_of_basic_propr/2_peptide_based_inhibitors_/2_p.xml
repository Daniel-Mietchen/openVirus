<p id="Par68">So far, only few endogenous PC inhibitors are known. A prominent role plays autoinhibition by prodomains (Zhong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">1999</xref>). Furin-like PCs are synthesized as zymogen and are activated by autocatalytic cleavage within the prodomain. The prosegment acts as an intramolecular chaperon, needed for the correct folding, regulation of enzymatic activity, and transport within the secretory pathway. A moderate

 <sub>i</sub> value of 156 nM was determined for the complete 83-mer prodomain of furin. Furthermore, this inhibitor reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells (Basak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2010</xref>). Several truncated derivatives have been synthesized. The most potent one, the 24-mer DYYHFWHRGVTKRSLSPHRPRHSR, inhibits furin with an inhibition constant of 0.9 μM. Moreover, some peptides derived from the prodomain of PC1 inhibit furin in the same range (Basak and Lazure
