<p id="Par77">Reduction of peptide bonds by treatment of their amide precursors with borane-tetrahydrofuran provided a series of multibasic piperazine and pyrrolidine containing derivatives, like 
 <bold>45</bold> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">11.19</xref>) with submicromolar affinity against PC2 and weak affinity against PC1 and furin (Kowalska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2009</xref>). Among a series of weakly basic guanylhydrazones, several compounds like derivative 
 <bold>46</bold> were prepared, which inhibit furin with inhibition constants close to 0.5 μM (Sielaff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2011b</xref>). Even, the mono-guanylhydrazone derivative (
 <bold>47</bold>) still showed a significant furin inhibition with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 11.8 μM (Komiyama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2009</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>47</bold> also inhibits PC5 and PACE4 in the same range, whereas a reduced potency was observed against PC7. Despite the poor in vitro potency of the cell-permeable naphthofluorescein derivative B3 (
 <bold>48</bold>) with a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 12 μM against furin, it was able to inhibit the furin-catalyzed activation of the remodeling protease proMT1-MMP, leading to decreased MMP-2 activation and cell motility of CHO cells. Treatment with B3 also reduced the invasiveness of human fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080) (Coppola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>).
