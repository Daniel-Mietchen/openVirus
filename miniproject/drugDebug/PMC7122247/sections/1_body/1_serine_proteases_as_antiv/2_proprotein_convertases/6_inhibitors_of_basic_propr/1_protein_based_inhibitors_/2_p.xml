<p id="Par62">Turkey ovomucoid third domain (OMTKY3) belongs to the family of Kazal-type inhibitors and normally inactivates serine proteases of the S1A fold that prefer a neutral P1 residue. Exchange of A15-C-T-L18 to R15-C-L-R18 in its reactive site loop leads to a moderate furin inhibitor with an association constant
