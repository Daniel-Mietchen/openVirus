<p id="Par75">Moreover, peptidomimetic compounds containing a multi-Leu motif have been described (Levesque et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2012</xref>). The aim of this modification was the discrimination between furin and PACE4. The most selective derivative of this series (
 <bold>42</bold>) inhibits PACE4 with a K
 <sub>i</sub> value of 18 nM, whereas furin was 22-fold less affected. Further modification with polyethylene glycols of different length could improve the selectivity profile, whereas incorporation of 4-amidinobenzylamide or 2,3-dehydroagmatine as P1 residue resulted in less selective PACE4 inhibitors compared to furin (Kwiatkowska et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2016</xref>).
