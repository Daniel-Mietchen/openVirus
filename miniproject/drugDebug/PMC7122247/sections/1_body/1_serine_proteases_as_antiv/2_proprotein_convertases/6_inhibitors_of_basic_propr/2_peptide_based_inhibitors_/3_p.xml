<p id="Par69">A combinatorial peptide library containing approximately 52 million hexapeptides was scanned to identify PC1 and PC2 inhibitors. For instance, Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH
 <sub>2</sub> inhibits PC1 and PC2 with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values of 3.2 and 360 nM, respectively, whereas it is only a moderate furin inhibitor with an inhibition constant of 1.4 μM. On the other hand, the unprotected analogue H-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-OH has a stronger furin affinity (0.42 μM) but reduced potency against PC2 (3.4 μM) (Cameron et al.
