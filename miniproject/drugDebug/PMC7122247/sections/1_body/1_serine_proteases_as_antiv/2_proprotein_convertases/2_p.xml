<p id="Par57">Four PCs (furin, PC5B, PC7, and SKI-1/S1P) possess a transmembrane and C-terminal cytoplasmatic domain, which anchors them to cellular membranes. Furthermore, furin, PC5B , and SKI-1/S1P can be shed and released in a soluble form into the extracellular space. PC1 and PC2 are maintained in dense-core granules, whereas the remaining PC4, PC5A, PACE4, and PCSK9 are secreted. Furin and the related six PCs PC1, PC2, PC4, PC5, PACE4, and PC7 recognize multibasic cleavage sequences and, therefore, are also known as basic PCs or furin-like PCs. The catalytic domains of these enzymes show more than 50% identity (Thomas

Despite overlapping consensus sequences and a high sequence homology, minor modifications in the recognition sequence as well as in their cellular localization lead to specific cleavages by the different PCs. In contrast, SKI-1/S1P cleaves after the consensus cleavage site (K/R)-X-(V/L/I)-Z↓, where Z is any amino acid except Val, Pro, Cys, Glu, or Asp and the spacer X is preferably a basic residue (Seidah
