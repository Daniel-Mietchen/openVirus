<p id="Par56">The family of proprotein convertases comprises nine calcium-dependent serine endoproteases (furin, PC1, PC2, PC4, PC5, PACE4, PC7, SKI-1/S1P, and PCSK9). These enzymes play an important role in the maintenance of cell homeostasis by activation or deactivation of proteins including prohormones as well as proforms of transcription factors, membrane receptors, and extracellular membrane proteins (Seidah and Prat

For example, several enveloped viruses depend on the cleavage of their surface glycoproteins by PCs to gain fusion capacity, which is required for virus propagation (Pasquato et al.
