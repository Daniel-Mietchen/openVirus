<p id="Par36">Additional candidates have been found among the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSPs) , which comprise 17 different enzymes (Antalis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; Garten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2015</xref>). Most of them show a restricted tissue-specific expression pattern; an exception is matriptase, which is ubiquitously found in epithelial layers of most tissues. In 2006, the TTSPs TMPRSS2 (epitheliasin) and human airway trypsin-like peptidase (HAT or TMPRSS11D) were identified as activating enzymes of monobasic HAs of seasonal IAV when overexpressed in MDCK cells (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>; Böttcher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). A potential HA cleavage of the 1918 IAV was also described by TMPRSS4 (Bertram et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>; Chaipan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). The virus spread is eventually promoted by additional TTSPs, like DESC1 (Zmora et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">2014</xref>) or hepsin, whereas no HA processing was found for TMPRSS3 and TMPRSS6 (also named as matriptase-2) (Bertram et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2010</xref>). In contrast to these TTSPs involved in the HA activation of LPAIV, a strong substrate preference for HAs from HPAIV with Lys as P4 residue has been identified for TMPRSS13 (MSPL) (Okumura et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2010</xref>). This is a striking difference to the substrate profile of the PC furin, which strongly prefers arginine in P4 position (Rockwell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">2002</xref>). Independent studies with knockout mice revealed that the HA of the seasonal H1N1 virions including the 2009 pandemic virus is dominantly activated by TMPRSS2 (Hatesuer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2013</xref>; Sakai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2014</xref>; Tarnow et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">2014</xref>), whereas TMPRSS2 alone is not sufficient for the maturation of the HA from H3N2 subtypes. A recent study showed that only the combined TMPRSS2
 <sup>-/-</sup> and TMPRSS4
 <sup>-/-</sup> knockout mice reduced H3N2 spread and signs of infection in lung, suggesting that both proteases are involved (Kuhn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2016</xref>).
