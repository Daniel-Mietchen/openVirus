<p id="Par47">In principle, it should be possible to replace the C-terminal 4-Amba residue in these substrate analogue inhibitors. Numerous alternative P1 groups are known from the field of thrombin and fXa inhibitors (Straub et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2011</xref>). Besides basic groups, many chloro-substituted aromatic P1 residues as used, for example, in inhibitor 
 <bold>13</bold> have been developed (Sisay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2010</xref>). The chlorine addresses a highly conserved Tyr228 side chain found at the back of the S1 pocket, whereas the aminomethyl group comes out of the S1 pocket and does not bind to Asp189. It provides an enhanced inhibitory potency against thrombin and fXa but leads to a reduced inhibition of HAT, matriptase, plasmin, and of several other trypsin-like serine proteases. However, only weak anti-influenza activity was found for compound 
 <bold>13</bold> suggesting that the relevant HA-cleaving host proteases are not susceptible to such chloro-substituted aromatic P1 structures.
