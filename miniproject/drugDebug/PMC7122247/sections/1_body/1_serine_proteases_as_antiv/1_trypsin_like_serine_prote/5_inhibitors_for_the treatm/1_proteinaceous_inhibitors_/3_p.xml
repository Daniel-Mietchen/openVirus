<p id="Par39">It is one of the smallest naturally occurring peptidic protease inhibitors and comprises a typical Bowman-Birk motif of serine protease inhibitors (BBIs) with its characteristic 9-mer disulfide-bridged loop containing Lys5 as P1 residue (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2007</xref>; McBride et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2002</xref>). The inhibitor is further stabilized by an additional head-to-tail backbone cyclization between the N-terminal Gly1 and C-terminal Asp14 residues. SFTI-1 inhibits trypsin and matriptase with

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">1999</xref>) and 100 nM (Long et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2001</xref>), respectively. After initial crystallization in complex with trypsin (Luckett et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">1999</xref>), its binding mode has been determined also in the active site of matriptase (Fig.
