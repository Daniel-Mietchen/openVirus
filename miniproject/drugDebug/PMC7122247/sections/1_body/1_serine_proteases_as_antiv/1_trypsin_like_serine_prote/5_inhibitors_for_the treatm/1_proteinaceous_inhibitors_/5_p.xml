<p id="Par41">Because of their high molecular weight aprotinin, HAI-1, HAI-2, or SFTI analogues should mainly inhibit extracellular HA processing, and it is rather unlikely that substantial amounts of these compounds can enter the cell and block the TTSPs in the secretory pathway. Despite this limitation, an aerosol formulation of aprotinin has been developed and approved in Russia for the treatment of mild-to-moderate influenza infections (Zhirnov et al.

It was described that in case of mammalian IAV and LPAIV with monobasic HAs, progeny particles are assembled, which still contain some uncleaved HAs and therefore require further activation by extracellular enzymes sensitive to aprotinin. In contrast to these previous reports, more recent findings reveal that the monobasic HAs are processed in intracellular compartments without a further need for extracellular processing (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al.
