<p id="Par37">The concept of HA cleavage inhibition as realistic antiviral strategy was supported by studies with the broad-spectrum inhibitor aprotinin (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">1994</xref>; Zhirnov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">1982a</xref>). The 58-mer Kunitz-type inhibitor, also known as BPTI or Trasylol
 <sup>Â®</sup>, is isolated from bovine lungs and relatively well tolerated in animals and humans. It inhibits numerous trypsin-like serine proteases such as trypsin, plasmin, matriptase, and plasma kallikrein (Ascenzi et al.
