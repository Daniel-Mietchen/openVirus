<p id="Par51">Drug development is strongly focused on the design of nonpeptidic, small-molecule inhibitors . Usually, they are more stable than peptidic inhibitors, possess longer half-lives, and offer better chances to be orally bioavailable. Hundreds of highly potent nonpeptidic inhibitors targeting the clotting proteases are available, whereas only few TTSP inhibitors of this type have been described, so far. Most of the work was done in the field of matriptase inhibitors (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">11.11</xref>). The bis-benzamidine 
 <bold>23</bold> has a 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value of 208 nM (Enyedy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2001</xref>); and an enhanced potency (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 40 nM) was described for analogue 
 <bold>24</bold> (Goswami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2013</xref>). The tribasic compounds 
 <bold>25</bold> and 
 <bold>26</bold> show improved matriptase inhibition with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values of 10 nM and 3 nM, respectively (Goswami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2014</xref>). A less rigid core segment was used for the design of the tribasic inhibitor 
 <bold>27</bold>, which inhibits matriptase and matriptase-2 with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values of 38 nM and 3.6 μM (Furtmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2016</xref>). A group from Korea reported the discovery of the 2-hydroxydiarylamide derivatives 
 <bold>28</bold> and 
 <bold>29</bold> as TMPRSS4 inhibitors with 
 <italic>IC</italic>
 <sub>50</sub> values of 12 μM and 6 μM (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2013</xref>), respectively. Surprisingly, also the mucolytic cough suppressant bromhexine 
 <bold>30</bold> was described as TMPRSS2 inhibitor (
 <italic>IC</italic>
 <sub>50</sub> = 0.75 μM).
