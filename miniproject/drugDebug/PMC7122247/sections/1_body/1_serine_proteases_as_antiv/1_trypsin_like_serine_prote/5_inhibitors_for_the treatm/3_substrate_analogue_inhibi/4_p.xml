<p id="Par46">The replacement of glycine by proline in P2 position leads to the relatively nonselective inhibitor BAPA (
 <bold>12</bold>), which possesses one- or two-digit nanomolar potencies against the clotting proteases thrombin, fXa, plasma kallikrein (PK), fibrinolytic plasmin, and the TTSPs HAT, TMPRSS2, and matriptase (Hellstern et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2016</xref>; Sielaff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2011a</xref>). A significant antiviral effect was found in BAPA-treated cell cultures infected with numerous monobasic IAV strains (Böttcher-Friebertshäuser et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2012</xref>; Böttcher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>; Sielaff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2011a</xref>). Many analogues of this inhibitor scaffold with different P2 and/or P3 residues have been tested but were less effective than BAPA (data not published). It seems that compounds with a broader target spectrum exhibit an advantageous antiviral profile. This tendency confirms the promising results obtained for the relatively nonselective inhibitor aprotinin. Otherwise, less selective inhibitors that also target numerous clotting proteases might suffer from a narrow safety profile due to potential bleeding complications after i.v. treatment. Such side effects might be reduced, when the compounds will be inhaled, as described for aprotinin. Notably, BAPA (
 <bold>12</bold>) was well tolerated in a bleomycin-induced fibrosis model in mice when it was applied as aerosol via a microsprayer (data not published).
