<p id="Par48">Another strategy is the design of covalent inhibitors (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2011</xref>). Covalent bonds can be irreversibly formed, e.g., when serine proteases are inactivated by chloromethyl ketones (CMK) (Powers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2002</xref>). Although such CMKs are useful tools for initial biochemical experiments and structure analysis, they are not suitable for drug development due to stability and selectivity problems. A more eligible approach is the incorporation of electrophilic warheads, which also form covalent but reversible bonds to their targets. This can be achieved by coupling of substrate-analogue P3-P2 or P4-P2 segments with P1 boroarginine and arginal groups or with P1-P1′-arginyl ketones. These electrophilic groups can be attacked by the active-site serine providing covalent boronate ester-, hemiacetal-, or hemiketal-like complexes. The formed covalent bond significantly improves the affinity of the inhibitors. In the 1990s, a few arginal and arginyl-ketone-derived thrombin inhibitors reached preclinical and early clinical development (Steinmetzer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2001</xref>), which was stopped due to the discovery of more suited non-covalent inhibitors, like melagatran containing the 4-Amba residue. The arginal derivative 
 <bold>14</bold> acylated with the N-terminal Abz-fluorophore (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">11.8</xref>) was described as an inhibitor of HAT (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 54 nM) (Wysocka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2010</xref>). CVS-3983 (
 <bold>15</bold>), a second aldehyde derivative containing an unusual dialkylated P3 residue, inhibits matriptase with an inhibition constant of 3.3 nM and reduced prostate cancer growth in a xenograft mice model (Galkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2004</xref>). However, none of these aldehydes was tested for antiviral potential. The reuse of reversible arginyl ketone inhibitors against TTSPs has started in 2012 with compound 
 <bold>16</bold> (IN-1) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">11.8</xref>). Although it is a much stronger matriptase inhibitor (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> = 11 pM), it potently inhibits additional trypsin-like serine proteases like matriptase-2, hepsin, HAT, and trypsin with 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values &lt;10 nM (Colombo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). Compound 
 <bold>16</bold> reduces breast cancer progression in mice (Zoratti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">2015</xref>) and inhibits H1N1 IAV propagation in human Calu-3 cells with an EC
 <sub>50</sub> of 5.6 μM (Beaulieu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2013</xref>). It was postulated that the antiviral efficacy is due to matriptase inhibition. However, since the inhibitor concentrations used were well above the 
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> values against related proteases, it is conceivable that the inhibition of additional targets contributes to the observed antiviral effects. Numerous analogues with modified P4-P2 peptide segments like compound 
 <bold>17</bold> (
 <italic>K</italic>
 <sub>i</sub> value for matriptase 0.92 nM) targeting also matriptase-2, hepsin, and hepatocyte growth factor activator (HGFA) have been prepared for tumor treatment or regulation of iron overload but were not further tested with influenza viruses, so far (Duchene et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>; Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2014</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2016</xref>).
