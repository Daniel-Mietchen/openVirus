<p id="Par40">In contrast to the trypsin complex, the Lys5 amino group makes only a water-bridged interaction to Asp189 at the bottom of the S1 pocket of matriptase but forms no direct contact to its carboxyl group. It also interacts with the side chain and carbonyl oxygens of the adjacent Ser190 and with a second water molecule (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">11.3</xref>). Numerous analogues of SFTI-1 have been made. For instance, its conversion to the more simple truncated monocyclic analogue

 <bold>4</bold>, containing a side-chain-to-tail cyclization, is even more potent with an inhibition constant of 2.6Â nM (Fittler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2014</xref>). However, despite this excellent potency, none of the SFTI analogues has been tested for antiviral activity.
