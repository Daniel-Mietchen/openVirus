<p id="Par43">Although an antiviral efficacy was demonstrated for ECA 
 <bold>5</bold> and the S1 ligands 
 <bold>6</bold>–
 <bold>9</bold>, a stronger potency can be achieved with compounds also addressing adjacent binding sites. Trypsin-like host proteases possess relatively well-defined S2 and S3/S4 regions, often named proximal and distal binding pockets, respectively. Therefore, substrate analogue S3/S4-S2-segments were coupled with C-terminal decarboxylated P1 arginine mimetics or with stabilized non-cleavable P1-P1′ scaffolds, e.g., arginyl-ketone moieties or other warheads targeting the active-site serine.
