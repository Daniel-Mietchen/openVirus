<p id="Par52">The binding mode of a few bis-benzamidine and several tribasic analogues in complex with matriptase was determined by crystal structure analysis. The complex with inhibitor 
 <bold>26</bold> is shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">11.12</xref>. One benzamidine occupies the S1 site, and the second targets the distal S3/4 pocket above Trp215, whereas the aminocyclohexyl group is directed toward the 60-loop of matriptase but not involved in direct polar contacts. Due to the lack of experimental structures of TMPRSS2 and TMPRSS4, the binding mode of compounds

 <bold>30</bold> cannot be trustfully predicted. Most of these nonpeptidic inhibitors were developed to address the TTSPs as targets for tumor treatment (Goswami et al.
