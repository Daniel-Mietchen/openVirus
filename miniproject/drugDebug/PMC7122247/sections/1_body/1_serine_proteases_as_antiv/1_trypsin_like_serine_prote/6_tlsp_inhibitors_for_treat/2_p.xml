<p id="Par55">The spike (S) surface protein of respiratory coronaviruses (CoV) is also synthesized as inactive precursor protein that has to be activated by host proteases. The N-terminal S1 unit of the cleaved protein binds to receptors on host cells, and the C-terminal S2 unit enables the fusion of the viral membrane with host cell membranes. Both functions are essential for CoV propagation. Original studies suggested that the endosomal cysteine protease cathepsin L is solely required for spike activation and subsequent SARS-CoV infectivity (Simmons et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2005</xref>). Notably, a cathepsin dependency was also found for the enveloped Ebola virus of the 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family (Chandran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>) and Nipah virus (Diederich and Maisner 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2007</xref>), as described above. Later, numerous groups have found that in the presence of cathepsin L inhibitors, the S-protein of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV is activated by TMPRSS2 (Gierer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>; Matsuyama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">2010</xref>; Shulla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2011</xref>; Zmora et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR213">2014</xref>). Consequently, inhibition of SARS-CoV growth in Calu-3 airway epithelial cells was achieved by a combination treatment with the broad-spectrum serine protease inhibitor camostat (
 <bold>8</bold>) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">11.4</xref>) and the cathepsin inhibitor (23,25) trans-epoxysuccinyl-
 <sc>l</sc>-leucylamido-3-methyl-butane ethyl ester (EST) (Kawase et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2012</xref>). Based on these observations, it is suggested that SARS-CoV enters the host cells via two distinct pathways, one using TTSPs like TMPRSS2 and a second using the endosomal cathepsins L and/or B for spike activation. Interestingly, a recent study with a fresh clinical isolate of the human CoV 229E revealed a clear preference for host cell entry via TMPRSS2, whereas after 20 passages in HeLa cells the cathepsin L pathway became more important (Shirato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2017</xref>). However, the cell culture virus showed a reduced ability for replication suggesting that the endosomal pathway is disadvantageous for HCoV-229E infection in humans. Based on these results, the authors suggested to target TMPRSS2 rather than endosomal cathepsins in CoV infections (Shirato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">2017</xref>). A similar tendency was previously found in an animal model of SARS-CoV infection, where viral spread and pathogenesis were only prevented by the TLSP inhibitor camostat and not by broad-spectrum vinylsulfone-type cysteine protease inhibitors targeting cathepsins L and B (Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR211">2015</xref>). However, the authors argue that their new vinylsulfone inhibitors might be excellent lead structures for the development of inhibitors of Ebola virus entry.
