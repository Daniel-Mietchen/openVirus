<p id="Par90">A few respiratory viruses use membrane-bound host proteases independent from their proteolytic activity as entry receptors. A surface region far away from the active site of the ubiquitously expressed serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 , also called CD26) serves as human cellular receptor of MERS-CoV (Raj et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2013</xref>). Consequently, no antiviral effect could be observed after treatment of MERS-CoV-infected cells with active-site-directed DPP4 inhibitors. Moreover, the SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2003</xref>; Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">2009</xref>) and aminopeptidase N (Yeager et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">1992</xref>) as human receptors. Both proteases do not show any sequence or structural similarity with DPP4 (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2013</xref>). The crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain of the MERS- and SARS-CoV S-protein in complex with DPP4 (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2013</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">2013</xref>) and ACE2 (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2005</xref>) has been determined, respectively. The complexes reveal typical protein-protein interactions (PPI). The receptor region on DPP4 and ACE2 are relatively flat missing deep binding pockets normally found in the active site of proteases. Although no examples are known so far, it should be possible to inhibit the entry of these virions by blocking the described PPIs with suitable ligands.
