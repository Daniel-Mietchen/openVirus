  <p>Structure of aprotinin (
   <bold>1</bold>) in complex with trypsin (PDB, 3FP6). Trypsin is shown with its surface in beige, aprotinin as cartoon in green. Only the aprotinin residues in direct contact to the trypsin surface (Pro13-Cys-Lys-Ala-Arg17 and Cys38-Arg39) are shown as sticks with carbon atoms in yellow, as well as the three disulfide bridges. The P1 residue Lys15 binds into the S1 pocket of trypsin
