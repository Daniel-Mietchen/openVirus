  <p>Crystal structure of the substrate analogue inhibitor H-

   <bold>10</bold>) in complex with trypsin (PDB, 4MTB) (Maiwald et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2016</xref>). (
   <bold>a</bold>) Overall structure of the complex indicating the characteristic binding pockets similarly found in all trypsin-like serine proteases (S1 pocket with Asp189 at the bottom in yellow, S2 pocket below His57 and Leu99 in light blue, distal S3/4 pocket above Trp215 in light green). The trypsin residues of the catalytic triad (Ser195, His57, and Asp102) and some additional residues within the active site are labeled; water molecules are omitted. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Polar interactions of the 4-Amba residue in the S1 pocket of trypsin, a conserved water molecule found in nearly all crystal structures with arginine or benzamidines in P1 position, is shown as red ball. Most family members contain a Ser190 as shown for trypsin or an Ala190 (e.g., in HAT, thrombin, factor Xa) that makes an H-bond less
