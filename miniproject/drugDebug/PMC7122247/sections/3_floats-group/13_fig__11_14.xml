  <p>Structure of human furin (shown with its surface in beige) in complex with the irreversible active-site inhibitor Dec-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-CMK (stick model with carbons in green, nitrogen in blue, and oxygen in red) and with the furin inhibitory nanobody Nb14, shown in cartoon style in orange (PDB, 5JMO) (Dahms et al. 
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016b</xref>). Although the nanobody binds far away from the active site, it blocks the binding of larger proteinaceous substrates
