 <caption>
  <p>Crystal structure of SFTI-1 (
   <bold>2</bold>) in complex with matriptase (PDB, 3P8F). Matriptase is shown with its transparent surface in cyan; important residues involved in H-bonds are shown as sticks with carbon atoms in green. SFTI-1 is presented as sticks with carbons in white, water molecules as red balls, and polar contacts as dashed lines in black. For better differentiation, matriptase residues are labeled in black and selected inhibitor residues in blue
