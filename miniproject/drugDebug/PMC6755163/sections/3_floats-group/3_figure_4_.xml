  <p>Anti-HBV drugs tested in HBV-infected hNTCP-complemented primary PPHs. HBV infections of HepAD38 cells were performed in the presence of different doses of Lamivudine, Myr-preS1
   <sup>2-47</sup> and 4B10. (A) Relative HBsAg and (B) HBeAg secretion in the culture supernatant 7 days post-infection was measured by ELISA. (C) HBV copies in the supernatant were measured by quantitative PCR. (D) Lamivudine, Myr-preS1
   <sup>2-47</sup> and 4B10 were not cytotoxic to hNTCP-complemented PPHs, as evidenced by Cell Counting Kit-8 assay. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 and ***P&lt;0.001, with comparisons indicated by lines. hNTCP, human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; PPH, primary pig hepatocyte; HBV, hepatitis B virus; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen; HBeAg, hepatitis B e-antigen; ns, not significant.
