  <p>HBV infection of hNTCP-complemented hepatocytes. (A-C) Cells were infected with HBV stocks for 16–24 h, and media were collected at 3, 5 and 7 dpi for detection of (A) HBeAg and (B) HBsAg by ELISA, and (C) cccDNA by quantitative PCR. Values over the cut-off line were considered positive. (D) HBV infections were performed using PEG8000-concentrated supernatants at 3, 5 and 7 dpi, and HBeAg secretion was measured by ELISA at the indicated time points. (E) Raw HBV-positive serum and purified HBV particles served as viral sources to infect hNTCP-complemented PPHs, followed by HBeAg detection. (F) hNTCP-complemented PPHs were incubated for the indicated time points with raw patient serum (naïve serum) and heated patient serum, and cell viabilities were detected by Cell Counting Kit-8. *P&lt;0.05, **P&lt;0.01 and ***P&lt;0.001, with comparisons indicated by lines. hNTCP, human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; PPH, primary pig hepatocyte; PRH, primary rabbit hepatocyte; HBV, hepatitis B virus; dpi, days post-infection; HBsAg, hepatitis B surface antigen; HBeAG, hepatitis B e-antigen; ns, not significant.</p>
