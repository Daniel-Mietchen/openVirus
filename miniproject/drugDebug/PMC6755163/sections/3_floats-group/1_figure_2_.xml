  <p>Culture and hNTCP complementation of PPHs and PRHs. (A) The morphology of PPHs and PRHs was assessed at 4 days post-seeding using a phase-contrast microscope. Scale bar, 150 µm. The maintenance medium is indicated. (B) The different cell groups were subjected to reverse transcription-quantitative PCR to determine the relative hNTCP mRNA expression levels. (C) Lysates of the different cell groups were subjected to western blotting to detect hNTCP protein expression levels. (D) At 4 days post-lentivirus infection, the different cell types groups were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Green, hNTCP staining; blue, nucleus. Scale bar, 25 µm. ***P&lt;0.001, with comparisons indicated by lines. hNTCP, human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide; PPH, primary pig hepatocyte; PRH, primary rabbit hepatocyte; PMM, primary human hepatocyte maintenance medium; FBS, fetal bovine serum.</p>
