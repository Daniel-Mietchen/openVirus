<p>For quantification of HBV copies, HBV DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen GmbH), according to the manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was performed using FastStart Universal SYBR
 <sup>Â®</sup> Green Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics). A pCH9-3091 (
 <xref rid="b17-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) plasmid (containing 1.05X HBV genomic DNA) was used as the standard. The exact HBV copies were calculated with molecular weight of plasmid, plasmid concentration and Avogadro constant. The primer sequences and the thermocycling conditions for all qPCR experiments are presented in
