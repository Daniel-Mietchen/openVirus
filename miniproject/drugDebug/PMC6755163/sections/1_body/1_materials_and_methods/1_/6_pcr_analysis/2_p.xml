<p>The hNTCP mRNA level was detected as described previously (
 <xref rid="b9-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Briefly, total intracellular RNA was extracted using TRIzol
 <sup>®</sup> reagent (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.), and cDNA was synthesized using the PrimeScript RT kit with gDNA Eraser (Takara Biotechnology Co., Ltd.). The cDNA products were subjected to qPCR with primers for hNTCP and β-actin (
 <xref rid="tI-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="table">Table I</xref>). β-actin served as the internal control for sample normalization. The relative hNTCP mRNA expression levels were calculated using the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCq</sup> method (
 <xref rid="b16-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>) and the expression of each group was calculated as relative to the levels of Huh7D cells. All samples were measured in triplicate and all experiments were repeated independently three times.
