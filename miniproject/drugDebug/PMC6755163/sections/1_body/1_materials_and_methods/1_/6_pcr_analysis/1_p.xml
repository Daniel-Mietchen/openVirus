<p>HBV covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) was extracted as described by Köck 
 <italic>et al</italic> (
 <xref rid="b13-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Briefly, ~2×10
 <sup>6</sup> cells in a single well in a 6-well culture plate were lysed with 500 µl NP-40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8.0, 140 mM NaCl and 0.5% NP-40) for 5–10 min until the cells detached from the well. Cells were thoroughly rinsed several times with the NP-40 lysis buffer. The lysate (nuclei and cell debris) was centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 × g, and the supernatant was removed. A total of 500 µl NP-40 lysis buffer, 5 µl ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; 0.5 M) and 5 µl proteinase K (20 mg/ml; Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd.) were added to the nuclear pellet and incubated at 56°C for 2 h. The mixture was loaded onto a QIAshredder column (Qiagen GmbH) and centrifuged at room temperature for 1 min at 15,800 × g. The flow-through was incubated at 56°C for 1 h, the DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation, and the pellet was solubilized in ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O. The genomic DNA, linear viral DNA and relaxed circular DNA were digested for 8 h at 37°C by plasmid-safe ATP-dependent deoxyribonuclease DNase (Epicentre; Illumina, Inc.). Following inactivation at 70°C for 30 min, cccDNA was detected with the primers ccc-1580 and ccc-2314 (
