<p>For cytotoxicity of patients' pool serum, the pool serum was incubated with hNTCP-expressing PPH or heat-inactivated at 56Â°C for 30 min before incubation. Cell viabilities were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 from Yeasen Biotechnology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., according to the manufacturer's instructions. For cytotoxicity of inhibitors, different concentrations of inhibitors (myr-preS1
 <sup>2-47</sup>, 4B10 and Lamivudine) were incubated with hNTCP-expressing PPH for 48 h. Cell viabilities were measured by Cell Counting Kit-8 according to the manufacturer's instructions.
