<p>PPHs and PRHs were seeded and maintained at 100% confluence. Huh7D cells (
 <xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) were seeded at 50% confluence and cultured to 80% confluence prior to induction with 2.5% DMSO. Cells were infected with hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus in the presence of 6 µg/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA). The medium was replaced at 12 h. To ensure expression of hNTCP protein, cells were maintained for at least 72 h prior to HBV infection. At 3 days post-lentivirus infection, concentrated HBV stock solution diluted in PMM (10% v/v FBS was added for PRHs) supplemented with 4% (w/v) PEG8000 was added directly to the cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1,000. For HBV infection with purified patient serum, a MOI of 200 was used. Following incubation overnight, cells were washed thoroughly three times with phosphate-buffered saline, and the media were refreshed. Cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, and the medium was changed every 2 days.
