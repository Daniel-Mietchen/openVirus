<p>For the competing infection assays, the cells were pre-incubated with different concentrations of the HBV entry inhibitor myr-preS1
 <sup>2-47</sup> at 37°C for 30 min in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, and infectious medium containing myr-preS1
 <sup>2-47</sup> was added. For the blocking infection assays, infectious media were pre-incubated with different concentrations of the HBV entry inhibitor 4B10 at 37°C for 30 min in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, and the infectious medium (containing 4B10) was added to the cells. For the inhibition of HBV replication assays, different concentrations of Lamivudine were incubated with cells post-HBV infection.
