<p>Primary pig hepatocytes (PPHs) were isolated from the liver tissues of Wuzhishan minipigs (n=3; estimated age, 8 weeks) provided by the Beijing Genomics Institute, China. Primary rabbit hepatocytes (PRHs) were isolated from the liver tissues of New Zealand rabbits (n=4; estimated age, 4 weeks) provided by Guangdong Medical Animal Center, China. Animals were euthanized by cutting the inferior vena cava under anaesthesia by intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg pentobarbital sodium (

 <xref rid="b9-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Briefly, cell viability was 78–93%, as determined by trypan blue staining and counting. Primary hepatocytes were seeded at a density of 2×10

 <sup>2</sup> in 12-well tissue culture plates pre-coated with collagen (Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-free primary human hepatocyte maintenance medium (PMM) (
 <xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) containing 5% v/v fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) for 4–6 h. Afterwards, the medium was replaced with fresh PMM. For the PRH culture, PMM containing 10% v/v FBS was essential during plating and maintenance. The cells were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator, and the medium was replaced every 2 days.
