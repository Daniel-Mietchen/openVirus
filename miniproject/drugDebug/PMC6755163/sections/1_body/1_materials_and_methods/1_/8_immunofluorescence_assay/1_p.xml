<p>Immunofluorescence assay was performed as described previously (
 <xref rid="b8-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The primary antibody used was anti-rhodopsin antibody (cat. no. ab5417; Abcam; dilution 1:1,000) rabbit anti-human hNTCP polyclonal antibody (cat. no. HPA042727; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck KGaA; dilution 1:750). The secondary antibody used was Alexa Fluor Plus 488-conjugated Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) (cat. no. A32731; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.; dilution 1:1,000). The nuclei were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Roche Diagnostics; dilution 1:2,000), and the cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH), magnification, ×200. The images were processed using Adobe Photoshop CS5 (Adobe Systems, Inc.).
