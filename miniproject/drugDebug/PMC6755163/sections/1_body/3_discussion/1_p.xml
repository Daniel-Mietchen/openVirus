<p>The results of the present study indicated species tropism regarding the HBV post-entry lifecycle. 
 <italic>S. scrofa</italic> was hypothesized to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle, as it is close to 
 <italic>T. brasiliensis</italic> in the divergence tree, both of which are close to 
 <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and 
 <italic>M. mulatta</italic>. 
 <italic>S. scrofa</italic> was experimentally demonstrated to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle in the present study. Although 
 <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> is closer to 
 <italic>H. sapiens</italic> and 
 <italic>M. mulatta</italic> compared with 
 <italic>M. musculus</italic> and 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic>, PRHs were unable to facilitate the HBV post-entry lifecycle in the present study. According to the present results, 
 <italic>R. norvegicus</italic> and 
 <italic>O. cuniculus</italic> may lack one or more limiting factors for the HBV post-entry lifecycle. Identification of these limiting factors may help in the development of immunocompetent small animal models and identification of novel antiviral targets.
