<p>As demonstrated in the present study, the differentiation status is an important limiting factor in productive HBV infection and replication. According to viral antigen secretion and cccDNA formation, hNTCP-complemented PPHs may be a superior cell model for HBV infection compared with the dedifferentiated human hepatoma cell line Huh7D (
 <xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The Huh7 cell line can be induced by DMSO to a higher differentiation state compared with untreated cells. Our previous study has also demonstrated this phenomenon (
 <xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, the differentiation state of well-differentiated Huh7 is still lower compared with that of primary human hepatocytes. For example, well-differentiated Huh7 is resistant to HBV infection. According to our previous unpublished data, the expression levels of differentiation-related genes are lower in well-differentiated Huh7 cells compared with primary human hepatocyte. As pig is close to human in the divergence tree, PPHs complemented with hNTCP may be a superior model for HBV infection compared with the dedifferentiated human hepatoma cell line.
