<p>hNTCP expression in PPHs is controlled by a relatively stable promoter (human elongation factor-1Î±); this is different from the endogenous promoter that induces hNTCP expression in PHHs, which leads to a rapid decrease in hNTCP expression, thus causing PHHs to be resistant to HBV infection (

However, hNTCP-complemented PPHs have certain limitations, such as genomic differences compared with PHHs and limited genomic annotation. One of these differences is the xenoantigens expressed on pig cells (e.g., Gal and Neu5Gc), which can be recognized by natural anti-pig antibodies in human blood and may lead to complement-dependent cytotoxicity (

However, hNTCP-complemented PPHs may partially replace the roles of PHHs in HBV-related fundamental research and drug screening.
