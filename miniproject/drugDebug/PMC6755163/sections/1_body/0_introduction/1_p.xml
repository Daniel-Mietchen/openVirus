<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection exhibits a wide spectrum of clinical liver manifestations (
 <xref rid="b1-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) are currently considered to be the ‘gold standard’ cell model for studying HBV infection (
 <xref rid="b2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, poor availability, variation between batches and ethical issues regarding PHHs limit their application. Primary hepatocytes from non-human primates, such as chimpanzees and monkeys, are expensive, difficult to obtain and also associated with ethical concerns (

 <italic>tupaia</italic> hepatocytes (PTHs) from the treeshrew genus 
 <italic>Tupaia belangeri</italic> are less expensive, but also difficult to obtain, and HBV infection of PTHs is different compared with that of PHHs, as the addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) plus polyethylene glycol 8000 (PEG8000) during infection does not significantly promote HBV infectivity (
