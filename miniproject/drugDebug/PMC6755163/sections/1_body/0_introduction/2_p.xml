<p>The discovery of the HBV functional receptor human sodium taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (hNTCP) (
 <xref rid="b4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) has enabled the development of primary cell models and immunocompetent animal models based on easily obtainable laboratory animals. However, complementation of mouse and rat hepatocytes with hNTCP does not result in susceptibility to HBV infection (

 <xref rid="b6-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), which indicates that additional host factors may be needed for the post-entry HBV lifecycle in mouse and rat hepatocytes. Therefore, other easily obtained laboratory animals that do not pose the same ethical concerns as primates may be a promising alternative solution for primary cell and animal models of HBV infection.
