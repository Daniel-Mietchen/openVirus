<p>Serum from HBV-positive patients is frequently used as a viral source for infection, as it is related to clinical viral strains. hNTCP-complemented PPHs were infected at MOI=200 with raw pooled patient serum and purified HBV particles. As presented in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3E</xref>, HBeAg secretion was positive and continuously increased during HBV infection with purified HBV particles, indicating that hNTCP-complemented PPHs could be infected by clinical viral strains. Raw pooled patient serum was cytotoxic to PPHs, as the cells died in the presence of this serum (data not shown). This cytotoxicity was significantly reduced by heating the raw pooled patient serum at 56Â°C for 30 min (
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3F</xref>), indicating that natural human anti-pig antibodies (such as anti-Gal or anti-Neu5Gc antibodies) and the complement system were the major cause of cytotoxicity. Therefore, purification is essential for the establishment of HBV infection using human serum as the viral source.
