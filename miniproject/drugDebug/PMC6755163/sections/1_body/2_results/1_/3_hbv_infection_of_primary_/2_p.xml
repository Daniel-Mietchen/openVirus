<p>To confirm the formation of cccDNA, the infected cells were lysed, and nuclear DNA was extracted for qPCR. As presented in 
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>, hNTCP-complemented PPHs produced the highest cccDNA levels among the three types of cells, followed by hNTCP-complemented Huh7D cells, whereas the cccDNA levels in hNTCP-complemented PRHs were comparable to the controls. These results were similar with the results of HBeAg and HBsAg secretion. To further confirm the secretion of infectious HBV particles, the new virions in the culture medium at 3, 5, and 7 dpi were concentrated by PEG8000 and added to a new batch of hNTCP-complemented PPHs (
 <xref rid="f3-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). HBeAg secretion in infected hNTCP-complemented PPHs gradually increased in a time-dependent manner, indicating that new virions were infectious and could be passaged (
