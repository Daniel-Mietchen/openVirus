<p>Lamivudine, Myr-preS1
 <sup>2-47</sup> and 4B10 are well-characterized inhibitors of HBV replication and/or HBV entry (

 <xref rid="b25-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and were tested in HBV-infected hNTCP-complemented PPHs in the present study. The three inhibitors were non-cytotoxic to hNTCP-complemented PPHs (

 <sup>2-47</sup> and 4B10, the peptide HBV entry inhibitors, exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion and HBV DNA in the supernatants as higher concentration of inhibitors significantly reduced antigens/virion secretion compared with the lower concentration although there is a plateau, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of 0.5–1 nM (
 <xref rid="f4-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4A-C</xref>), which matches the reported data regarding HBV infection in the PHH model (
 <xref rid="b23-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Lamivudine, an inhibitor of HBV replication, also exhibited concentration-dependent inhibition of HBsAg and HBeAg secretion and HBV DNA in the supernatants, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of ~50 nM. The less effective inhibition of HBV infection by lamivudine possibly occurred due to the failure of lamivudine to block HBV entry. These results indicated that HBV-infected hNTCP-complemented PPHs may be applicable for anti-HBV drug screening.
