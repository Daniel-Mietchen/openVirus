<p>As a positive control for HBV infection, the human cell line Huh7D exhibits increased susceptibility to HBV infection in the presence of hNTCP compared with the HepG2 cell line (
 <xref rid="b10-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>); therefore, the Huh7D cell line was selected in the present study as a positive control for subsequent experiments. PPHs and PRHs, as well as Huh7D cells, were infected with the hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus. Cells were harvested 4 days post-lentiviral infection to determine the hNTCP mRNA expression levels by qPCR and protein expression levels by western blotting, or were fixed to detect hNTCP expression and location by immunofluorescence assay. hNTCP expression was only observed in cells infected with hNTCP-recombinant lentivirus (
 <xref rid="f2-mmr-20-04-3820" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). Although the same MOI of the lentivirus (MOI=1) was used, the estimated percentage of hNTCP-positive PPHs and Huh7D cells was 70–80%, whereas the estimated percentage of hNTCP-positive PRHs was slightly lower at 50–60% (
