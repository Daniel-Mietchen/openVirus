<p>Future considerations in the management of adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis should require consideration of antisepsis and mitigation of sequelae from the host inflammatory response. Furthermore, special consideration for persistent latent HAdV subtypes and immunocompromised individuals is required. Identification of exact mechanisms that underlie the adaptive immune response in adenoviral infections is prudent to the development of novel therapeutic sources. However, the lack of animal models that accurately mimic complexity of human ocular anatomy while also illustrating proper replication and infection of human adenoviruses can prove decelerating for new discovery.
