<p>Kosulin et al suggested that latent HAdV infection of the gut lymphoid cell could serve as a source of release of HAdV particles in the community.
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Garnett et al demonstrated the asymptomatic persistence of group C adenovirus in human mucosal T lymphocytes or lymphoid tissue following primary adenoviral infection.
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> The stimulation of these adenovirus containing mucosal T-lymphocytes results in reactivation of latent HAdV with consequential leakage of reactivated viruses into intestinal epithelial cells, where adenoviruses undergo replication and subsequent shedding in stool.
