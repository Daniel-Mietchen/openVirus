<p>Immunosuppressive steroid therapy can suppress the production of cytokines including TNF-alpha, type I IFN, and type II IFN, as well as depleted T cells and NK cells.

Inhibition of the IFN response allows for expression of the HAdV E1A gene, which results in reactivation and replication of HAdV DNA in epithelial cell associated with latently infected lymphoid tissue and consequential dissemination of HAdV.
