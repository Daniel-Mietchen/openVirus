<p>Despite favorable outcomes of cidofovirâ€™s antiviral activity in rabbit models, several studies discussed the significant side effects to the ocular surface, which is a potential limitation for therapeutic use. Gordon et al described the effects of topical cidofovir in uninfected animals, determining that there was consistent clinically significant ocular toxicity at a total dose exceeding 15mg over 10 days.
