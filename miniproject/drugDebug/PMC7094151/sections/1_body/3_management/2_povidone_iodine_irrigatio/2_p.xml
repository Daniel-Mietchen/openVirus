<p>Povidone-iodine (PVI) is a broad-spectrum microbicide solution, which exists in multiple forms that are easily accessible, and a cost-effective disinfectant agent. Since its discovery, it has been routinely utilized in the medical field as an antiseptic agent for laboratory and surgical purposes. Furthermore, it has found much purpose in the ophthalmic setting as an effective disinfecting solution due to its proven toxicity against viruses, bacteria, parasites, fungi, yeasts, molds, and protozoans.
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Diluted forms of PVI are commercially sold as Betadine (Alcon Laboratories, Inc., Fort Worth, TX 76134) in 5% and 10% concentrations and can be further weakened as medical use requires. It is critical to note that, unlike other antiseptics, PVI does not lose antimicrobial activity with decreased available iodine concentration in solution when a diluent is added.
