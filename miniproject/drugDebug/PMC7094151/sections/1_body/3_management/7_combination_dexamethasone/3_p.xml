<p>When comparing PVI/dexamethasone combination treatment with that of dexamethasone alone, combination drops not only increase recovery but also, reduce the risk of development of SEIs more effectively than steroids alone.
 <xref rid="CIT0092" ref-type="bibr">92</xref> It is well documented that sole topical corticosteroid therapy has the risk of increased viral replication and prolonged shedding, further delaying the resolution of active infection. This significant treatment challenge is alleviated with the addition of PVI.
