<p>Gordon et al were the first to investigate NSAID effects on adenoviral replication, specifically ketorolac tromethamine and diclofenac sodium ophthalmic solutions. During both the early and late phases of infection, the effect of NSAIDs on viral titers did not differ from control groups, nor did it affect the duration of viral shedding. In contrast, prednisolone treatment was shown to prolong viral shedding.

This study suggests that NSAIDs are not likely to have any clinically significant antiviral effects.
