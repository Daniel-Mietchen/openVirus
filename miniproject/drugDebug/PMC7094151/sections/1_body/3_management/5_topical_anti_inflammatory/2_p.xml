<p>Research demonstrates that mild corticosteroid treatment administered topically approximately three times per day can significantly improve EKC symptoms and, if used in the short term, acute phase of the disease, does not lead to significant ocular side effects. There is also additional benefit in the use of topical corticosteroids once the acute phase of the infection resolves, for the remaining, persistent SEIs.
