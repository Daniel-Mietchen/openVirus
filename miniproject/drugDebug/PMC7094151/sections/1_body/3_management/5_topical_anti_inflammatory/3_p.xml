<p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are another alternative to corticosteroids, in that they are approved for topical, ocular use and exhibit anti-inflammatory effects without the substantial risk of glaucoma and cataract effect seen with steroid use. These agents work on the arachidonic acid pathway by inhibiting cyclooxygenase and, subsequently, the formation of prostaglandins, thromboxane, and prostacyclin. With specificity to ocular uses, they have been shown to be effective in cases of allergic conjunctivitis, alkali burns, herpetic uveitis, ocular trauma, and pre/post-operative cataract and refractive surgeries.
