<p>Asena et al also evaluated treatment options for acute adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis using either topical 1% prednisolone acetate in conjunction with non-preserved artificial tears, topical 2% Cyclosporine A with non-preserved artificial tears, or non-preserved artificial tears alone. In comparison to artificial tears alone, both the corticosteroid and cyclosporine groups exhibited improvement in symptoms as well as a shorter duration. Both the Cyclosporine A and prednisolone groups were also similarly effective in preventing the development of SEIs when used during the active phase of infection, suggesting possible prophylactic benefit.
