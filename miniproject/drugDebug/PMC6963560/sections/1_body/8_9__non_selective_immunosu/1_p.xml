<p>Plasma exchange has been considered for many years the option of choice for MCS, with or without kidney involvement, with the aim of obtaining clearance of circulating cryoglobulins from the plasma and lowering the deposition of ICs to the kidneys. Intravenous or oral administration of corticosteroids has been given to alleviate inflammation at glomerular level. However, steroids support progressive liver disease and replication of HCV [

Mycophenolate mofetil inhibits proliferation of T- and B-lymphocytes, thereby suppressing antibody synthesis and cell-mediated immune responses. Evidence on mycophenolate mofetil for HCV-associated glomerular disease is extremely limited [
