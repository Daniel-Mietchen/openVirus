<p>A good number of large databases have addressed the relationship between HCV and chronic kidney disease. According to a recent systematic review and meta-analysis, aggregating results of longitudinal studies (

 <italic>n </italic>= 2,299,134 unique patients) demonstrated a correlation between positive anti-HCV serologic status and increased frequency of CKD, the weighted estimate for adjusted HR with HCV across the surveys, 1.54 (95% CI, 1.26; 1.87,

An accelerated endothelial damage at kidney level (renal arteries and arterioles) has been cited to explain the detrimental role of HCV on the incidence and progression of CKD in the adult general population all over the world. Endothelial dysfunction in HCV-infected patients is in turn supported by oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory cytokines, peripheral or hepatic insulin resistance, or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) [
