<p>A role of chronic HCV infection in the pathogenesis of CKD has been suggested by several studies mostly performed in the last decade. The relationship between HCV and CKD is complex and shows bidirectional nature. Patients on maintenance dialysis remain at risk for HCV infection due to nosocomial transmission of HCV and have a high prevalence of HCV infection. On the other hand, a significant frequency of HCV infection has been noted in patients with renal insufficiency at pre-dialysis stage suggesting a role of HCV in developing CKD [
