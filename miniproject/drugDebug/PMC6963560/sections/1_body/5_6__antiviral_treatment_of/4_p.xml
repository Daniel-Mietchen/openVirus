<p>It is well known that the removal of HCV RNA from serum is frequently accompanied by clinical improvement of glomerular abnormalities. However, the clinical remission was incomplete or lacking in many patients (
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00176-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). HCV-related glomerular disease is not easily controlled by antiviral therapies, particularly in the case of proliferative or sclerotic injury. Also, information on DAAs efficacy in HCV-associated cryoglobulinemic vasculitis is disappointing due to the inability of these drugs to inhibit the immune-mediated process once it has been triggered. In other words, even with viral eradication, the course of mixed cryoglobulinemic disease or cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis is difficult to predict.
