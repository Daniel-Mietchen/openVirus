<p>The evidence shown in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00176-t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> is incomplete. As an example, the details on kidney disease (including kidney biopsy) at baseline and after antiviral therapy ended were frequently lacking, the information on type and dose of immunosuppressive therapy before, during and after antiviral therapies was not extensively given. The low incidence of HCV-related glomerular disease clearly hampers the conduction of RCTs or observational studies with large size.
