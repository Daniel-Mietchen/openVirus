<p>The natural history of HCV-induced mixed cryoglobulinemia is clinically variable. Some patients have an indolent course while others develop vasculitic lesions in various organs including kidneys. The exacerbation of extra-renal symptoms is often associated with a flare-up of kidney disease, but can occur independently. No link between serum complement or rheumatoid factor levels and the course of cryoglobulinemic glomerulonephritis has been noted. However, the clearance of HCV RNA from serum gives clinicians the opportunity to adopt immunosuppressive therapies with no concern on HCV replication.</p>
