<p>More than 71 million people have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection worldwide. HCV is a major health problem, and long lasting HCV results in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. HCV plays both a hepatotropic and lymphotropic activity and is an important antigenic stimulus for clonal B cell expansion. The detection of circulating cryoglobulins is frequent in patients with chronic HCV (up to 50%) but only 2–3% develop vasculitic symptoms that characterize HCV-mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome. HCV infection is the main cause of mixed cryoglobulinemia, a systemic vasculitis producing various clinical manifestations which range from the so-called MCS (purpura, asthenia, and arthralgias) to important abnormalities including neurological and renal diseases [

HCV-MCS is more frequent in women than men and affects patients with cirrhosis more commonly than chronic hepatitis. It appears that HCV-MCS is not affected by HCV genotype, viral load, or duration of HCV infection [
