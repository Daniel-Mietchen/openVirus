<p>We suggest caution about RTX administration as relevant side events have been observed following its use for cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. Prospective data from the AIR (Autoimmunity and Rituximab) registry, which includes data on patients who received RTX off-label, have reported that among patients (

One single dose of RTX for gastric lymphoma resulted in the occurrence of cholestatic hepatitis in a renal transplant (RT) recipient with chronic HCV. An enormous increase of HCV RNA levels after RTX administration was noted and the patient died due to bacterial pneumonia [
