<p>The efficacy and safety of combined antiviral therapy (pegylated IFN plus RBV) for the treatment of HCV-MCS in non-immunosuppressed population were also evaluated. 10 clinical studies (
 <italic>n </italic>= 300 unique patients) were retrieved. The frequency of kidney involvement at baseline ranged between 4% and 39%. The overall estimate of the frequency of SVR was 42% (95% CI, 31–54%). The pooled estimate of frequency of patients interrupting (or dose reducing) antiviral therapy was 15% (95% CI, 8–21%). A good correlation between viral and clinical response (weighted K = 0.63) by a meta-analysis at individual level on a subgroup of studies (
 <italic>n </italic>= 3, 
 <italic>n </italic>= 74 unique patients) was noted [
