<p>The identification of HCV and a better comprehension of the pathophysiological mechanisms of diseases have provided the possibility to treat HCV-associated glomerular disease with various approaches. (1) Antiviral therapy has been given with the idea that the underlying infection promotes the synthesis of immune complexes and resultant glomerular disease; (2) Nonspecific immunosuppressive agents (corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, etc.) lowering glomerular inflammation have been adopted by several authors; (3) An additional choice is given by rituximab (RTX), which selectively targets B cells and causes depletion of B cells. Thus, RTX diminishes the synthesis of IgM with rheumatoid factor (RF) activity that bind HCV-IgG immune-complexes; (4) RBV mono-therapy proved to be effective and safe in the treatment of HCV-induced glomerular disease post liver transplant due to its immunomodulatory properties [
