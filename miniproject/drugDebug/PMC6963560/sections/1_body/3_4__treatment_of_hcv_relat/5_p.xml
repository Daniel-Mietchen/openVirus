<p>A systematic review and meta-analysis concerning mono-therapy with conventional or pegylated IFN for HCV-MCS in the non-transplant setting was undertaken (
 <italic>n </italic>= 11 clinical studies, 
 <italic>n </italic>= 235 unique patients). It showed that the weighted estimate of frequency of sustained virological response was 15% (95% CI, 8â€“22%). The frequency of patients who interrupted antiviral therapy was 3.4% (most patients experienced minor adverse events which did not require discontinuation of therapy). An excellent relationship between virological and clinical response was found (weighted K = 0.72). Cirrhosis (
