<p>The most common glomerular disease in HCV-positive patients is cryoglobulinemic membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN). Other immune complex glomerular diseases associated with HCV are non-cryoglobulinemic GN, membranous nephropathy, IgA nephropathy, immunotactoid glomerulopathy/fibrillary glomerulonephritis (
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00176-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis and mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis are additional forms of glomerular disease observed in HCV-infected patients. Polyarteritis nodosa is another uncommon form of kidney disease associated with HCV. It is probably related to the IC deposition in medium-sized muscular arteries leading to ischemic changes in the glomeruli.
