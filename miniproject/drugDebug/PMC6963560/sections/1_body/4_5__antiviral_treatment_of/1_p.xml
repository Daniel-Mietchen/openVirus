<p>Direct-acting antiviral agents are molecules that affect the non-structural proteins of HCV and block HCV replication. Three groups of DAAs are now available for the treatment of HCV. These include NS3/4A protease inhibitors, NS5A inhibitors, and NS5B polymerase inhibitors [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-08-00176-f001">Figure 1</xref>]. The first-generation NS3/4A protease inhibitors (telaprevir and boceprevir) have been introduced for the treatment of HCV in combination with pegylated IFN and RBV (2011). The triple combined antiviral regimens (IFN/RBV/telaprevir or boceprevir) increased treatment success, but were poorly tolerated [
