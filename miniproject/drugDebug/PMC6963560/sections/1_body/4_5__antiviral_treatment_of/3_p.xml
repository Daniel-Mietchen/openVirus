<p>The American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) have issued clinical guidelines in order to recommend appropriate combinations of DAAs in patients with kidney impairment. These guidelines have been updated recently (September 2017) [
 <xref rid="B14-pathogens-08-00176" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. All patients with eGFR â‰¥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m
 <sup>2</sup> can be treated with any licensed DAA-based regimen. As listed in 
 <xref rid="pathogens-08-00176-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, three DAA-based regimens have been recommended for patients on maintenance dialysis or those with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m
 <sup>2</sup>. Sofosbuvir is the key drug of many DAA-based combinations that are currently available, but is not suggested in patients with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m
 <sup>2</sup> due to the accumulation of its active metabolite GS-331007. On the grounds of large surveys, we observed remarkable deterioration of kidney function following therapy with sofosbuvir-based regimens [

The daily fixed-dose elbasvir/grazoprevir regimen is recommended for the treatment of genotype 1 infection in patients with severe renal dysfunction. The C-SURFER study showed that the elbasvir/grazoprevir combination is effective in patients with HCV genotype 1 infection and CKD stage 4/5 [
 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00176" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, elbasvir/grazoprevir shows efficacy in patients with intact kidneys and HCV genotype 1 and 4. Thus, it has been extrapolated that elbasvir/grazoprevir is efficacious in patients with CKD stage 4/5 and HCV genotype 4. The EXPEDITION-4 trial found that the pangenotypic NS3/NS4A protease inhibitor glecaprevir and the pangenotypic NS5A inhibitor pibrentasvir provide a very high rate of viral response in patients with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 infection [
