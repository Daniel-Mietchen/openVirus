<p>Medical students and post-graduate trainees in internal medicine have poor knowledge of drug prescribing recommendations in older patients with renal impairment. As recommendations vary greatly between sources, it is necessary to prepare and popularize clear and complete guidelines of drug dosing in older patients with chronic kidney disease. The problem of dose adjustment in renal failure should be more emphasized during pre- and postgraduate education. Mobile- and computer-based supportive systems should be popularized to improve prescribing of drugs with renal recommendations.</p>
