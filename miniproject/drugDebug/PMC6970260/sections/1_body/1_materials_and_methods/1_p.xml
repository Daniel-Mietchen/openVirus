<p>We conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge of drug prescribing recommendations in older patients with eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73m
 <sup>2</sup> in two groups of respondents: 1) medical students at the Poznan University of Medical Sciences (Students); and 2) post-graduate trainees in internal medicine (Physicians). The pre-graduate education in medicine lasts 6 years. The questionnaires were filled out by the 4th year students at the beginning of clinical training in geriatrics. All students had completed a pharmacology course, and a clinical training in internal medicine earlier in the program of education. The physicians filled the questionnaires in during a course organized by our department as an obligatory part of a 3-year post-graduate training in internal medicine. Physicians from the whole country were enrolled to the course.
