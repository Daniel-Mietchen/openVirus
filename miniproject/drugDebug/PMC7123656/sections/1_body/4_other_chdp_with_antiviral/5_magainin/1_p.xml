<p id="Par72">Magainins are cationic host defence peptides that were originally identified in the skin and granular secretions of 
 <italic>Xenopuslaevis</italic> (the African clawed frog) (Zasloff 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">1987</xref>; Giovannini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1987</xref>), but have also been identified as inducible peptides in other species in the 
 <italic>Xenopus</italic> genus; 
 <italic>X. borealis, X. clivii, X. muelleri, X. petersii, X. amieti</italic> and 
 <italic>X. andrei</italic> (Conlon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). These peptides are 23â€“34 amino acids in length and the native peptides, together with synthetic derivatives, have been demonstrated to have broad antimicrobial activity against a range of bacterial pathogens (Zairi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2009</xref>; Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1988</xref>). There is, however, a limited amount of information on the activity of magainins against viral pathogens. One study has assessed the activity of a number of synthetic magainin derivatives against Herpes Simplex-1 virus, establishing that several peptide derivatives have the capacity to reduce viral plaque formation in in vitro assays (Egal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1999</xref>). Further evidence of antiviral activity of magainins was also revealed in a study by Chinchar et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>) which showed magainin II, but not magainin I, was able to reduce the infectivity of channel catfish virus (CCV) (Chinchar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>). However, both magainins exhibited less activity against frog virus 3, indicating that the activity was likely virus specific.
