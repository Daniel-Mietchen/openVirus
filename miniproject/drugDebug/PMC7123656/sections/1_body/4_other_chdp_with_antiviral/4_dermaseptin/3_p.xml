<p id="Par70">Dermaseptins S1-S5 shown to have direct and varying antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex Virus-1 in vitro (Belaid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2002</xref>). This study identified Dermaseptin S4 as having the most potent antiviral activity, but only at very early stages in the viral infection process as experiments suggested that it exerted an effect when exposed to the virus prior to infection or during viral attachment. A later study further evaluated the activity of Dermaseptin S1 and derivatives against Herpes Simplex Virus, demonstrating that the antiviral activity of the parent peptide could be increased by alteration of the original sequence (Savoia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2010</xref>). Interestingly, the same study also showed that some of the derivatives also exhibited activity against Papillomavirus Psv-16 in vitro, but with very low cytotoxicity towards the host cells. A recent study by Bergaoui et al. also demonstrated that Dermaseptin S4 and synthetic derivatives exhibited activity against Herpes Simplex Virus-2 with reduced cytotoxicity, although in vivo efficacy remains to be determined (Bergaoui et al.
