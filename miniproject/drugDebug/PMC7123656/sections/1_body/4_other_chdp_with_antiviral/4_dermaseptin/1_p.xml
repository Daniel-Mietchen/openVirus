<p id="Par68">There have been a substantial number (~1000) Host Defence Peptides identified from amphibian skin, of which Dermaseptins are a superfamily. These host defence peptides have a cationic charge due to an abundance of lysine residues, and tend to be between 27â€“34 amino acids in size (Amiche et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1994</xref>). They have been found in several species of frogs, including the Hylidae (tree frogs) and the Ranidae (true frogs) (Nicolas and El Amri

 <italic>Phyllomedusa</italic>, was shown to have immunomodulatory activity via an ability to stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species and myeloperoxidase by primary human neutrophils (Ammar et al.

Dermaseptin S2 has also been touted as a potential therapeutic molecule in the treatment of cancer in a recent study demonstrating antitumor and angiostatic activity in a range of tumour cell types, likely due to the induction of necrosis (van Zoggel et al.
