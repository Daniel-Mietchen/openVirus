<p id="Par76">More recently, it has been demonstrated that the native melittin peptide showed antiviral activity towards Junin virus (Albiol Matanic and Castilla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>), and that synthetic melittin analogues showed activity towards Tobacco Mosaic Virus (Marcos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">1995</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study by Falco et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>) used melittin-loaded liposomes to specifically target fish viral hemorrhagic septicemia rhabdovirus (VHSV) (Falco et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>). The authors coated the immunoliposomes with antibodies targeting the surface G glycoprotein of VHSV, and showed a reduction in infectivity of greater than 95Â %. This approach provides an exciting avenue for the targeted delivery of antiviral host defence peptides whilst minimizing cytotoxic damage to host cells.
