<p id="Par73">Melittin is an alpha helical peptide that is 26 amino acids in length and was initially identified in bee venom (Habermann and Jentsch 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1967</xref>) and later characterized as an amphipathic peptide with broad ranging antimicrobial activity (Terwilliger and Eisenberg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">1982</xref>; Wade et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">1992</xref>). The native melittin peptide and synthetic analogues have been investigated in a number of studies as potential novel antimicrobial therapeutics, but their well-characterized antiviral activity against a number of pathogens is of particular interest.
