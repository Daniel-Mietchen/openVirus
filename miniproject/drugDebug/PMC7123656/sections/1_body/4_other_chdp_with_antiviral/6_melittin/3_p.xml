<p id="Par75">Several studies have also characterized the influence of melittin, and synthetic derivatives upon the establishment and progression of Herpes Simplex Virus infection. Baghian et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>) synthesized a number of derivatives based upon the original melittin structure to assess their antiviral activity against HSV-1 virus. One such peptide was called Hecate, which has an altered amino sequence that changes the distribution of charged residues within the peptide without altering the overall amphipathic α-helical structure (Baghian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1997</xref>). The authors determined that Hecate prevented HSV-1 plaque formation and prevented virus spread in in vitro models while some synthetic melittin analogues were unable to do so, suggesting that sequence played an important role in the antiviral activity of the peptide. A later study screened a number of known CHDP against HSV-1 and HSV-2 and established that many of the α-helical peptides screened (including magainins, cecropins and cathelicidin) did not display activity against the viruses (Yasin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">2000</xref>). However, melittin did have substantial activity against both HSV-1 and HSV-2, although the mechanism underlying this observation was not fully described.
