<p id="Par74">One of the first studies to assess the antiviral activity of melittin was published Wachinger et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">1992</xref>) which identified that melittin and six derivatives reduced HIV-1 replication in host cells (Wachinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">1992</xref>). A subsequent study revealed that the mechanism underlying this inhibition was that melittin was capable of specifically reducing HIV-associated gene expression in the host cell while not affecting the overall gene expression profile (Wachinger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">1998</xref>). This suggests an important immunomodulatory role for this peptide, rather than direct antiviral activity, as potentially contributing to the treatment of HIV infection.
