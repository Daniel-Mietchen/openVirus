<p id="Par24">Vaccinia virus (VV) is an enveloped poxvirus, of the family 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic>, which is the active constituent of the vaccine that eradicated smallpox. It has been demonstrated that individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) have a predisposition to develop eczema 
 <italic>vaccinatum</italic> in response to the vaccine, and that, in these individuals, the expression of hCAP18 is reduced (Howell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2006</xref>). It has been shown that in normal skin biopsies, the expression of LL-37 was induced by vaccinia virus, but this was not observed in not in AD skin. Furthermore, a study by Howell et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2004</xref>) demonstrated that both LL-37 and the murine cathelicidin, mCRAMP, have antiviral activity against vaccinia virus, and the antiviral mechanism by which LL-37 exerts its effect involves the removal of the outer membrane of vaccinia virus, thus causing envelope damage (Howell et al.
