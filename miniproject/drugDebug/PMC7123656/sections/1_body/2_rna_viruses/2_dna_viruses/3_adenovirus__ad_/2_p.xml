<p id="Par30">A study by Gordon et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>) investigated the antiviral activity of LL-37 against different adenovirus serotypes (Ad19, Ad8, Ad5 and Ad3) (Gordon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2005</xref>). LL-37 demonstrated a significant reduction of Ad19 titer in vitro (2 log reduction over 4Â h). This study also provided some insight on a potential antiviral mechanism of cathelicidins, based on the comparison of HSV and Ad19 time-kill assays. The data demonstrated a rapid killing of HSV-1 which suggested a disruption of the viral lipid membrane as a possible mechanism. Several other studies have also proposed similar mechanisms for other cathelicidins (Robinson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">1998</xref>; Albiol Matanic and Castilla 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>; Dean et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref>). Interestingly, for the Ad19 strain, LL-37 produced a much slower progressive reduction in virus titers. As adenovirus lacks a viral envelope, this suggests that the direct antiviral mechanism of cathelicidins does not involve membrane disruption. Alternative mechanisms have been proposed such as disruption of the adenovirus particles (detergent-effect) and/or blockage of viral entry into the cell.
