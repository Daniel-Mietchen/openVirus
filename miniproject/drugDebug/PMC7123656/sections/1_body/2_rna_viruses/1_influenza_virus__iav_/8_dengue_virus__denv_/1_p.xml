<p id="Par22">Dengue virus (DENV) is an enveloped member of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family which causes dengue feverâ€”a mosquito-borne tropical disease. An important target for antiviral therapies against dengue virus is NS2B/NS3 serine protease, as disruption of NS2B/NS3 serine protease functions inhibit virus replication. A study by Tambunan and Alamudi (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2010</xref>) demonstrated that cationic cyclic peptides have a high potential to inhibit NS2B/NS3 serine protease activities of dengue virus (Tambunan and Alamudi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2010</xref>). A more recent study proposed that protegrin-1 (PG-1), a cationic cyclic peptide which was originally isolated from porcine blood cells, is able to inhibit NS2B/NS3 serine protease activity, thus translating to reduced viral replication in vitro (Rothan et al.
