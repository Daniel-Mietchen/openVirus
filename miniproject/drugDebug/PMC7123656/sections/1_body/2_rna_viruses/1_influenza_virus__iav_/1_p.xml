<p id="Par11">Influenza virus (IAV) is an enveloped virus from the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2006</xref>). There is a well-established global vaccination programme in place for preventing influenza infection on an annual basis, but this is limited to protecting against the prevalent circulating strains, and therefore emerging new strains can potentially lead to a global pandemic outbreak. Antiviral treatments are available, although the emerging resistance of circulating strains to neurominidase inhibitors, one of the current front-line treatment, is of serious concern (Nitsch-Osuch and Brydak
