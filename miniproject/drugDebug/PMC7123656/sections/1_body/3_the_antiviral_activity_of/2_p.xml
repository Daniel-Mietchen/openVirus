<p id="Par33">Neutrophil α-defensins (HNPs 1–4) are mainly synthesized as prepropeptides in promyelocytes in the bone marrow, and the mature peptide is stored in the granules of neutrophils. These peptides are found in lower concentrations in NK-cells, B-cells, γδ T-cells, monocytes, macrophages and immature dendritic cells (Rehaume and Hancock
