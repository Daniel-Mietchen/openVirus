<p id="Par32">Defensins are small, cysteine-rich cationic peptides that act as important effectors of the innate immune system (Ding et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>; Ganz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>). Human defensins are classified according to their structure, α and β-defensins differing in their disulphide bond pairing, and θ-defensins, being present in Old World monkeys, displaying a circular structure (Lehrer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2004</xref>). Of note, despite RNA transcripts for θ-defensins are found in human bone marrow cells, a premature stop codon prevents protein translation (Nguyen et al.
