<p id="Par58">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected over 8000 individuals in 2002–2003, causing almost 800 deaths, underscoring the importance of testing antiviral agents (Peiris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2003</xref>). It has been shown that intranasal injections of ~125 μg RTD-1 peptide prior to virus inoculation protected BALB/c mice against a mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV (Wohlford-Lenane et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">2009</xref>). Of note, untreated animals exhibited around 75 % mortality rate, whereas treated ones showed a 100 % survival. RTD-1 treatment altered lung cytokine responses to the virus, suggesting immunomodulatory effects where at least in part, behind the protective action of RTD-1. Interestingly
