<p id="Par53">Rhinovirus is a major cause of common cold and it is associated with asthma exacerbations (Jartti and Korppi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). It has been demonstrated that RV16 infection of primary bronchial epithelial cells results in the induction of hBD2 and hBD3 mRNA, whereas hBD1 remains unaltered (Duits et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2003</xref>). It was also demonstrated that the same serotype also upregulated hBD2 mRNA and protein in A549 alveolar epithelial cells. Interestingly this effect was conserved in other major group serotype HRV-14 or in 2 minor group serotypes such as HRV-2 and HRV-1A.
