<p id="Par54">Further work has investigated the inoculation of human subjects divided into non-smokers, smokers and COPD groups with RV-16 (Proud et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1950</xref>). Interestingly, a larger proportion of smokers (78.6 %) were successfully inoculated with the virus, compared to those with COPD (66.7 %) or non-smokers (58 %). RV16 was shown to increase α-defensin secretion in the sputum 9 days post-infection compared to baseline, but this was only observed in the COPD group (Mallia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2012</xref>). RV-16 infection also resulted in increased neutrophil elastase, which may subsequently degrade secreted host defence peptides.
