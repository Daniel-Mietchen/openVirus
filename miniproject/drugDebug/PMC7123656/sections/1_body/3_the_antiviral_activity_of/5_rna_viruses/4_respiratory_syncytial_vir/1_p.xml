<p id="Par52">Defensins are expressed at high concentrations in the inflamed lung, and are usually upregulated during viral infections of the airway epithelia. In this context, it has been demonstrated that RSV infection increased hBD2 secretion by alveolar A549 cells, which was subsequently able to block further viral entry by directly disrupting the viral envelope (Kota et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2008</xref>). Interestingly RSV did not induce the expression of hBD1, as this is constitutive, but hBD1 lacked direct anti-RSV activity. Although alveolar macrophages are permissive to RSV infection, they do not tend to influence the later development of disease (Pribul et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2008</xref>). However, this interaction can result in increased secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can impact on Î²-defensin expression in the lungs (Becker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1950</xref>).
