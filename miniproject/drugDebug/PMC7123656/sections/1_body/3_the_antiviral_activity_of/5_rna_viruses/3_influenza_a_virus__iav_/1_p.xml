<p id="Par51">Early studies have reported HNP-1-3 activity against the A/WSN (H1N1) strain of IAV (Daher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1986</xref>). More detailed work has shown that HNP-1 affects influenza replication by blocking the PKC signalling pathway on host cells, needed for viral endosomal trafficking (Salvatore et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2007</xref>). It was shown that HNP-1 did not have a direct impact on viral particles, but did increase viral clearance by neutrophils (Tecle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2007</xref>). A similar effect was also observed with HNP-2, HD5 and to a lesser extent with hBD2 but not with HNP-3 or hBD1. Another β-defensin, hBD3, was also shown to block IAV infection by blocking hemagglutinin-mediated fusion and immobilizing membrane proteins (Leikina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2005</xref>). Interestingly, RC2 also showed similar effects to hBD3. Of note, murine β-defensin 2 and 3 (mBD2 and mBD3) protected mice from infection with the A/PR/8 (H1N1) IAV strain, and in similarity to their human analogues, their activity was attributed to impaired viral entry (Gong et al.
