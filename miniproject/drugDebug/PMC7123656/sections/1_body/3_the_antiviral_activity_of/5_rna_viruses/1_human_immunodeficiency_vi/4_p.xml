<p id="Par49">Given the interest in the broad antiviral effects of defensins, rhesus macaque θ-defensins (RTD) and synthetic retrocyclins (RC) have been also tested for their anti-HIV activity. RC-1 and RC-2 were shown to bind glycosylated gp120 and CD4, thus explaining the previously observed protective activity (Cole et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2002</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2003</xref>). Interestingly, RTD peptides also showed anti-HIV activity (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2004</xref>). Further work demonstrated that RC-1 was able to block HIV-1 fusion with target cells (Gallo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>). Finally, rhesus macaque α-defensins 4 (RMAD 4) also showed anti-HIV activity at 150 μg/ml by blocking viral entry (Tanabe et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">2004</xref>). Interestingly, the same study showed that cryptidin-3 (a mouse derived α-defensin) actually increased HIV-1 replication. In this regard, guinea pig, rabbit and rat α-defensins have also been tested for anti-HIV activity, demonstrating an ability to inhibit infection of T-cell lines (Nakashima et al.
