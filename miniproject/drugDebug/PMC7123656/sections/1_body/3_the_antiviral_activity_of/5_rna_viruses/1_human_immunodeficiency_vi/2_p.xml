<p id="Par47">In stark contrast to HNP1-3, HD5 and HD6 seem to increase viral infectivity without any blockage of post-entry viral events (Klotman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>). Further assessment of this unexpected effect suggested that HD5 and HD6 actually enhance viral attachment to the cells (Rapista et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2011</xref>). Another study, however, showed HD5 to inhibit HIV infection by blocking gp120â€“CD4 interaction (Furci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2012</xref>). Further work is needed to clarify HD5 effects on the HIV infection process, particularly when considering sexually transmitted infections may increase HD5 and HD6 secretions in the genital mucosa prior to a possible HIV infection (Klotman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2008</xref>).
