<p id="Par48">Given the importance of HIV interaction with mucosal surfaces, β-defensin impact on HIV infection has also been investigated. HIV was shown to upregulate hBD2 and hBD3 release by human oral epithelial cells, and incubation of viral particles with these peptides protected cells from infection (Quiñones-Mateu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2003</xref>). Interestingly, hBD1 was neither upregulated nor protective in this context. However, hBD2 and hBD3 did appear to act both directly on viral particles, and also on the host cell, by downregulating CXCR4 expression. Accordingly, these peptides were found to be more effective against X4 viral isolates. A later study found a similar anti-HIV activity of hBD2 and hBD3 to both X4 and R5 strains, indicating that defensin treatment inhibited early products of reverse transcription (Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2005</xref>).
