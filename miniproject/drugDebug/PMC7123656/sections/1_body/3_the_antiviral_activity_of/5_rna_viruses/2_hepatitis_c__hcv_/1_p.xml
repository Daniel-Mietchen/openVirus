 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2008</xref>). HCV infection is estimated to affect 170 million people worldwide, is frequently asymptomatic, and spontaneous clearance is seen in a third of infected individuals. Chronic infection (with viral replication detected for more than 6Â months) leads to hepatic complications. Little is known about the capacity of defensins to impact viral hepatitis. However, it has been shown that HCV core protein have been shown to activate the transcription of alpha-defensin genes, indicating that they may play a role in the innate immune response to the virus (Aceti et al.
