<p id="Par44">In the context of CHDP activity against this virus, super physiological concentrations (100 and 200 μg/ml) of HNP-1 peptide were shown to directly inhibit CMV viral particles reducing the PFU/ml by 0.29 and 0.81 log
 <sub>10</sub>, respectively (Daher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1986</xref>). However, this virus notably showed less susceptibility to HNP-1 compared to HSV-1, which was also assessed in the same study.
