<p id="Par41">HNP1 and HD5 were shown to reduce viral V-protein expression in VERO cells when incubated directly with the virus at 20 or 50 μg/ml for 1 h, while hBD2 only was effective at 50 μg/ml. In contrast, hBD1 showed no inhibitory effect (Dugan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>). When the direct antiviral effect of defensins was studied further, HD5 was shown to interact directly with BK virus particles, inducing aggregation, and thus reducing viral attachment to cell membranes. Of note, similar antiviral effects of HD5 were also observed against other related polyomaviruses such as simian virus-40 (SV40). It was also shown that both HNP-1 and HD5 were also able to block adenovirus escape from endosomes.
