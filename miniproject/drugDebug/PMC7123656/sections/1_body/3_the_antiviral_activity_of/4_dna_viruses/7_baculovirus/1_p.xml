<p id="Par45">Baculovirus naturally infects insect larvae hosts, usually 
 <italic>Lepidoptera</italic> (Butterflies and moths), with no known diseases caused by this virus in organisms others than arthropods (Airenne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2013</xref>). Due to its efficient reproduction cycle and ability to carry large DNA inserts, baculovirus are extensively used as tools for gene delivery and recombinant production of proteins in insect cells. Baculovirus gp64 protein allows viral fusion in an acidified endosome, an event seen upon infection of 
 <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> insect cells, resulting in gp64 expression and the formation of cell syncytia (Leikina et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2005</xref>). However, it has been shown that RC-2 peptide is capable of blocking baculovirus fusion with host cells, inhibiting the virus-mediated syncytium formation.
