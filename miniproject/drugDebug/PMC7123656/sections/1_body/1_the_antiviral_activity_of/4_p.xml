<p id="Par9">In contrast to humans and mice, which only express one cathelicidin, pigs express a variety of cathelicidins which differ in activity and structure. The porcine cathelicidins include five different protegrins (PGs), three Î±-helical peptides (PMAP-23, -36, -37), two prophenins (PF-1, -2) and the PR-39 peptide (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">2000</xref>). PGs are produced and stored by porcine neutrophils as inactive propeptides but are proteolytically cleaved into their active forms by neutrophil elastase in the extracellular environment. Their expression is enhanced by bacterial LPS, IL-6, retinoic acid and salmonella infections (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">2000</xref>) and PG-1 has been shown to have the broadest antimicrobial activity spectrum (Yasin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">1996a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">b</xref>). Cathelicidins have also been characterized in many other species, such as sheep, monkeys, horses and cows. In sheep, eight cathelin-associated peptides have been identified and SMAP-29 (sheep myeloid antimicrobial peptide 29) is one of the most potent cationic host defence peptide known in terms of antimicrobial activity, having a wide spectrum of activity against bacteria, fungi and virus (Tomasinsig and Zanetti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2005</xref>).
