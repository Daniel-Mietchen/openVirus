<p id="Par7">Cathelicidins were first identified in bovine neutrophils and are widely distributed in mammals including humans, rhesus monkeys, rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep, cows, horses and dogs and also in non-mammalian species including chicken, rainbow trout and hagfish (Zanetti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">1993</xref>). In humans, only one cathelicidin has been described—the cationic antimicrobial peptide of 18kDa (hCAP18), which can be found at high concentrations in the specific granules of neutrophils and can be expressed by epithelial cells of skin and mucosa of the respiratory, urogenital and gastrointestinal tracts (De et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2000</xref>). hCAP18 is cleaved extracellularly by proteinase-3 to generate its active form LL-37, a linear 37 aminoacids peptide with two leucine residues at the N-terminal and an amphipathic α-helical structure (Sorensen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2001</xref>). The peptide is known to be expressed by macrophages, eosinophils, lymphocytes, mast cells and NK, T- and B-cells (Agerberth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>).
