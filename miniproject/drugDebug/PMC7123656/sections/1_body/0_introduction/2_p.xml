<p id="Par3">The antiviral activity of Cationic Host Defence Peptides (CHDP; also known as antimicrobial peptides) is of increasing interest for informing the development of novel antiviral therapeutics. Due to their broad spectrum activity, CHDP play a key role in the innate immune response to both bacterial and viral pathogens. In addition, CHDP have substantial immunomodulatory activities that can contribute to the rapid clearance of infections. Therefore, a better understanding of the antiviral and immunomodulatory activities of CHDP in the context of viral infection will be of great importance in the race to develop new treatments that are broadly effective against viral pathogens.</p>
