<p id="Par2">The ongoing mortality and disease associated with circulating viral infections of humans and animals, together with the ongoing threat of emerging viral strains underscores the requirement for the development of novel antiviral molecules. While vaccination against common viral pathogens is effective and desirable, direct antiviral therapeutics play a key role in treating diseases caused by viral pathogens that have no vaccine, that lack a global vaccination programme, or those with vaccines of limited efficacy. In addition, as the resistance of viral pathogens to common antiviral drugs increases, new classes of antiviral molecules could provide a strategy for treatment of both existing and emerging infections for decades to come.</p>
