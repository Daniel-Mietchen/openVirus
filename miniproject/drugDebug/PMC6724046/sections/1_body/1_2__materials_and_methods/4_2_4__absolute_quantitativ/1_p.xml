<p>Absolute quantification PCR was used to evaluate the anti-CPV effect. Total DNA was isolated from SD6 infected F81 cells using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacture’s instruction. CPV specific primers VP2-F 5′-CAAATAGAGCATTGGGCTTACC-3’ and VP2-R 5’-TCCCATTTGAGTTACACCACG-3’ were used to amplify the 119-bp fragment. The obtained fragment was cloned into pMD
 <sup>®</sup>18-T (Takara, Shiga, Japan), and the resulting positive clone was named pMD-VP2S for further use. To evaluate the antiviral effects of the three drugs of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium and Closantel, F81 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 7.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well and pretreated with the 3 drugs at a final concentrations of 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM, respectively, for 1 h, then treated cells were infected with CPV at MOI of 0.076 as described above. Cells treated with 0.1% DMSO were used as control. After 40 h incubation, total DNA was extracted from whole cell lysates by QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The quantitative standard curve was generated via quantitative real-time PCR of the plasmid pMD-VP2S preparations at serial dilutions of 10
 <sup>6</sup>, 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup>, 10
 <sup>3</sup>, 10
 <sup>2</sup>, and 10 copies/μL. Each 20 μL qPCR reaction mixture contained 1 μL 10-fold diluted sample, 10 μL SuperReal PreMix Plus (SYBR Green) (TianGen Biotech, Beijing, China), and 0.2 μM of specific primers. All mixtures were then loaded into a StepOne Plus qPCR machine (Applied Biosystems, USA). The qPCR procedure was of 3 min at 95 °C, followed by 45 cycles of 5 s at 95 °C, and 30 s at 60 °C. The absolute number of DNA copies of the VP2 gene in the cells was determined according to the generated standard curve.
