<p>Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to further evaluate the antiviral effects of identified drugs. F81 cells in 96-well plates (2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) were pretreated with 4 μL prediluted Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel at final concentrations of 5 μM, 10 μM, and 20 μM, respectively, for 1 h, then treated cells were infected with 10 μL CPV at MOI of 0.076. After 30 h postinfection, cells were fixed with 80% acetone, and then incubated with a 1:100 dilution of mouse anti-VP2 monoclonal antibody (INGENASA, Madrid, Spain) for 40 min, followed by incubation with a 1:200 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated Goat anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Highly Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Finally, the cells were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in order to label cell nuclei in focus. After washing, the cells were examined with High Content imaging System (Operetta, PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at 20× magnification.
