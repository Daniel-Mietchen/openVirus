<p>Dose response experiments were performed to test CC
 <sub>50</sub>s and EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of drugs as described above with minor modifications. For CC
 <sub>50</sub> assays, 96 μL of F81 cells (2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) was mixed with 4 μL prediluted drugs at final concentrations ranging from 0.0024–160 μM. For EC
 <sub>50</sub> assays, 86 μL of F81 cells (2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) was pretreated with 4 μL prediluted drugs at final concentrations ranging from 0.0024–160 μM for 1 h, and then treated cells were infected with 10 μL CPV at an MOI of 0.076. Both CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> assays were done in triplicate. Cell cytotoxicity and inhibition of CPV infection were both examined after 40 h incubation using the TransDetect
 <sup>®</sup> Cell Counting Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China). The CC
 <sub>50</sub> and EC
 <sub>50</sub> values were calculated via a best-fit Log (dose)-response curve-fitting in GraphPad Prism software (version 7.00, La Jolla, CA, USA) [
