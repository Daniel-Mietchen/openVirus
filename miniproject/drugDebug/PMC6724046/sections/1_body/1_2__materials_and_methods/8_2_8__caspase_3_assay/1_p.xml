<p>F81 cells were seeded in 96-well plates (2.5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells/well) and pretreated with 4 μL Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel with final concentrations of 10 μM, then infected with CPV (MOI = 0.076). Cells were incubated for 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The assay was performed in triplicates. Caspase-Glo 3/7 assay kit (Promega, USA) was used to detect pro- or antiapoptotic effects of the identified drugs [
