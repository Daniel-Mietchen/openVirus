<p>CPV is a widely distributed virus and contains at least three main subspecies: CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Currently, commercial vaccines cannot provide complete protection against all CPV variants. Moreover, no effective drug is available to control CPV infection except for supportive and symptom-based care. Hence, it is important to develop an alternative treatment against CPV infection. In this study, we developed a CPE-based assay to screen CPV inhibitors from a FDA-approved drug library, and successfully identified three FDA-approved CPV inhibitors. These drugs might provide potential treatment options for anti-CPV infections.
