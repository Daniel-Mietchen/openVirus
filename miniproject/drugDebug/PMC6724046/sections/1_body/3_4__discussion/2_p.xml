<p>Although the selectivity index (SI) of Gemcitabine HCl, Cladribine, Gemcitabine, and Trifluridine were at a higher level (
 <xref rid="viruses-11-00742-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), the percentage CPE inhibition of the four drugs was always maintained at a lower level (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00742">Figure S1</xref>). The maximum percentage CPE inhibitions for the drugs were between 51.80 ± 2.48 and 68.37 ± 7.79, which are relatively lower CPE inhibition levels that would not increase with increased drug concentration. Therefore, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel were selected for further study.
