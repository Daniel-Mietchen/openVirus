<p>The antiviral mechanism of Nitazoxanide remains unclear for now. Nitazoxanide could impair the terminal glycosylation of the influenza A hemagglutinin protein or the formation of E1-E2 (Rubella virus surface glycoproteins) complex of the Rubella virus (RV), thus affecting the assembly of influenza A virus and RV, respectively [
