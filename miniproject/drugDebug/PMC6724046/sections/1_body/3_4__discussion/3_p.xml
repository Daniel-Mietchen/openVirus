<p>As mentioned above, the identified drugs Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel can reduce the copy numbers of CPV viral DNA to 0.07%, 24.04%, and 20.83%, respectively, compared with the 0.1% DMSO-treated control (

Western blot showed that 10 μM Nitazoxanide treatment reduced relative VP2 expression in three CPV variants SD6, SD3, and BJ-1 to 9.68%–36.29%, and the reduction rates following 10 μM Closantel Sodium and Closantel treatment were 12.83%–23.85% and 10.78%–30.1%, respectively (
