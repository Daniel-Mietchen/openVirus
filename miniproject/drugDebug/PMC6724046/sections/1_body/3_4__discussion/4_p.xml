<p>In previous studies, two drugs Oseltamivir and Cidofovir were added in the second round of screening. As a neuraminidase (NA) inhibitor, Oseltamivir has been used to treat the human influenza virus. Savigny and Macintire (2010) used Oseltamivir for CPV enteritis and found that the Oseltamivir-treated group gained a significant increase of weight and had no changes in white blood cell (WBC) count compared to the control group; however, the authors also reported that no obvious advantage had been established [
