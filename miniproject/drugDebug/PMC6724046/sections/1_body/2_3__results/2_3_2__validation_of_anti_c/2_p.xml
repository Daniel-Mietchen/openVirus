<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00742-f004">Figure 4</xref>, CPV infection could be inhibited in the presence of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel at a concentration of 5 μM. Few cells were CPV-positive when treated with 10 μM of the drugs. Almost no green signals were detected in all F81 cells treated with 20 μM of the drugs. The results confirmed that these identified drugs inhibited CPV infection in a dose-dependent manner, which was consistent with the qPCR assay results.
