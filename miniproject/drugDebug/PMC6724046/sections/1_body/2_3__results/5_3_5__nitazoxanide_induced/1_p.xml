<p>Doley et al. (2014) reported that CPV could induce caspase-dependent (involving extrinsic, intrinsic, and endoplasmic reticulum pathways) apoptosis in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-11-00742" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In order to evaluate whether drug-associated apoptosis was involved in the antiviral effect, we measured the caspase-3 activity of drug-treated cells with or without CPV infection. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-11-00742-f007">Figure 7</xref>, the antiapoptotic effects were observed within 12 h in Nitazoxanide-treated F81 cells with or without CPV infection. Therefore, Nitazoxanide-associated caspase activation reduction (apoptosis) might be involved in the antiviral effect of the drug. Closantel Sodium- or Closantel-treated cells had no pro- or antiapoptotic effects (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-11-00742">Figure S2</xref>); hence, the antiviral effects of these two drugs may not be due to drug-associated apoptosis.
