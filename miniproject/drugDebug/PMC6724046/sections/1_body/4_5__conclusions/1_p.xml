<p>In this study, which is aimed at identifying anti-CPV drugs for potential therapeutic use, a CPE-based assay was developed for screening CPV inhibitors from an FDA-approved drug library. After screening, the top three drugs, Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel, with higher percentage CPE inhibition, were selected and further confirmed by qPCR and IFA. In addition, the identified drugs can inhibit different subspecies of CPV variants and displayed broad-spectrum antiviral activity against CPV. Hence, these drugs may provide potential options for the treatment of CPV infection.</p>
