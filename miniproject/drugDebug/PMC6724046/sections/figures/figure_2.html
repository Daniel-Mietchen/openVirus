 <caption> Evaluation of cytotoxicity and anti-CPV efficacy of three identified drugs. Dose-dependent curves show cell viability of F81 cells with 2-fold serial dilution concentrations of Nitazoxanide ( A), Closantel Sodium ( B), and Closantel ( C). Dose-dependent curves show the anti-CPV efficacy of 2-fold serially diluted Nitazoxanide ( D), Closantel Sodium ( E), and Closantel ( F). Error bars represent standard errors from three independent experiments. The CC 50s and EC 50s were determined by a best-fit Log(dose)-response curve-fitting in GraphPad Prism 7. </caption>
