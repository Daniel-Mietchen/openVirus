 <caption> The antiviral effects of the identified drugs were analyzed by quantification of viral DNAs. F81 cells seeded in 6-well plates were pretreated with 5 μM, 10 μM, or 20 μM of Nitazoxanide ( A), Closantel Sodium ( B), or Closantel ( C) before CPV infection. Total DNA was extracted at 40 hpi from whole cell lysates. The absolute number of copies of the VP2 gene in the cells was determined according to the generated standard curve. Error bars represent standard errors from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was normalized to Control (0.1% DMSO-treated cells, marked as D in the figure) and carried out using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.005; **** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
