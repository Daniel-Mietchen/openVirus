  <p>Potential broad-spectrum anti-CPV activity of identified drugs. F81 cells were seeded in 6-well plates and pretreated with 5 μM, 10 μM, or 20 μM of Nitazoxanide (
   <bold>A</bold>), Closantel Sodium (
   <bold>B</bold>), or Closantel (
   <bold>C</bold>) for 1 h, respectively. Then treated cells were infected with various CPV strains SD6, SD3 or BJ-1. Cells were harvested and lysed at 40 hpi for western blot analysis. Band intensities were then measured using software Image J, and VP2 expression was analyzed and compared to beta Actin expression. Relative expression levels for Nitazoxanide- (
   <bold>D</bold>), Closantel Sodium- (
   <bold>E</bold>), and Closantel (
   <bold>F</bold>)-treated results are presented in bar graphs. Error bars represent standard errors from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was compared to Control (0.1% DMSO-treated cells, marked as D in the figure) and carried out using one-way ANOVA and Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test. *
