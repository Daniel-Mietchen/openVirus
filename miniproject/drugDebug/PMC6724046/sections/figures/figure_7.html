 <caption> Caspase 3/7 activity of Nitazoxanide treated F81 cells. F81 cells were pretreated with 0.1% DMSO, Z-VAD-FMK (as a control to inhibit apoptosis), or Nitazoxanide for 1 h, then Caspase 3/7 activity of F81 cells with or without CPV infection were analyzed at 4 hpi, 8 hpi, 12 hpi, and 24 hpi. Statistical analysis was carried out using one-way ANOVA and Dunnettâ€™s multiple comparisons test. * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.005; **** p &lt; 0.001 (compared to 0.1% DMSO-treated cells without CPV infection, at each time point). # p &lt; 0.05; ## p &lt; 0.01; ### p &lt; 0.005; #### p &lt; 0.001 (compared to 0.1% DMSO-treated cells with CPV infection, at each time point). </caption>
