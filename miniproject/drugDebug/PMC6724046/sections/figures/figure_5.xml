  <p>Time of addition analysis of the antiviral effects of identified drugs. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Timeline of time of addition assay. F81 cells were inoculated with CPV and treated with 10 μM Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel, respectively, at different time points, designated prior to infection (−1 h), during infection (0 h), postinfection (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, or 6 h). Antiviral effects were determined according to the percentage CPE inhibition. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Percentage CPE inhibition of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, and Closantel added at different time points, presented in bar graphs. Error bars represent standard errors from three independent experiments.
