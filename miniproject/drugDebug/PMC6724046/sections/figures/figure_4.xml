  <p>The antiviral effects of identified drugs were analysed via IFA. F81 cells were treated with 0.1% DMSO (Control) or 5 μM, 10 μM, or 20 μM of Nitazoxanide, Closantel Sodium, or Closantel before CPV infection. Then cells were fixed with 80% acetone at about 30 hpi and immunostained for VP2 protein (green), while nuclei (blue) were stained with DAPI.</p>
