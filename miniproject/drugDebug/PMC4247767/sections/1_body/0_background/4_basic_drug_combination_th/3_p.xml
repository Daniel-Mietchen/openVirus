<p>where the right hand side of Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>) is identical to the left side of Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">1</xref>). When CI &lt; 1, the relationship is synergetic, when CI = 1, it is additive, and when CI &gt; 1, it is antagonistic. For example, suppose that 4 μM of drug A and 5 μM of drug B exert the same effect as a combination of 1 μM of A and 2 μM of B. Substituting these concentrations into Eq. (
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">2</xref>), we obtain 
 <italic>CI</italic> = 0.65 (=1/4 + 2/5 &lt; 1), implying that the drug combination is synergistic. Note that the 
 <italic>CI</italic> does not express the extent of synergy or antagonism; it is merely a criterion that separates the two behaviors without quantifying them.
