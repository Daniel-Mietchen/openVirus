 <caption> Concept of integrating drug combination theory and viral dynamics. The effect of a drug combination calculated by mathematical modeling of viral dynamics could be assessed by the Loewe additivity and Bliss independence. This approach could improve antiviral therapy by predicting the effect of a drug combination in vivo and in vitro, estimating the optimal drug dosage and combination, and discovering how the drugs interact. </caption>
