   <p>it is monophosphorylated intracellular by viral thymidine kinase during HSV infection and by a viral phosphotransferase encoded by the UL97 gene during CMV infection, while diphosphate and GCV triphosphate forms are produced by cellular enzymes;</p>

   <p>CMV can become resistant to GCV by mutations in the viral phosphotransferase encoded by the UL97 gene and by mutations in viral DNA polymerase [
