<p>Hepatitis viruses have been the subject of intense study in the last years, with a special attention on therapy. As mentioned in the first section, hepatitis treatment depends upon the type of hepatitis, therefore different antivirals are considered and summarized in detail in references [

Currently, interferons (IFNs) α, β, and γ have antiviral activity, the first two being produced by nearly all cells as response to viral infections, while the third is restricted to T-lymphocytes and NK cells. IFN-induced proteins include 2′-5′-oligoadenylate [2-5(A)] synthetase and a protein kinase, either of which can inhibit protein synthesis in the presence of double-stranded RNA. The 2-5(A) synthetase produces adenylate oligomers that activate a latent cellular endoribonuclease (RNase L) to cleave both cellular and viral single-stranded RNAs.
