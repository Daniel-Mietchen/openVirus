<p>According to International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) there are 1 phylum, 2 subphylia, six classes, 10 orders, seven suborders, 89 families, 36 subfamilies, 387 genera, 59 subgenera and 2202 species [
 <xref rid="B43-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Currently, viruses are classified based on their type of nucleic acid (DNA, RNA, single-stranded, double-stranded) and their way of replication, known as Baltimore classification [
 <xref rid="B44-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], divided as seven Baltimore classes:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>I—dsDNA viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses): enter to the host nucleus and are dependent by host cell polymerases to replicate viral genome. The virus may induce the cell to forcefully undergo cell division, which may lead to transformation of the cell and, ultimately, to cancer.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>II—ssDNA viruses (+ strand or “sense”) 
    <italic>DNA</italic> (e.g., parvoviruses), consists of viruses that have a single-stranded DNA genome of the same polarity as the mRNA. Excepting Parvoviruses, most of them have circular genomes and are replicating within nucleus.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>III—dsRNA viruses (e.g., reoviruses): not dependent by host replication polymerases and their replication (monocistronic) is realized into capsid (in cytoplasm).</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>IV—(+)ssRNA viruses (+ strand or sense) 
    <italic>RNA</italic> (e.g., picornaviruses, Togaviruses): the RNA can be directly accessed by ribosomes of the host to form proteins, and use a simple reproduction pathway (viruses with polycistronic mRNA) or a more complex transcription pathway (for which subgenomic mRNAs, ribosomal frameshifting, and proteolytic processing of polyproteins may be used).
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>V—(−)ssRNA viruses (− strand or antisense) 
    <italic>RNA</italic> (e.g., orthomyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses), that first must be transcribed by viral polymerases (positive-sense) before can be directly accessed by host ribosomes to form proteins.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>VI—ssRNA-RT viruses (+ strand or sense) RNA with DNA intermediate in life-cycle (e.g., retroviruses), which use the reverse transcriptase to convert the positive-sense RNA into DNA. They are using DNA to create the templates and those are spliced into host genome by integrase.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>VII—dsDNA-RT viruses DNA with RNA intermediate in life-cycle (e.g., hepadnaviruses), dsDNA viruses that replicate through a single-stranded RNA intermediate, which use a pregenome RNA as a template and conversion to DNA is done by a viral reverse transcriptase.</p>
