<p>Treating or improving treatment success rate for viral diseases are fundamental responsibilities. The established potential and boosted progress of nanotechnology in antiviral therapy development generates great expectations for new therapeutic innovative strategies for attacking or eradicating viral disorders. At present, studies explored numerous and diverse nano-platforms including nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles, with different compositions, size, with single or combined entrapped drugs that may serve as potential antiviral drug delivery transporters. These nano-based systems have exhibited versatile features to improve the identified current therapy drawback. However, the clinical use of a nano-based antiviral formulation to date based on our knowledge has turned out just a few approved or under clinical trials nanoformulations, mainly vaccines, despite more than 22 years of constant efforts. It is expected in the upcoming years that part of this “success preclinical story” to be scaled-up, translated and applied for better outcome, convenience and access for patients.</p>
