<p>Mucoadhesion can be the resultant of interactions like hydrophobic, hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding or van der Waals ones. Other possible attractive interactions can be covalent bond formation between catechols, maleimides, thiols, and acrylates with domains of mucin glycoproteins rich in cysteine. Chitosan, alginate, pectin or cellulose polymers are mostly used for achieving adhesion on mucosa. Furthermore, it is known that thiolation of the mentioned polymers develops high mucoadhesive properties.</p>
