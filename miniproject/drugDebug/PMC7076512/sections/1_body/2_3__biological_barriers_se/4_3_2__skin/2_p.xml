<p>Topical, through skin drug delivery, has a local effect, requiring less drug for the targeted outcome. Transdermal therapy results in fewer side effects with no need of regular treatment but systemic distribution of the drug. Both methods of treatment have a common blockage, stratum corneum. To pass through this barrier, different approaches were developed based mostly on disrupting this structure chemically with substances like surfactants, alcohols, esters, amines, terpenes, alkanes phospholipids, or mechanically by using ultrasounds, micro needling, magnetophoresis, iontophoresis, electroporation or lasers. Excessive use, though, can damage the skin.</p>
