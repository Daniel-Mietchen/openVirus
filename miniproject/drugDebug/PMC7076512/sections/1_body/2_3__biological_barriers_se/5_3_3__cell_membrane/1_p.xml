<p>The cell membrane separates the content of a cell from the exterior surroundings. Besides the standard protection around the cell, the cell membrane controls what substances go in and out. The composition is based on a bilayer of phospholipids, internally hydrophobic (tails) and externally hydrophilic (heads) with different proteins and cholesterol between them. The membrane is permeable selectively, permitting only some materials to pass through its lipid layer by active (through protein pumps or vesicles) or passive (diffusion) processes of transportation. Water passes the membrane through a process called osmosis, which occurs when an imbalance of solutes appears outside and inside the cell [
