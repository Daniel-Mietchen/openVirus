<p>In most of the cases, hydrophobic and small molecules can pass through diffusion. Nanoscale drug delivery systems depend upon an active mechanism (endocytosis). Over this process, the cell unit takes in ions, solid particles and molecules. There are studies that prove that positive charged nanogels can bind the membrane of the cell (negative charge) through electrostatic intercommunication. More than that, receptor-mediated endocytosis can provide a mechanism through which selectively attracted cell groups are targeted. In addition, hydrophobic nano-platforms can grow the adhesion to the membrane and the amount of drug entered in the cell [
