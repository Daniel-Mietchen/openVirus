<p>The BBB is a highly selective semipermeable structure composed of five parts: the basement membrane, the astrocytes, the immune cells, the pericytes and an endothelial cell layer of capillaries. The area between basement membrane and the neurons is called Virchow-Robin space. In this region there is interstitial fluid in which reside microglia. All the above components are called neurovascular unit. The kinetics of this unit is crucial to the role of BBB and its states of illness. The capillaries of BBB compose a layer of squamous epithelial cells that fold to form a circular vessel. These cells are linked with strong connections for blocking entrance or exit of materials through central nervous system. Protein transportation facilitates the selective flow of molecules through vessel lumens, essential biomolecules being in higher concentrations, like glucose and at the same time eliminating toxins.</p>
