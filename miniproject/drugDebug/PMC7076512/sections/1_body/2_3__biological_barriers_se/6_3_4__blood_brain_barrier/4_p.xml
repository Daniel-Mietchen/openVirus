<p>Active efflux transport is assured by two major types of transporters that extrude metabolic waste, xenobiotics and a large number of drugs from the brain back into the blood. The first superfamily of BBB efflux transporters is the solute carrier proteins (SLC) superfamily, being represented at the level of BBB by SLC22 and SLCO (SLC21) efflux transporters. The second is the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporter family represented by permeability glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) and the multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRPs) [
