<p>NFV, used in HIV-1 and HIV-2 treatment as PI, is a promising drug that can be used also for other grave medical disorders like cancer [
 <xref rid="B181-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. Some studies have showed the ability of different types of NPs loaded with NFV to activate latent HIV and to restrict viral spread in vitro. Kovochich et al. [
 <xref rid="B160-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">160</xref>] showed that lipid NPsâ€“LNPs incorporated with bryostatin-2, a protein kinase C activator (LNP-Bry), can be loaded with NFV (LNP-Bry-NFV), and proved the above mentioned abilities on J-Lat Full Length Cells (10.6). Tang et al. [
 <xref rid="B144-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] have prepared NPs based on poly(lactic-
 <italic>co</italic>-glycolic acid)-polyethylene glycol diblock copolymers and anti-CD45RO antibody conjugated with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) and NFV and tested theirs in vitro properties on ACH-2 cells. More complex studies have been performed by Venkatesh et al. [
 <xref rid="B145-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>] PLGA NPs loaded with NFV have significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of the drug studied in vivo in New Zealand rabbits, a reduced frequency of dosing being needed in this case.
