 <xref rid="B183-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>] proved that AuNPs alone acts as entry inhibitors. Moreover, integrase inhibitor, RAL, has been functionalized with a thiol group in order to link Au-NPs. In vitro cellular uptake has been tested on macrophages, human brain microendothelial cells and primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the results suggesting that RAL—pMBA—Au-NPs penetrate the cells and also can exhibit antiviral activity. In vivo studies performed by injection of RAL—pMBA—Au-NPs in female adult BALB mice tail proved that the studied NPs could cross the BBB [
