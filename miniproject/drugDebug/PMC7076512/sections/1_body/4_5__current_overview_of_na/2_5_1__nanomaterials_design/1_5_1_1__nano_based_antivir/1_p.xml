<p>Donalisio et al. [
 <xref rid="B155-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>] have reported the preparation by a modified nano-emulsion method of chitosan nanospheres (NS) loaded with 8.5% ACV as a topical formulation against both HSV-1 and HSV-2 herpes virus strains. The main component, chitosan, a natural polycationic polysaccharide, was selected as a material for ACV release, due to its distinctive properties: hydrophilic character, in situ gelling, mucoadhesion, permeation enhancing, in addition to a low cytotoxicity, biocompatibility and bioresorbability features [
 <xref rid="B165-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>]. The obtained gel formulation based on ACV-loaded NS proved an enhanced ability to penetrate porcine skin to about 55% (at 24 h) greater than the commercial cream product (10%). IC
 <sub>50</sub> values against HSV-1 and HSV-2 were also determined on Vero cell cultures infected with above-mentioned strains, displaying significant reduced values of 0.012 µM and 0.100 µM, respectively, when using the NS formulation as compare to 0.156 µM and 1.608 µM for free acyclovir. This nano-technological approach attests the higher efficacy of the described formulation and with promising expectations for further preclinical and clinical experiments.
