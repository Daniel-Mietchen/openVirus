<p>Biogenic gold (Au) and silver (Ag) NPs were prepared using the seaweed 
 <italic>Sargassum wightii</italic> (
 <italic>Sw</italic>) and investigated for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 and HSV-2 strains [
 <xref rid="B166-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The NPs synthesis resided in an eco-friendly method, previously described in the literature [
 <xref rid="B167-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>], replacing the use of different reducing agents. The obtained NPs, 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Au and 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Ag, were evaluated concerning both cytotoxic and antiviral effect, using MTT and CPE (cytopathic effect) assays on Vero cells. The results showed that cell viability ranged from 93% to 85% when the concentration ranged between 2.5 and 25 µL per sample in 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Au, and from 97% to 84.58% for concentrations of 2.5 and 1 µL per sample in 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Ag. The antiviral assay have shown a 70% decrease of CPE on both HSV-1 and HSV-2 when Vero cells were treated with 10 and 25 µL 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Au, whereas 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Ag exhibit similar reduction of CPE at a concentration of only 2.5 µL per sample. Higher concentrations of 
 <italic>Sw</italic>-Ag are not accepted due to an increased cytotoxic effect. The authors claimed that the obtained results are in agreement with other published research and they inferred that functionalized metallic NPs act as antiviral agents by blocking the virus attachments and cell access, depending on particle size.
