<p>Taking into consideration the performance indicators of nanomedicine, we claim that the development a personalized nanomedicine is possible via a synergistically approach. Since the development of “best” viral carriers involves a multidisciplinary team, virologists should be directly implicated in the development, offering specialized support on the following matters: identification of differentially expressed moieties virus cells for targeted delivery, elucidation of the type of desired targeted and the response from the host cells to nanodelivery platforms.</p>
