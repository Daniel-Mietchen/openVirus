<p>The usual most accurate methodology to estimate a burden (associated with a disease) is the so-called “cost-of-Illness” [
 <xref rid="B10-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and measures all the costs of a particular disease, including the direct, indirect, and intangible dimensions. It is widely accepted that estimating the total social cost of a disease is useful in establishing policy decisions [
 <xref rid="B14-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. But there are also other methods as the 
 <italic>cross-sectional surveys</italic> of samples of primary and secondary care physicians, analyzing health care resource utilization or approaches based on the analysis of a large administrative data sets, such as values of spending or drugs consuming lists [
 <xref rid="B15-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Other approaches are used to estimate the number of patients seeking medical treatment, the average medical expenditures (as health inputs employed per unit multiplied by number of units) and estimated national costs. These comprehensive studies can often be advantageous in allocating total national expenditures among the major diagnostic categories [
 <xref rid="B16-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, regardless of the method, such analyzes are not possible otherwise than inside countries (where the impact determined by cultural and social aspects can vary substantially). But even in the absence of global data of this nature, we still can extract from the information presented the relevant issue for the topic of this paper: the current arrangements in the management of viral infections (treatments, prevention and limitations of spread) are costly and less effective, unaffordable in some cases and burdensome for medical systems. For example, according to the current analysis of Globe Newswire Reports and Data [
 <xref rid="B17-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the global antiviral drugs market was valued at $49.87 billion in 2018 and is expected to reach $71.48 billion by year 2026. Sales of antivirals increased by approximately 20% each two years. Moreover, thanks to better diagnostics, innovative drugs and new therapeutics, the market is likely to witness even further future growth. However, the list of viral diseases for which antiviral therapies are available is still relatively short [
