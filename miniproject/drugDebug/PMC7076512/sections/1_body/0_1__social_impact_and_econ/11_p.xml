   <p>the virusesâ€™ functions are specific to each virus, preventing the development of a broad-spectrum antivirals fighting against different viruses that cause similar symptoms. Antivirals developed for some viruses (as HSV and HIV) can treat the acute illness, but do not cure the latent infection. This leads to recurrent or chronic diseases that require treatment for longer periods of time [
