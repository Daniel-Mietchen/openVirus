<p>Although antiviral therapy appears to be expensive (for example, average cost for a treated HCV case ranges from $26,500 to $94,500 [
 <xref rid="B11-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]), is considered to be also cost effective when compared with other well-accepted medical interventions [
 <xref rid="B12-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] due to sustained viral response to therapy, the cost savings and quality-of-life improvement and prolongation of life expectancy from the prevention of HCV complications. In the era of new DAAs, the statement “provide treatment to HCV-patients” generates savings compared to not provide it. Low and middle-income countries may consider HCV-treatment as a cost-saving intervention for the health system, not only in a long-term horizon, but in 5–10 years [
 <xref rid="B5-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Economic impact of no treatment is higher than treatment costs itself. But still, the enthusiasm for DAA therapies, however, has been tempered by two major concerns: the price, still very high, of these medications, and, the challenges patients and clinicians face with respect to drug access in many countries.
