<p>With the aim of developing new personalized diagnostic tools, Farzin et al. [
 <xref rid="B164-pharmaceutics-12-00171" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>] summarized current strategies and under-development tools for early diagnosis of HIV. Their review combines the use of nanomaterials such as carbon nanostructures, nanoclusters, quantum dots, metallic and metal oxide NPs as advanced structures for HIV detection with possible biosensing strategies targeting to offer innovative outlooks for developing intelligent, sensitive and specific nano-objects for in situ and real-time detection of HIV.
