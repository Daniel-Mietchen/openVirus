<p id="Par16">In order to effectively reduce overcrowding and block the spread of the virus through person-to-person transmission during the coronavirus epidemic, medical institutions across China have launched remote pharmacy services such as online drug prescribing, drug consultation, and drug delivery services. For example, the Pharmacy Department of Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, created an online remote pharmacy service via WeChat
 <sup>Â®</sup>. Pharmacists provide patients with free medication consultation and education, allowing patients to purchase medications online and arrange for home drug delivery. The implementation of these remote pharmacy services provides out-of-hospital pharmaceutical care access and helps to reduce the risk of cross-infection during unnecessary hospital visits. The positive effects of these remote services on patient care during the epidemic is helpful for pharmacy to further establish its professional role in China.
