<p id="Par14">During the coronavirus pandemic, both prescription (including resuscitation drugs) and over-the-counter (OTC) medication shortages may occur. Drugs may also be in short supply due to production disruptions for various reasons. Pharmacists and pharmacies must conduct active surveillance and establish early warning mechanisms to address drug shortages in a timely manner. The American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) guidelines on managing drug product shortages and a published provincial drug shortage surveillance and early warning platform in Hunan, China, can be referenced and adapted to create local, regional and national platforms to manage prescription drug shortages during a pandemic [

Community pharmacies and pharmacists should pay equal attention to potential shortages of OTC drugs. This is especially important due to an increase in the public buying OTCs to treat the symptoms of the illness (fever, cough and shortness of breath) from the advice of healthcare professionals and public agencies.
