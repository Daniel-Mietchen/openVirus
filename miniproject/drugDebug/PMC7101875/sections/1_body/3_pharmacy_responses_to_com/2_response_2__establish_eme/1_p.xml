<p id="Par12">There is currently no specific vaccine and no effective antiviral therapy against SARS-CoV-2. The China National Health Commission (CNHC) has released the "Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for the New Coronavirus Infected Pneumonia” (the CNHC guidelines), currently in its sixth update [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The CNHC guidelines suggest the use of antiviral drugs (α-interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine, umifenovir) and traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) for treatment. Although these therapies may not be recommended by the WHO, their treatment roles are based on past experiences during the SARS outbreak in China in 2003 with the consideration of lack of drug therapies to treat the coronavirus. The CNHC guidelines recommend eight TCM injections for severe and critical cases. For severe cases,
