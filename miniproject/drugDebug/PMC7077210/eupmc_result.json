    "Currently, no rabies virus-specific antiviral drugs are available. Ranpirnase has strong antitumor and antiviral properties associated with its ribonuclease activity. TMR-001, a proprietary bulk drug substance solution of ranpirnase, was evaluated against rabies virus in three cell types: mouse neuroblastoma, BSR (baby hamster kidney cells), and bat primary fibroblast cells. When TMR-001 was added to cell monolayers 24 h preinfection, rabies virus release was inhibited for all cell types at three time points postinfection. TMR-001 treatment simultaneous with infection and 24 h postinfection effectively inhibited rabies virus release in the supernatant and cell-to-cell spread with 50% inhibitory concentrations of 0.2-2 nM and 20-600 nM, respectively. TMR-001 was administered at 0.1 mg/kg via intraperitoneal, intramuscular, or intravenous routes to Syrian hamsters beginning 24 h before a lethal rabies virus challenge and continuing once per day for up to 10 days. TMR-001 at this dose, formulation, and route of delivery did not prevent rabies virus transit from the periphery to the central nervous system in this model (n = 32). Further aspects of local controlled delivery of other active formulations or dose concentrations of TMR-001 or ribonuclease analogues should be investigated for this class of drugs as a rabies antiviral therapeutic."
