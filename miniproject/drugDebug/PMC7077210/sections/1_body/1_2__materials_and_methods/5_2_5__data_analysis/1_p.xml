<p>The mean and standard deviation of at least four statistical replicates from at least two biological replicates were calculated. Cytotoxicity data were normalized using untreated controls, and 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) was calculated using a linear regression. For in vitro studies, GraphPad Prism v6.07 was used to plot log
 <sub>10</sub> transformed average and standard deviation of virus release, and to calculate statistical significance using the two-way ANOVA Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test; plot data points for virus release and cell-to-cell spread to calculate IC
 <sub>50</sub> values using a nonlinear regression, log inhibitor vs. response, three parameter fit, and calculate statistical significance using the two-way ANOVA Tukey’s multiple comparisons test. For in vivo studies, GraphPad Prism v6.07 was used to plot average body weight and calculate statistical significance using the two-way ANOVA Tukey’s multiple comparisons test, plot Kaplan–Meyer survival curves and calculate statistical significance using the log-rank Mantel-Cox test, and analyze contingency data using the Fisher exact test. Comparisons were considered significantly different at
