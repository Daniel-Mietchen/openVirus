<p>Confluent monolayers of MNA, BSR, and E03E cells were treated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and diluted in DMEM-10 to 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> live cells/mL using 0.2% trypan blue and counting with a Cellometer Auto1000 (Nexcelom Bioscience, Lawrence, MA, USA). A total of 5 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> cells (1 mL) were added to each well of a 24-well plate and incubated 24 h at 37 °C and 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The medium was removed and 10-0.024 µM of TMR-001 was added to 0.9 mL DMEM-10 in triplicate. For virus control, 0.1 mL of PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4) was added to 0.9 mL DMEM-10 in triplicate, and plates were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Rabies virus ERA was added to all wells at MOI = 0.1 except one untreated cell-only control well, and plates were incubated for 72 h at 37 °C and 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Aliquots of supernatant from each well were removed at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection and stored at −80 °C. Cytotoxicity was measured at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection using the Neutral Red uptake assay as described previously [
