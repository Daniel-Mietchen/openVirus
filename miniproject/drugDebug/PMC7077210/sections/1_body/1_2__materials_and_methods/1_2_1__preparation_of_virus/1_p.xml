<p>Fixed RABV Evelyn–Rokitnicki–Abelseth (ERA) strain was propagated in BSR cells (a clone of baby hamster kidney cells) in Dulbecco’s minimal essential medium (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM-10). A cell monolayer grown for three days at 37 °C and 5.0% CO
 <sub>2</sub> was infected with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) = 1, incubated at 34 °C and 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, the medium was changed three days postinfection, and virus in the supernatant was collected seven days postinfection. Virus was titrated as described previously [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], diluted in DMEM-10 to 1 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> focus-forming units (ffu)/mL, and stored at −80 °C. Low-passage mouse neuroblastoma cells (MNA), BSR cells, and primary fibroblast cells from 
 <italic>Eptesicus fuscus</italic> (E03E) were maintained in DMEM-10 at 37 °C and 0.5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. Cells were passaged every three or four days when the monolayer reached confluence. Cells were selected based on availability and animal models established in our laboratory (mouse, hamster, and bat). Ranpirnase TMR-001 (lot: 1602-0015) at 290 µM (3.8 mg/mL) was diluted in PBS (0.01 M, pH 7.4, without calcium, magnesium, or manganese) and stored at −80 °C. TMR-001 is the bulk drug substance used to make TMR-004 and Onconase. It contains only ranpirnase protein and mannitol. To maintain consistency, aliquots of drug and virus were only thawed and used once.
