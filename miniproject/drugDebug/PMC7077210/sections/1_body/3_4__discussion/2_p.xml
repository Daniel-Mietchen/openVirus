<p>Based on these results, TMR-001 was tested in the hamster, RABV lethal-challenge model. In the hamster model, RABV reaches the brain by 5-6 days postinfection [
 <xref rid="B28-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Thus, the 10-day treatment window covers RABV entry, transit to the CNS, and replication in the brain. Results of TMR-001 administered at 0.1 mg/kg by three different routes were not significantly different for clinical onset or death within this animal model, demonstrating additional research is warranted to evaluate RNases as a potential rabies antiviral. That one of the animals treated by the IM route survived 14 days postinfection without any clinical signs of rabies is promising and may indicate a protective effect. Indeed, only one other RNase (from 
 <italic>Bacillus intermedius</italic>) has been tested in animals for rabies antiviral activity, and in that case Gribencha, et al. found only injection of 5 mg/kg at the site of infection was prophylactic [
