<p>In conclusion, ranpirnase is a promising broad-spectrum antiviral that inhibits RABV in vitro. Additional studies are required to determine if an effective dose, route of delivery, new formulations of the drug, or another RNase A homologue could prevent rabies in an animal model. The need for an effective RABV antiviral drug is of utmost importance due to the high lethality of natural infection and dearth of medical countermeasures once symptoms manifest.</p>
