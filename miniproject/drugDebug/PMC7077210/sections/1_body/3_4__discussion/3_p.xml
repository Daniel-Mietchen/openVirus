<p>While ranpirnase has an antiviral effect in vitro, effectiveness of this compound in vivo likely requires the ability to cross the BBB or novel delivery methods. A form of ranpirnase (Onconase for Injection) was rapidly distributed throughout the body and had a short serum half-life of 36.5 min [
