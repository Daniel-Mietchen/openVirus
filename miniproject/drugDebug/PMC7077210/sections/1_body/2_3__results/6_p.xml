<p>Survival curves for 0.1 mg/kg TMR-001 administered IP and IM were not significantly different from the control group (log-rank 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.093 and 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.66, respectively). The survival curve for 0.1 mg/kg TMR-001 administered IV was significantly lower than the control group (log-rank 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0052) possibly due to the added stress of survival surgery to place jugular vein catheters. Median survival was similar: 10, 10.5, and 11 days for IV, IP, and IM, respectively, compared to 11 days for untreated controls. A significant number of animals 15/38 (39%) euthanized with clinical signs of rabies also showed nonspecific clinical signs (e.g., aggression, hypersensitivity, hyperactivity) prior to rabies-specific signs (e.g., paresis, paralysis, seizure) compared to previous experiments (unpublished data) in this animal model using the same challenge virus (Fisherâ€™s exact test 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.017). In conclusion, ranpirnase TMR-001 inhibited rabies virus in vitro but not in vivo at the tested dose and routes.
