<p>TMR-001 was added to cell monolayers 24 h preinfection and maintained in the medium for sampling 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection. Different cell lines, due to the known cytotoxicity of ranpirnase in transformed cells [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and a primary cell culture were evaluated. These cell lines and cell culture were selected accordinglyâ€”MNA as a standard neuronal cell model for RABV, BSR as a comparison to in vivo testing in the hamster model, and EO3E as primary cells from a common natural RABV host. The RABV titer in the supernatant of untreated cells increased approximately 2-fold at each time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00177-f002">Figure 2</xref>), while virus in the supernatant decreased approximately 2-, 4-, and 10-fold with increasing drug concentration at 24, 48, and 72 h postinfection, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00177-f002">Figure 2</xref>). The IC
 <sub>50</sub> for ranpirnase decreased 100-fold over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00177-f002">Figure 2</xref>) because the untreated virus titer increased over time and treatment inhibited viral release, i.e., the inhibition was more pronounced the longer the assay time point. The 50% cytotoxic concentration was in the micromolar range and did not change more than 5-fold over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00177-f002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus, the selective index increased due to the decrease in IC
 <sub>50</sub>. The selective index was lower in the primary cell line E03E indicating that effects on the host cell may have contributed to RABV inhibition (
