<p>The experimental strategy was refined to better characterize the effect of different concentrations of TMR-001 on RABV infection by choosing a single time point and cell line (48 h postinfection in the BSR cell line). Additionally, the assay conditions were altered to use an 8-well chamber slide to observe the effect of ranpirnase on virus infection of the cell monolayer. TMR-001 was added to BSR cells 24 h preinfection, simultaneously to infection, and 24 h postinfection (
