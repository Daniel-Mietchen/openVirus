<p>The mechanism of ranpirnase antiviral activity is hypothesized as being an RNA interference pathway which can result in direct virus inhibition and alterations in the host cell gene expression [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The mechanism of selective cytotoxicity in transformed cells is well studied, where endocytosis [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] is followed by the degradation of dsRNA, such as tRNA, which results in halting protein synthesis and arrest of the cell cycle [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Proposed mechanisms of antiviral activity include degradation of viral RNA [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and disruption of TNF-Î± signaling [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00177" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Ranpirnase is a highly stable water-soluble molecule but has never been recorded to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB).
