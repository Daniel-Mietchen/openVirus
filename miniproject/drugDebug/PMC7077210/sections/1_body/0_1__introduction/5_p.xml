<p>In the current study, we investigated the antiviral activity of TMR-001 against RABV in vitro and in vivo. This form of the drug was not previously evaluated in preclinical or human clinical studies. Transformed cell lines and a primary cell culture were used for the initial evaluation, and a transformed cell line was used to further characterize TMR-001 antirabies effect. Finally, efficacy of the compound was tested in Syrian hamsters treated and challenged peripherally.</p>
