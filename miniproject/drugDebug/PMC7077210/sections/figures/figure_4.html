 <caption> TMR-001 treatment does not prevent rabies in Syrian hamsters. Starting 24 h preinfection, 0.1 mg/kg TMR-001 was administered intraperitoneally (IP, green), intramuscularly (IM, red), intravenously (IV, blue), or no treatment (purple), once per day for 10 days. Group size was 12 hamsters, except the IV administration group, which contained 8 hamsters. All animals were infected with 10 3.5 mouse intracranial LD 50 of canine rabies virus IM in the hind leg. Days 7 to 21 postinfection, animals were observed twice daily and euthanized at the first clinical signs of rabies. The experiment was terminated 14 days postinfection due to a lack of significance between the groups (log-rank test p = 0.66). Percent survival over time is shown on a linear scale. </caption>
