 <caption> Inhibition of rabies virus release and cell-to-cell infection regardless of TMR-001 treatment time. TMR-001 was added at the given concentrations to a clone of baby hamster kidney cells (BSR) at 24 h preinfection (blue circle), simultaneously to infection (red square), or 24 h postinfection (green triangle). The average and standard deviation were calculated from four statistical replicates from at least two biological replicates, plotted on a log 10 scale, and 50% inhibitory concentrations were calculated using a three-parameter fit, nonlinear regression. ( a) Culture supernatant was sampled at 48 h postinfection, and virus concentration was measured in fluorescent foci units per mL (ffu/mL) using DFA staining of mouse neuroblastoma cells 24 h postinfection. Note that the titer for the first dilution (10 −1.54 mM ranpirnase) is below the axis limit for all three treatments and for the second dilution (10 −2.54 mM ranpirnase) is below the axis limit for 24 h preinfection and simultaneous treatments. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were 2 nM for 24 h preinfection, 0.4 nM for simultaneous, and 0.2 nM for 24 h postinfection. ( b) The cell monolayer was fixed at 48 h postinfection, and relative cell-to-cell infection was measured by counting clusters of fluorescent foci using DFA staining and comparing counts to virus-only controls. The 50% inhibitory concentrations were 600 nM for 24 h preinfection, 100 nM for simultaneous, and 20 nM for 24 h postinfection. The amount of cell-to-cell infection was not significantly different between the different treatment time points (two-way ANOVA Tukey’s adjusted p-values &gt; 0.05). </caption>
