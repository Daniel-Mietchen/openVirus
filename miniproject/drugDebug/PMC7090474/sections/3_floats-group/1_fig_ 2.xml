  <p>Fc receptor-mediated antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infection and inflammatory responses. 
   <bold>A</bold> ADE occurs when antiviral neutralizing antibodies cannot completely neutralize the virus. Instead, the virus-NAb complex attaches to the Fc receptor (FcR), leading to viral endocytosis and infection of the target cells. The outcome is an increase in the overall replication of the virus and greater disease severity. 
   <bold>B</bold> Virus-NAb complex binding to FcR can also activate proinflammatory signaling, skewing macrophage responses to the accumulation of proinflammatory (M1 or classically activated) macrophages in lungs. The M1 macrophages secrete inflammatory cytokines such as MCP-1 and IL-8, leading to lung injury. 
   <bold>C</bold> Potential therapeutics based on targeting the Fc receptors to block SARS-CoV-2-induced inflammatory responses. From left to right, FcR can be blocked using anti-Fc specific antibodies, small molecules, or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). The inhibitory FcR, FcγRIIB, may also be targeted to inhibit FcR activation. The FcRn can also be blocked by specific antibodies or inhibited competitively through IVIG binding.
