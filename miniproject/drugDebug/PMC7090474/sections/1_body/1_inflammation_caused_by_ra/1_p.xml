<p id="Par3">Previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV predominantly infects airway and alveolar epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, and macrophages. In addition, SARS-CoV viral particles and viral genome have been detected in monocytes and lymphocytes (Gu

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2005</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 uses the same entry receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), as SARS-CoV for infection, suggesting the likelihood of the same set of cells being targeted and infected (Zhao 
 <italic>et al.</italic>

 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>). The early onset of rapid viral replication may cause massive epithelial and endothelial cell apoptosis and vascular leakage, triggering the release of exuberant pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (Yang

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2020</xref>). A vast majority of patients (82.1%) have been found to experience SARS-CoV-2-induced peripheral blood lymphopenia (Guan 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020</xref>), suggesting possible pulmonary infiltration of lymphocytes and/or cell damage through apoptosis or pyroptosis (Huang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>). In SARS-CoV infection, viroporin 3a has also been shown to trigger the activation of NLRP3 (NOD-like receptor protein 3) inflammasome and the secretion of IL-1Î² in bone marrow-derived macrophages, suggesting the induction of cell pyroptosis (Chen 
 <italic>et al.</italic>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2019</xref>), which can cause the release of large amounts of proinflammatory factors (Fink and Cookson
