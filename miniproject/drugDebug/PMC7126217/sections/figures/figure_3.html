 <caption> Effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin. Effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on hemagglutinin was evaluated by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. Epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin at a concentration of 5Â mg/mL was serially diluted 2-fold and added to the 96-well plate. The standardized hemagglutinin viral solution was added to the 96-well plate. Then, 0.6% chicken red blood cells suspension was added to the mixtures as described in the Material and Methods.
