 <caption> Inhibitory effect of epiprogoitrin, progoitrin, epigoitrin and goitrin on influenza virus A (H1N1) in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells ( n = 3). 100 μL of sample solutions at different concentrations were mixed with 100 μL of virus at 100 TCID 50. After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the mixtures were added to the cells. After incubation at 37 °C in 5% CO 2 for 72 h, the antiviral activity was investigated by cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK8) method. </caption>
