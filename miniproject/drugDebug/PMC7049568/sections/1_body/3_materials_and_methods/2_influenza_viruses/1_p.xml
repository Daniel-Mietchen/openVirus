 </xref> Pooled allantoic fluid was clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at −80°C until use. Both viruses were sequenced at the CDC for HA and NA, and titered for plaque-forming units (PFUs) in MDCK cells. The titer for A/Brisbane/59/2007 is 1.55 × 10
 <sup>8</sup> PFUs/mL and A/Puerto Rico/8/34 is 2 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> PFUs/mL.
