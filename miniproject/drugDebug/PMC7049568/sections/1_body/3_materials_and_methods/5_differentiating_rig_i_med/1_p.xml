<p id="p0095">Vero cells that lack type 1 IFN genes were grown in six-well tissue culture plates and transfected with 3 μg of shRNAs containing the 5′-PPP group, as well as their m7G-capped counterparts using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), as per the manufacturer’s instructions, and infected with A/Brisbane/59/2007 virus at an MOI of 1.0 at 6 and 24 h post-transfection. RNA and cell lysates were collected 24 h later for analysis of NS1 message expression by qRT-PCR and NS1 protein expression by western blot analysis.</p>
