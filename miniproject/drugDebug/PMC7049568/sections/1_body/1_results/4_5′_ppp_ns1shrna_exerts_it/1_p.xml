<p id="p0035">Having demonstrated the functionality of NS1shRNAs, we assessed the potential prophylactic utility of the dual-function shRNAs. We first transfected A549 cells with 3 μg of 5′-PPP-shRNA constructs and their m7G-capped counterparts, as well as control shRNA. At 6, 12, and 24 h post-transfection of shRNAs, A549 cells were infected with 1.0 MOI of A/Brisbane/59/2007 virus. Twenty-four hours post-infection, supernatants and cell lysates were collected to determine viral titers in plaque assay using Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells and RNA to determine NS1, RIG-I, and IFN-β transcript levels, respectively. All shRNA constructs with the exception of m7G-capped scrambled and m7G-capped control constructs significantly reduced viral titers when compared with control, with inhibitions ranging from 4 logs to 2 logs (
 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>A). For example, NS1shRNA containing a 5′-PPP moiety significantly reduced viral titers by about 4 logs at the 6-h time point. Although the antiviral effect appears to be very high at 6 h when compared with 24 h, there were no statistically significant differences between 6, 12, and 24 h. The inhibition was mediated by RIG-I activation, as well as direct inhibition of NS1 transcripts. m7G-capped NS1shRNA inhibited viral titers by about 3 logs, and this inhibition was mediated by direct inhibition of NS1 by shRNA. RIG-I activation and NS1 suppression work synergistically in dual-functioning 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA. 5′-PPP-containing scrambled shRNA construct did reduce viral titers through RIG-I activation; however, the reduction in viral titers hovered around 3 logs for all time points (

The inhibition of viral titers correlated with the significant inhibition (80%–90%) of NS1 transcription (
