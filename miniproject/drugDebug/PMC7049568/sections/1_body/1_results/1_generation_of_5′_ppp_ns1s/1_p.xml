<p id="p0020">In this study, we investigated the antiviral potential of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA, which not only suppresses the NS1 gene of influenza virus but also activates RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses by virtue of its 5′-PPP moiety, therefore serving as a dual-function shRNA. In order to find small stretches of conserved NS1 sequence that can serve as a target sequence in 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs, we performed sequence alignment of the NS gene segment of 12 different influenza viruses. Sequence alignment results revealed nine short stretches of sequence that were the most conserved among the 12 different influenza viruses and that served as the putative target (NS1) sense sequences in the 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs tested (

 <italic>in silico</italic> analysis of the A/PR/8/34 NS1 sequence utilizing a multi-parameter prediction of RNA accessibility (mppRNA) analysis paradigm. This analysis determines domains in an RNA sequence that are accessible to shRNA attack by predicting stretches with minimal to no secondary structure that would impede shRNA binding (

 </xref> The double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) templates used for generating the 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs were composed of a T7 promoter followed by the NS1 target sense sequence, stem loop, target antisense sequence, and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). The purpose of using a T7 RNA polymerase (T7 Pol)-based transcription was that T7 Pol not only results in a triphosphate moiety at the 5′ end of its transcripts but also has high transcriptase activity with very strict specificity for its promoter.

 </xref> In order to circumvent this problem, we incorporated a HDV ribozyme sequence at the 3′ end of the dsDNA template (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>B). Among all nine shRNAs, only three shRNAs, namely, 1, 4, and 9, were found to be effective and functional (data not shown). We also established an optimum dose of 3 μg for these shRNAs to be used in transfection studies by doing a dose-response study (data not shown).
