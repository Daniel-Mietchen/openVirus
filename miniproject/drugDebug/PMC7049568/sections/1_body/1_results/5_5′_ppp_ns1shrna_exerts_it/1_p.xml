<p id="p0040">To evaluate the therapeutic potential of our dual-functional shRNA, A549 cells were first infected with 1.0 MOI of A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza virus and at 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection, the cells were treated with shRNAs (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>). Viral titers were significantly lower (&gt;3 logs reduction) in infected cells treated with NS1shRNA with or without 5′-PPP, or scrambled shRNA with 5′-PPP and Is9.2 with 5′-PPP at 6 and 12 h post-infection (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>A). However, the reduction was about 1 log at 24 h post-infection. Neither m7G-capped scrambled shRNA nor m7G-capped Is9.2 RNA had any impact on viral titers. NS1shRNAs with or without 5′-PPP were able to suppress NS1 levels ranging from 30% to 70% as compared with controls in cells at 6, 12, and 24 h post-infection, unlike 5′-PPP-scramshRNA and 5′-PPP-Is9.2 RNA, which suppressed NS1 by 45%–50% at 6 h post-infection and marginally, 5%–15% at 12 and 24 h post-infection (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>B). m7G-capped-scrambled shRNA and m7G-capped Is9.2shRNA failed to suppress NS1 expression. There was a 20- to 30-fold increase in the levels of RIG-I as compared with transfection control in virus-infected cells that were treated with 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA 6 h post-infection. However, this induction of RIG-I was not seen at 12- or 24-h time points during infection (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>C). Interestingly, treatment of infected cells with NS1shRNA with or without the 5′-PPP moiety, 5′-PPP-scramshRNA, and 5′-PPP-Is9.2 RNA induced significantly higher levels of IFN-β (&gt;100-fold) when cells were treated with them at 6 h post-infection (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>D). Although NS1shRNA with or without the 5′-PPP group induced about a 70-fold increase in IFN-β at 12 h post-infection, none of the other constructs induced significant levels of IFN-β.
