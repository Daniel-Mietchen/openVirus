  <p>Antiviral Activity Mediated by NS1shRNA in a Prophylactic Setting</p>
  <p>A549 cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>) were mock transfected or transfected with 3 μg of IVT shRNAs or their 7mG-capped counterparts, as indicated. The transfected cells were infected with 1.0 MOI of A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza virus at indicated time points (i.e., 6 [filled bars], 12 [empty bars], and 24 h [hatched bars]) post-transfection and harvested for mRNA analysis by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell supernatants were collected for detecting viral titers by plaque assay. (A–D) Viral titer (A), relative mRNA expression of (B) NS1, (C) RIG-I, and (D) IFN-β measured by plaque assay and qRT-PCR analysis, respectively. mRNA expressions are displayed as fold increase over controls. Error bars represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons analysis was used to analyze differences among treatment groups and control group.
