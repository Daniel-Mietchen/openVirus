  <p>Therapeutic Potential of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA</p>
  <p>A549 cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>) were mock infected or infected with 1.0 MOI of A/Brisbane/59 influenza virus, and 6 (filled bars), 12 (empty bars), or 24 h (hatched bars) later the cells were transfected with 3 μg of IVT shRNAs or their 7mG-capped counterparts, as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were analyzed for mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR, and supernatants were collected for detecting viral titers by plaque assay. (A–D) Viral titers in the supernatants measured by plaque assay in MDCK cells (A): NS1 (B), RIG-I (C), and IFN-β (D). Error bars represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons analysis was used to analyze differences among treatment groups and control group.
