  <p>Design and Characterization of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA</p>
  <p>(A) Determining optimal shRNA sequences by multi-parameter prediction of RNA accessibility (mppRNA) analysis. Peaks indicate domains along the influenza A/PR/8/34 sequence with a higher probability of access for shRNA attack based on secondary structure. Orange shaded regions indicate domains with ≥97% homology with the consensus sequence of 12 influenza A strains. #1, #4, and #9 sequence domains from which shRNAs were derived that resulted in anti-influenza activity. *Location of shRNA species that was utilized in subsequent detailed 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> and 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> analysis. (B). The dsDNA template to generate 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA by T7 polymerase (7 Pol)-based 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (IVT) was composed of a T7 Pol promoter region (in yellow) at the 5′ end of the dsDNA template followed by the target sense sequence (in blue), loop (in green), target antisense (in gray), and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme (in pink). Both ends of this dsDNA template were flanked by restriction enzyme sites (in red). 5′-PPP-NS1shRNAs were synthesized using a T7 RNA Pol-based IVT kit. A549 cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>/well) were dispensed into six-well plates and then mock transfected (cont) or transfected with 3 μg of IVT 5′-PPP shRNAs (with the indicated sense sequence or a scrambled control) or their m7G-capped counterparts, as indicated, and cells were harvested 24 h post-transfection for RNA analysis by quantitative real-time PCR. (C–E) In a separate set of experiments, these transfected cells were also infected with 1.0 MOI of A/Brisbane/59 (H1N1) influenza virus and were harvested 24 h post-infection for mRNA analysis of (C) RIG-I, (D) IFN-β, and (E) NS1 expression. mRNA levels are expressed as fold increase over controls in shRNA-transfected cells. Error bars represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with multiple comparisons analysis was used to analyze differences among treatment groups and control group.
