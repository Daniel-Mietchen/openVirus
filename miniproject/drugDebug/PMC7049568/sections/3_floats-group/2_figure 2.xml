  <p>Differentiating NS1 Silencing and Type 1 IFN-Mediated Antiviral Effects</p>
  <p>Vero cells (1 × 10
   <sup>6</sup>) were mock transfected or transfected with 3 μg of shRNAs or their capped counterparts as shown. Six (empty bars) or 24 h (filled bars) later, the transfected cells were infected with 1 MOI of A/Brisbane/59/2007 influenza virus. The cells were harvested 24 h post-infection for NS1 mRNA and protein analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (A) and western blot (B), respectively. Error bars represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons analysis was used to analyze differences among NS1shRNA, scram shRNA, and Is9.2 RNA groups.
