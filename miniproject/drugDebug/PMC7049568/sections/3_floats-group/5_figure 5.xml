  <p>Prophylactic and Therapeutic Potential of NS1shRNA in Mice</p>
  <p>Mice were intranasally administered 50 μg of 5′-PPP-NS1shRNA (□), m7G-capped-NS1shRNA (▲), 5′-PPP-scrambled shRNA (X), or m7G-capped-scrambled shRNA (Δ) mixed with 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> transfection reagent 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI or 
   <italic>in vivo</italic>-jetPEI alone (▪). All shRNA constructs were administered on day −1, 0, 1, 2, or 3. Mice were infected with mouse-adapted A/PR/8/1934 (H1N1) on day 0, and mouse lungs were harvested on day 4. (A–F) Lungs were analyzed for (A) viral titers by plaque assay, and mRNA expression of (B) NS1, (C) RIG-I, (D) IFN-β, (E) IFN-λ, and (F) RANTES by quantitative real-time PCR and expressed as fold increase over controls. Error bars represent the mean ± SD from three independent experiments. One-way ANOVA with multiple comparisons analysis was used to analyze differences among treatment groups and PBS group.
