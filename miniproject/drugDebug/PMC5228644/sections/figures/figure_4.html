 <caption> HCC development in patients who did not receive antiviral treatment. The cumulative HCC development rate of male patients was significantly greater than that of female patients ( P = 0.02) (A). The cumulative HCC development rate of patients with LC was significantly greater than that of those without LC ( P &lt; 0.01) (B). The cumulative overall HCC development rate of patients with genotype 1 or another genotype were similar ( P = 0.59) (C). HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma, LC = liver cirrhosis. </caption>
