 <caption> HCC development in patients who received antiviral treatment. The cumulative HCC development rate of patients with LC was significantly greater than that of those without LC ( P &lt; 0.01) (A). The cumulative HCC development rate of patients with genotype 1 was significantly greater than that of those with other genotypes ( P = 0.047) (B). HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma, LC = liver cirrhosis. </caption>
