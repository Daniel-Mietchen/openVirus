 <caption> HCC development in all study subjects. The cumulative HCC development rate of patients who achieved SVR on PEG-IFN/RBV therapy was significantly lower than the rate of those who did not and than that of those not treated with PEG-IFN/RBV ( P values for all &lt; 0.01) (A). The cumulative HCC development rate of study subjects with LC was significantly greater than those without LC ( P &lt; 0.01) (B). The cumulative HCC development rate of study subjects with genotype 1 was not significantly greater than those with other genotypes ( P = 0.09) (C). HCC = hepatocellular carcinoma, LC = liver cirrhosis, PEG-IFN/RBV = peg-interferon plus ribavirin, SVR = sustained virologic response. </caption>
