<p>Several limitations of the present study require consideration. First, selection bias could not be avoided because of the retrospective design of the study. Second, histologic differences in liver tissues could have confounded our analysis of factors associated with HCC development. However, liver tissue samples could not be obtained from enrolled subjects because biopsy is not a mandatory before the initiation of anti-HCV therapy. Third, some factors potentially associated with the risk of HCV-related HCC, such as, obesity, diabetes mellitus, and insulin resistance, were not addressed in the present study. Fourth, median follow-up duration was relatively short as 31 months, and therefore, long-term follow-up data are needed. Fifth, our recommendation regarding the need for active antiviral therapy based on new DAA agents in patients with CHC with some risk factors was made based on results obtained for PEG-IFN/RBV therapy. Because of time limitations imposed by the recent introduction of the new DAA agents, the preventive effects of these drugs on HCC development in patients with CHC needs further detailed evaluation in the future.</p>
