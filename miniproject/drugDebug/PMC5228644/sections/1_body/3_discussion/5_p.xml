<p>Several factors are considered contraindications to the PEG-IFN/RBV regimen.

 </sup> Historically, older patients with CHC have been excluded from clinical trials using IFN-based regimens due to drug toxicities, and an advanced age has been considered as major limitation to IFN-based anti-HCV therapy for reasons of poor tolerability and response.

  <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]
 </sup> Thus, anti-HCV therapy for older patients constitutes a major unmet need. On the other hand, new era of DAA regimen, such as, sofosbuvir- and daclatasvir/asunaprevir-based regimens, have no such contraindications, because the incidences of side effects are considerably lower.

  <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,
  <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]
 </sup> Accordingly, because an advanced age is a risk factor of HCC development in patients with CHC and new DAA agents are well tolerated, advanced age should not be contraindicate to active antiviral treatment.
