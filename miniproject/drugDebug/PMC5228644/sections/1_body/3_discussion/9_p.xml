<p>Summarizing, the present study shows that the risk of HCC development in CHC is significantly higher for patients with an advanced age, those with cirrhosis, those who have failed to achieve SVR, and those not treated with PEG-IFN/RBV. In particular, it was found for patients with CHC treated with PEG-IFN/RBV, an older age, presence of cirrhosis, and failure to achieve SVR independently predicted HCC development, and in patients with treatment-na√Øve CHC, an older age, a male gender, and presence of cirrhosis were found to predict HCC development. In our opinion, patients with CHC with one of these factors should be viewed as candidates for active antiviral therapy in the new era of highly effective oral antiviral drugs.</p>
