<p>Many patients on the PEG-IFN/RBV regimen experience side effects, and as a result, about 10% to 20% and 20% to 30% of those discontinue treatment or continue at reduced dosages, respectively.

 </sup> However, new DAA agents have fewer side effects, are better tolerated, and have higher compliance rates than the PEG-IFN/RBV regimen.

 </sup> In a previous study, we found that 27.4% (n = 181) of patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV were nonadherent due to dose reduction and drug discontinuation in 45.3% and 54.7%, respectively.

 </sup> In the present study, 37.4% of patients in the treatment group failed to achieve SVR, and this was found to be an independent risk factor of HCC development in patients with CHC. Although incidences of antiviral therapy discontinuation were not evaluated, the side effects of PEG-IFN/RBV are a probably an important cause of discontinuation, and thus, of treatment failure. Currently, patients with CHC who failed to achieve SVR on PEG-IFN/RBV can be retreated with new DAA agents and expected to achieve high SVR rates of 90% to 95%.

 </sup> Accordingly, accumulating evidence suggests the risk of HCC development in patients with CHC who failed to achieve SVR on PEG-IFN/RBV may be reduced by retreatment with new DAA agents.
