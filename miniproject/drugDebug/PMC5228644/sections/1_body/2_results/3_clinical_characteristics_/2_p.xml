<p>Clinical characteristics of patients with or without HCC were analyzed in the treatment and no-treatment groups (Table 
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). In the treatment group, median patient age was greater (

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) in patients who developed HCC than in those who did not. Other factors, such as, gender, BMI, ALT, HCV RNA, HCV genotype, and follow-up duration, were similar in these 2 HCC subgroups (
 <italic>P</italic> values for all &gt; 0.05) (Table
