<p>In the treatment group, HCC developed in 20 (4.1%) patients during a median follow-up duration of 46 months. In this group, the 2-, 4-, and 6-year cumulative HCC development rates of patients with LC were significantly greater than those without LC (8.9%, 13.5%, and 19.0% vs 0.6%, 1.4%, and 2.1%, respectively,
