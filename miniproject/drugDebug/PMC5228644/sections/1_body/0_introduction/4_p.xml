<p>The paradigm for antiviral therapy in patients with CHC has rapidly changed from PEG-IFN-based therapy to DAA agents. After the FDA approved of DAAs in 2011, new drugs, such as sofosbuvir and daclatasvir/asunaprevir, were recently approved with much higher SVR rates and lower adverse event rates than PEG-IFN/RBV.

 </sup> Given that SVR rate improvement may translate into improved long-term prognosis in patients with CHC, active antiviral therapy with these new drugs needs to be applied to as many patients as possible. To date, however, selection criteria for treatment with these new drugs have not been fully determined.
