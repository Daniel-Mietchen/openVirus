<p>If treatment is indicated, the choice of antiviral agent should be a medication with a high barrier to viral resistance. Studies of pivotal trials have revealed low long‐term (up to 8 years) rates of HBV resistance to entecavir (ETV), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). Thus, these three antiviral drugs have become the only oral therapies recommended by the AASLD and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL).

 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> TAF, a nucleotide reverse‐transcriptase inhibitor and prodrug of tenofovir, was approved in the United States in 2016 and has emerged as one effective first‐line antiviral therapy. TAF benefits from more efficient hepatocyte drug delivery compared with TDF, which allows lower allowable TAF doses. For this reason, TAF may be associated with lower risk for renal dysfunction and reduced bone mineral density compared with TDF.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0053" ref-type="ref">53</xref> An analysis of two large, randomized, phase 3 controlled trials found significantly lower bone mineral density at 96 weeks in patients receiving TDF compared with TAF (hip: −2.51% TDF vs. −0.33% TAF; spine: −2.57% TDF vs. −0.75 TAF;

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001), with TAF noninferiority for HBV viral suppression.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0054" ref-type="ref">54</xref> The recent 2017 EASL Guidelines and 2018 AASLD Guidance update have added TAF as a first‐line preferred HBV therapy to TDF, ETV, and pegylated interferon. Additionally, these recommendations include considerations for choosing TAF over TDF, including advanced age, reduced bone density, and chronic renal insufficiency (Table
