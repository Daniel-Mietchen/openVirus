<p>Current approved treatments for chronic HBV fall into two classes: nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors, also known as nucleos(t)ide analogs (NAs), and interferon alpha. Additionally, additional NAs are currently in development, including other tenofovir prodrugs besifovir and metacavir.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref> Unfortunately, even though NAs effectively suppress viral replication, they do not lead to virologic cure. Thus, most patients require indefinite oral therapy, as although partial functional cure is readily achievable with current therapies, complete functional cure is achieved in a minority and virologic cure in even fewer patients.
