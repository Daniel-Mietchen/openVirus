<p>More research on the biomarkers of treatment efficacy will allow better assessment of HBV cure. Biomarkers may assist in posttreatment monitoring and in identifying those potentially able to be successful with antiviral therapy discontinuation. Decrease in quantitative HBsAg levels has been associated with viral clearance,

 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0059" ref-type="ref">59</xref> Hepatitis B core‐related antigen (HBcrAg) is one new biomarker under investigation. HBcrAg has been correlated with cccDNA levels, can predict posttreatment recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma during antiviral therapy, and can identify patients who may successfully discontinue therapy.

 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0062" ref-type="ref">62</xref> Pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), an intermediate genome‐length RNA transcribed from cccDNA, has also been associated with cccDNA levels and may be a clinical marker for viral replication activity.
