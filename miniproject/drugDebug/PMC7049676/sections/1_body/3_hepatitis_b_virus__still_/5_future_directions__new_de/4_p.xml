<p>Development of new treatments for chronic HBV is needed, concurrently with a better understanding of the HBV replication life cycle. For treatments to theoretically achieve virologic cure, inhibition of cccDNA and viral replication is needed. Towards this goal, multiple drugs targeting multiple therapeutic targets (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41480-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>) are in development. Viral entry inhibitors such as Myrcludex B competes for viral binding for viral entry into the hepatocyte and would play a role in treating both HBV and HDV.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0063" ref-type="ref">63</xref> Other targets include viral migration to the hepatocyte nucleus, viral uncoating, cccDNA production and integration, viral replication through DNA synthesis, as well as the production and secretion of viral particles (Dane particles).
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0055" ref-type="ref">55</xref> New drug development coupled with research on combination therapies hold promise for effective viral virologic cure.
