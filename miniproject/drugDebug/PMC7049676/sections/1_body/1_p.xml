<p>Viral hepatitis continues to contribute to the burden of liver disease in the United States, causing chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and decompensated disease, liver cancer, and extrahepatic manifestations. However, this past decade has experienced a sea of change in our ability to identify, diagnose, and manage these diseases, most notably with development of curative direct‚Äêacting antiviral (DAA) therapies for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Numerous advances in treatment development and strategies have been made in chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis D virus (HDV) as well. This review aims to summarize the current epidemiology and management strategies available for chronic viral hepatitis, including future directions and areas where further work is needed.</p>
