<p>A recent systematic review and meta‐analysis of 182 articles reported a HDV worldwide pooled prevalence in the overall HBsAg‐positive population of 11% and in those with intravenous drug use as high as 38%.

 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0068" ref-type="ref">68</xref> This suggests higher HDV disease burden than previous believed (previously estimated to be only 5%).
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0069" ref-type="ref">69</xref> Further epidemiologic studies are needed to clarify the current disease burden of HDV, which in turn may help identify optimal screening strategies. Current recommendations for HDV screening suggest testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)‐positive patients, persons who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, those at risk for sexually transmitted diseases, and immigrants from areas of highly endemic regions.
