<p>The only currently recommended treatment for HDV infection is pegylated interferon‐alfa 2a or 2b, which is associated with suppression rates of only 25% (range 17%‐43%) after 12 months of treatment.

 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0071" ref-type="ref">71</xref> NAs are not indicated for treatment of HDV infection, as they were not found to contribute further efficacy,

Newer agents are under investigation, including HDV prenylation inhibitors (Lonafarnib), virion secretion inhibitors (REP 2139), and viral entry inhibitors (Myrcludex B) in phase 3 studies.
