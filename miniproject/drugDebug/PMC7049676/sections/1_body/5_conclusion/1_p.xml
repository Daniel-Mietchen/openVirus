<p>Rapid, significant advances in the diagnosis and management for viral hepatitis has changed the landscape of the treatment of viral hepatitis in the past decade. Treatment options for hepatitis C currently hold the potential for eradication in the future if reduction in new cases can be coupled with widespread disease identification and treatment. Clearly defining hepatitis B cure endpoints, in conjunction with effective biomarkers and therapies targeting multiple pathways that focus on prevention of viral replication machinery, holds the key to virologic cure and ultimately eradication. Progress on hepatitis D infection grows in tandem with that of hepatitis B, and future work in epidemiology and pharmacotherapy are needed. Finally, although hepatitis A and hepatitis E are generally approached usin supportive measures due their self‐limited nature, more knowledge regarding management is needed for the minority of patients who develop protracted or chronic disease. Finally, in all viral hepatitides, the recognition of high‐risk groups coupled with development of optimal screening and vaccination will hold the key for mitigating public health burden from these infections.</p>
