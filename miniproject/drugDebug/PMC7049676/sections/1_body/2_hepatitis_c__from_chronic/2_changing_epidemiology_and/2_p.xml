<p>In the United States, although the disease burden from HCV is decreasing, the clinical characteristics of those with chronic infection is evolving. Overall, HCV prevalence has decreasing nearly 2‐fold, from 1.6% to 0.9% over the past 20 years.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">7</xref> Additionally, the distribution of affected age groups is thought to have become bimodal, with a disproportionate number of new HCV cases seen in those aged 20 to 39 years and 40 to 59 years.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">8</xref> It has been proposed that this bimodal distribution has developed due to the increase in people who inject drugs (PWID), a population in whom prevalence of chronic HCV has been estimated to be approximately 73.4% (range 20%‐80% globally), corresponding to 1.5 million people in the United States.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> Another suggested epidemiological change based on a recent modeling analyses is that in contrast to the previous population consisting of treatment‐experienced patients, most of the treatable patients are now anticipated to be treatment‐naïve and without cirrhosis.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0010" ref-type="ref">10</xref> However, despite anticipated decreased disease incidence, disease burden is still expected to be substantial based on a modeling study finding that, driven primarily by a lack of disease identification, 560,000 patients will not know about their chronic infection, 320,000 patients will die, 157,000 will develop hepatocellular carcinoma, and 203,000 patients will develop decompensated cirrhosis in the next 35 years.
