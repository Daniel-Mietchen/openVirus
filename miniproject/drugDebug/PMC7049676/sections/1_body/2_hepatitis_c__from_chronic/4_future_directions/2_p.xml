<p>Providing treatment would ultimately only treat the 7% to 11% with known chronic HCV infection, but it does not account for those undiagnosed or not offered treatment.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> Thus, more work is needed to identify those suffering attrition during the process steps required from testing to treatment, by which loss to follow‚Äêup would result in persistent infection, described as the HCV treatment cascade.

 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> As an illustrative example, Rege et al. found in an analysis of two large national laboratory databases from 2013 to 2016, that 89.4% of patients diagnosed with chronic HCV infection did not receive prescription for antiviral therapy. In this study, 46.7% of patients did not have genotype testing, and 57.3% did not have liver chemistries, suggesting that patients suffer attrition at an early phase of the care cascade.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">31</xref> Future work to target the care cascade gaps will help to identify those for whom treatment could be offered: HCV screening, diagnosis, patient communication regarding chronic infection, care linkage, and fibrosis staging. Concurrently, development of HCV vaccinations and subsequent provision implementation strategies will be important to reduce population disease burden.
