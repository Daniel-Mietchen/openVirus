<p>Solid‐organ transplantation capacity can be expanded through improved HCV‐positive organ use. Wooley et al. conducted a single‐center, open‐label pilot trial of patients receiving organ transplantation from HCV‐infected donors of various genotypes (n = 44 with 36 lung and 8 heart transplants) who received 4 weeks of sofosbuvir and velpatasvir immediately after transplantation. The authors found that, on follow‐up, all 35 patients (100%) were alive with excellent graft function and undetectable viral load 6 months after transplantation.
