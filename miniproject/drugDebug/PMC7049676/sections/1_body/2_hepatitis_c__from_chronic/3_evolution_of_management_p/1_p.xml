<p>Our understanding of treatment‐eligible populations has developed in tandem with DAA therapies and an evolving definition of cure. Although in prior years there was need to define safe populations for antiviral treatments, current recommendations suggest treating all individuals diagnosed with HCV infection regardless of risk for reinfection, hepatic fibrosis stage, or prior‐treatment status. Additionally, the definition of SVR has been shortened to be the absence of viremia 12 weeks after treatment completion, as 99% of patients with SVR12 have been found to have persistent viral clearance at 24 weeks.
 <xref rid="hep41480-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref> This finding has reduced the heterogeneity of treatment endpoints in treatment studies, whereas prior studies used 24 or even 48 weeks to define HCV cure.
