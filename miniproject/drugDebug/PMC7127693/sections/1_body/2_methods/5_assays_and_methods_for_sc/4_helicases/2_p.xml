<p id="p0335">Virus-encoded ATPase-driven helicases have been identified in numerous human pathogens. Helicases from several (+)RNA viruses have been characterized, including NS3 helicases from flaviviruses such as dengue virus, HCV, West Nile virus, yellow fever virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus (

 <xref rid="bb1555" ref-type="bibr">Seybert et al., 2000</xref>). In Semliki Forest virus, a representative member of the togavirus family, helicase activity is encoded by the N-terminal domain of nsP2 protein. Helicases are also common in some DNA viruses, including poxviruses. These include the vaccinia virus helicase-primase D5 (
