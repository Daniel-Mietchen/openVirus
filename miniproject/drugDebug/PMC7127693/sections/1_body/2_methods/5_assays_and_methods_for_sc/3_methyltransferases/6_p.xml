<p id="p0325">Flaviviral and human cap N7-MTases have been screened with radioactive assays using 
 <sup>3</sup>H-labeled SAM and GpppAC4 or 
 <sup>7m</sup>GpppAC4 synthetic RNAs. The 
 <sup>3</sup>H methyl transferred onto DEAE filter-bound RNA can be measured by scintillation after multiple washings to remove unincorporated 
 <sup>3</sup>H-SAM (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription can be carried out using 
 <sup>3</sup>H-SAM. The radioactively labeled products are then resolved by thin-layer chromatography and developed using a phosphorimager (
