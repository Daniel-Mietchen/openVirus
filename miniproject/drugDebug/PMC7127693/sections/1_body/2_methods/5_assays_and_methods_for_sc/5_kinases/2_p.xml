<p id="p0355">Both protein tyrosine kinases and protein serine/threonine (S/T) kinases have been found in viruses. Tyrosine kinase function is well-understood in connection with oncogenic retroviruses, [for review on retroviral oncogenes, see (
 <xref rid="bb1750" ref-type="bibr">Vogt, 2012</xref>)]. In contrast to tyrosine kinases from oncogenic viruses, such as Rous sarcoma virus src tyrosine kinase, viral S/T kinases share little homology with cellular enzymes. They are exclusively encoded by large DNA viruses (e.g. herpesviruses), in which they play important roles in viral virulence, helping the virus to escape defense mechanisms such as those regulated by cytokine signaling pathways (

 <xref rid="bb1525" ref-type="bibr">Sato et al., 2017</xref>). Their autophosphorylation and transphosphorylation activities mimic those of cellular cyclin-dependent kinases such as cdc2. For example, viral kinases can phosphorylate translation elongation factor 1 delta (EF-1Î´) (
