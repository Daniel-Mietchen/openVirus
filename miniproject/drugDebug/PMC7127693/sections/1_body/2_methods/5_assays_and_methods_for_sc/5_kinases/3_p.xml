<p id="p0360">In addition to protein kinases, HSV encodes a thymidine kinase. Unlike cellular thymidine kinase, HSV thymidine kinase has a wide substrate specificity that includes pyrimidine and purine phosphonate analogs (e.g. acyclovir, ganciclovir, penciclovir) (
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">De Clercq and Li, 2016</xref>). In the body, ganciclovir is phosphorylated by cellular kinases and penciclovir and acyclovir by virus-encoded thymidine kinases to the active nucleoside triphosphate forms of the drugs that inhibit viral DNA synthesis (
