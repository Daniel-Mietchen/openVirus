<p id="p0300">HCV uses an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). A unique cell-based assay for monitoring HCV RNA polymerase (NS5B) activity, based on the innate immune signaling molecule retionic acid-inducible gene I product (RIG-I), has been developed (
 <xref rid="bb1445" ref-type="bibr">Ranjith-Kumar et al., 2011</xref>). The RIG-I-like receptors are cytosolic proteins that recognize viral RNA and induce production of proinflammatory cytokines and interferon-activated genes (
 <xref rid="bb0840" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Thomsen, 2012</xref>). RIG-I triggers cytokine production stimulated by various viral RNAs from different families, including

 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic>, as well as Ebola virus RNA (
 <xref rid="bb0840" ref-type="bibr">Jensen and Thomsen, 2012</xref>). The assay is based on recognition of HCV RNA produced by active NS5B by RIG-I, followed by RIG-I-mediated activation of firefly luciferase expression controlled by the interferon b promoter. Renilla luciferase expression is used for normalization of transfection efficacy.
