<p id="p0430">Cell-based assays can provide additional information, including the capability of the inhibitor to pass through the cell membrane and its stability in the cytoplasm. A general determination of infectivity, such as a plaque cytotoxicity assay in the presence of protease inhibitor, may be used for confirmation. One elegant example exploits the cytotoxicity of HIV protease. Cells are transfected with a protease precursor fused to GFP. In the absence of inhibitor, HIV-1 protease is autocatalytically activated and cleaves a broad variety of cellular proteins, resulting in activation of apoptosis and cell death (

 <xref rid="bb1500" ref-type="bibr">Rumlova et al., 2014</xref>). This toxic effect, when suppressed by active inhibitors, results in production of a GFP signal in surviving cells (

Another elegant approach for HIV and coxsackievirus B3 proteases, which both undergo autocatalytic cleavage, employs constructs in which the protease gene is inserted between sequences encoding the DNA-binding domain and the domain that activates transcription of the GAL1-lacZ reporter gene (

 <xref rid="bb1270" ref-type="bibr">Murray et al., 1993</xref>). The protease-mediated cleavage separates the DNA-binding domain from the trans-activating domain and results in failure of reporter gene transcription. This approach has also been modified with GFP as a reporter gene (
