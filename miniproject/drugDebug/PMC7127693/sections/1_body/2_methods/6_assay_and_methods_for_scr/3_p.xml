<p id="p0400">Development of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly systems has contributed greatly to current understanding of the structure of retroviral particles and mechanisms of virion formation. These systems also became the base for several high throughput assays for screening assembly inhibitors. During the last 20 years, a number of

 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">Cheslock et al., 2003</xref>). HTS assays for inhibitors of HIV-1 assembly include several methods using purified HIV-1 CA or CA-NC proteins. One of them, the turbidimetric assay, is based on the observation that direct dilution of the HIV-1 capsid protein (CA) into a high-salt solution (1.6–2.2 M NaCl) leads to the formation of tubular structures. As the tube formation is accompanied by an increase in light scattering, assembly can be detected as an increase in turbidity, and the rate of turbidity change is proportional to the rate of the assembly (
 <xref rid="bb0975" ref-type="bibr">Lanman et al., 2002</xref>). Other method published by Lemke et al., exploits the affinity of nucleocapsid (NC) to a short TG-rich deoxyribooligonucleotide, d(TG25), which is used as a scaffold (
 <xref rid="bb1010" ref-type="bibr">Lemke et al., 2012</xref>). This arrangement enables CA to assemble at much lower protein and salt concentrations than in the turbidimetric assay (
 <xref rid="bb0975" ref-type="bibr">Lanman et al., 2002</xref>). Biotin-labeled d(TG25) bound on the surface of neutravidin-coated microtiter well plates nucleates assembly of complexes of CA-NC and soluble fluorescein-labeled d(TG25). Fluorescence is measured after washing to remove the unbound and unassembled material from the captured assembly products (
 <xref rid="bb1010" ref-type="bibr">Lemke et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, the FAITH assay uses a dually labeled oligonucleotide (tqON). However, in this case, the ssDNA oligonucleotide tqON is labeled with the reporter dye fluorescein (FAM) as well as Black Hole Quencher (BHQ); thus, it does not emit any fluorescence. The assembly reaction is triggered by mixing HIV-1 CA-NC or a Gag-truncated assembly-competent version with tqON. Following incubation, during which tqON is incorporated into the particles, exonuclease is added to degrade unbound tqON, while co-assembled tqON is protected from cleavage. Degradation of free unbound tqON with 
 <italic>Exo</italic>I results in separation of FAM from its quencher, and the emitted fluorescence is measured (
