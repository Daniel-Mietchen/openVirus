<p id="p0410">Late in the retroviral life cycle, gRNA is incorporated into the nascent particle during assembly at the plasma membrane. NC contains two zinc-finger domains that are responsible for specific binding of gRNA. To screen for compounds that would prevent NC-RNA/DNA interactions, a HTS system consisting of two sequential screens was developed (
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Breuer et al., 2012</xref>). The primary screen uses fluorescence polarization (FP), while the secondary one uses differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). The combination and order of these two techniques were selected to first identify compounds that disrupt interactions between DNA and NC, and then identify the compounds binding to NC during the secondary screen.
