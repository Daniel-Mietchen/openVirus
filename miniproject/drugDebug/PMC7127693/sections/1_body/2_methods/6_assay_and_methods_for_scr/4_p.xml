 <xref rid="bb1610" ref-type="bibr">Sticht et al., 2005</xref>). A commercial library of M13-derived phages presenting random 12-amino-acid peptides was analyzed for specific binding to purified CA or CA-NC proteins. The specifically bound phages were sequenced, and corresponding peptides were chemically synthesized and re-tested in an
