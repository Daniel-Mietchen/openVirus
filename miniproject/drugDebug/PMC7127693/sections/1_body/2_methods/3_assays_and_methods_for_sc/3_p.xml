<p id="p0230">Jiang et al. established an

 <xref rid="bb0850" ref-type="bibr">Jiang et al., 1999</xref>). In their system, the bundle is formed by mixing equimolar concentrations of peptides derived from the N- and C-HR regions of gp41. ELISA using the monoclonal antibody NC-1, which specifically recognizes and binds an epitope formed on the gp41 6-helix bundle but not the individual peptides, enables screening for compounds that prevent formation of fusion-active gp41. For HTS of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors, this method was modified to use a fluorescence-linked immunosorbent assay (FLISA), in which the C-HR peptide was replaced with FITC-conjugated C-HR peptide (
