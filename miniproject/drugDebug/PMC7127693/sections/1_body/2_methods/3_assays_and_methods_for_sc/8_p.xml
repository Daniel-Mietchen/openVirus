<p id="p0255">Until recently, the development of anti-HBV therapeutics had been limited by the lack of an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> infection system. Several aspects of the HBV life cycle have been elucidated using 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> production of HBV particles after transfection of human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2) with recombinant HBV DNA and by establishment of hepatoma cell lines with the entire HBV genome integrated, such as the HepG2.2.15 cell line (

The identification of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) as an HBV receptor by Yan et al. opened possibilities to use NTCP-complemented HepG2 cells not only for studies of HBV replication mechanisms but also for HTS of inhibitors (
