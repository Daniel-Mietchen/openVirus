<p id="p0225">Different types of assays, including cell-cell fusion assays, cell-virus fusion assays with pseudotyped viral particles, and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical assays have been developed to screen inhibitors of viral entry. In enveloped viruses, entry is initiated by fusion of the viral envelope with the target cellular membrane. The entry mechanism has been well-described for HIV-1, in which it is mediated by Env glycoprotein, consisting of transmembrane gp41 and surface gp120 subunits. Binding of gp120 to its cellular receptor, CD4, and to one of two co-receptors, CXCR4 or CCR5, triggers a refolding of gp41 that promotes fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. The refolding involves oligomerization of the extracellular N- and C-terminal heptad repeat (HR) domains of gp41, which leads to the formation of a 6-helical bundle [reviewed in (
