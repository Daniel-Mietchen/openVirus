<p id="p0245">Virion-based fusion assays are another category of cell-based fusion assays. One such approach is based on production of chimeric HIV-1 virions carrying β-lactamase–Vpr chimeric protein (BlaM-Vpr). Chimeric HIV released into the cell culture media is isolated by ultracentrifugation and used to infect target cells. Entry of the virions into the cytoplasm is detected by cleavage of a fluorescent substrate by β-lactamase. The fluorescence shift corresponds to the fusion efficacy and is measurable by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, or fluorometric plate reader (

 <xref rid="bb1715" ref-type="bibr">Tscherne et al., 2010</xref>). Their assay uses influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) bearing the influenza membrane proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase. BlaM tagged with influenza matrix protein (M1) is incorporated into the VLPs and delivered into target cells. Upon release, BlaM can be detected by flow cytometry, microscopically, or fluorometrically.
