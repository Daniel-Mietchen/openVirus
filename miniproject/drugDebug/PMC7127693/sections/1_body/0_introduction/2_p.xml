<p id="p0020">Viral pandemics remain serious threats to humankind. Every year, known viruses such as HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus newly infect millions of people across the globe. In addition, recent outbreaks of Ebola virus, influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) serve as a reminder of the silent danger. The World Health Organization reported in 2015 that over 1.34 million causalities per year are connected with hepatitis B and almost 500,000 with hepatitis C. Occasional epidemic outbreaks of other viruses are also striking. These include outbreaks of noroviruses, flaviviruses (Zika and dengue viruses), new strains of influenza viruses, the re-emergence of West Nile virus in Italy and the United States. Despite relatively long pauses, viruses such as influenza virus can re-emerge and cause global pandemic health problems.</p>
