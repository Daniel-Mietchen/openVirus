<p id="p0045">The viral life cycle is the process of viral replication in a host cell. First, viruses enter the host cell and replicate their genomes. Following translation of viral proteins by the host cell machinery, viruses package their genomic material into protective proteinaceous capsids and exit the cell to infect another host cell. Nonenveloped viruses consist only of a protein capsid shell enclosing the viral genome and enzymes, while the capsid shell of enveloped viruses is enclosed in a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane. Regardless of whether the virus is enveloped, its surface must display (glyco)proteins suitable for specific interactions with host cell receptors. In contrast to the surface proteins of nonenveloped viruses, those of enveloped viruses usually serve another function in addition to host cell recognition and attachment. For example, they may enable fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, usually through an interaction with a secondary receptor(s) or co-receptor(s). The fusion domains of viral surface glycoproteins thus can lower the kinetic barrier for the energetically demanding membrane fusion.</p>
