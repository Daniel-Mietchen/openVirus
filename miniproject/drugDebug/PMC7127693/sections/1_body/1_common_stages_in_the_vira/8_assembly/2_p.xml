<p id="p0140">Depending on the species, viruses assemble either in contact with the cellular membrane or independent of the membrane in either the nucleus or cytoplasm. The membrane-independent route is used by nonenveloped viruses and a few enveloped viruses (e.g. orthomyxoviruses, herpesviruses, and some retroviruses) that acquire the membrane envelope after intracellular assembly during budding from the cell.</p>
