<p id="p0155">Most viruses assemble upon interaction of their structural proteins with cellular membranes. The target membrane for assembly differs according to the virus type. Flaviviruses assemble at the surface of the ER and then upon their budding into the ER lumen, the immature particles are then transported into the TGN. Some viruses, such as coronaviruses, assemble at the ERâ€“Golgi intermediate compartment [reviewed in (
