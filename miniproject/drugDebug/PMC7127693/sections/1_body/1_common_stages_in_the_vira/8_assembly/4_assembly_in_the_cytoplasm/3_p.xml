 <xref rid="bb0530" ref-type="bibr">Freed, 2015</xref>), assemble underneath the cytoplasmic membrane, which facilitates assembly by providing a scaffolding function. The virus then acquires a lipid envelope through budding across the plasma membrane. During this process, it also gains the envelope glycoproteins (Env) that are anchored in the plasma membrane by hydrophobic transmembrane domains. Env reaches the plasma membrane by a cellular secretory pathway upon synthesis in the ER and subsequent glycosylation in the Golgi. Usually, a specific interaction between viral structural proteins and glycoproteins is required. This may be either direct or mediated through the interaction with matrix protein (e.g. in (â€“)RNA viruses such as ortho- and paramyxoviruses or rhabdoviruses). Most retroviruses, including HIV (so-called morphogenetic C-type), also assemble at the plasma membrane of the host cell. The interaction of the structural polyprotein precursor (Gag) with the plasma membrane is usually facilitated by a bipartite signal in the N-terminal domain of Gag (i.e. matrix protein) comprising both the basic patch and N-terminally linked myristoyl residue (added co-translationally to Gag). In contrast to C-type assembly at the membrane, morphogenetic B/D-type retroviruses assemble at pericentriolar sites where Gag polyproteins are transported along microtubules by dynein molecular motors (
