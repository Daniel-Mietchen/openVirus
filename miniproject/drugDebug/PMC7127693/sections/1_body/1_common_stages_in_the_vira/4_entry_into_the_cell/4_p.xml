<p id="p0075">Upon internalization, most viruses become trapped and enclosed in vesicles that pinch off the inner side of the plasma membrane and transport their cargo into the cytoplasm. On their way through the cell, these transport vesicles undergo maturation by fusing with other vesicles. To fulfill their task of genome replication, viruses have to escape from these endosomes. The “great escape” is triggered by activation of a fusion or penetration mechanism, such as changes in conditions in the endosomal interior [e.g. pH, ionic environment (e.g. calcium ion concentration), oxido-reducing conditions], changes in membrane composition, and other physico-chemical cues (

Depending on the requirements for a particular virus, these events can occur in early endosomes (pH 6.5–6.0; e.g. hepatitis C virus, vesicular stomatitis virus), late endosomes (pH 6.0–5.0; e.g. influenza A virus, dengue virus, SARS coronavirus), recycling endosomes, macropinosomes, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes (pH 5.0–4.5) (

For the majority of animal viruses, the activation of these fusion or penetration mechanisms occurs through conformational changes and structural rearrangements in viral surface proteins and/or the whole virion shell that may destabilize the capsid core. Structural rearrangements in enveloped viruses usually mediate fusion of viral and endosomal membranes. In nonenveloped viruses, the structural changes uncover amphipathic or hydrophobic domains that may induce pore formation or disruption of endosomal membranes. To deliver genetic material to the replication site, these mechanisms ultimately release viral capsid structures from endosomal vesicles into the cytosol either by fusing with the endosomal membrane (enveloped viruses) or by penetrating the endosomal membrane (nonenveloped viruses).
