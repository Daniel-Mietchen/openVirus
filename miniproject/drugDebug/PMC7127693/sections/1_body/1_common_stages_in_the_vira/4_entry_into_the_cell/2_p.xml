<p id="p0065">In general, the first phase of viral infection is specific recognition of the target host cell and binding to a surface receptor displayed on the cell membrane. This process is common to both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. In enveloped viruses, the binding is mediated by viral surface components, typically oligomers of integral glycoproteins. Nonenveloped viruses bind receptors through sites or projections on the capsid surface. Viruses can use either a single receptor (e.g. TIM-1 for hepatitis A virus, GM1 for SV40, CD155 for poliovirus, low-density lipoprotein receptor for human rhinovirus) or multiple receptors with equivalent roles (e.g., Nectin-1/2 or HVEM for herpes simplex virus 1/2, ACE or L-SIGN for SARS coronavirus). For other viruses (e.g. HIV, HCV, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, picornaviruses, and some herpesviruses), the presence of at least two cytoplasmic membrane components is required. For example, HIV-1 binds to the primary receptor CD4 and one of two co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) [reviewed in (
