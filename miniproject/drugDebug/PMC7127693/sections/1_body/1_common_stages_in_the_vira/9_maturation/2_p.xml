<p id="p0175">Numerous viruses assemble from polyprotein precursors that must be specifically cleaved by a viral protease to generate infectious particles. This mechanism, which is an irreversible step in the virus life cycle, ensures equimolar packaging of structural proteins and proportional co-assembly of viral enzymes in the form of precursors. Upon proteolytic release, the liberated proteins may undergo different trafficking pathways or fulfill various functions in the virus. Maturation changes the energy of interaction forces among those interfaces required for intracellular assembly of immature particles to those suitable for viral stability in the environment and for disassembly and uncoating of genetic material for replication [reviewed in (
