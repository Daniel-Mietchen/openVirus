<p id="p0180">In poliovirus, the autocatalytic and subsequent viral protease-mediated cleavage of P1 precursor protein allows formation of pentamers that interact with gRNA. Additional cleavage of VP0, yielding VP2 and VP4, is required to form infectious poliovirus particles. In retroviruses, proteolytic processing is initiated by the autocatalytic liberation of viral protease, which subsequently cleaves the polyproteins to trigger major structural rearrangements in the virus and release of other viral enzymes (reverse transcriptase and integrase) and structural proteins.</p>
