<p id="p0090">The ssRNA genome of retroviruses, which is fully enclosed inside a protective capsid shell, must be reverse transcribed into dsDNA and released from the capsid. Although it is accepted that HIV-1 uncoating is linked to reverse transcription and nuclear import (
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Ambrose and Aiken, 2014</xref>) and is controlled by host factors (e.g. cyclophilin A, TRIM5Î±), the precise molecular mechanisms that trigger the uncoating remain unknown. Several hypotheses have been proposed, including breakage of the capsid shell due to increased inner pressure caused by accumulation of the reverse transcription product (
