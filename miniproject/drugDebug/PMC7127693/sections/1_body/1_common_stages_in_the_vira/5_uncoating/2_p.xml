<p id="p0080">Uncoating is the partial or complete disassembly of the protective capsid shell and/or lipid envelope to liberate the viral genome. For many viruses, this process is closely connected with conformational changes induced by the virus binding to the cell surface receptor; a low pH environment; or changes in oxido-reducing conditions, ion concentrations, or other factors. For enveloped viruses, uncoating involves a loss of the viral membrane by fusion either with the plasma membrane or with intracellular vesicles, followed by stepwise uncoating of the protective capsid shell. In nonenveloped viruses, the uncoating process typically involves conformational changes that result in the weakening of intermolecular interactions, loss of structural proteins, proteolytic cleavage, and so on (
