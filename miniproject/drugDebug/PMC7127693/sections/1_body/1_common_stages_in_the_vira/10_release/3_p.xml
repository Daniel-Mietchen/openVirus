<p id="p0205">The standard way for enveloped viruses to leave the host cell is budding, which includes membrane extrusion and separation of the viral and cellular membranes (so-called pinching off). The lipid envelope layer acquired during viral particle budding through the plasma membrane protects the virus particle. There are three basic mechanisms of budding: i) mediated by envelope glycoproteins, such as the E protein of coronaviruses; ii) independent of glycoproteins, in which the viral structural proteins trigger the extrusion of the plasma membrane, such as retroviral budding in which strong interactions between the Gag N-terminal domain (matrix protein) and the plasma membrane induce bulging of the membrane; and iii) requiring interaction between the viral glycoproteins and the capsid for membrane extrusion, as in alphaviruses.</p>
