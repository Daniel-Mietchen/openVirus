<p id="p0105">Viral genomes can be encoded by various types of NAs, as summarized in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for DNA viruses and 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for RNA viruses. By convention, ssDNA of equivalent polarity to mRNA is designated as the positive (+) strand. The complementary ssNAs are of minus polarity (âˆ’). The majority of DNA viruses replicate in the nucleus, where cellular DNA replication and transcription also occur. In contrast, RNA viruses usually replicate in the cytoplasm.
