<p id="p0120">In viruses with segmented genomes (
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>), each segment is transcribed in an autonomous transcription-replication unit by viral RNA polymerase that binds to the 5â€² end cap structure. Of note, the genomic RNA (gRNA) is capped by a unique mechanism called cap-snatching (
 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">Ferron et al., 2017</xref>), in which the cap is cleaved from cellular mRNA and transferred onto the viral gRNA by a subunit of viral RNA polymerase (
 <xref rid="bb1370" ref-type="bibr">Pflug et al., 2017</xref>). Some dsRNA viruses (
 <italic>Birnaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Reoviridae</italic>) also contain segmented genomes. Upon replication, these viruses must ensure stoichiometric incorporation of single copies of each gRNA segment into new particles. This is guided by specific packaging signals on each segment of gRNA that interact with positively charged domains in the capsid proteins [reviewed in (
 <xref rid="bb0800" ref-type="bibr">Isel et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb1400" ref-type="bibr">Pohl et al., 2016</xref>)]. Although different models of packaging have been proposed for various segmented genome viruses, a common feature is co-assembly of the capsid proteins with the gRNA and RNA polymerase.
