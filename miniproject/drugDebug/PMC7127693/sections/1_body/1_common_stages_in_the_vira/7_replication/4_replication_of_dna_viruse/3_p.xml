<p id="p0130">Viruses with intermediate-size genomes (up to 35 kb) (e.g. adenoviruses) encode their own DNA polymerase for genome replication, but they usually utilize cellular RNA polymerases II and III for transcription (
 <xref rid="bb0515" ref-type="bibr">Fields and Knipe, 2013</xref>). Viruses with large genomes (larger than 100 kb) (e.g. herpesviruses) encode proteins for replication, including DNA polymerase and DNA helicase-primase, as well as some enzymes necessary for biosynthesis of deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates (dNTPs) and several transcription factors (
 <xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Boehmer and Nimonkar, 2003</xref>). Poxviruses (e.g. vaccinia virus), are another type of virus with large dsDNA genomes, and their replication, transcription, and translation take place entirely in the cytoplasm within discrete juxtanuclear sites called virus factories (

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D, III). These viruses encode all enzymes and specific factors necessary for genomic replication and transcription. With their own replicative machinery, large-genome DNA viruses can replicate in nondividing cells. In contrast, the replication of small-genome DNA viruses, which depends on cellular DNA polymerases, must occur simultaneously with the S-phase of the cell cycle (e.g. parvoviruses), or must express some viral protein/oncogene to re-program the host cell-cycle regulatory proteins p53 or retinoblastoma protein (pRb), triggering entry into the S-phase (e.g. polyomaviruses and papillomaviruses). By affecting the G1/S checkpoint (controlled by p53 and pRb), the viruses ensure the production of host enzymes required for viral replication (
