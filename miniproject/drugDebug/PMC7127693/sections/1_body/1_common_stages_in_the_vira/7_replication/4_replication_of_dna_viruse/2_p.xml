<p id="p0125">The genomes of DNA viruses come in a considerable variety of sizes and shapes, from small ss to large ds molecules that may be linear or circular. The size range of these genomes (from 1.8 kb to 1200 kb) reflects the necessity for some viruses to encode specific proteins required for viral replication. Small-genome DNA viruses (polyoma-, papilloma-, and parvoviruses) use only host cell enzymes for replication and transcription. The only exceptions are some hepadnaviruses (e.g. hepatitis B virus) that despite having small genomes (approximately 3 kb), encode their own specific DNA polymerase/reverse transcriptase that reverse transcribes pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) into genomic viral DNA (
