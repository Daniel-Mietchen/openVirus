<p id="p0435">The need to develop new antiviral compounds will likely persist over the long term, although there has been enormous progress in molecular biology methods, especially RNA silencing, bioinformatics, imaging, and structural biology techniques. Viruses present challenging targets for drug development due their flexibility and adaptability caused by the error-prone copying of their genomes, which can result in emergence of drug-resistant mutants. Viral integration into the host genome and inhibitor toxicity are other obstacles. Here, we provide an overview of 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> methods, including cell-based assays, that may be suitable for screening of antivirotics that interfere with the key steps of viral life cycles and target either virus or cell-encoded proteins required for the infectivity.
