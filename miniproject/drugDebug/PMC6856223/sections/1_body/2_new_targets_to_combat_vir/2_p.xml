<p>Targeting some host proteins participating in the replication of viruses positively modulate the viral infection, and their inhibition has recently shown new insights into antiviral drugs development (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">Huthoff and Towers, 2008</xref>). Although not all of these proteins have been identified, recent advances in clinical studies indicated additional targets to combat viral infection. Targeting the host cell factors involved in the HIV-1 replication might be one way to overcome the resistance of HIV-1 to antiviral drugs (
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">Opar, 2007</xref>). While drugs directed to viral proteins act against specific viral infections, those targeting host proteins have a wide range of antiviral effects (

Binding the HIV envelope protein gp120 to the CD4 receptor on host cells is followed by engagement of specific chemokine receptors (CXCR4 and CCR5) as co-receptors of host cells for fusion and their antagonists considered as HIV-fusion inhibitor (
