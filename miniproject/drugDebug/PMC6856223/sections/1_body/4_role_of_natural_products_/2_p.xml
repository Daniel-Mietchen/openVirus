<p>Considerable advancement has been made in the use of several natural plant-derived products for the treatment of HIV infection. It has been previously shown that terpenoids, coumarins and flavonoids possess promising activities for the prevention and attenuation of the HIV infection. Flavonoids have been found to inhibit fusion (

More recently, a tricyclic coumarin has been shown to suppress nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-ÐºB) activation and, thereby, inhibited HIV replication
