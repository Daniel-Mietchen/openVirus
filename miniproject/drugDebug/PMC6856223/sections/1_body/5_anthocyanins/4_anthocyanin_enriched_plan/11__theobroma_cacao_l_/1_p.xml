<p>Cyanidin-3-arabinoside and cyanidin-3-galactoside were found as two major anthocyanins in cocoa seeds (CS), which contained 0.02–0.4% of defatted CS powder (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">Niemenak et al., 2006</xref>). Kamei et al. investigated the antiviral activity of CS and showed which it was dose-dependently effective against, InfV A, InfV B, and avian InfV. The extract’s mechanism of action was the inhibition of the adsorption phase of viruses. In a mice model, CS significantly increased the survival after exposure to an intra-nasal lethal dose of InfV. On the other hand and to examine the antiviral properties of CS in the human model, the natural killer (NK) cell activity and the titers of neutralizing antibody against InfV A were evaluated. The results suggested that the NK cell activity was increased; though the improvement was more considerable in the treated group. The titers of neutralizing antibody were considerably enhanced in treated and control groups; however, the enhancements were not significantly different between the groups. Finally, CS and its derivatives improved the immune system responses and procured more potent protection against InfV disease (

The finding showed cacao husk extract inhibited the HIV-1 cytopathic effect against MT-2 and MT-4 (HTLV-1 transformed T-cell lines), syncytium formation between HIV-infected and uninfected MOLT-4 cell line (
