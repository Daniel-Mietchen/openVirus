<p>The outcomes of HPLC-PDA-MS/MS analysis of the anthocyanins extracted from 
 <italic>Rubus coreanus</italic> (Bokbunja, black raspberry) exhibited the presence of some anthocyanin structures, which were tentatively identified as cyanidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-xylosylrutinoside, 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-sambubioside, cyanidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, delphinidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside, delphinidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-glucuronide and pelargonidin 3-
 <italic>O</italic>-rutinoside (

In their study on the black raspberry (RCS) seed enriched with a high amount of polyphenolic compounds, Lee et al. reported the antiviral activity of RCS fraction (RCS-F1) and the total extract against food-borne viral feline calicivirus-F9 (FCV-F9), murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1), and surrogates (FBVS). The highest antiviral activity was reported when both the extract and fractions were added together to infected cells with FCV-F9 or MNV-1, which resulted in a complete inhibition. The results showed that the RCS-F1 disrupted viral capsids and their expansion, and impaired the attachment to the surface protein of host cells. Moreover, one anthocyanin called cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) was isolated from RCS-F1 that showed inhibitory activity against the viruses. The mechanism of action of C3G is through binding to RNA polymerase of MNV-1 and expansion of viral capsids (

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016b</xref>), which may be related to the anthocyanins as sources of active ingredients target viruses. As Oh reported, RCS inhibited noroviruses and caliciviruses infection, probably through inhibiting their entry or attachment to the cellular receptor (

 <italic>R. coreanus</italic> as a prospective plant and its cyanidin derivatives with potential use in the prevention and treatment of viral disease.
