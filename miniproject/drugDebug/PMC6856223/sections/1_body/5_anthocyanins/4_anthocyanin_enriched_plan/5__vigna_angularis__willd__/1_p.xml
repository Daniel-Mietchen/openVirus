<p>The isolation and structural elucidation of anthocyanin from the 
 <italic>Vigna angularis</italic> (red bean) have shown cyanin as a major anthocyanin of this species of edible legumes (
 <xref rid="B260" ref-type="bibr">Yoshida et al., 1996</xref>). Kawai et al. studied different extracts of 
 <italic>V. angularis</italic>, which among exudate fluids and aqueous extract, respectively, indicated potent and little antiviral activities against rabies virus (RV). According to the findings, the anthocyanins fractions were involved in the antiviral activity of 
 <italic>V. angularis</italic>, which were affected by maceration conditions, and the anthocyanin-deficient white bean did not show antiviral effects into the exudate fluids. Moreover, the antiviral activity was still observed after heating for 10 min. Further studies on the antiviral activity of the extract affect preliminary adsorption phase and the preliminary phase of viral replication. The antiviral activity of 
 <italic>V. angularis</italic> was not only restricted to RV, but the HSV and InfV were affected as well (
