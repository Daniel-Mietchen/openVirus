<p>Pomegranate (
 <italic>Punica granatum</italic>) is a rich source of anthocyanins (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">Legua et al., 2016</xref>). Delphinidin-3,5-diglucoside is known as a major anthocyanin in pomegranate juice, and cyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, pelargonidin-3,5-diglucoside, delphinidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, pelargonidin-3-galactoside, and pelargonidin-3-glucoside are in the next ranks (

Neurath et al. investigated the inhibitory activity of pomegranate juice (PJ) against HIV-1 of the cells, which was expressing the CD4 and CXCR4 receptors as coreceptors. PJ acts directly through inhibiting the both HIV-1 and the virus receptor: CXCR4 as a coreceptor with the highest inhibitory effect. Actually, PJ inhibited the binding of CD4 to the gp120 of HIV-1 envelope. According to the evidence, it has been suggested that the PJ ingredients bound irreversibly or strongly to the binding site of CD4 on gp120 to inhibit the early stages of virus replication. It also possessed inhibitors of HIV-1 that were targeted by the gp120 virus envelope belonging to a class of antiretroviral drugs, the development of which is quite rare (

 <italic>P. granatum</italic> as an inexpensive and safe anti-HIV-1 fruit with widely available sources.
