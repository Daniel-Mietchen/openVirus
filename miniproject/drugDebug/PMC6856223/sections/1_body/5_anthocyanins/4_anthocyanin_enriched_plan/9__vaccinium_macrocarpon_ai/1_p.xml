<p>Several studies revealed the antiviral properties of cranberry (

 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Côté et al., 2010</xref>). Cyanidin-3-galactoside, cyanidin-3-glucoside, cyanidin-3-arabinoside, peonidin-3-galactoside, peonidin-3-glucoside, and peonidin-3-arabinoside were reported as the anthocyanin content of four cultivars of cranberry by P. 
 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">Viskelis et al. (2009)</xref>. In their study, Lipson et al. assessed the antiviral effects of cranberry juice (CJ) on unconnected viral species. The treatment of bacteriophage T2 (BT2) with CJ showed no detectable virus infection. Like BT2, almost identical data were reported for the bacteriophage T4 (BT4). The inactivation of BT4 by CJ was fast and dose dependent. Further studies determined the antiviral effect of CJ against a simian rotavirus SA-11. CJ is closely connected to the adsorption phase of the replication in virus. In addition, inhibition of hemagglutinin occurred at a 20% concentration of CJ that was treated with simian rotavirus SA-11 (

The findings indicate that the inhibitory effect of CJ on InfV adhesion and infectivity may have therapeutic potential and may be a suitable natural extract for viral diseases.
