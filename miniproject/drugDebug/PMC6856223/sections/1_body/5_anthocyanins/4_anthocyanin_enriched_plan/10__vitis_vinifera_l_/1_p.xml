<p>Delphinidin, cyanidin, petunidin, peonidin, malvidin, and their glycosides were introduced as major anthocyanin composition of fruit of

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Cortell et al., 2007</xref>). In a research study on grape seed extract (GSE), Joshi et al. examined its antiviral effects against three viruses: feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), murine norovirus (MNV-1), and hepatitis A virus (HAV). They also studied the activity of GSE in 2% milk, apple juice (AJ), gastric juice (GJ), and water conditions at 37 °C. The antiviral activity of GSE was dose-dependent and enhanced with time. The GSE possessed some mild activities at the viral adsorption stage of viruses with minor activity on the replication stage. GSE also showed positive effects on foodborne viral diseases (

In the other study, GSE indicated antiviral effects by producing Th1-derived cytokine interferon- γ (IFN-γ) through peripheral mononuclear cells, proposing that the effective immunostimulatory activity of GSE might be mediated through IFN-γ induction (
