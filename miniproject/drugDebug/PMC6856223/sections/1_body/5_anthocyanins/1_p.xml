The presence of anthocyanins in petals is connected to attracting the pollinators, while the anthocyanin presence in seeds and fruits may lead to dispersal of the seed. The other importance of anthocyanins in plants is their use as feeding deterrents and protectants against UV irradiation- induced damage (
