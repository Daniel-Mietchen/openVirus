<p>Maximum concentrations of anthocyanins are achieved after 1.5 h (plasma) and 2.5 h (urine) (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">Manach et al., 2005</xref>). The metabolites exist in the urine up until 24 h and may save the basic structure of anthocyanin (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">Kay et al., 2004</xref>). The urinary excretions of anthocyanins were estimated to be less than 0.1% in humans, while some studies reported up to 5% levels of anthocyanin excretion (

 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">Felgines et al., 2003</xref>). This demonstrates the extensive metabolism of anthocyanins in the body before their urine excretion (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">Fang, 2014</xref>). In general, the studies showed that anthocyanins are absorbed rapidly from stomach (

 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">Talavera et al., 2003</xref>) and small intestine (
 <xref rid="B160" ref-type="bibr">Miyazawa et al., 1999</xref>), and present in both blood and urine like intact, methylated, sulfate or glucuronide conjugated forms (
 <xref rid="B252" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">Felgines et al., 2005</xref>). Anthocyanins are degraded rapidly by the microflora of the intestine so that they might be existing in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). Although the degraded compounds are remarkably unstable in all circumstances, in the neutral pH, they are naturally changed into aldehydes and phenolic acids (

 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">Keppler and Humpf, 2005</xref>). There are different ways to enhance the stability and then the bioavailability of anthocyanins. Some studies showed that consumption of anthocyanin with foods influences the absorption and excretion phase. For instance, both rats and human, phytic acid hulls nuts components, grain and seeds (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Dendougui and Schwedt, 2004</xref>), lead to enhance the bioavailability of blackcurrant anthocyanins (
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>). Anthocyanins urinary recovery from rats was enhanced by increasing of phytic acid dose, which leads to the reduction of GIT mobility, decreases the anthocyanins passage through the GIT and finally plays a part in increasing the time for the absorption phase. Phytic acid also enhanced the levels of anthocyanin in human plasma and urine(
 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>). Another method to enhance the bioavailability of anthocyanins is the use of nanoformulations like nanoparticles, nanocomplexes, nanoliposomes, and nanoemulsions (
