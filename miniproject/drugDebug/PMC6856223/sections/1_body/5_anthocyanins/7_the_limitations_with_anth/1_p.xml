<p>The daily use of anthocyanins in the USA is estimated about 200 mg/day (
 <xref rid="B241" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Stoner, 2008</xref>). Although anthocyanins are ordinarily consumed in the guise of a meal, there is limited information about their bioavailability and pharmacokinetic. To comprehend the effectiveness of anthocyanins, determining the features of anthocyanin at the molecular level, their absorption (serum level), as well as urine concentration of anthocyanin red pigments after oral administration, is critical (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">Lucioli, 2012</xref>). Following such intakes, the plasma concentrations of anthocyanins were found to be very low. Recent studies have revealed a rapid absorption followed by a quick metabolization and excretion of anthocyanins into urine and bile as methylated, glucuronidated or intact glycosides derivatives. Some clinical studies have shown that anthocyanins are absorbed with poor efficiency (
