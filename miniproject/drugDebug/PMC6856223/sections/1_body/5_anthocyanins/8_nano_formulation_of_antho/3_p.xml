<p>Encapsulating the anthocyanin into nanoparticles plays a significant role in overcoming this drawback and improving their antiviral properties (

According to Liu et al., nanocrystallization of anthocyanin potentiated the antioxidant capacity of pure proanthocyanidins under stressful conditions (
