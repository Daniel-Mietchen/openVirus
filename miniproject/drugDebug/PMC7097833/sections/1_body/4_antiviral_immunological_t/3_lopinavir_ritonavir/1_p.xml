<p>Lopinavir/ritonavir is a well-known protease inhibitor which has been widely used for many years for the treatment of HIV infection. Compared to remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir has the advantage that itâ€™s widely available and has an established toxicity and drug-drug interactions profile. Its antiviral action against coronavirus infections has been previously demonstrated both in-vitro and in-vivo (animal and human data) in studies conducted on SARS (in combination with ribavirin) and MERS infection. Moreover, a randomized clinical trial (RCTs) on lopinavir/ritonavir combined with IFNb use in MERS infection is currently ongoing [MIRACLE Trial].</p>
