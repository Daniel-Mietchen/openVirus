<p>It has been postulated that antiviral action of chloroquine may depend by several mechanisms such as the change of cell membrane pH which is necessary for viral fusion and the interference with glycosylation of viral proteins. Hydroxychloroquine, an analogue of chloroquine, has been proved to have similar if not better in-vitro efficacy on SARS-Cov-2.</p>
