<p>Highly pathogenic viruses such as Ebola and variola pose a significant threat to human health, yet in most cases, therapies to prevent or treat these diseases are lacking. Project BioShield was put forward in 2004 by the U.S. President George W. Bush to help address this issue by expediting research and development of medical countermeasures against biothreat agents. In theory, this legislation gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the ability to make promising treatments available quickly in emergency situations, and ensures that resources are available to pay for “next-generation” medical countermeasures. Project BioShield is a comprehensive effort overseen jointly by the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) with involvement from other federal agencies, including the Department of Defense (DOD), as appropriate. Recognizing the limitations of BioShield, additional legislation was passed in 2006 to help drug companies to bridge the “Valley of Death”, the crucial middle phase of drug development between basic research and the acquisition of final products, which includes many of the late stage development activities required to support a New Drug Application (NDA). The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) was created to facilitate collaboration between companies and the federal government and to promote innovation. These measures are helpful, but there is still a significant disconnect between recognizing what needs to be done and actually accomplishing it in a timely fashion. We are committed to trying to bridge this gap. In the sections below, we will discuss the major challenges to develop these new antivirals and the approach we have taken for the development of new therapeutics against Category A viral biothreat agents.</p>
