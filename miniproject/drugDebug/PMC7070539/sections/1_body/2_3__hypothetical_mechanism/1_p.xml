<p>DDX3 helicase is a multifunctional protein interacting with many human and viral proteins and their complexes with RNA [

 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], but its role in the viral replication of different viruses has not been studied precisely. It was shown that DDX3 plays a dual function in viral replication: first, as a cofactor of viral replication, and second, as a mediator of the innate immunity system. The role of helicases in viral infection was discussed in several reviews [

In this section, we describe the proposed mechanisms of action of the DDX helicases in the replication of HIV, HCV, HBV, herpes, and influenza viruses. The most detailed virus replication scheme involving DDX3 helicase has been described for HIV (

DDX3 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein, which binds to the Rev/RRE/CRM1 transport complex for enhancing the export of unspliced/partially spliced HIV RNA from nucleus to cytoplasm. Knockdown of DDX3 using RNA interference or dominant-negative mutants suppresses Rev/RRE/CRM1 function in the export of full-length HIV RNA [
