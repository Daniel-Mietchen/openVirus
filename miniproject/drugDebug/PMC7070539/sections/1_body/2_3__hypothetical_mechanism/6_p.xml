<p>Finally, DDX proviral action could be due to its role in the regulation of stress granules (SG) and processing bodies (P-bodies). SG are membraneless organelles that consist of proteins with distorted structure and various RNAs. Specifically, most mRNAs sequestered to SGs are under stalled translation, so the formation of these organelles suppresses global and gene-specific translation, and in particular, may result in changes in interferon response [
 <xref rid="B83-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In P-bodies mRNAs are stored for decapping and degradation or until initiation of translation. However, the biology of stress granules and P-bodies is not well understood, so the role of DDX3 in their functioning merits further studies. DDX3 is a regulator of SG assembly [
 <xref rid="B84-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>] and maturation [
 <xref rid="B85-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. The assembly of stress granules is enhanced in HCV-infected cells [
 <xref rid="B86-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. The binding of DDX3 to 5â€²-UTR of HCV RNA promotes interaction of the latter with SGs as well as with lipid droplets [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Noteworthy, SG assembly is inhibited in tumor cells harboring DDX3 with tumor-associated mutations [
 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>], i.e., the inactivated protein [
 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. So, DDX3 inhibitors could be regarded as tools to prevent virus-induced formation of SGs. The formation of stress granules may affect HCV replication by a global change in host gene translation. Indeed, DDX3 binds to a vast majority of mRNAs, as well as to 18S rRNA, thus blocking their translation [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. However, as shown for yeast DDX3 orthologue Ded1, the helicase is also critical for reinitiation for translation [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Specifically, DDX3-mediated SG assembly may significantly affect the translation of mRNAs bearing upstream open reading frames (uORFs) [
 <xref rid="B92-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] and probably cap-independent translation. Indeed, for enterovirus serotype 71, which is also a small enveloped RNA virus, DDX3 does stimulate IRES-mediated translation of its genome [
 <xref rid="B94-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Another recent paper suggested that DDX3 is also a regulator of non-AUG initiated translation [
 <xref rid="B95-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. So, the role of DDX3 in virus replication can also be explained by a switch from cap-dependent (i.e., cellular) to cap-independent (i.e., viral) RNA translation. However, it is evident that investigation of stress granule biology may unveil their role in the replication of viruses and in controlling innate immune response.
