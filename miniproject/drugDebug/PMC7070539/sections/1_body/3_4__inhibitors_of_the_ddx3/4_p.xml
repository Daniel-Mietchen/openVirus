<p>The compounds 
 <bold>A</bold> and 
 <bold>B</bold> inhibited DDX3 helicase activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 1 μM and 6 μM, respectively, being a competitive inhibitor with respect to RNA substrate [
 <xref rid="B41-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Taking 
 <bold>A</bold> and 
 <bold>B</bold> as leading compounds, the compounds were modified after docking analysis of the crystal structure of the complex DDX3 + compound, using the 3D structure of DDX3 in its closed conformation [
 <xref rid="B31-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The most interesting among the predicted inhibitors was the compound 
 <bold>1</bold>, bearing a triazole ring instead of the nitro group. The compound inhibited DDX helicase activity with IC
 <sub>50</sub> 0.3 μM and displayed inhibiting potential against HIV, HCV, Dengue virus, and West Nile virus replication in cell cultures, with ED
 <sub>50</sub> 1.1 μM for HIV, 0.97 μM for HCV, 2.55 μM for Dengue virus, and suppressed West Nile virus replication by 98% at a concentration of 20 μM. The cytotoxicities of the compounds were rather low (&gt;200, 50, 200 µM, respectively) [
 <xref rid="B8-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Importantly, the compounds also suppressed HIV1 strains resistant to anti-HIV drugs. One of the essential disadvantages of the compounds was low aqueous solubility, which makes it difficult to study the inhibitors in animal models.
