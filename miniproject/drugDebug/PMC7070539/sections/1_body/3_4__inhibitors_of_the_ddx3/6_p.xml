<p>Based on compound 
 <bold>5</bold> and previously published compound 
 <bold>2</bold> (
 <xref rid="molecules-25-01015-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), a new series of DDX3X inhibitors was synthesized, validated as inhibitors of both DDX3 helicase in vitro and the WNV replication [
 <xref rid="B16-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The most interesting compound proved to be compound 
 <bold>6</bold>, which showed high activity against WNV and a good safety profile. The docking studies showed that the compound acts as a competitive inhibitor towards a template in the helicase binding site. Compound 
 <bold>6</bold> displayed the highest antiviral activity among the series, inhibiting WNV replication by 98% at 20 Î¼M.
