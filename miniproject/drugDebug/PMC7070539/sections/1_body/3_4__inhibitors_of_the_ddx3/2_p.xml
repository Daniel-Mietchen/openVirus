<p>The first potential DDX3 inhibitors were synthesized after a high-throughput docking prediction of the interaction of commercially available compounds from the Asinex Co. (Asinex Ltd., Winston-Salem, NC, USA,

 <uri xlink:href="http://www.chembridge.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.chembridge.com</uri>)) with the crystal structure of the DDX3â€“AMP complex in closed conformation [

 <xref rid="B118-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Later on, their structures were optimized and the compounds were tested as inhibitors of DDX3 in vitro and some of them as suppressors of virus replication in cell cultures and tumor aggression. Among the active compounds were derivatives of rhodanine, pyrazolo-, or diarylurea [
