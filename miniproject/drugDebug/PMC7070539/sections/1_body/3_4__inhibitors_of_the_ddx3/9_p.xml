<p>Later on, it was shown that RENs display not only antiviral but also anticancer activities. The role of DDX3 in cancer development is rather controversial. DDX3 helicase can act as an oncogene or tumor suppressor in different cancer types [

 <xref rid="B125-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Moreover, DDX3 may play different roles in the same type of cancer. For example, a decreased level of DDX3 was found in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) caused by HBV, although not by HCV [

 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. Up to now, there is no exact explanation of the dual role of DDX in a variety of cancers, but some data should be taken into consideration. DDX3 is involved in the cell signaling pathway Wnt/Î²-catenin and can affect the Wnt regulation cascade, which is crucial to DDX3 functions in cancer development [
 <xref rid="B130-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. DDX3 also modulates cell adhesion, represses the E-cadherin expression, which results in increased cell migration, and thus promotes tumor progression [
 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. As supposed, different roles of DDX helicases might be associated with mutations in the DDX helicase (as can be exemplified by [
 <xref rid="B132-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]) or virus infections, particularly HCV or HBV. DDX3 knockdown with short interfering RNA (shRNA) or small molecules suppressed cell motility and reduced metastatic potential in cancer cells and a mouse model [

 <xref rid="B131-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. The localization of DDX3 within the cell might also determine different DDX3 functions. Usually, DDX3 accumulates in the cytoplasm of the cell, but there are also reports of DDX3 export from nucleus to cytoplasm during tumor progression. DDX3 helicase is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling protein predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of non-malignant cells. It has been suggested that its localization is altered during cell transformation and could even contribute to malignancy [
