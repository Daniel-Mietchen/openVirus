<p>Among synthesized REN analogs (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01015-f004">Figure 4</xref>), NZ51 suppresses ATPase/helicase of DDX3 at low micromole concentration in vitro and displays antiproliferative activity, blocking cell replication at the G1 phase of aggressive breast cancer in different cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], causing a global delay in cell cycle progression [
 <xref rid="B135-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. The observed effects were similar to those upon the silencing of the DDX3 gene. Unfortunately, NZ51 treatment had no effect on primary tumor growth rates in a mouse model system, although DDX3 knockdown by shRNA resulted in reduced tumor volume and metastasis progression [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Among ring-expanded derivatives, the compound RK33 proved to be the most interesting and prospective for medicine (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-25-01015-f004">Figure 4</xref>). RK-33 was found to display antiproliferative activity against Ewing sarcoma [
 <xref rid="B136-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>], breast cancer [
 <xref rid="B137-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>], medulloblastoma [
 <xref rid="B25-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], colorectal [
 <xref rid="B129-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>], prostate [
 <xref rid="B138-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>], and lung [
 <xref rid="B116-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>] cancer, due to a stage G1 arrest [
 <xref rid="B43-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Moreover RK-33 proved to be a radiosensitizer that allows a reduction in the dose of radiation for cancer treatment [
 <xref rid="B45-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. The precise mechanism of RK-33 action in different types of cancer remains to be elucidated. There is evidence that the inhibition of DDX3 functions by RK-33 could disrupt the DDX3-Î²-catenin complex and cause a disturbance in the Wnt signaling pathway involved in cell differentiation, cell proliferation, malignant tumors, and transition of the G1/S cell cycle [
