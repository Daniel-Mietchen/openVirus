<p>The general architecture of the DEAD-box helicase family is quite conservative. The helicases are composed of two RecA-like domains connected via a short flexible linker that allows changing their orientation to each other, which is critical for the enzyme functions [

 <xref rid="B30-molecules-25-01015" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Variable C- and N-terminals contain from a few to several hundred amino acids, which allow interaction with other proteins or RNA. RecA-like domains are composed of nine conservative motifs involved in ATP and RNA binding, ATP hydrolysis, and RNA strands unwinding.
