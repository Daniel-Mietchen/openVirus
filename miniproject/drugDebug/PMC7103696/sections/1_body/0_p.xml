 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], has led to over 80,000 diagnosed cases including more than 3000 deaths globally as of 29 February 2020. While the overall mortality rate for SARS-CoV-2 seems lower than SARS or MERS, the death rate among severe cases infected by SARS-CoV-2 is alarming. There are a wide range of efforts to develop special treatments for COVID-19 with limited success. In the current commentary, EMI invited three leading infectious disease experts in China who have personally participated in the clinical management of COVID-19 cases to share their bedside observations and to suggest what may be important in formulating the treatment strategy to optimize the clinical outcome.
