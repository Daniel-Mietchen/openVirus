<p>Every critically ill COVID-19 patient in Shanghai is managed by a group of healthcare providers which includes at least a pulmonologist, an infectious diseases expert, a critical care specialist, and an ECMO specialist if necessary. Nephrologists, psychiatrists, physicians of traditional Chinese medicine, experienced nurses also actively participate in managing these patients as well. Besides, substantial heterogeneity among severe patients was noted. Mild patients are more alike, but each severe case is severe in his/her own way. There may be multiple pathophysiological mechanisms in these critically ill patients. The types of critically ill patients need to be more carefully classified in order to perform more individualized treatment, in addition to conducting more dedicated research to develop a unique management plan. In Shanghai, medical decisions and interventions are carefully tailored to the unique characteristics of each severe patient.</p>
