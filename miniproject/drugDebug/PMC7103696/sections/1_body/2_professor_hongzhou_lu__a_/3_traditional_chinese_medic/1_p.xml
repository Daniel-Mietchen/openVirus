<p>Traditional Chinese medicine, after a long history of clinical use, has carved out its own theory and practice. The most typical ones are the “Doctrine of Shanghai” (febrile diseases caused by exogenous pathogenic factors) and the “Doctrine of Seasonal Febrile Diseases.” In the diagnosis and treatment of acute respiratory infectious diseases like SARS and influenza, traditional Chinese medicine has played a significant role. But its treatment determination is based on “Syndrome Differentiation,” in which case, individual plans are produced. The Chinese medicine formulae are typical of complicated chemical compositions. This means that a creative evaluation system of traditional Chinese medicine needs to be developed.</p>
