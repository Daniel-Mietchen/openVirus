  <p>Screening of anti-EBOV compounds using the trVLP system. (A) Flow chart showing the screening procedure. (B) Z’ factor plot derived from HTS performed in 96-well plates. Black spots present the results of the FLuc assay and red spots those of the RLuc assay. The signal-to-basal ratio (S/B), coefficient of variation (CV), and average Z’ factor are shown. The dashed line indicates a threshold of 0.5. (C) trVLP replication (y-axis) and cell viability (x-axis) are expressed as percentages in the presence of 2,354 different compounds (each at 10 μM). The green box highlights 86 primary hits that suppressed trVLP replication below 15% and maintained viability of HEK293T cells between 80% and 120%.</p>
