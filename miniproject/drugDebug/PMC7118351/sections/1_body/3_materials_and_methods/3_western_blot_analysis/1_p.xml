<p>HEK293T cells seeded in 6-well plates (1 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells per well) were transfected with pCAGGS-NP (120 ng), -VP35 (120 ng), -VP30 (80 ng), -L (1,000 ng) together with pCAGGS-Tim1 (250 ng). The next day, 2 mL of 3-fold diluted trVLPs (P0) were infected into cells with increasing concentrations of antiviral compounds. On day 1 p.i., the cell lysates were harvested using the M-PER buffer (Thermo Scientific). Twenty micrograms of total protein per well were loaded on the 10% or 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). Viral proteins were detected using primary antibodies specific for VP40 (Cat. no. 40446-T48; Sino Biological) or NP (Cat. no. 40443-T62; Sino Biological), followed by a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific). The cellular β-actin protein, a loading control, was detected with an anti-β-actin-specific primary antibody (Cat. No. A1987; Sigma) and the HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Thermo Scientific).
