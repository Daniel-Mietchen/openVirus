<p>HEK293T cells (2 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> cells per dish) were cultured in a 150-mm dish overnight and transfected with p4cis-vRNA-RLuc (4 μg), pCAGGS-T7 (4 μg), -NP (2 μg), -VP35 (2 μg), -VP30 (1 μg), and L (15 μg) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On day 3 post-transfection, the culture supernatants with EBOV-derived trVLPs (passage 0, P0) were harvested and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min (
