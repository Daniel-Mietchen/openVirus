<p>Plasmids used in this study were designed for the tetracistronic minigenome (p4cis-vRNA-RLuc) under the T7 promoter and for the expression of T7 RNA polymerase (pCAGGS-T7), viral proteins (pCAGGS-NP, -VP30, -VP35 and -L) and TIM-1 (pCAGGS-Tim1) under the chicken beta-actin (CAG) promoter. Their constructs were reported previously (
