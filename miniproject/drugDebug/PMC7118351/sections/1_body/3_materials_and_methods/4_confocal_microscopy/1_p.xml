<p>Plasmids expressing polymerase complex (NP, VP35, VP30, and L) and TIM-1 were cotransfected into HEK293T cells seeded on 12-mm glass cover slips in 24-well plates (3 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells per well). The next day, the cells were infected with 500 μl of trVLP (P0) in the presence of each test compound (10 μM) or RBV (100 μM). Following fixation and permeabilization, the cells were immuno-stained with an anti-GP antibody (Cat. no. 40304-T44; Sino Biological) and an Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (Invitrogen), and counterstained with Vectashield mounting medium containing 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; Vector Laboratories). Confocal fluorescent images were acquired using Zeiss LSM 700 (Carl Zeiss). The number of GP-positive cells was quantified by collecting data from 36 nonoverlapping images per well in triplicate for each sample to analyze wide-field fluorescence occupancy (IncuCyte FLR; Essen BioScience).
