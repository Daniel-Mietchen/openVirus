<p>For high-throughput screening, we transfected and infected cells with the trVLP system derived from EBOV. After treatment of 2,354 small organic compounds, we measured their effects on the expression of both firefly luciferase (FLuc) and 
 <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (RLuc), in which FLuc represents cell viability and RLuc denotes trVLP replication (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Based on the measurement of FLuc with 0.02% DMSO as a delivery vehicle, the average Z’ value was 0.61, with a signal-to-basal (S/B) ratio of 336 and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 13% (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>). From the RLuc analysis with 0.02% DMSO, the average Z’ value was 0.57, with an S/B ratio of 450 and a CV of 14%. Z’ values in all plates were higher than 0.5, which suggested the reliability of the screening assay. We primarily selected 86 hits with relative RLuc values &lt; 15% and FLuc values ranging between 80% and 120% at 10 μM (
