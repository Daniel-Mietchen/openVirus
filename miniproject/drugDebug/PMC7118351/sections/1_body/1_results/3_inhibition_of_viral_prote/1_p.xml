<p>To investigate whether the antiviral compounds reduce viral protein levels and generation of progeny trVLP, we performed immunoassays and quantitative RT-PCR (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Western blot assay showed that tetracistronic minigenome-derived VP40 was downregulated in a dose-dependent manner by sertindole, raloxifene and ibutamoren as well as RBV, a positive control, whereas the amount of another viral protein, NP, expressed via the plasmid-derived CAG promoter remained consistent (

 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref>). Total fluorescent spots per well were quantified by collecting images from 36 areas without any overlap in each sample triplicate. This wide-field imaging analysis revealed that the number of GP-positive spots was reduced significantly in the presence of 10 μM sertindole (by 84.7%), raloxifene (by 69.1%), or ibutamoren (by 74.2%) as well as 100 μM RBV (by 62.5%) (
 <xref rid="S1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>). We investigated whether their inhibition suppressed the production of infectious trVLPs. Culture supernatants were harvested to quantify the relative amounts of the encapsidated tetracistronic minigenomic RNA. After RT and touchdown PCR, quantitative PCR analysis was performed using EBOV-specific primer sets as described previously (
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The results revealed suppression of the amount of negative-sense minigenome RNA incorporated into trVLPs in a dose-dependent manner (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C</xref>). These data strongly suggested that sertindole, raloxifene and ibutamoren not only prevent trVLP-derived EBOV viral replication in cells but also subsequently block the generation of trVLP progeny.
