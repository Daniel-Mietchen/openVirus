<p>To establish this finding, we purchased highly purified sertindole (≥ 97.5%), raloxifene (≥ 98%), and ibutamoren (≥ 98%) and repeated the antiviral assay using a wide range of concentrations of compounds (0.015 to 100 μM) (
 <xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Nonlinear regression analysis revealed EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 1.5, 1.2, and 0.2 μM and the CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 23.1, 13.9, and 42.4 μM against HEK293T cells, respectively. However, the FLuc values could have been affected by the transfection efficiency of the reporter plasmid rather than by cell viability. Thus, we performed another cytotoxicity assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT). Treatment of the mock cells with increasing concentrations of the compounds resulted in CC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 13.7 μM for sertindole, 23.4 μM for raloxifene, and 76.7 μM for ibutamoren (
