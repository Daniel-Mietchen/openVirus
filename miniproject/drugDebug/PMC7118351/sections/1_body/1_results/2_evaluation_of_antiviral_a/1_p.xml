<p>Five-point dose-response curves with these 86 hits were analyzed with 3-fold dilutions from the initial concentration of 30 μM. Both 50% effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) and 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC
 <sub>50</sub>) were calculated according to the simple two-point method using the RLuc and FLuc data, respectively (

 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The majority of these compounds have been used to treat psychotic disorders or allergic diseases by binding to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). This finding was partially consistent with previous reports of GPCR modulators as anti-EBOV compounds (

 <sub>50</sub>, 0.7 μM; SI, &gt; 45.8), raloxifene hydrochloride (raloxifene; EC
 <sub>50</sub>, 0.5 μM; SI, 47.1) and ibutamoren mesylate (ibutamoren; EC
 <sub>50</sub>, &lt; 0.4 μM; SI, &gt; 81.1) showed the most prominent antiviral activity among the 15 major hit compounds. They were comparable or superior to the known anti-EBOV compounds such as ribavirin (RBV) and T-705 in their inhibitory effects.
