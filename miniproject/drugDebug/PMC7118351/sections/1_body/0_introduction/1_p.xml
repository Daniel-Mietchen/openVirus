 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Zaire ebolavirus [ZEBOV or simply Ebola virus (EBOV)] is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, negative sense RNA genome measuring approximately 19,000 nucleotides in length (
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It encodes structural proteins including nucleoprotein (NP), envelope glycoprotein (GP), and the matrix protein VP40, in addition to VP24 (nucleocapsid-associated protein), VP30 (an activator of viral transcription), VP35 (a type I interferon antagonist and a polymerase cofactor) and RNA dependent RNA polymerase (L), and non-structural proteins such as sGP (
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Efficient viral infection requires at least two cellular receptors, the endo/lysosomal cholesterol transporter protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) and T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The viral ribonucleocapsid (NC) consisting of the helical NP-viral RNA (vRNA) complex associated with VP24, VP30, VP35 and L is released into the cytoplasm after macropinocytosis (
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). The negative sense vRNA is transcribed into mRNA for synthesis of viral proteins and complementary RNA for further vRNA amplification. During the final stage of the virus life cycle, the progeny virions are assembled at the plasma membrane via a VP40-dependent mechanism (
