<p>In this section, the optimal solution of optimality system (
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="EEq17">17</xref>) is investigated. Given that there are initial conditions for the state variables and terminal conditions for the adjoints, the optimality system is a two-point boundary value problem with separated boundary conditions at times 
 <italic>t</italic>=0 and 
 <italic>t</italic>=
 <italic>T</italic>. The forward-backward sweep method described in [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] is hence used for the numerical solution of the optimal control problem. The method is named based on how the algorithm solves the problem's state and adjoint equations. The state variables are solved using the forward difference scheme while the adjoint variables are solved using the backward difference scheme. The solution iterative scheme makes an initial guess of the controls and using that guess solves the state system forward in time using a 4th-order Runge–Kutta scheme. Next, using the stored values of the controls and the solution of the state system, the adjoint system is solved backward in time using a 4th-order Runge–Kutta scheme. The RK4 method has to be adapted to account for solving backward in time. The controls are then updated using a convex combination of the previous controls and the values obtained using the characterizations. The updated controls are then used to repeat the solution of the state and adjoint systems. This process is repeated with values in the current iteration being tested for convergence against a user provided tolerance and depending on that, the algorithm either starts the process over again using the updated control or the algorithm terminates. The final approximations for the control, state, and adjoint systems are considered to be the solution to the optimal control problem.
