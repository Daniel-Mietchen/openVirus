<p>The numerical simulations were carried out using the MATLAB software and the parameter values in 
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. There is however paucity of published estimates of morbidity and mortality rates resulting from influenza pneumonia coinfection in the middle- and low-income countries. On the other hand, in high-income, temperate countries where influenza surveillance has been done for years, these rates are well documented [
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]; hence the data used in this research study are from these countries. The population under consideration is children &lt;5 years and adults &gt;60 years. Studies show that influenza pneumonia coinfection affects people of all ages; however, the morbidity and mortality rates of the high risk group which includes the immunocompromised, children &lt;5 years, and adults &gt;60 years are disproportionately high [
