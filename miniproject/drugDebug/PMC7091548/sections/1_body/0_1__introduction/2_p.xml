<p>The morbidity, mortality, and economic burden resulting from the lethal synergism that exists between influenza virus and pneumococcus are of major concern globally. The catastrophic 1918 influenza pandemic is an extreme example of the impact that results from this cooperative interaction [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Lung tissue samples examined from those who died during this pandemic revealed that the majority of deaths were as a result of secondary bacterial pneumonia. Data from the subsequent 1957, 1968, and 2009 influenza pandemics are consistent with these findings [

 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> have been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. According to [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], influenza virus alters the lungs in such a way that predisposes them to invasion by pneumococcus rendering a mild influenza infection severe or even fatal. This could be through several ways such as epithelial damage, changes in airway function, upregulation and exposure of receptors, dampening of the immune response, or amplification of inflammation. Several studies have been carried out to investigate the time course of susceptibility to 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> after influenza virus infection. Results revealed that on average, individuals developed coinfection within 6 days after influenza virus infection [
