<p>Clinical evidence points out that infection with a particular combination of pathogens results in an aggravated infection with more severe clinical outcome compared with infection with either pathogen alone [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is specially true for influenza virus and bacterium 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Influenza and pneumonia each contributes greatly to the global burden of morbidity and leads to high death toll, typically over a relatively short period of time [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>–
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic>, and 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> are the most common causes of pneumonia, the chief being 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Coinfection resulting from influenza virus and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> further increases morbidity and mortality and is a major public health concern. These two pathogens rank among the chief pathogens affecting humans, and their ability to work together presents a major threat to world health [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Coinfection greatly impairs the host's immune system, increases antibacterial therapy intolerance, and can be detrimental to the diagnosis of the disease [
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. According to [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], it can be difficult to identify influenza patients experiencing bacterial coinfections due to symptom overlap of influenza and bacterial infections. In [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], it is indicated that a strong index of suspicion and additional diagnostic testing may be required for diagnosis and treatment of the infections.
