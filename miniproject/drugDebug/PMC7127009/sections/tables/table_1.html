   <td align="left">2- Follow the recommendations for infection prevention suggested by the Italian Ministry of Health, in particular avoid contact with crowded places. Smart working is encouraged.</td>

   <td align="left">3- Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine seem to have some efficacy on SARS-CoV2 infection.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td align="left">4- Chronic immunomodulatory therapies, including biologic drugs, must be guaranteed for rheumatic patients. This includes tocilizumab and baricitinib availability for patients chronically taking these compounds, as they may start to be used to treat CoViD-19 severe pneumonia cases.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td align="left">5- Outpatients clinics, albeit with limited activity, should be guaranteed for biologic therapies, as the National Health System has authorized people to move for very specific reasons such as health issues. For all patients, consulting should be made available using media that exclude a person-to-person relationship.</td>
