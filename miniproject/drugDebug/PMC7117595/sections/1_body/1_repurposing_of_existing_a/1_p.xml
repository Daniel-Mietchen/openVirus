<p>Broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs) that have been deemed ‘safe-in-man’ through testing on early phase clinical trials have been touted as good drug repurposing candidates [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Andersen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> have recently summarized 31 potential candidates for COVID-19 in a highly accessible database of 120 experimental, investigational and approved agents [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Conceptually, BSAAs take advantage of the promiscuity of viral replicative mechanisms and host interactions to target two or more viral families [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Following the COVID-19 outbreak in December 2019, a few existing BSAAs have been rapidly introduced into clinical trials, spanning Phases II though IV. Umifenovir is a membrane fusion inhibitor targeting viral entry and lopinavir/ritonavir is a drug combination targeting viral protease, both approved for the indications of Influenza and HIV. They are currently being considered in different combinations in a Phase IV clinical trial for pneumonia associated with COVID-19 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT04255017) [
