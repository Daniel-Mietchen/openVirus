<p>One limitation of phenotypic screens is the low potency of hit compounds as single agents, as their maximal tolerated dose is often subtherapeutic for the new indications being sought [
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. One way to circumvent this issue is to evaluate two or more drugs acting on different cellular signaling pathways involving viral replication with minimal redundancy. Another strategy is high-throughput screening of compound libraries for synergistic combinations at the hostâ€“virus interactome level for emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, which may allow researchers to narrow down the spectrum of individual antimicrobials [

 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These strategies promise to address the often-weak activity of BSAAs by improving efficacy while potentiating dose reductions, reducing duration, cost of the drug development pipeline, lowering toxicity and minimizing emergence of secondary resistance.
