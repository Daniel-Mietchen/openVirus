<p>It is no secret that COVID-19 has caught the global public health community by surprise, with the number of laboratory-confirmed human cases surpassing the 200,000 mark as of late March 2020, leading to the WHO declaring it a pandemic. While all efforts should be made toward prevention and/or containment of the 2019/2020 outbreak, it is evident that contingency measures with experimental therapeutics must be urgently sought. With the average cost of 
 <italic>de novo</italic> drug development reportedly over $1 billion USD, what are viable strategies to discover potential candidate drugs to combat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)? Here we take a snapshot look at the strategy of drug repurposing – also known as drug reprofiling or repositioning – that promises to identify antiviral agents for the novel coronavirus disease in a time-critical fashion. We also offer a perspective that antiviral combinations with a ‘double hit effect’ may offer the best chance of success and clinical translatability.
