<p>Further, drug repurposing will have to compete with structure-based design of preventative/therapeutic vaccines and small molecules on efficacy and off-target toxicity turfs. The CoV spike glycoprotein used by SARS-CoV-2 at the atomic resolution and human ACE2 enzyme as its port of cellular entry have now been determined. These discoveries are hoped to spur rapid efforts to develop vaccines and antibodies. However, such processes typically take up to a decade and can be hindered by the potential for blunted antigenicity of epitopes due to genetic drift of the virus [
