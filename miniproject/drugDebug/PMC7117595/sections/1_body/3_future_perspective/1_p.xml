<p>A notion that will determine the effectiveness of this drug repurposing strategy is whether such agents will compare favorably with virus-specific vaccines or small molecules, both options traditionally considered gold standards of modern drug development. If one were to extrapolate the experience from precision oncology, where targeted cancer therapies and immunotherapeutics have made major gains against cancer, a broad-spectrum strategy will have fundamental flaws. Importantly, the lack of specificity of BSAAs may become implicated in the emergence of drug resistance and more virulent strains.</p>
