    "BACKGROUND:Antiviral drugs are widely used in populations with viral infection caused by immunologic inadequacy. Because these drugs are mainly metabolized by the kidneys, patients with renal failure undergoing renal replacement therapy are prone to drug adverse effects and poisoning. Severe neurotoxicity caused by antiviral drugs is a rare but life-threatening complication. CASE SUMMARY:This study reported one male patient on peritoneal dialysis who suffered from severe mental disorders after receiving an overdose of acyclovir and valacyclovir for the treatment of herpes zoster. The literature review suggested that hemodialysis is better than peritoneal dialysis to clear acyclovir from the circulation. The patient died after his consciousness deteriorated despite peritoneal dialysis and continuous blood purification. CONCLUSION:This case emphasizes cautiousness when using anti-retroviral drugs in patients with uremia. Hemodialysis is optimal method to remove the drugs."
