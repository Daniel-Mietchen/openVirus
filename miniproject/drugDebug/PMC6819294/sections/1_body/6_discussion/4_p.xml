<p>Since acyclovir is mainly cleared by the kidneys, it is a consensus to reduce its dose in patients with renal failure[
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The dose is mainly determined by a combination of factors such as different methods of dialysis, residual renal function, hydration, and age. The dose of drug used in many cases of neurotoxicity is often greater than the recommended dose[
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It is generally believed that a concentration of acyclovir of 2.5-4.5 µg/mL[
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or a concentration of its main metabolite, carboxymethoxy methylguanine, above 10.8 µmol/L[
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] in plasma leads to neurotoxicity. Nevertheless, there is still no consensus on the specific numerical reference range of therapeutic and toxic doses of such drugs, and it is difficult to measure the drug levels in clinical practice.
