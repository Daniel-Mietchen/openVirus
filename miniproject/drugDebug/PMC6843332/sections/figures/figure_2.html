 <caption> Posterior distributions of relative substitution rates. Protein products of HHV-1 involved in the packaging of DNA (pUL6, pUL15, pUL17, pUL25, pUL28, pUL32, and pUL33) are shown in blue and the protein products of HHV-1 that are currently used as antiviral targets (pUL23, pUL30 and pUL42) are shown in gray. pUL15 (red) has been highlighted to show an extremely conservative rate of change relative to the other packaging related genes. </caption>
