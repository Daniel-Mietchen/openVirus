 <caption> Phylogenetic tree of 21 homologs of HHV-1 pUL15. The tree is rooted on an outgroup GaHV-2. Sequences are labeled by virus abbreviations. Each node shows the posterior probability value from a Bayesian analysis followed by the bootstrap support value reported as percentages from maximum likelihood analysis. The scale bar represents the number of substitutions along each branch. </caption>
