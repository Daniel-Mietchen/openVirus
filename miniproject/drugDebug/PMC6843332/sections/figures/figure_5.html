 <caption> Orientational cross-correlations between residue fluctuations. The cross-correlation (CC) map shows the extent of correlation of the movements between two nodes, i and j , representing amino acid residues. CC values vary fromâˆ’1 (fully anticorrelated motions, blue) to +1 (fully correlated motions, red). </caption>
