<p>The analysis of the rate of change of all proteins in the herpesviridae family reveals that those involved in the packaging of DNA are generally the most conserved. These proteins include pUL6, pUL15, pUL17, pUL25, pUL28, pUL32, and pUL33. Mutations or removal of these proteins result in complications in the formation of the virus, typically affecting the ability to successfully cleave and package DNA into its capsid. This makes any of these proteins a potential antiviral target because, once the DNA packaging has been hindered, the spread of new virus particles will be impaired. To determine suitable protein targets, the rates of change were calculated for those protein products of HHV-1 involved in the packaging of DNA. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f002">Figure 2</xref> shows that pUL15 (red) is more conserved than not only any other packaging protein in HHV-1 (blue), but also the current drug targets (gray). pUL42 and pUL23, in accord with previous studies [
 <xref rid="B20-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], are the least conserved out of the proteins which were analyzed, which may explain the resistance that has emerged against raltegravir and acyclovir, respectively. Since pUL15 is one of the most conserved proteins in the entire virus, utilizing it as a model for drug discovery may prove to be highly beneficial. Although letermovir has already paved the way for DNA packaging motor inhibition, it has done so by targeting the pUL28 homolog in CMV and has been observed to only affect CMV. This could be explained by the lesser degree of conservation found in the pUL28 homolog in HHV-1. Targeting a more conserved protein, such as pUL15, may allow for a more inclusive use of antivirals by developing wide spectrum therapies to treat multiple viruses from the HHV family.
