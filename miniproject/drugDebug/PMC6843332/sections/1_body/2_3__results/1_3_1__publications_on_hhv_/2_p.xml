<p>A gap between the number of papers published on HIV compared to HHV and influenza is likely a result of the high mortality rate of HIV and a significant support provided by the World Health Organization Global Special Programme on AIDS [

 <xref rid="B82-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. The increase in the publication of influenza research papers correlates with flu outbreaks; this is especially true with the outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5n1 in Asia in 2003 and the Swine flu pandemic in 2009. Herpes viruses lack the dramatic peaks in transmission that are seen in influenza and the widespread mortality rate of HIV to spur research, which likely results in comparatively fewer publications. However, the human herpesvirus family includes the pathogens HHV-1 and HHV-2 along with VZV, EBV, CMV, HHV-6, HHV-7, and HHV-8, meaning that the human herpesvirus family is responsible for numerous diseases including roseola, post-transplant infections, neurological disabilities in infants, chicken pox, shingles, lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Hodgkinâ€™s disease, and infectious blisters on the lips and genitals. HHV-1 and HHV-2 alone can result in neonatal infection, keratitis meningitis, encephalitis, and HHV-2 increases the likelihood of HIV infection by three-fold [
