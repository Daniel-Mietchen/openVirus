<p>A sequence-based analysis of DNA binding was conducted with DP-Bind and DISPLAR. Since sequence-based predictions may not always be reliable, a review of currently available literature discussing potential DNA binding residues in pUL15 was conducted. To test these predictions, we docked DNA to the pUL15 model. We computationally created a double-stranded (ds)DNA with a 3D-DART using an HHV-1 sequence and docked it to the protein with HADDOCK. The third cluster of the top five results was selected as it was the most consistent with binding residues reported by DP-Bind, DISPLAR, and the published literature. A detailed model of pUL15 bound to DNA shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="biomolecules-09-00603-f009">Figure 9</xref> reveals three loop structures flanking the DNA. Two are flanking the DNA on one side, while the third is positioned on the other side of the DNA. Added to the heat map described above, the DynOmics online server also generated a molecular motion using an Anisotropic Network Model (ANM), which provides information on how protein residues are predicted to move. A movie showing the molecular motion of pUL15 predicted based on its cross-correlation map is included as

These results indicate that the protein is moving in a manner perpendicular to the DNA, supporting a hypothesis that the DNA movement likely involves either rotation or revolution, rather than a simple linear motion.
