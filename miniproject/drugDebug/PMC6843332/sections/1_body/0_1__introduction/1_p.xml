<p>Approximately 80% of the world population are infected with a form of herpes viruses [
 <xref rid="B1-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Herpes viruses remain for the life of the host and can establish latency, a non-productive state that allows the virus to go undetected and unaffected by antiviral drugs [

 <xref rid="B4-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HHV-1 and HHV-2) are associated with blisters on the lips and genitals, respectively, whereas HHV-6 and HHV-7 cause Roseola in infants [

Human cytomegalovirus (CMV or HHV-5) is linked to lethal diseases involving the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, liver, retina, and central nervous system in immune compromised individuals, and is the leading cause of post-transplant infection [

Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) causes Burkett’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and Hodgkin’s disease, and has been detected in approximately 70% of advance breast cancer tumors [
