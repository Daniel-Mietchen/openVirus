<p>The most common antiviral strategy against herpes viruses is based on nucleoside analogs targeting the viral DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase. While these drugs are effective, many of them are associated with significant toxicities, poor bioavailability, and resistance in immunocompromised persons [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The nucleoside analogues acyclovir and ganciclovir are the standard therapy for HHV-1 and CMV, respectively [
 <xref rid="B22-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,
 <xref rid="B23-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,
 <xref rid="B24-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. These compounds target HHV-1 pUL30, the viral DNA polymerase, and HHV-1 pUL23, the viral thymidine kinase. Regarding CMV, mutations in the viral kinase pUL97 and polymerase pUL54 mediate resistance to ganciclovir and valganciclovir [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The prevalence of resistance against acyclovir is 5% in immunocompromised persons and as high as 30% in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], whereas the incidence of resistance to ganciclovir is 5–10% in organ transplant recipients [
 <xref rid="B27-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 40–50% in patients receiving repeated treatments or prolonged prophylaxis [
 <xref rid="B25-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. HHV-1 strains that are resistant to acyclovir are typically cross-resistant to thymidine kinase-dependent drugs such as penciclovir and famciclovir. They also may be cross-resistant to polymerase dependent drugs, foscarnet or cidofovir [
 <xref rid="B26-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Ganciclovir-resistant strains also have shown cross resistance to second-line treatments foscarnet and cidofovir [
 <xref rid="B28-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Targeting the DNA polymerase and thymidine kinase, while widely used, is not the only option for herpesvirus antivirals.
