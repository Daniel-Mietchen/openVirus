<p>The capsid needs to be filled with the appropriate DNA for a viable viral particle to be formed. Replication of the HHV genome first creates a concatemer and, subsequently, the packaging motor identifies the genetic sequence and begins packaging. At a certain point in the packaging process it must cleave the DNA in the proper location so only a monomeric strand of DNA remains in the capsid [
 <xref rid="B33-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The first antiviral agents to inhibit the cleavage of concatenated DNA into monomeric genomes, through inhibiting the terminase, were 2,5,6-trichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (TCRB) and 2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-(β-D-ribofuranosyl) benzimidazole (BDCRB). These compounds are suspected to affect CMV proteins encoded by genes UL56 coding the small terminase subunit and UL89 coding the large terminase subunit, the key components of the packaging motor. Mutations in UL56 result in resistance to TCRB, whereas mutations in UL89 cause resistance to both TCRB and BDCRB [

 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The high resistance caused by mutations in UL89 were mapped to amino acid substitutions D344E and A355T [
 <xref rid="B35-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Since there are no acidic residues corresponding to D344 of CMV in the HHV and VZM UL89 homologs, BDCRB and TCRB are unlikely to interact with HHV and VZV. This accords with in vitro results showing that benzimidazole ribonucleosides have little to no effect against HHV, VZV, HHV-6, and HHV-8 [
 <xref rid="B30-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Along with the specific nature of these compounds, they also are metabolized too rapidly in vivo, despite their effectiveness in cell culture [

 <xref rid="B37-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. To develop more biologically stable compounds, analogs have been derived from BDCRB, including acetylated, tetrahalogenated benzimidazole D-ribonucleosides, 2-bromo-4,5,6-trichloro-1-(2,3,5-tri-

 <italic>O</italic>-acetyl-β-d-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (Cl4RB), which inhibit DNA cleavage and packaging [

 <xref rid="B39-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. BTCRB is suspected to inhibit the ATPase activity of pUL56 [
 <xref rid="B38-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], while Cl4RB is believed to interfere with the interaction between pUL56 and the portal protein pUL104 [
 <xref rid="B40-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These two compounds are shown to be active against VZV, rat cytomegalovirus, and human cytomegalovirus, however Cl4RB has no effect on HHV-1 and the effects of BTCRB are minimal [
