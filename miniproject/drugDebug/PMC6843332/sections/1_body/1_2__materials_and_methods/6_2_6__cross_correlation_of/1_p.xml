<p>To predict residue fluctuations, an elastic network model for pUL15 was built using the Gaussian Network Model (GNM) via the DynOmics online tool [
 <xref rid="B79-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The default cutoff distance of 7.3 Ã… between GNM nodes was used. The cross-correlation (CC) map shows the extent of a connection between two nodes representing amino acid residues. DynOmics by default includes all the principal modes of structural variations in the CC map. Each mode represents the direction of the concerted motion of the entire system, which is determined upon principal component analysis (PCA) of the covariance matrix.
