<p>Twenty-one HHV-1 UL15 gene homologs from various herpes virus species were collected by BLAST [
 <xref rid="B54-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] with HHV-1 as the query. These sequences, highlighted in italics in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00603-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, have E-values &lt;10
 <sup>âˆ’15</sup> against HHV-1. Amino acid sequences were obtained from the Reference Sequence (RefSeq) database [
 <xref rid="B55-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Multiple sequence alignment was performed with MUSCLE [
 <xref rid="B56-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. The ProtTest 2.4 server [
 <xref rid="B57-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] was used to determine the best fitting substitution model. The LG+I+G+F substitution model scored by AIC was found to be the best suited to the alignment. A phylogenetic tree was generated for the amino acid alignment based on the LG+I+G+F model using maximum likelihood inference preformed on RAxML v8.2.4 [
 <xref rid="B58-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] with bootstrapping of 100 replicates. Additionally, a Bayesian MCMC estimation was conducted, and a majority-rule consensus tree was generated by MrBayes v3.2.6 [
 <xref rid="B52-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B59-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. The trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.3 [
 <xref rid="B60-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] using, GaHV-2 as the outgroup to root the trees. The recovered topologies of the two trees were identical, except for the reverse placement of HHV-4 and BHV-6. Both the bootstrap and posterior probabilities values are displayed on the Bayesian tree [
 <xref rid="B61-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>].
