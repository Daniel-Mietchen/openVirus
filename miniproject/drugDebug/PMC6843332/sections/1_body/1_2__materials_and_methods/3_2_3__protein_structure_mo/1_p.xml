<p>The amino acid sequence of HHV-1 pUL15 was obtained from the RefSeq database [
 <xref rid="B55-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] (GeneID: 2703385). Only a partial crystal structure of the C-terminus of pUL15 (PDB-ID: 4iox) [
 <xref rid="B62-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] is available in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) [
 <xref rid="B63-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. DNA packaging protein gp17 from enterobacteria phage T4 (PDB-ID: 2o0j) [
 <xref rid="B64-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] was selected by HHPRED [
 <xref rid="B65-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] as the most reliable template to model the N-terminal domain of pUL15. To properly orient the two proteins, two template structures (2o0j and 4iox) were superposed onto the crystal structure of T4 gp17 (PDB-ID: 3cpe) [
 <xref rid="B66-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] by Fr-TM-align [
 <xref rid="B67-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Following the structure alignment, a sequence alignment was done using SALIGN [
 <xref rid="B68-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] to align the sequences of 2o0j and 4iox to the sequence of pUL15. The sequence and structure alignments then were utilized to create the model of pUL15 with MODELLER 9.16 [
 <xref rid="B69-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>], excluding the first 126 amino acids due to the lack of templates to generate a high-quality model of this pUL15 segment.
