<p>Eight previously sequenced herpesvirus strains, highlighted in bold in 
 <xref rid="biomolecules-09-00603-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, were selected from GenBank [
 <xref rid="B47-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] to be included in genome-wide phylogenetic analyses. These sequences were chosen to represent all major groups of alphaherpesviruses, while also focusing on those found in human, HHV-1 and HHV-2. To conduct phylogenetic analyses, homologous regions of the genome must be identified and aligned. We conservatively interpreted available annotations, excluding any potential homologs in which annotation was unclear, to identify 59 homologs that were then extracted from each genome and compiled into gene-by-gene datasets. Each gene-by-gene dataset was aligned with MAFFT version 7 using the E-INS-i algorithm for the highest level of accuracy [
 <xref rid="B48-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. To select the best fitting model of amino acid substitution, we used the Bayesian Information Criterion [
 <xref rid="B49-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] as implemented in ProtTest version 3.2 [
 <xref rid="B50-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. All available 120 amino acid substitution models were tested and, in each case, the Jones92 model with a gamma distribution and invariant sites [
 <xref rid="B51-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] was preferred. All individual gene datasets were then concatenated and partitioned, based on gene identity, resulting in an alignment with 41,543 amino acids. A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with fixed partitioning schemes was performed using MrBayes version 3.2.6 [
 <xref rid="B52-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] using 4 independent runs of 5 million generations, with 4 Metropolis-coupled chains per run. Fixed partitioning analyses included parameter estimates across all 59 genes. Regarding each partition, all substitution model parameters, with the exceptions of topology and branch lengths, were unlinked across data subsets, allowing each partition to independently estimate relative rates of evolution. Analyses were monitored for convergence by examining trace plots of scalar values in Tracer version 1.6 [
 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Topological convergence was assessed using the average standard deviation of split frequencies technique. To compare the relative rates of evolution across different genes, the inferred rate multipliers from the posterior distribution were plotted using Tracer version 1.6 [
 <xref rid="B53-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].
