<p>The GNM analysis of pUL15 indicates that it contains two domains connected by a hinge that move in opposite directions of one another. When dsDNA was docked onto our model, we found that the DNA was surrounded by three loop structures flanking it on both sides. Further, the ANM model suggests that the movement of the protein upon ATP hydrolysis most likely would be perpendicular to that of the DNA, contrary to the linear theory. Our data indicates that the packaging of DNA would follow more closely with either the rotation or revolution theory. Due to the limitations of the rotation theory, particularly the small size of the channel for the dsDNA to pass through, it is more likely that the DNA is packaged according to the revolution theory in HHV-1 due to its abundant space for the dsDNA to pass through the channel.</p>
