<p>Finally, the “Scrunchworm Hypothesis” considers DNA to be what provides the energy for its own translocation rather than the protein doing all of the work [
 <xref rid="B93-biomolecules-09-00603" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. During the process of packaging, proteins bind to the DNA and remove it from the solvent, causing its dehydration and compression. The energy stored in the DNA at this compressed state then is responsible for the ultimate movement of the DNA into the empty capsid.
