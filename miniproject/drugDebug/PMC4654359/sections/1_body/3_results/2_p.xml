<p>The overall mean duration of clinical development was 77.2 months, the majority of which was spent in clinical trials before the date of regulatory submission (84%, 
 <xref rid="BMJOPEN2015009333TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>). The total time in clinical development increased during the study period, from 58 months for drugs licensed 1981–1992, to 91.7 months for drugs licensed 2004–2014, a result that was statistically significant (p=0.048). This increase was accounted for by an increase in time spent in clinical trials before regulatory submission, which increased from 41.7 months for drugs licensed 1981–1992 to 78.4 months for drugs licensed 2001–2014 (p=0.027). No equivalent increase in time spent in the regulatory approval period was observed. A statistically significant upward linear trend in the total duration of clinical development (r=0.31, y=1.26×year—2442.01, p=0.034,

In contrast, no significant linear trend was observed for the duration of the regulatory approval period (r=0.16, y=−0.12×year+253.36, p=0.32).
