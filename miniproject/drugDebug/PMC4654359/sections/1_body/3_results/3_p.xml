 <xref rid="BMJOPEN2015009333TB1" ref-type="table">table 1</xref>), though this result was not statistically significant. A statistically significant upward linear trend was observed for total clinical development durations for drugs first licensed to treat HIV across the study period (r=0.54, y=1.84×year—3606.44,
