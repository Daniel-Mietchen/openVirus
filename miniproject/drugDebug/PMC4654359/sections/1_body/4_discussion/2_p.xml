<p>This study relied on data from the BNF, MHRA and EMA, ensuring that the identification of drugs was comprehensive and the data on regulatory dates were accurate. For initiation of clinical trials, we relied on the date of IND application, a process which only applies to the USA and not to Europe. This point in the development of a new molecule occurs when the developer ‘wants to test its diagnostic or therapeutic potential in humans’.
 <xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> On a global basis, the IND application may be regarded as a reasonable proxy for the decision to advance development of a new drug beyond preclinical testing given that in recent decades the majority of new drugs have been launched in the USA at an earlier or similar time to Europe.
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The European Union (EU) equivalent process, requiring submission of a request for authorisation of clinical trials, stems from a 2001 Directive
 <xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and is therefore a more recent development that could not be applied to the study period of interest. We could not determine a date for IND application in six cases (representing drugs launched between 1982 and 1996). The association between clinical development time and year of launch was maintained after excluding these drugs from the analysis (r=0.42, y=1.99×year—3912.46, p=0.006).
