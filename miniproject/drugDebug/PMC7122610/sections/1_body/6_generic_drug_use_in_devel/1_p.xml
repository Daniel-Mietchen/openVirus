<p>It is reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association that the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) saved an estimated $323,343,256 from 2005 to 2008 through the use of generic ARV drugs [

This significant cost savings contributed to PEPFAR’s ability to dramatically improve access to antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions. In 2008, there were eight PEPFAR programs that procured at least 90% of ARV packs in generic form. Additionally, deliveries in Ethiopia, Haiti, Namibia, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe were more than 99% generic. The officer in PEPFAR strongly supported the use of generic drugs because saving money ultimately means saving more lives [

However, developed countries in the west and large international pharmaceutical companies are strongly against the compulsory licenses. They often justify their standpoint that they believe it is against patent law to produce generic drugs and that such ability will have a negative impact on the research and development of new drugs. The use of patented drugs is acceptable in developing countries. However, given the current epidemics and public health crises in developing countries, patented drugs are simply inadequate. Generic medications provide an affordable means to provide treatment to more people suffering from HIV/AIDS. In order to solve the demand of patent drugs in developing countries, and to save more lives around the world, the best long-term solution can be provided by compulsory licensing.
