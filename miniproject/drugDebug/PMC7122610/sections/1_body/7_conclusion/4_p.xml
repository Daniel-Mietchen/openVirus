<p>Countries with large emerging economies, such as India, China, Brazil, and South Africa, are not only faced with the public health challenges of financing essential drugs and vaccines for their huge population but also the responsibility to help other developing countries, especially the least developed countries in Africa, to solve their public health crises. China is the world’s largest producer of APIs, including more than half the global APIs used for ARV drugs and antibiotics. India is the world’s largest producer for generic drugs. Therefore, it is advantageous for all developing countries to work together for the research, production, and distribution of generic drugs.</p>
