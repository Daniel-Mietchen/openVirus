<p>Some developed countries and large pharmaceutical companies had opposed the implementation of a compulsory license practice by developing countries, arguing it might hinder drug discovery research. The truth behind this claim, however, is that governments have the resources to buy the brand drugs. The large pharmaceutical companies lobbying to protect their monopolies also exert a strong influence. However, when there is a public health threat, developed countries will issue compulsory licenses without hesitation to solve the crisis. A good example is the US government forcing Bayer to reduce the price of Cipro using the compulsory licensing as a last resort after the September 11 attack in 2001. A WHO official pointed out that the global economy increases at an annual rate of 1%, much lower than the increase of average drug prices. According to the 2007 OECD report, drugs that took up 6–7% of the health budget of developed countries 10 years ago doubled or tripled their percentage in the health budget today [
