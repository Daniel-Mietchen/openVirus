<p>Patent protection for medical drugs is a double-edged sword, encouraging discovery of new drugs but at the same time limiting accessibility to patented drugs. The significant polarization of the rich and the poor can be translated to accessibility and inaccessibility of medical drugs, which equates with developed countries and developing countries. Differing from other commodities, drugs are essential for saving lives. The international community has reached a consensus about the conflict between the monopolies protected by patents and public health and has chosen to protect public health and expand the accessibility of drugs. This decision is apparent in the TRIPS agreement adopted by WTO General Council in 2005. Developing countries should use the rights endowed by Protocol Amending the TRIPS agreement and issue compulsory licenses for drugs against major diseases to safeguard the health of their people and public health interests of their nations.</p>
