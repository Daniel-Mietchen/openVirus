<p>Through the PEPFAR and other global health programs, the USA is the largest founder and the major player in the global AIDS, TB, and malaria treatment programs covering African and other developing countries. Most of the ARV drugs used in these US founded programs are actually generic drugs manufactured in developing countries, mostly in India. Additionally, the big pharmaceutical companies in the developed countries developed all of the ARV drugs and most of the anti-TB and malaria drugs. Some of the drugs were developed by developing countries, such as artemisinin, which was invented by the Chinese scientists. Without the close collaborations in the last decade between the south and the north and the private and public, the lives of several millions of HIV/AIDS patients, TB patients, and malaria patients would not have been saved. Therefore, developed countries and big pharmaceutical companies must ally with the developing countries in the war against AIDS, TB, malaria, and other infectious diseases. Due to the lack of such collaboration, the initial sparks of HIV infections in central Africa become a global AIDS pandemic killing 30 million lives in both the developing and developed world. Such tragedy can only be prevented through further strengthening collaboration between the private and public sectors in both developed and developing countries.</p>
