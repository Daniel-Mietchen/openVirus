<p>The success of the Indian generic drugs is greatly attributed to the Indian governmental support, its unique patent laws, and the government policy. Indian premier Rajiv Gandhi once said, “Medical inventions are not patented, and we cannot make profits between life and death.” The patent law issued in 1970 declared that food, medicine, agricultural chemicals cannot be patented; only the method of making these products can be patented. Therefore, one can make the same exact product or drug by a different methodology according to the Indian Patent Law. This regulation was vital to the rise of the Indian domestic pharmaceutical industry. For many years, the Indian government has withstood pressure from western countries and maintained efficient laws for generic production on the grounds of promoting health and equity. After its entrance into the WTO in 1995, India was pressured by western countries to enter the TRIPS agreement but was granted a period of 10 years to adapt their patent laws to the international standards. India issued the 2004 Patent (amendment) Bill on December 26, 2004. This law mandates that India must begin accepting medicine, agricultural chemicals, and food patent applications from January 1, 2005. However, the Indian government stated that they would only recognize applications submitted from January 1, 1995 onwards and also declared that certain drugs, methods, or applications cannot be patented. At the same time, the Indian Patent Office maintains a unique flexibility in its approval process for generic drugs [
