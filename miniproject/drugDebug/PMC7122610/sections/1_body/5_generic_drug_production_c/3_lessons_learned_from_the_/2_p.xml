<p>The Indian pharmaceutical industry is at a high level of internationalization. Facing strong foreign competitors, Indian pharmaceutical companiesâ€™ success is mainly due to their strong entrepreneurship, talented researchers and business development people, and the high quality and low price of their products. India has strategically entered foreign markets by buying up the US and European local pharmaceutical companies. Many Indians are trained in the west and thus fully understand the regulation and the western culture. Their ability to communicate in English also simplifies their international work.</p>
