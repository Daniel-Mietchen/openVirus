<p>In December 2005, the WTO General Council adopted the Protocol Amending the TRIPS Agreement, which was the first amendment to TRIPS since 1995 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Up to now, many developing and developed countries have approved the Protocol Amending the TRIPS Agreement. Developing countries should make full use of the privileges introduced by this document by granting compulsory licenses in public health related areas or use it as a tool to acquire a voluntary license in the local manufacture of drugs or in negotiation for affordable drug price. These areas should target drugs for prevention and treatment of infectious diseases and tumors, including HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, as well as malignant tumors, to break the high price barrier of imported patent drugs and make them accessible to the respective countryâ€™s population. This direction, if taken, will significantly minimize these serious public health issues in China as well as in other developing countries.
