<p>In November 2003, the WTO Ministerial Conference announced the 2003 General Council’s decision on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health (a General Council decision) and included an amendment to paragraph (f) of Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement. The first revision of the series waived the obligations of exporting members: generic drugs produced under compulsory licenses can be exported to other developing countries lacking the manufacturing capacity instead of remaining exclusive to the domestic market within the manufacturing country. This additional stipulation to the law removed obstacles hindering developing countries’ ability to make full use of compulsory licenses. The second revision waived the remuneration to patent holders from importing countries because the exporting country already pays it. This General Council decision resolved the previous issues of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration. As a result, member states lacking manufacturing capacity found themselves with the means to import cheap generic drugs from countries that produced the drugs under compulsory licenses.</p>
