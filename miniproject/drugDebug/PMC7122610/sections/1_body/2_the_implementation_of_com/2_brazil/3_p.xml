<p>After 6 months of unsuccessful negotiations, the Brazilian government issued their first compulsory license on May 4, 2007. Brazil reduced the price per day from $1.56 to $0.45 by buying Indian generic products. The government expected to save $30 million in 2007 and a total of $237 million between 2007 and 2012. “From an ethical point of view the price difference is grotesque,” said Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. “And from a political point of view, it represents a lack of respect, as though a sick Brazilian is inferior,” he added. “Our decision today involves this one drug, but we can take the same steps with any other that we consider necessary.”</p>
