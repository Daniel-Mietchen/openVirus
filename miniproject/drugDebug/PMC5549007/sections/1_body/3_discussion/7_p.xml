<p>There is strong epidemiological, clinical, and experimental data linking chronic HCV infection to glomerulonephritis in native as well as transplanted kidneys [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>-
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Both in native kidneys and in kidney allografts, HCV may cause a variety of glomerular patterns. Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is the most common condition and is sometimes difficult to distinguish from chronic allograft nephropathy. Eight of the 19 lost allografts in our series had histological evidence of chronic allograft nephropathy. The role of HCV is uncertain in each case. One patient in our study lost his graft due to glomerulopathy, specifically
