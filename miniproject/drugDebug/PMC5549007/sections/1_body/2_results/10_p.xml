<p>Of the seven patients transplanted with HCV and HBV co-infection, one developed NODAT and one developed neoplasia. The median survival time was 13.4 years. The median graft survival time was 13.4 (95% CI: 10.7–16.1) years. The median graft survival for those patients without HCV infection was 14.6 (95% CI: 13.8–15.4) years (p=0.23) (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> shows the Kaplan-Meier curve of patient survival time, though this may be biased due to lost to follow up of survived patients who lost the graft.
