 <caption> Overview of findings. Positively-charged ZrO 2 of 200 nm size and 100 mg/kg dose conferred protection against H5N1 infection in mice. The mechanisms are related to ZrO 2-mediated enhancement of innate immunity in the early stage of H5N1 infection. The appropriate nanoparticle treatment could reduce viral load and suppress the inflammatory cytokine storm in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, thus preventing lung injury and improving the survival rate of the infected mice. </caption>
