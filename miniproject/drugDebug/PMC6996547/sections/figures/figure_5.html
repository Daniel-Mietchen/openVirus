 <caption> Positively-charged ZrO 2 NPs of 200 nm suppressed cytokine overexpression in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice. The expression levels of cytokines (IFN-γ, IP-10, MCP-1, IL-12, IL-6, and TNF-α) in the lung were determined through qPCR ( A) and ELISA ( B). These results are mean ± SD values obtained from three distinct animals and are representative of three independent experiments. *, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; and ***, P &lt; 0.001 compared to the glucose group. </caption>
