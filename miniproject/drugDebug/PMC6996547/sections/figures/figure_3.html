 <caption> Positively-charged ZrO 2 NPs of 200 nm reduced lung injury and viral replication in H5N1-infected mice. ( A) Representative lung sections from each group were stained with H&amp;E (400×) and scored in a blind study. The black triangles show alveolar lumen ﬂooded with edema ﬂuid and mixed with exfoliated alveolar epithelial cells, inﬂammatory cells, and erythrocytes. Arrows represent interstitial edema and inﬂammatory cellular inﬁltration around small blood vessels and bronchioles. Empty triangles indicate reduction in the number of mucous epithelial cells in bronchioles. ( B) Representative lung sections from each group were stained using IHC (400×) and scored in a blind study. Arrows indicate positive cells. ( C) Expression levels of HA genes were determined via qPCR and their PFU values were determined through plaque assay. These results were obtained from three distinct animals and are representative of three independent experiments. *, P &lt; 0.05;**, P &lt; 0.01 and ***, P &lt; 0.001 compared to the glucose group. </caption>
