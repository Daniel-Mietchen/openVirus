 <caption> Positively-charged ZrO 2 at a dosage of 100 mg/kg increased survival of H5N1-infected mice. ZrO 2 of different diameters (100, 150, and 200 nm) ( A), with different charges (positive and negative) ( B) or at different dosages (25, 50, and 100 mg/kg) ( C) were administered twice intraperitoneally to mice, one day apart. On the second day of NP administration, the viral challenge was administered, with triple the LD50 of H5N1. Body weights were determined every 2 days. *, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001 and compared to the glucose group. </caption>
