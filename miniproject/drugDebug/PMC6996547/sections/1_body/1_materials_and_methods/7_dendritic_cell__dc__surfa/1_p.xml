<p>Fluorescent conjugated rat anti-mouse monoclonal antibodies including anti-CD40-PE, anti-CD80-PE, anti-CD86-PE, anti-MHC-II-PE, and anti-CD11c-FITC were purchased from eBiosciences (San Diego, CA, USA). Three non-infected mice from each group were sacrificed on day 1 and another three on day 3 following intraperitoneal administration, and single-cell suspensions were isolated from their spleens. Stimulated cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) for complete intracellular staining. Cells were then double-stained with antibodies for 30 min at 4Â°C. The fluorescence intensities were measured with the FACSVerse system and analyzed with FlowJo software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA).</p>
