<p>Pathological changes were evaluated by a veterinary pathologist and scored from 0 to 4 in a blind study. Descriptions of the lung scores were as follows: 0 = no microscopic lesions; 1 = extremely mild, characterized by mild interstitial edema and desquamation of rare epithelial cells; 2 = mild, characterized by interstitial edema, thickening of alveolar walls, and occasional bronchial structural damage; 3 = moderate, characterized by hyperemia, hemorrhage, interstitial edema, thickening of the alveolar wall, bronchial structural damage, and slight infiltration of inflammatory cells; and 4 = severe, characterized by hyperemia, hemorrhage, interstitial edema, thickening of the alveolar wall, serious bronchial structural damage, and greater infiltration of inflammatory cells. Detection of the IAV antigen was scored as 0–4. Scoring was based on the number of positive cells per section. Descriptions of the scores are as follows: 0 = no positive cells; 1 = 1–10 positive cells; 2 = 11–30 positive cells; 3 = 31–100 positive cells; and 4 &gt; 100 positive cells.</p>
