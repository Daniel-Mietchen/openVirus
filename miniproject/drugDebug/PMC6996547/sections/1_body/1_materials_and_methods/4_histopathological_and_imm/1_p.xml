<p>On days 3 and 6 post-infection, lung tissue samples from three mice per group were collected and ﬁxed with 4% neutral formalin at room temperature for 48 h. Histopathological and viral antigen analyses of lung tissues on day 6 post-infection were performed using hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) staining and IHC staining, as previously described.
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Briefly, serial tissue sections were cut to 5-μm thickness after embedding in paraffin. Each slide was stained with H&amp;E and examined using light microscopy (Olympus CX31). For IHC staining, sections were incubated in 10% normal goat serum in PBS for 30 min to block non-speciﬁc binding sites prior to reaction with the anti-inﬂuenza nucleoprotein mAb (AA5H, Abcam) at 1:400 dilution in PBS for 2 h. The slides were further incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with avidin (Chemicon, USA) for 1 h, followed by incubation in biotinylated peroxidase (Victoria, BC, Canada) for an additional 1 h. Staining was visualized through the addition of 3.3-diaminobenzidin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 15 min and counterstaining with hematoxylin; the slides were then mounted with neutral balsam.
