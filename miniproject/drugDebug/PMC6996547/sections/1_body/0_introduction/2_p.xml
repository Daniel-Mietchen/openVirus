<p>In recent decades, nanoparticles (NPs) have increasingly been applied as an inexpensive and easy-to-use detection method as well as a promising adjuvant against viral infections due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics and strong activation of the immune system. Due to these structural and chemical properties, nanomaterials have several advantages over bulk materials of the same composition, including small size, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and ease of preparation and modification. NPs can affect immune responses by binding to serum proteins. In previous studies, NPs have shown specific immunomodulatory effects on immune cells, as well as antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer capabilities.

 <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, because protein or DNA vaccines exhibit poor stability in vivo, most reported NPs have been used only as efficient antigen delivery systems. Although NPs can enhance immunity, few studies to date have focused on the antiviral function of NPs rather than using them only as protein or DNA carriers.
