<p>To study the protective effects of NPs in IAV H5N1 infection in vivo, three kinds of NPs, namely ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>, SNs, and PS, were administrated twice intraperitoneally to mice at 100 mg/kg, one day apart. These NPs were prepared according to previous studies. All three sizes (100, 150, and 200 nm) of ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> showed good monodispersity in 5% glucose solution (
