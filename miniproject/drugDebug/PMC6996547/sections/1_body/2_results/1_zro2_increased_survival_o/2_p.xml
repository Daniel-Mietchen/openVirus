<p>NPs were administered to mice intraperitoneally in two doses, one day apart. On the day of the second NP administration, the viral challenge was given with triple LD50 of H5N1, and seven mice per group were used in the experiment over a period of 14 days. As shown in

 <sub>2</sub>, SNs, and PS of different diameters (100, 150, and 200 nm) were administered. Four mice died in the glucose group; one animal died in each of the 200 nm SN and ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> treatment groups, and no deaths were observed in the 200 nm PS treatment group. According to the size effect, the survival rate of mice in the 200 nm ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> group was 85.7%, which was significantly higher than that in the glucose group (42.9%), 100 nm ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> group (57.1%), or 150 nm ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> group (42.9%). Moreover, the average body weight of mice treated with NPs at 200 nm was higher than those of other groups throughout the experimental period. The results thus indicate that NPs provide protection against H5N1 that is particle-size-dependent, and the best protection is offered by the 200 nm particle size.
