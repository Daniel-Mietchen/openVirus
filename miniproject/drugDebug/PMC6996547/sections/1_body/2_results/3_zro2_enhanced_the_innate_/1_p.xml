<p>The activation or maturation of DCs is critical for both innate and adaptive immunity. During initiation of the immune response, the expression of co-stimulatory markers CD40, CD80, and CD86 at the DC surface is related to their ability to induce or suppress immune responses, as is MHC-II expression. Thus, the proportions of CD40+ CD11c+, CD80+ CD11c+, CD86+ CD11c+, and MHC-II+ CD11c+ cells among mouse T cells on days 1 and 3 after intraperitoneal ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> administration were determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; 
 <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>). CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II expression levels in the ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> groups were higher than those of the control group, with a significant difference between the 25 mg/kg ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> and glucose groups (P &lt; 0.001). Notably, we found that the higher dosage of ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> resulted in lower expression, which was due to toxicity of ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> in normal mice. These data suggest that 200 nm ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> can promote CD40, CD80, CD86, and MHC-II expression in T cells of mice and favorably affect the maturation of DCs.
