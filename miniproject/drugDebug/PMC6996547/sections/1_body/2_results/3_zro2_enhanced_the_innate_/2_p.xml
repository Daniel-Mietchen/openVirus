<p>IFN-α, IFN-β, and IL1-β are crucial for the innate immune and antiviral responses. To examine the effects of ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> on cytokine expression in mice, the mRNA levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, and IL1-β in the spleens of mice on days 1 and 3 after intraperitoneal administration were examined. The mRNA levels of the ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> groups were upregulated compared to the glucose group. With 25 mg/kg ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> treatment, the expression levels of all cytokines increased significantly. The mRNA levels in the 100 mg/kg ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> group were lowest among the three ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> groups due to the toxicity of ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> in mice (

 <sub>2</sub> group on day 3 after intraperitoneal administration were higher than those on day 1. These data suggested that ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> promotes the expression of cytokines associated with the antiviral response and innate immunity. Consistent with the FACS results, we found that ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> effectively enhances innate immunity in mice.
