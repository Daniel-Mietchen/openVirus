<p>We demonstrated that positively-charged ZrO
 <sub>2</sub> of 200 nm size and 100 mg/kg dose conferred protection against H5N1 infection in mice (
 <xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>). The mechanisms of this protection are related to ZrO
 <sub>2</sub>-mediated enhancement of innate immunity in the early stage of H5N1 infection. Appropriate NP treatment could reduce the viral load and suppress the inflammatory cytokine storm in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice, thus alleviating lung injury and improving the survival rate of infected mice. Our antiviral study using zirconia NPs suggests strong potential for application of this novel treatment to a wide range of microbial infections.
