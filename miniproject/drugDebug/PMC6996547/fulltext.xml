Nevertheless, vaccination effectiveness is decreasing as new variants arise through antigenic drifts or shifts.<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Although some antiviral drugs such as zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu) are currently in use, the increasing emergence of drug-resistant strains affects their clinical application.<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Therefore, development of novel broad-spectrum prophylactic and therapeutic agents against IAV is urgently needed.</p><p>In recent decades, nanoparticles (NPs) have increasingly been applied as an inexpensive and easy-to-use detection method as well as a promising adjuvant against viral infections due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics and strong activation of the immune system. Due to these structural and chemical properties, nanomaterials have several advantages over bulk materials of the same composition, including small size, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and ease of preparation and modification. NPs can affect immune responses by binding to serum proteins. In previous studies, NPs have shown specific immunomodulatory effects on immune cells, as well as antiviral, antioxidant, and anticancer capabilities.<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> In particular, virus-like particles (alundum and mesoporous silica) have received great attention for potential application as adjuvants.<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> However, because protein or DNA vaccines exhibit poor stability in vivo, most reported NPs have been used only as efficient antigen delivery systems. Although NPs can enhance immunity, few studies to date have focused on the antiviral function of NPs rather than using them only as protein or DNA carriers.<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The nanomaterial-activated immune response must be overcome when NPs are used as carriers.<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> To date, little attention has been paid to the antiviral effects of NPs without virus-based antigens. Nanoparticles of ZrO<sub>2</sub>, a nano-sized and hollow colloidal metal oxide with controllable thickness, were synthesized using a robust sol-gel process and show superior catalytic activity for many reactions due to the unique physicochemical characteristics of the surface of ZrO<sub>2</sub>.<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> ZrO<sub>2</sub> has been widely used as a catalyst in many engineering applications and offers an environmentally-friendly option for chemical and pharmaceutical industries.<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> It is also used as an anticancer agent in the treatment of colon cancer.<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Despite their potential biomedical applications, few studies have reported on the use of ZrO<sub>2</sub> as an antiviral material.</p><p>In the present study, a series of NPs were investigated with regard to particle size, surface charge, and composition for NP-mediated protection of animals from highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 infection. The results showed that ZrO<sub>2</sub> with optimal physical and chemical characteristics could reduce mouse mortality, alleviate respiratory pathological changes, and inhibit viral replication in the lungs of H5N1-infected mice. Treatment with ZrO<sub>2</sub> prior to influenza infection caused prompt initiation of the host antiviral response and alleviated the damage induced by cytokine storms during H5N1 infection. This is the first report of an in vivo antiviral effect of ZrO<sub>2</sub> against H5N1 infection, and provides a comprehensive and low-cost method for the protection of humans or animals against various viral infections.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S0002-S2001"><title>Animals</title><p>Six&#x02013;Seven-weeks-old female BALB/c mice were purchased from Vital River Laboratories (Beijing, China).</p></sec><sec id="S0002-S2002"><title>Preparation of NPs</title><p>SNs were prepared as previously described.<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Briefly, SNs were synthesized through a two-step selective-etching method. In the first step, organic&#x02013;inorganic hybrid solid silica spheres (HSSSs) were elaborately designed with a three-layer sandwich structure. The core and outer layer, or shell, were made up of a pure silica framework hydrolyzed from tetraethylorthosilane (TEOS), and the middle layer comprised organic silica co-condensed from TEOS and N-[3-(trimethoxysilyl) propyl]ethylenediamine (TSD).

SNs underwent a dewatering process prior to dispersal in a mixture of alcohol and acetonitrile. Ammonia was added to adjust the pH to a weakly alkaline value. The zirconium precursor was slowly injected into the mixture with magnetic stirring. The hydrolysis of zirconium was triggered in the weakly alkaline environment to induce the growth of small ZrO<sub>2</sub> using SNs as seeds. After 6 h of reaction, a ZrO<sub>2</sub> shell gradually formed on the surface of the SN seeds. The thickness of the shell can be controlled by adjusting the reaction time and the Zr:SN ratio. To remove the SN seed core, NaOH solution (1 mL, 1 M) was added, followed by reaction at 80&#x000b0;C for approximately 4 h. The ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs thus obtained were collected through centrifugation and washed three times with deionized water.</p><p>Preparation of poly-styrene (PS) was prepared as previously described.<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Briefly, 6 g of freshly distilled styrene (Merck), 250 mg of hexadecane, 5 mg of the fluorescent dye N-(2,6-diisopropylphenyl)-perylene-3,4-dicarbonacidimide, and 100 mg of the hydrophobic initiator 2.2&#x02032;-azobis(2-methylbutyronitrile) were added to 24 g of water containing 125 mg of the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium chloride. After stirring 1 h for pre-emulsification, the miniemulsion was prepared by sonification for 120 s at 90% amplitude at 0&#x000b0;C to prevent polymerization. Polymerization was carried out at 72&#x000b0;C overnight. After the synthesis, surfactant was removed by Amicon ultrafiltration (100 kDa), extensive dialysis and washing. Before being used, the particle suspensions were dispersed by sonification.</p><p>The morphology and structure of NPs were observed with a JEOL-200CX transmission electron microscope.

Thus, the proportions of CD40+ CD11c+, CD80+ CD11c+, CD86+ CD11c+, and MHC-II+ CD11c+ cells among mouse T cells on days 1 and 3 after intraperitoneal ZrO<sub>2</sub> administration were determined using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; <xref rid="F0004" ref-type="fig">Figure 4A</xref>).

In 1997, the &#x0fb01;rst major epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 occurred in Hong Kong. Since then, it has become well known for its potential to cause global pandemics in humans and mammals at all ages with considerable risks of morbidity and high fatality rates; it is now considered a growing threat to public health around the world.<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> To date, it has been classified as a List A disease by the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and as a Category 1 animal disease in China. A variety of antiviral drugs and vaccines have been adopted to prevent and control influenza-induced illness. However, it remains difficult to limit the spread of these viruses due to their highly contagious nature, frequent mutation of viral genes, and the emergence of resistant influenza strains due to the widespread abuse of antiviral drugs. Therefore, new approaches to fighting influenza virus infection are urgently needed. Due to unique structure and chemical characteristics, including large surface area, strong targeting performance, good biocompatibility, and high adsorption capacity, NPs have many benefits over conventional materials. Therefore, NPs have been widely applied in clinical trials. As carriers of anti-tumor drugs, NPs can significantly improve the curative effects of tumor therapies and reduce toxic drug side effects, making them attractive candidates for cancer therapy.<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> For anti-viral therapy, NPs can be used as adjuvants or carriers to enhance the immune response.<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> However, while NPs are commonly used as efficient antigen delivery systems, their antiviral effects have only been recently reported. Herein, we have demonstrated that NPs alone effectively inhibit viral replication in a mouse model and protect mice from H5N1 infection. Our data further confirm the feasibility of the use of NPs alone as therapeutic agents to control influenza infection.</p><p>H5N1 influenza virus can cause severe respiratory diseases in humans and mammals. The clinical symptoms include fever, muscle aches, cough, headache, diarrhea, viral pneumonia, encephalitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).<xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> In the mouse model, it can cause hair thickening, bowed limbs, blindness, trembling, significant weight loss, severe pathological tissue changes, and even death.<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Previous studies have shown that virus-induced acute lung injury or ARDS is triggered by a cytokine storm and is a serious consequence of inflammation resulting from the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the recruitment of immune cells to the infected area.<xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> Excessive inflammation can cause systemic inflammatory response syndrome, during which the body enters a state of high metabolic activity and energy usage. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IFN-&#x003b3;, MCP-1, and TNF-&#x003b1;, have been detected in humans and mice infected with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus.<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> In the present study, we investigated the antiviral effects of positively-charged ZrO<sub>2</sub> on IAV in a mouse model and the mechanism of action of these NPs. Several studies have shown that positive charges can facilitate retention of NPs in cells for a relatively long time, which is likely related to intracellular agglomeration. The native surface chemistries of NPs also play crucial roles in their exocytosis patterns from cells. Here, we provide the first data that positively-charged ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs can downregulate the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and thereby alleviate the inflammatory response, making them effective anti-inflammatory agents against highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus.</p><p>In the present study, it seems paradoxical that 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs is less effective for activation of DCs but appears to be more effective in protection when compared to lower doses. Previous researches by our team have researched the systemic toxicity of ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs and demonstrated that dosages of ZrO<sub>2</sub> in the range of 100&#x02013;350 mg/kg are safe for effectively clinical use.<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> However, we found that 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs seemed to have a mild adverse reaction in H5N1-infected mice, which only showed the slightly low spirits just on day 1 after intraperitoneal administration. Thus, we consider that this clinical phenomenon may lead to the lower expression of immune indicators in spleen of the 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> group. Compared to 25 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs or 50 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs, 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs group showed the most dramatic increases with time increasing, indicating its growing powerful immune responses. We suppose that 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs group will show the better immune responses on day 7 or day 9 after intraperitoneal administration, which will be further investigated in future studies. Due to that NPs could be carried into the lung through the circulation, we speculate that 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs can be carried into lung most effectively after viral infection when compared to 25 mg/kg ZrO2 NPs and 50 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs, and then 100 mg/kg ZrO<sub>2</sub> NPs activate the antiviral responses in lung and eventually provide best protection for mice to fight against virus.</p></sec><sec id="S0005"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We demonstrated that positively-charged ZrO<sub>2</sub> of 200 nm size and 100 mg/kg dose conferred protection against H5N1 infection in mice (<xref rid="F0006" ref-type="fig">Figure 6</xref>).
