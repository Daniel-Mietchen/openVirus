<p>Without utilizing host proteins and enzymes, DENV would be unable to propagate rapidly in host cells. Numerous host proteins are found to be essential in DENV replication. For example, host proteases aid in the RNA genome cleavage and polyprotein formation, while host kinases help in DENV assembly, and glucosidase is used in DENV maturation and folding. Every single step mentioned utilizes host proteins and enzymes, which are the most important factors for DENV multiplications. Hence, targeting one of these can reduce DENV production and may lead to an effective antiviral drug.</p>
