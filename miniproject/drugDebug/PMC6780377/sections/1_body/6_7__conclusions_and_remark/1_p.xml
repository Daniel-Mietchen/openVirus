<p>Several remarkable points arise in the way of host inhibition processes that interrupt DENV replication along with infections. Host metabolic pathways serve as a source of energy, and molecular building blocks are required for the multiplication of DENV. For example, the primary glycolysis is conservatively required by DENV and exogenous glucose, and glutamine deprivation decreases DENV production, which could lead to the development of novel broad-spectrum antiviral therapies. The fatty acid metabolic pathway induces the activation of autophagy in DENV-infected cells by increased Î²-oxidation of fatty acids, and helps to bind with C proteins during virion assembly. An extensive body of research has been dedicated to the role of lipid and fatty acid metabolism during DENV infection, and the extant findings indicate that modulating lipid metabolisms in the host can be a viable anti-dengue therapeutic approach. Cellular nucleoside biosynthesis pathways of the host supply necessary nucleosides required for DENV replication. Hence, targeting the host nucleoside biosynthesis pathways can assist in blocking the essential functions of DENV as another avenue for antiviral drug development. </p>
