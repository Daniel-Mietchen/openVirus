<p>Cytokines are not responsible in causing any primary and secondary DENV infections in humans. Cytokine IFN-γ production in the host cell plays protective roles during primary DENV infection. In primary DENV infections, production of IL-12 and IL-18 proinflammatory cytokines precede IFN-γ release, and optimal IFN-γ production relies on the combined action of these two cytokines. For example, higher levels of IL-12 and 18 cytokines that are required for optimal IFN-γ production are usually recorded for DF patients, but in the case of DHF patients (Grade III and IV), the levels of this cytokine were non-detectable [

 <xref rid="B144-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that IFN-γ controls nitric oxide synthase II-mediated nitric oxide production that assists the host in resistance against primary DENV infection [

 <xref rid="B138-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Hence, IFN-γ can be a potential target for the host to control DENV replication and resistance to infection. Enhanced proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α production is also associated with severity of dengue manifestation in humans. For example, T-cells isolated from patients are found to contain higher amounts of TNF-α after ex vivo stimulation with DENV antigens [
 <xref rid="B148-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Hence, the blocking of enhanced proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α might reduce the pathology due to the primary [

 <xref rid="B151-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>] infections. The migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is indicative of a more severe disease form during primary DENV infections [
 <xref rid="B138-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Experiments have shown that DENV primary infections were less severe in MIF

 <sup>−</sup> mice, and they exhibited a significant delay in lethality, indicating that reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels (such as TNF-α) are correlated with lower viral loads at the initial phases of infection. Therefore, elevated production of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-α and MIF during the host response to DENV infection favors more severe disease [
