<p>After the virus infects the host, cell signals are generated to block the dissemination of DENV. DENV causes acute disease without persistent infection. All virus strains have developed strategies that bypass the innate and adaptive immune response. Therefore, DENV does not escape the host defense mechanism. Innate immunity is known as the first line of antiviral defense mechanism that uses cytokine interferon I (IFN-I) for host defense purposes. It also results in the rapid activation of adaptive immune responses, resulting in the complete elimination of the virus [

To achieve this beneficial response, the immune system induces various factors and a series of gene expressions, including interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), inflammatory responses, plasma, and vascular endothelium leakage, along with the disease progress factors both in infected and uninfected cells [
