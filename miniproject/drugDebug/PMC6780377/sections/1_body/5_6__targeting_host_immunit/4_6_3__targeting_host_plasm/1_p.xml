<p>Plasma leakage is an important factor in dengue disease progression and can cause DHF/DSS. Endothelium (primary fluid barrier) is changed by DENV, inducing edema and hemorrhage because of cell barrier permeability [
 <xref rid="B200-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>]. Vascular leakage can be blocked by FX06 (28-AA cleavage product), which decreases primary dengue infection. The protective effect of FX06 has been found to be elevated when combined with src/Fyn kinase. After activation, the 28-AA (28-Amino Acid) cleavage product Fyn dissociates from vascular endothelial and is combined with p190-Rho-GAP, an antagonist of RhoA activation. Thus, blocking vascular leakage by stabilization of endothelial cell development is important for DENV infection prevention [
 <xref rid="B201-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. The MIF inhibitor ISO-1 reduces permeability in the human hepatoma cell line. ISO-1, or the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K/AKT)/Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK/JNK signaling pathway, can be partially inhibited through the tight junction protein zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) [

 <xref rid="B204-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>] proteins are also involved in increasing vascular permeability. It has also been shown that type I-IFNs, IFN-β, VEGFR2 (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2), and INF-α inhibit plasma leakage, where this process occurs with the help of endothelial stabilization [
