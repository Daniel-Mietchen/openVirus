<p>All viruses require host nucleosides for replication. Host proteins associated with nucleoside biosynthesis can thus be targeted as anti-dengue therapeutics. Nucleotide guanosine 5â€²-triphosphate (GTP) pool depletion has emerged as a significant system for repressing Flaviviruses. Guanine biosynthesis can be inhibited through antiviral ribavirin [
 <xref rid="B69-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH) is a mitochondrial protein that catalyzes the oxidation of dihydroorotate to orotate. It is an essential enzyme in the de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. Available evidence indicates that using brequinar (a known DHODH inhibitor), an anti-metabolite in cancer and immune-suppression, can inhibit DENV type 1,2,3 (DENV-1,2,3) serotypes. However, it cannot inhibit DENV type 2 (DENV-2) variants because of resistance against brequinar, which was also cross-resistant to compound NITD-982 [

 <xref rid="B71-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. The NITD-982 analogue directly bound to the DHODH protein. A study also suggests that compound NITD-982 is also capable of inhibiting host DHODH [
 <xref rid="B69-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. An in vitro study of the compound shows a great potency against DENV serotypes, but the compound did not show any efficacy because of the exogenous uptake of pyrimidine from the diet in the DENV-AG129 mouse model (deficient in interferon alpha/beta and gamma receptor signalling). Targeting the enzymes that play a key role in supplying DENV nucleoside can therefore be effective for antiviral therapeutics.
