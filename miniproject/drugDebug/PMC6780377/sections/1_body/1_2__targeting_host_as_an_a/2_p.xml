<p>The virus depends on the host machinery to complete their life cycles. For example, RNA replication of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) depends on the human homologue of the 33-kDa “vesicle-associated membrane protein-associated protein (hVAP-33)”, Golgi-specific brefeldin factor 1 (GBF1)—a type of resistant guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and host geranylgeranylated proteins and fatty acids [

 <xref rid="B51-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Meanwhile, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) utilizes host C–C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) and C–X–C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR-4)—chemokine receptors as mediators of HIV infections [

 <xref rid="B54-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. The influenza virus requires post-entry steps for its replication and, for that purpose, it utilizes the host’s important nuclear components, proteases, and the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase IIb (CAM K2B) [

In order to understand DENV host dependent factors, a genome-wide screen to explain DENV host dependency for their life cycle in 
 <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (host) cells has been published [
 <xref rid="B59-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Later, different conservative genome-wide screens of DENV identified different host-dependent factors responsible for their replication, where metabolic pathways, receptors and attachment factors, host proteins or enzymes, host immune factors, and anti-inflammatory pathways are most commonly found to influence DENV replication and infection.
