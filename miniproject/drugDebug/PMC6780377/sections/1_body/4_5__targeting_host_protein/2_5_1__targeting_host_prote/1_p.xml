<p>Host protease is an effective target for antiviral drug development, as it is essential for virus replication. Host proteases, such as furin and signalase, have been used to cleave the DENV RNA genome co- and post-translationally and were translated as a polyprotein [
 <xref rid="B101-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. Correct processing can be used to generate the polyproteins essential for the viral life cycle [

 <xref rid="B102-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Since host protease required for virus polyprotein formation is a basis of DENV replication, it can be a strong target for antiviral production. Protease furin is enriched in the Golgi apparatus of the host cell, where it assists in cleaving the DENV prM proteins, resulting in the formation of mature active forms of the virion M protein that plays an important role during DENV infections [

 <xref rid="B103-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The signal peptidase on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane cleaves the C/E-prM junctions [
 <xref rid="B104-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. It processes many secretory proteins, but the inhibition is likely to have side-effects. Nonetheless, recent research indicates that peptidomimetic furin luteolin inhibits the viral maturation process in an uncompetitive manner [
 <xref rid="B105-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Peptide compound 45 and 46, as well as cavinafangin, have also been used as protease inhibitors in DENV-infected cells (
