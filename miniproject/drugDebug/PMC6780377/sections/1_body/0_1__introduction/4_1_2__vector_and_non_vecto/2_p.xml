<p>The non-mosquito DENV transmission route is infrequent and accidental, but it has great importance for physicians. Several authors have reported cases of transmission without a mosquito vector, which occurred in different ways, including through needles, congenitally, through mucocutaneous exposure, and through bone marrow transplants [
 <xref rid="B24-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. DENV infection of healthcare workers usually occurs as a result of needle injuries [

 <xref rid="B29-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], while vertical transmission is responsible for dengue fever cases in infants born to a DHF-diagnosed mother [
 <xref rid="B30-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. A child from Puerto Rico attained DENV-4 via bone marrow transplant and subsequently died [
 <xref rid="B31-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], and DENV-3 was transmitted to a healthcare worker through blood (mucocutaneous exposure) [
 <xref rid="B32-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. These are only a few examples of non-vector dengue transmission.
