<p>As one of the major public health concerns, the term “dengue” is believed to originate from the Swahili word “ki-dinga pepo”, which means “cramp-like pains, produced through the agency of an evil spirit” [

Subsequent epidemics (1780 to 1901) were reported in Philadelphia, Zanzibar, Calcutta, the West Indies, and Hong Kong. Where the relevant factors considered for all these epidemics were thought to be DENV, many others believed that it was not only dengue, but that the Chikungunya virus was also responsible for the epidemics [

In 1922, it was estimated that 1 to 2 million individuals in the southern United States were affected. In the three decades after World War II, dengue epidemics occurred sporadically in Central America and the Caribbean basin [
