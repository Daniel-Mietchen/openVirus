<p>Dengue is an important arthropod-borne viral infectious disease caused by any one of the four-dengue virus (DENV-1 to -4) viral serotypes. The antigenically distinct but closely related serotypes of DENV belong to the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. Its rapid and intense spread is noted in most of the worldâ€™s tropical and subtropical regions, which has led to its categorization as an emerging infectious disease [

 <xref rid="B2-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. The genus includes more than 70 small-enveloped viruses related to Japanese encephalitis (JEV), Zika viruses (ZIKV), West Nile (WNV), yellow fever virus (YFV), DENV, or tick-borne encephalitis (TBEV), and other medically-important arboviruses [

 <xref rid="B4-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. More than one-third of the world population is at risk of infection, and it is estimated that ~400 million individuals suffer annually because of DENV infection [
 <xref rid="B5-microorganisms-07-00296" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DENV infection results in varying degrees of clinical signs and symptoms (asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic). In the case of dengue fever (DF), patients may experience headache, myalgia, rash, leukopenia, arthralgia, retro-orbital pain, and hemorrhagic manifestations. Thereafter, patients suffering from dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) may develop petechiae, bruising, thrombocytopenia, and shock. Ultimate disease signs include rapid or weak pulse, manifestations of hypotension and clammy skin, and finally cold and restlessness in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) [
