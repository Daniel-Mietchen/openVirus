 <caption> DENV receptors in human cells: DENV recognizes various types of receptors present in the host cells. Heparan sulfate was identified as the first molecule responsible for DENV entry into mammalian cells, while sulfated glycosaminoglycans—ubiquitous molecules on the cell surface—were found to play a role in mediating DENV attachment. CLEC4L (C-type lectin domain family 4, member L), CLEC4M (C-type lectin domain family 4, member M), and mannose receptor/CLEC13D/CD206 (cluster of differentiation 206) are some conventional C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) that have a high affinity towards high-mannose ligands involved in DENV entry into target cells, where C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (CLEC5A) lectin acts as a signaling receptor for releasing proinflammatory cytokine. Cell surface chaperones HSP-90, HSP-70 and GRP-78, all of which are part of the receptor complex, assist in the DENV binding. Lipid receptors phosphatydil serine (PtdSer), T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain (TIM), and Tyro3, Axl, and Mer (TAM) types of putative receptors are relevant for viral entry into the human 293 T-cell line [ 87]. Another receptor, SR-BI, is also responsible for lipoprotein-associated interaction with DENV and allows the virus to enter the host [ 76]. </caption>
