 <caption> Sylvatic transmission of dengue virus (DENV) from lower primates to humans: Serotypes of DENV-1â€“4 emerged independently via the sylvatic cycle and subsequently disseminated among human populations. The forests of Southeast Asia and West Africa maintained the sylvatic cycle and supported contact with human populations, leading to an urban endemic/epidemic cycle between Aedes mosquitoes and human repository hosts. </caption>
