<p id="Par18">The ideal goal of anti-HBV treatments is the loss of viral surface antigens, HBsAg, which is correlated with dramatic reduction of incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, current nucleos(t)ide inhibitors are ineffective in this regard, because they have little effects on the cccDNA pool that serves as the template for HBsAg expression. To improve treatment outcomes, novel anti-HBV agents that target other steps of viral DNA synthesis, in combination with current HBV drugs, may promote cccDNA decay and provide a higher barrier to resistance.

 </sup> The core protein self-assembles to form a nucleocapsid in which viral DNA synthesis is carried out, and several inhibitors of this process are in phase I/II clinical trials. Furthermore, such inhibitors may facilitate cccDNA decay because the strong inhibition of viral DNA synthesis is thought to completely block the recycling of nucleocapsids into the nucleus for cccDNA replenishment.

 </sup> Thus, perturbing the capsid assembly process would be a promising approach for novel HBV treatment. A derivative of leucamide A, a cyclic heptapeptide derived from sponge, was found to interfere with this process.

 </sup> Furthermore, RNase H-mediated pregenomic RNA degradation is another essential step for the viral DNA synthesis and a novel inhibitor of this activity is undergoing preclinical trials.

 </sup> As the nucleolytic cleavage is dependent on a metal ion coordinated by the active site of RNase H, a class of metal-chelating inhibitors might have a potential for the development of novel RNase H inhibitors. Although Î²-thujaplicinol, which showed inhibitory activity toward HBV RNase H, is of plant origin,

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>
 </sup> such hydroxylated tropolones are often found in microbial metabolites.

 </sup> Taken together, it appears likely that microbial metabolites represent an enthralling resource of new chemical entities that target HBV DNA synthesis. In general, natural product screening is a time-consuming process that requires the fractionation and isolation of active compound(s) from complex extracts of an unknown composition. Recently, we developed a system to facilitate the detection of the replicating HBV genome using adenovirus vectors,

 </sup> which can be used to quantitatively evaluate the inhibitory potency of a test compound in a shorter period of time than other model systems for studying HBV replication using cell lines. Similarly, new efficient detection methods for virus replication would allow for the rapid drug screening of natural resources.
