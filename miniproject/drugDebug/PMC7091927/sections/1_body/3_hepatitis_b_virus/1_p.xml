<p id="Par14">According to the World Health Organization estimates in 2016, the annual number of deaths resulting from viral hepatitis is ~1.4 million, which is comparable to that of HIV and tuberculosis; 47% of those deaths can be attributed to HBV.

 </sup> Approximately 257 million individuals are chronically infected with HBV worldwide and have an elevated risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.

 </sup> Current antiviral drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration include immunomodulators (interferon-α and pegylated interferon-α) and nucleos(t)ide analogs (lamivudine, adefovir, telbivudine, entecavir and tenofovir), which are useful for therapeutic treatment to interrupt the disease progression. However, these drug classes have certain limitations; for immunomodulators, a partial efficacy and side effects exist, and for nucleos(t)ide analogs, the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains can occur during long-term use. Thus, an unmet need remains for the development of novel anti-HBV drugs. Although microbial products with anti-HBV activities, as compared with phytochemicals,
