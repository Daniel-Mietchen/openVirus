<p id="Par9">Hemagglutinin (HA) and NA are two major glycoproteins expressed by both influenza A and B viruses. HA mediates the binding of viruses to target cells via terminal sialic acid and NA cleaves terminal sialic acids from host cells. NA activity facilitates the release of progeny influenza virus by digesting sialic acids in the HA receptors (

 </sup> A siastatin B epimeric analog, 3-episiastatin B, can inhibit the sialidase activity of influenza A and B viruses NA and propagation of influenza A virus.
