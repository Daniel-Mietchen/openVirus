<p id="Par10">A synthetic analog of neuraminic acid, 2,3-didehydro-2-deoxy-
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac2en), was found to be an inhibitor of influenza virus NA.

 </sup> Neu5Ac2en is considered to be a transition state analog that can bind to the active site of NA.

 </sup> Based on a structural analysis of the NA-Neu5Ac2en complex, analogs of Neu5Ac2en were synthesized and the specificity for influenza virus NA and activity of these analogs were tested. Among these analogs, 4-guanidino-Neu5Ac2en (zanamivir) exhibited antiviral activity against various influenza A and B viruses.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>
 </sup> The guanidine group in zanamivir is suggested to form salt bridges with Glu119 in the NA active site and strong chargeâ€“charge interactions with Glu227 of NA. Because of poor oral bioavailability, zanamivir is administered by inhalation. To improve oral bioavailability, novel analogs were synthesized based on X-ray crystallographic analysis of NA with key analogs.
 <sup>

 </sup> One analog, GS4071, inhibited influenza A virus NA activity. The NA inhibition activity of GS4071 was comparable to that of zanamivir. Oseltamivir is an ethylester prodrug of GS4071. The oral bioavailability of oseltamivir was improved compared with that of GS4071.
 <sup>

 </sup> After zanamivir and oseltamivir, two NA inhibitors, peramivir and laninamivir octanoate, were launched.
 <sup>

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup> Peramivir is administered by intravenous administration and laninamivir octanoate is administered by inhalation. These two drugs are used as a single-dose treatment for influenza A and B viruses.
