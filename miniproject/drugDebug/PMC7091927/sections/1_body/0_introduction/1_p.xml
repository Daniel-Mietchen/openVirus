<p id="Par2">Viral infectious diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans. Lower respiratory infections are the deadliest communicable disease, causing 3.2 million deaths globally in 2015. Moreover, in 2015 acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections killed 1.1 million people and 36.7 million people were infected with HIV globally. To combat viral diseases, both vaccines and antiviral drugs have been employed. As a result of global efforts, smallpox caused by variola virus infections was eradicated in 1979 because of smallpox vaccination (by vaccinia virus). However, the development of effective vaccines is difficult and time consuming for certain viruses that can escape from the host immune response. Therefore, the continual development of antiviral drugs and vaccines is required to combat viral diseases. Approximately 90 drugs have been approved to treat human infectious diseases caused by the following nine viruses: HIV, human cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella zoster virus and human papillomavirus. In addition, many antiviral drugs are being evaluated in clinical trials. One of the threats of viral infections is emerging and re-emerging viruses, such as Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Zika virus. Effective antiviral drugs or vaccines against these emerging viruses are not currently available. Drug-resistant viruses, which can emerge because of the high mutation rate of the viral genome exhibited by many viruses, particularly RNA viruses, also represent a threat to global health.</p>
