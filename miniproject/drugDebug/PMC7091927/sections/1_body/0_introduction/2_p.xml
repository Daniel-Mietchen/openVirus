<p id="Par3">Almost all currently approved antiviral drugs have been produced by chemical synthesis, but natural products have contributed to the development of antiviral drugs by providing insights into the synthesis of chemical compounds. Viruses must utilize host cellular machineries to propagate and our knowledge of virusâ€“host interactions has recently been advanced. Natural products exhibit great structural diversity and complexity. Thus, both viral and host proteins involved in viral propagation can be targeted to develop antiviral drugs from natural products. In this review, we summarize antiviral microbial products discovered by Institute of Microbial Chemistry (IMC) and discuss antiviral compounds against influenza virus and HBV, because these two viruses threaten global human health now and antiviral drug against these two viruses have been developed. Antiviral compounds isolated in IMC are summarized in 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. In addition, we provide a summary of natural compounds for broad-spectrum antivirals and discuss the future potential uses of microbial products as antivirals. Natural compounds with antiviral activities focused in this review are summarized in
