<p id="Par5">Currently, several classes of anti-HIV drugs are available for HIV treatment and the combination therapies using them, termed highly active antiretroviral therapy that targets multiple steps of the virus life cycle, significantly reduce morbidity and mortality. Zidovudine (azidothymidine) was first approved for HIV treatment by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1987. This drug had initially been used for chemotherapeutic intervention against HIV infection, but unmet medical needs of increased efficacy, reduced adverse effects and a higher barrier to drug-resistant mutations remained, prompting a continuing effort to develop new anti-HIV drugs. In this context, IMC had isolated microbial products with anti-HIV activity, such as benanomicins A and B,

 </sup> and bellenamine and its homologs.

 </sup> Among them, benanomicins also exhibited anti-fungal activity, which may be advantageous for the treatment of AIDS patients with fungal infections. In addition, 14-

 </sup> were synthesized as HIV reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Meanwhile, other research groups found that several compounds discovered by IMC exhibit inhibitory activities against other viruses: phleomycin (anti-poliovirus activity),

 </sup> aclacinomycin A (anti-phage

 </sup> Among them, phleomycins and aclacinomycins were discovered as antibiotics that exhibit antitumor activity, presumably as a consequence of interactions with cellular DNA.
