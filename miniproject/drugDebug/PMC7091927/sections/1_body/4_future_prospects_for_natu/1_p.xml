<p id="Par20">Recently, deadly disease outbreaks caused by emerging and re-emerging viruses have become increasingly threatening, including outbreaks of Nipah virus in Malaysia, Hendra virus in Australia, Hantavirus in the United States, Ebola virus in Africa, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses in China and Mideast, Zika virus in Oceania and Americas, and the influenza virus H5N1, H1N1 and H7N2 subtypes. No efficient vaccine or specific anti-viral drug for these emerging and re-emerging virus diseases is yet available. Not only antiviral drugs against specific virus infections, but also broad-spectrum antiviral drugs need to be developed. Here we summarize candidates of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, nucleoside analogs and drugs against host proteins and discuss the potential of natural compounds for broad-spectrum antiviral drugs.</p>
