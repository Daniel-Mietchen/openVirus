<p id="Par22">Drugs against non-viral proteins (that is, host proteins) are also broad-spectrum antiviral drug candidates. Viruses use common cellular machinery from entry into to exit from host cells. Inhibitors against such cellular machinery could inhibit viral propagation. These host targeted drugs are not yet approved as antivirals, but research and development are ongoing. RNA viruses are known to use host membrane compartments for replication and trafficking. Thus, lipid metabolism is a candidate target of antiviral drugs. Statins, which were first isolated from 
 <italic>Penicillium citrinum</italic>, are hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Treatment with statins decreases levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

 </sup> Antiviral effects of stains have been reported for HBV, HIV, influenza virus, dengue virus, human cytomegalovirus and HCV.

 </sup> The antiviral activity of statins may be a consequence of disruption of the membrane components that viruses use, along with changes in membrane trafficking. Serine palmitoyltransferase inhibitors, myriocin isolated from 
 <italic>Myriococcum albomyces</italic>

 </sup> and NA255 isolated from

 </sup> Serine palmitoyltransferase acts in the sphingomyelin synthesis pathway and sphingomyelin is an essential component of ‘lipid rafts’. Myriocin inhibits the intracellular transport of influenza virus glycoproteins and NA255 disrupts the HCV replication complex.
