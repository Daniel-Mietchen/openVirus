<p id="Par21">Nucleoside analogs are candidates for use as broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. Ribavirin is known to be a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor and an antiviral candidate for emerging infectious diseases, such as dengue virus, norovirus, and Hendra and Nipah viruses.

 </sup> The potential activity of ribavirin against broad-spectrum RNA viruses can be exerted by both the direct and indirect inhibition of viral polymerase activity. Ribavirin monophosphate inhibits inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase, which catalyzes the reaction from inosine-5′-monophosphate to xanthosine monophosphate, thereby decreasing intracellular GTP levels.

 </sup> Nucleotide pool imbalances that result from ribavirin treatment could cause a reduction of viral polymerase activity and the incorporation of alternative nucleotides for GTP. Recent reports suggest that T-705 is also a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor for viruses such as Ebola virus.

 </sup> The detailed mechanism of the anti-viral activity of T-705 against these RNA viruses is not known and merits further study. Both BCX4430 and GS-5734 are nucleoside analogs and are the subject of clinical trials for Ebola virus disease.

 </sup> They also exhibit broad-spectrum antiviral effects against RNA virus families, including filoviruses, arenaviruses, paramyxoviruses and flaviviruses.

 </sup> As mentioned above, natural products have contributed to the development of antiviral nucleotide analogs. New classes of nucleotide analogs derived from natural products will be promising lead compounds for emerging viruses.
