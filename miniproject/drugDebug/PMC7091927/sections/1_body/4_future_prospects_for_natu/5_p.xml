<p id="Par24">Today, viral proteins are the major target of antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs against specific target proteins have been successful against important infectious diseases, such as HIV and HCV. With rapidly increasing knowledge of protein structure, development of 
 <italic>in silico</italic> tools, and methods for chemical and genetic modification, more antiviral drugs will be developed that will contribute to the future elimination of specific infectious diseases. Concurrently, we now face the threat of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases with no available specific antiviral drug. To prevent a pandemic of these infections, broad-spectrum antiviral drugs also need to be developed. Natural products are a rich source and promising starting points to identify lead compounds for antivirals that target host proteins. Studies of virus-host interactions and ‘omics’ data from virus infected cells will help us to accelerate the development of screening systems and the identification of potential drug targets. We anticipate that novel antiviral drugs derived from microbial products will contribute to both the elimination of specific virus infections and emerging virus infections in the future.
