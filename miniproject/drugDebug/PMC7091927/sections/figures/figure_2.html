 <caption> Life cycle of hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV enters hepatocytes following binding to the cellular receptor(s) including sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). After uncoating, relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) within a released nucleocapsid is transported into the nucleus due to nuclear localization signal on the capsid. In the nucleus, rcDNA is converted into cccDNA by viral and cellular enzymes. The cccDNA is quite stable in the form of a minichromosome that is responsible for persistent HBV infection and transcribed by host RNA polymerase II to generate four mRNAs as follows: 3.5 kb pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and precore mRNA, 2.4 and 2.1 kb surface antigens mRNA, and 0.7 kb HBx mRNA. pgRNA is translated into the viral polymerase and core proteins, which is then encapsidated together with polymerase. Within the nucleocapsid, the pgRNA is reverse transcribed into minus-strand DNA and degraded by the RNase H activity associated with the polymerase followed by plus-strand DNA synthesis. The 2.4 and 2.1 kb mRNA are translated into large (LHBs), and middle (MHBs) and small (SHBs) surface antigens, respectively. Finally, the matured nucleocapsids are enveloped by lipid bilayer containing these surface antigens at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus and progeny virions are released from infected cells. In parallel, a huge amounts of subviral HBsAg particles are assembled in the absence of nucleocapsid and released. The other 3.5 kb mRNA is translated into precore protein that is proteolytically processed to HBeAg. HBx has a multifunctional role in activation of various viral and cellular promoters and enhancers. A Full color version of this figure is available at Journal of Antibiotics online. </caption>
