<p>It should be noted that, unlike the situation in the field in 1960s−1970s, when the first dsRNA preparations have obtained and characterized, now much is known about the interaction of dsRNA with the cell and intracellular signal transduction. It has been found that the recognition of exogenous/extracellular dsRNA in the intracellular space can be performed using two main sensor systems [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One sensor system includes receptors of the well-studied family of Toll-like receptors of type 3 (Toll-like receptor 3, TLR3) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The other sensor system includes the cytoplasmic sensors RIG-I/MDA-5/LGP2 of the RIG-like receptor family (RLR) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Both types of these systems are able to induce production of type I interferons and pro-inflammatory cytokines, but the pathways for such activation differ.
