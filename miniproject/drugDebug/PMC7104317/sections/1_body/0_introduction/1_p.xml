<p>Recognition of viral nucleic acids and induction of interferon synthesis are the main components of innate antiviral immunity [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. It is generally accepted that double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are one of the most important mediators of interferon (IFN) induction in response to viral infection. Viral infection is associated with the appearance in the cell of double-stranded forms of RNA, which either represent the actual viral genome of the virus or appear during the viral reproductive cycle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The primary cascade of the bodyâ€™s response to viral infection and administration of exogenous dsRNA (recognition, initiation of intracellular signaling pathways) share many similarities, and therefore dsRNA may be considered as regulators of antiviral reactions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, subsequent studies of mechanisms of dsRNA action have shown that their functions are more diverse . In this regard, a constant interest in dsRNA as a substance for creation of new drugs for prevention and treatment of infectious and non-infectious diseases has not been waning for many years. This review summarizes current trends in the pharmaceutical development of drugs based on high-polymeric dsRNA.
