<p>Nucleic acids penetration into the cell can be improved by frequently used cationic polymers. The negative charges of nucleic acids prevent their interaction with a negatively charged cell surface. After binding of nucleic acids to polycations their negative charge neutralizes and they reduce in size; this promotes nucleic acid transfection into cells. The most known preparation of dsRNA preparations stabilized by polymers is Hiltonol.</p>
