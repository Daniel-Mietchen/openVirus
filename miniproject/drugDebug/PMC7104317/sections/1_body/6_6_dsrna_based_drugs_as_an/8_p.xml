<p>More than 90% of common solid tumors and many hemoblastoses, such as lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma, are known to express MUC1 glycopeptide (MUC1). However, fully synthetic glycopeptide tumor vaccines created on the basis of this glycopeptide are characterized by low immunogenicity. Glaffig et al. [
