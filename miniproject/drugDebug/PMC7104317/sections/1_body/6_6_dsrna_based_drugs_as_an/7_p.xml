<p>Intratumor administration of a plasmid carrying the apoptin gene with PolyI:PolyC not only significantly inhibited the growth of the 4T1 mammary tumor in Balb/c mice, but also induced a potent antitumor immune response, as evidenced by an increase in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes, increased secretion of cytokines into the circulation (IFN-Î³, IL-2) and tumor tissue infiltration with immune cells [
