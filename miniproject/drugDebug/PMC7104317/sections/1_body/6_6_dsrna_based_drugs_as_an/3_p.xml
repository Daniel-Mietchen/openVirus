<p>The antiproliferative, cytotoxic, and apoptogenic effects of PolyI:PolyC were observed in experiments on poorly differentiated human urinary bladder cancer cell lines MGH-U3 and RT4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. In MGH-U3 cells the drug induced growth arrest at the G1-S transition; it also increased the immunogenicity of MGH-U3 and RT4 cells, inducing expression of MHC class I molecules on their surface and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and IL-6 [
