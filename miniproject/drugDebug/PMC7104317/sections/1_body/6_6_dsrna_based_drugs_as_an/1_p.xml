<p>Although TLR3 has been first identified in cells of the immune system, more recent studies have shown that it is also expressed by malignant cells. The antitumor effects of the TLR3 agonist PolyI:PolyC have been demonstrated on a wide range of mouse and human tumor cell lines. For example, there is evidence that intracellular delivery of liposomal PolyI:PolyC to human AGS adenocarcinoma cells induced tumor cell apoptosis in vitro and significantly inhibited xenograft growth in
