 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">116</xref>] developed a PolyI:PolyC delivery system to enhance the antitumor immune response to the P5 peptide, containing multiple epitopes of the HER2/Neu glycopeptide characteristic of tumor cells. The P5 peptide was encapsulated into cationic nanoliposomes consisting of modified cholesterol (1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammoniumpropane-cholesterol) that contained or did not contain PolyI:PolyC. In groups of mice immunized with liposomes carrying the P5 protein and PolyI:PolyC, as well as liposomes containing only PolyI:PolyC, a more significant level of IFN-Î³ secretion by splenocytes and an increase in the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells compared with other groups were observed. The most pronounced inhibition of the growth of the experimental TUBO tumor with a high level of rHER2/neu expression during the whole experiment (90 days) was observed during treatment with liposomes containing P5 and PolyI:PolyC. This suggests that the combination of PolyI: PolyC and liposomes with a tumor antigen is able to induce an antitumor immune response even without the use of additional T-helper epitopes.
