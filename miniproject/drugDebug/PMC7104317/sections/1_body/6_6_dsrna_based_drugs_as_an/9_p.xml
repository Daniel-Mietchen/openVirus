<p>Kano et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>] investigated PolyI:PolyC and the recombinant protein encoded by the lymphocyte 3 activation gene (LAG-3) fused to human IgG Fc (LAG-3-Ig) as adjuvants to a peptide vaccine against the tumor antigen P1A. LAG-3 (CD223) is a protein expressed on the membrane of activated T-, B-cells, NK-сells, plasmacytoid DC and plays an important role in their functioning. In mice with grafted mastocytoma tumor P815, PolyI:PolyC in combination with LAG-3-Ig caused rejection of the grafted tumor and increased longevity of animals. The antitumor effect was due to increased proliferation and infiltration of tumor tissues by T-cells and their production of Th1-type cytokines. The combination of PolyI:PolyC with LAG-3-Ig suppressed expression of a number of proteins and receptors on T-cells, preventing their “depletion”; this is important for realization of a deep and long-lasting antitumor immune response [
