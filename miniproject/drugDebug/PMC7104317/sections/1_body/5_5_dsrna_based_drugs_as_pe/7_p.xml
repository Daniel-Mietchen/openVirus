<p>Kim et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>] found an increase in the production of antigen-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA in response to vaccination of mice with trivalent hemagglutinin-subunits or split H1N1 vaccine antigen after administration of PolyI:PolyC as an eyedrop adjuvant. Importantly, there was no increase in mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines and mononuclear cell infiltration at the injection site; this indicates that the drug does not have a side effect in the form of a local inflammatory response.
