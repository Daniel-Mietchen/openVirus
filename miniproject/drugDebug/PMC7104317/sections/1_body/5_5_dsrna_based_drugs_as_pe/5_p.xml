<p>The design of microcarriers for delivery of antigens in combination with immunoadjuvants to antigen-presenting cells (APC) is one of actively developing areas of vaccine construction. TLR3 ligands, particularly, PolyI:PolyC, are also used as candidate adjuvants in these systems. Such adjuvants activate not only “professional” APC (DC, macrophages), but also non-immune cells (epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts); this can result in the development of autoimmune reactions or chronic inflammation. In order to avoid such undesirable reactions, Hafner et al. proposed an original PolyI:PolyC delivery system [

The microcarrier is a negatively charged polystyrene microsphere equipped with a “crown” of polyethylene glycol (PEG), which is formed by electrostatic coating with polycationic copolymers based on poly(L-lysine)-graft-poly(ethylene glycol). Experiments on primary culture of peripheral blood monocytes have shown that PolyI:PolyC adsorbed on the surface of the microspheres caused activation of monocyte-derived DC [

At the same time, the preparation drug did not affect expression of antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I or secretion of IL-6 by human skin fibroblasts and weakened their phagocytic activity; this indicates that the adsorbed PolyI:PolyC lacks the ability to induce adverse inflammatory reactions [
