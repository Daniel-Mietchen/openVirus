<p>It is interesting to note that, despite the comparable level of antiviral activity and the less pronounced toxic properties of the PolyG:PolyC complex [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], although other reasons are also possible (e.g. differences in the width and manifestation of the immunomodulating action of these complexes).
