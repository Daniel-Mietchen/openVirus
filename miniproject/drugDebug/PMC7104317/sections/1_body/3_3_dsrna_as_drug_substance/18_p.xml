<p>In 2014, an improved version of the drug Ampligen, PolyI:PolyC
 <sub>30</sub>U, was developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. In contrast to Ampligen, the new drug is characterized by a higher content of C versus U (30 : 1), and therefore has a reduced ability to form branched dsRNA and as a result, it binds to TLR3 more actively.
