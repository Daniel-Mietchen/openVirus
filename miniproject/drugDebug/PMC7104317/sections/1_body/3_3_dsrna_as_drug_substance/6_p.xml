<p>Synthetic dsRNA is another type of high polymeric dsRNA widely used in pharmaceutical development. The history of synthetic double-stranded polyribonucleotide complexes began in 1955, when Grunberg-Manago and Ochoa showed that the enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase; EC 2.7.7.8) from 
 <italic>Azotobacter vinelandii</italic> in the presence of Mg
 <sup>2+</sup> could catalyze the reaction of polynucleotide synthesis of a certain structure up to 2â€“2.7 kb from ribonucleoside diphosphates with the release of stoichiometric amounts of orthophosphate [

The development of simple methods for synthesis of high-polymer dsRNA has opened the possibility of producing them in sufficient quantities to study and create drugs on their basis.
