<p>One of the current problems associated with the development and production of synthetic polyribonucleotides is standardization of their structure. In this context, in 2018, Nakano et al. developed a new method for production of industrial quantities of PolyI:PolyC of a strictly defined length [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. In this method prevention of an uncontrolled increase in the length of a polyribonucleotide during annealing was achieved by mixing several short PolyI molecules (0.1 kb) with one long PolyC molecule (0.4 kb) (
