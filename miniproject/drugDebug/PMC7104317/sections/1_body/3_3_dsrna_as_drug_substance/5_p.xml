<p>Limited information exists on the development of drugs based on other natural dsRNAs. One such example is dsRNA of bacteriophage φ6 isolated from infected 
 <italic>Pseudomonas phaseolicola</italic> cells and representing a mixture of dsRNA of different lengths: 6.3 kb; 4.0 kb and 2.9 kb (L-, M- and S-forms, respectively). In a series of experimental studies, it has been shown that phage dsRNA exhibits high IFN-inducing and antiviral activity against viruses causing Omsk hemorrhagic fever and influenza virus A/Chicken/Kurgan/05/2005 (H5N1) [
