<p>Interferons, in turn, induce expression of gene encoding proteins involved in realization of the antiviral response. Among IFN-stimulated genes, there are genes encoding 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthetase/RNase L (OAS/RNase L), these enzymes cause degradation of newly synthesized cell mRNA (including viral ones) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and also the gene encoding protein kinase R (PKR), which inhibits protein synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Most cells synthesize 2'-5'-OAS and PKR constitutively, but interferons increase the transcriptional activity of their genes several-fold. The mechanisms of activation of OAS/RNase L and PKR, as well as their biological effects, have been studied in details [
