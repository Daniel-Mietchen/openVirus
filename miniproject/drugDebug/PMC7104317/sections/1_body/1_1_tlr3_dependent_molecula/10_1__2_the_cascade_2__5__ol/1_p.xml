<p>OAS, like PKR, is an IFN-inducible enzyme; its activity depends on the presence of dsRNA in the cell. Unlike PKR, OAS does not have a separate domain for binding an inducer. dsRNA binds in the region of the positively charged groove of the enzyme; after conformational changes of the groove the OAS active center becomes spatially accessible. The activated enzyme catalyzes ATP polymerization resulted in formation of short mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra-oligoadenylates (2′, 5′-oligoA), which interact with RNase L (RNase L) and transform it from an inactive monomeric form to the active dimer (

RNase L, a protein with molecular mass of 83 kDa, consists of three domains: N-terminal regulatory domain, which contains nine ankyrin-like regions, protein kinase-like domain, and C-terminal RNase domain. 2'-5'A oligomers interact with the ankyrin-like sites of the RNase L N-terminal domain. The complex formation is accompanied by conformational changes, leading to dimerization of the enzyme molecule and the C-terminal ribonuclease domain becomes catalytically active. Destroying mRNA into fragments, RNase L suppresses formation of complete viral RNA, which leads to inhibition of both protein synthesis and assembly of viral particles [
