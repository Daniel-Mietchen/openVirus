<p>It has been found that TLR3 dimerization and corresponding signal can be induced by dsRNA of at least 45−50 base pairs (bp); this corresponds to the minimum spatially possible distance between the sites of dsRNA binding with receptor ectodomain monomers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This feature provides receptor recognition of only long dsRNAs appearing in the cell as a result of viral infection; shorter polyribonucleotides (tRNA, rRNA, microRNA) are not able to form stable complexes with TLR3 ECD. The second characteristic feature of TLR3 consists in the receptor binding of the ligand that occurs via surface interactions (hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction) with the sugar-phosphate backbone of RNA, and not with individual nucleotide bases, and depends only on the secondary structure of RNA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This explains the universality of the ligand-receptor interaction: the ability of the same receptor to bind dsRNA of different primary structure. On the other hand, there is evidence that TLR3 recognizes such specific ligand characteristics as the presence or absence of hydroxyl group at the 2'-position of β-D-ribose, which discriminates dsRNA and DNA molecules [
