<p>TLR3 is expressed mainly by specialized cells of the immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells (DC) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]; this receptor is also found on somatic cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In most cell types, TLR3 is located inside the cell compartmentsâ€”on the membranes of endosomes and lysosomes, although some cells, such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts, also express it on the plasma membrane outer surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. During endocytosis of dsRNA-containing material, intracellular TLR3 is able to move (by means of the UNC-93B protein) from the endoplasmic reticulum to endosomes, where they acquire functional ability for ligand recognition [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].
