<p>Proteins RIG-1 (retinoic acid-inducible gene 1) and MDA-5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) contain the C-terminal RNA recognition domain, the central DExD/H helicoid domain, and two N-terminal CARD domains (caspase activation and recruitment domain), which are able to bind CARD-containing adapters, such as Cardif/VISA/MAVS/IPS-1. These adapter proteins, in turn, serve as a platform for assembly of signaling proteins that trigger IRF-3 or NF-κB-signaling pathways (
