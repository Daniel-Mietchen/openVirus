<p>Until recently, helicase LGP2 (laboratory of genetics and physiology 2) was considered as an exclusively inhibiting factor of this family, preventing binding and activation of RIG-1 and MDA-5. However, several research groups have shown that LGP2 can be a positive regulator of the RLR-induced signal [
