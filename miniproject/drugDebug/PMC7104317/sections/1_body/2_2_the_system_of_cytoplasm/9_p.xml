<p>Thus, realization of the dsRNA effect on the cell involves several receptor systems that are specific in terms of dsRNA recognition. The receptor diversity provides reliable identification of foreign double-stranded structures and their differentiation from endogenous cell RNA. Finally, induction of intracellular signaling pathways leads to expression of cytokine genes, primarily IFN, and activation of dsRNA-binding enzyme, the key elements of the antiviral response.</p>
