<p>As already mentioned above, in addition to TLR3 present in almost all cell types, there is another dsRNA sensor system, which belongs to the family of RIG-like receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. RLRs are complex proteins with well-organized signaling and functional domains, with characteristic autoinhibition mechanism.
