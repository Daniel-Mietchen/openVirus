<p>The ability of dsRNA to induce synthesis of IFN and other cytokines is a basis for diversity of their immunomodulatory properties. It has been shown that dsRNA causes an increase in absorption, metabolic and bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells (macrophages, neutrophils), activity of natural killers (NK), and maturation and activation of DC; this leads to activation of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells [
