<p>A relatively new research direction includes the use of dsRNA as antitumor agents and antitumor vaccine adjuvants. It has been found hat these drugs inhibit growth of tumor cells through of proliferation suppression and induction of apoptotic cell death, enhance the antitumor immune response. Current clinical trials are aimed at investigating the antitumor properties of dsRNA as drugs for mono- and complex therapy in combination with antitumor agents, including vaccines. Further studies of the mechanisms of action, the role of dsRNA in the correction of pathological processes of various origins, will obviously help to optimize methods of drug usage to increase their effectiveness and safety.</p>
