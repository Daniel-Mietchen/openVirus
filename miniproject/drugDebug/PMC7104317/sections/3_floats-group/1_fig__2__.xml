  <p>Biochemical mechanisms of dsRNA-induced inhibition of translation and protein synthesis. DsRNA activated, IFN-induced protein kinase R (PKR) inhibits mRNA translation via phosphorylation of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2α) and complex formation with eIF2B. Initiation of 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthesis from ATP by dsRNA-activated 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (2′-5′OAS) leads to the dimerization of RNase L and non-specific RNA degradation.
