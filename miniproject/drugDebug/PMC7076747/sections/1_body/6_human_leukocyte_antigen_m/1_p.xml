<p>In the study by Zhao et al, only recipients of haploidentical grafts were included, thus at high risk of GVHD and thereby of immunosuppression-induced CMV reactivation. ATC was produced from the original stem cell donor and therefore also haploidentical. However, T cells restricted to a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–peptide combination, of which the HLA molecule is absent in the recipient, are useless from a functional point of view as these cells will never encounter their cognate target in the recipient. This “useless crowd” can even be disproportionally large; for example, HLA-B7–restricted CMV-specific T-cell responses are notoriously dominant. Thus, if the donor is HLA-B7 positive whereas the recipient is not, ATC therapy will be largely off-target. This might explain the failure of ATC in certain donor/recipient pairs.</p>
