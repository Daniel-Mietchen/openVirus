<p>CMV infection and GVHD are intricately related [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In all previous studies of ATC therapy, patients with clinically significant GVHD requiring immunosuppressive therapy were excluded. In contrast, the occurrence of GVHD before CMV reactivation was the main selection criterion in the study by Zhao et al. All (haploidentical) graft recipients received GVHD prophylaxis and part of the ATC-treated cohort used corticosteroid doses up to 0.5 mg/kg at the time of ATC, but still no excess GVHD occurred following ATC infusion. The safety of ATC in the setting of GVHD is an important novel finding. However, given the proapoptotic effect of steroids on lymphocytes, it is unclear to what extent the adoptively transferred cells persisted in patients using steroids. With the aim to overcome this problem, an interesting preclinical study describes protection of ATC from the proapoptotic effects of corticosteroids by ingenious genetical engineering [
