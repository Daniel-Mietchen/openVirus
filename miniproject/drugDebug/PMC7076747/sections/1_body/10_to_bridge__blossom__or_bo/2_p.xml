<p>To discriminate reliably between adoptively transferred and graft-derived CMV-specific T cells is a challenge because they originate from same donor. From a practical point of view, it probably makes no difference whether the clinical effect results from ATC or from enhanced graft function, as long as durable protective immunity is achieved. Nevertheless, further studies of the mechanisms that lead to recovery of cell-mediated immunity are justified. These can help to optimize ATC manufacturing, resulting in effector cells that can bridge an immune gap, early memory (CD62L
 <sup>+</sup>) T cells with potential for in vivo expansion, and/or helper T cells to boost graft function, as desired. ATC with multivirus specificity holds even more promise [
