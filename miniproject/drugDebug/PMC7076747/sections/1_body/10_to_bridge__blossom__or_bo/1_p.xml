 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> provides a simplified conceptual model of the possible different components of ATC and the period during which it may be effective. For containment of actively replicating CMV, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells with an immediate effector function are needed (bridge). In a less urgent setting, cells with a broad repertoire and proliferative potential are needed, and part of these may even persist as memory pool (blossom). The study by Zhao et al now suggests a third mechanism: stimulation of CMV-specific responses by the graft (boost) [
