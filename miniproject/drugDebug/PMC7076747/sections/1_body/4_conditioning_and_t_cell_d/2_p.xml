<p>It is generally thought that a stem cell graft consists of stem cells but, in fact, only a few percent are actually (CD34
 <sup>+</sup>) progenitor cells; the remainder consist of the peripheral blood repertoire of mononuclear cells, of which roughly half are T cells. Thus, undepleted grafts contain CMV-specific memory T cells, which occur with high frequency in healthy CMV-positive adults.
