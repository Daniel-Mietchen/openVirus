<p>Some haploidentical transplant protocols use nondepleted grafts and treatment of the recipient with, for example, antithymocyte globulin, as in the study by Zhao et al; others use T-cell depletion of the graft, for example, by alemtuzumab (anti-CD52) “in the bag.” In both cases, the depleting antibody ends up in the recipient and will exert its effect for at least 6 weeks, making ATC in this period ineffective. Nevertheless, some cells escape elimination, implicating that memory T cells from the donor can be available to the recipient already at the time of transplantation. This might explain why some patients at very high risk still never develop CMV complications.</p>
