<p>Transplant protocols may include donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) several months after transplantation, aimed at a graft-vs-leukemia effect. The high risk of GVHD following DLI is mainly explained by the presence of naive alloreactive cells. However, DLI also contains the whole repertoire of memory T cells of the donor, including CMV-specific cells. Because DLI was an exclusion criterion in the study by Zhao et al, it cannot have contributed to antiviral immunity.</p>
