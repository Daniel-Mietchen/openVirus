<p>When cytomegalovirus (CMV) was nicknamed the “troll of transplantation” in 1979, diagnostics were still rather primitive and no effective therapy was yet available [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Today, with adequate screening tools and effective, albeit toxic, antiviral drugs at our disposal, CMV still deserves that pejorative title. Especially after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with the associated high risk of graft-vs-host disease (GVHD), CMV remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality [
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–5</xref>]. Current strategies vary from CMV prophylaxis to preemptive therapy, but ultimately the virus must be controlled by the immune system. Treatment failures and toxicity of antiviral drugs have led to studies using adoptive transfer of donor-derived CMV-specific T cells (ATC) to restore immunity to CMV. Clinical studies, all phase 1/2, varied regarding inclusion criteria, manufacturing protocols, and timing of ATC therapy. However, ATC therapy was consistently safe with no excess GVHD and was generally suggested to be effective on the part of the recipients.
