<p>In the study by Zhao et al, ATC was produced by stimulation with a high concentration of cytokines and anti-CD3 (without costimulation), followed by 2 rounds of peptide stimulation. We believe this led to mainly terminally differentiated effector cells that had lost reproductive potential. However, the main study result was a lower rate of late and persistent CMV. Based on data from the mouse model and TCR spectratyping in 3 patients, this effect was purportedly caused by enhanced recovery of graft-derived cell-mediated immunity rather than persistence of ATC. The mechanism of this boosting effect was not studied, but T-helper function of the minority of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in the ATC might have caused this effect.
