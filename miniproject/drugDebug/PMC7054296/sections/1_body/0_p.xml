 </sup> As of February 14, 2020, there are over 64,000 confirmed cases with 1,384 deaths. This raises an urgent need for an effective treatment of the deadly disease. However, current antiviral drugs have limited effects on 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2). Although Gilead’s NUC (nucleoside) inhibitor, which previously failed to treat Ebola, seemed to benefit a 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) patient in Washington, USA, it remains unknown whether the drug will be effective against the virus in other patients, who may have been infected by different variants of the virus. Our analysis of 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) RNA genome from 19 patients in China, USA and Australia reveals that these viruses have differences in sequence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). These differences are mostly single nucleotide variations. Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref> shows an example of single nucleotide variations that result in changes in amino acids 62 and 84 of ORF8 of 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2), a polypeptide implicated in driving coronavirus transition from bat to human.

 </sup> The evidence from patient samples suggests that 2019-nCov (SARS-CoV-2) is actively acquiring new mutations that may enable it to escape antiviral drugs. This raises a serious challenge to the development of conventional drugs and of vaccines. The same limitations apply to other deadly RNA viruses such as SARS or MERS.
