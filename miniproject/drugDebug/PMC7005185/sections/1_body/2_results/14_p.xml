<p id="Par30">Patients treated with NAs with BSC had significantly higher levels of mtDNA (p = 0.018) and lower levels of mtRNA when compared to those without NAs (p = 0.005), as showed in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>. The median duration of current treatment was 65 months (IQR 55–65) in patients with BSC compared to 36 months (IQR 17–70) in patients without BSC (p = 0.045). Furthermore, the total median duration of NA treatment was 104 months (IQR 97–120) in those with BSC in respect with 78 months (IQR 37–108) in patients without (p = 0.01).
