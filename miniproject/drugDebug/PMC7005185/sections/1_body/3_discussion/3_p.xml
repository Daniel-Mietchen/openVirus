 </sup>. All NAs can have side effects, due to their potential of human DNA polymerase-Î³ inhibition involved in mtDNA replication. The reduction in intracellular mtDNA levels can lead to clinical manifestations of mitochondrial toxicity, rarely reported in NAs active against HBV. In previous reports, lamivudine, adefovir and tenofovir, have not been shown to display signs of mitochondrial neither in prescribing information, nor in HepG2 cell culture models
