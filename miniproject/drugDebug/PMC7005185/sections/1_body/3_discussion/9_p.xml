<p id="Par39">We found that patients receiving lamivudine + adefovir had higher levels of mtDNA, compared to those receiving entecavir or tenofovir, suggesting that the impact on mitochondrial damage could be lower with 2
 <sup>nd</sup> generation NAs. Altogether, our results indicate a possible causal role of antiviral therapy in mtDNA increase in HBV-infected patients receiving NAs. However, such findings seem to be in contrast with those reported in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy, which generally agree in identifying mtDNA depletion as the hallmark of mitochondrial toxicity
