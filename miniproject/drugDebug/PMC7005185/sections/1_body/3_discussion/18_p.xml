<p id="Par48">Our study has several limitations. These include the small number of patients enrolled and the cross-sectional nature of the design, which did not allow us to link cause and effect. Furthermore, it was a 4- site study in the same city and therefore the results may not be extended to other populations. Finally, it would have been interesting to evaluate patients before and after the initiation of antiviral therapy to have a prospective evaluation.</p>
