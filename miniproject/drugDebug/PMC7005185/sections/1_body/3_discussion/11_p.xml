<p id="Par41">Mitochondrial dysfunction in HIV patients has not always been associated with mtDNA depletion

 </sup>, and severe mtDNA depletion has been reported in asymptomatic subjects
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, additional mechanisms for mitochondrial alterations in HIV, beyond mtDNA depletion alone, are also likely, as has been recently suggested
