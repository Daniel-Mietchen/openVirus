<p id="Par14">For quantitative mRNA expression analysis real-time PCR was performed by jCycler. Each sample was run in duplicate and the mean value of the duplicate was used to calculate the mRNA expression of the gene COII which was normalized to reference control housekeeping nucleus mRNA b2microglobulin: forward primer (5′CATTCCTGAAGCTGACAGCATTC-3′), reverse primer (5′-CTGCTGGATGACGTGAGGT AACC-3′) and labeled probe (5′-VIC TGTCTCGCTCCGTGGCCTTAGCTG-3′). Appropriate controls ensuring no amplification in the absence of reverse transcriptase were performed for each sample. For analysis, data were expressed as mtDNA/nDNA and mtRNA/nRNA ratio.</p>
