 <p id="Par1">Our study purpose was to evaluate mitochondrial (mt)DNA and RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and body shape changes (BSC) in HBV-infected patients. mtDNA and mtRNA were measured in PBMCs. The presence of BSC was evaluated through a questionnaire and clinical evaluation. A total of 157 subjects were enrolled, of these 107 were HBV-infected patients, 54 receiving nucleoside analogues (NAs, Group A), 53 naive to antivirals (Group B) and 50 age-sex matched controls (Group C). All HBV-treated patients had negative HBV–DNA. Twenty (37,0%) received lamivudine + adefovir, 20 (37.0%) tenofovir, 2 (3.7%) lamivudine and 12 (22.2%) entecavir. Therapy median duration was 38 months (IQR 20–60) in NA-treated patients. Group A showed significantly higher mtDNA/nuclear (n) DNA ratio (p = 0.000008) compared to Group C and Group B (p = 0.002). Group B showed significantly higher mtDNA/nDNA ratio compared to Group C (p = 0.017). Group A and B had significantly lower mtRNA/nRNA ratio compared to Group C (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.00006, respectively). Tenofovir and entecavir showed less impact compared to lamivudine + adefovir. mtDNA/nDNA ratio positively (Rho = 0.34, p &lt; 0.05) and mtRNA/nRNA ratio negatively (Rho = −0.34, p &lt; 0.05) correlated with therapy duration. BSC were significantly more frequent in Group A [10/54 (18.5%)] compared to Group B [3/53 (5.6%, p = 0.04)] and Group C [0/50, (p = 0.0009)]. In conclusion, long-term NA therapy was associated both to mitochondrial toxicity and BSC, showing significant differences in mtDNA and mtRNA levels. Tenofovir and entecavir showed lower impact on alterations, compared to 1
  <sup>st</sup> generation NA.
