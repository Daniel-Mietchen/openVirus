    "Our study purpose was to evaluate mitochondrial (mt)DNA and RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and body shape changes (BSC) in HBV-infected patients. mtDNA and mtRNA were measured in PBMCs. The presence of BSC was evaluated through a questionnaire and clinical evaluation. A total of 157 subjects were enrolled, of these 107 were HBV-infected patients, 54 receiving nucleoside analogues (NAs, Group A), 53 naive to antivirals (Group B) and 50 age-sex matched controls (Group C). All HBV-treated patients had negative HBV-DNA. Twenty (37,0%) received lamivudine + adefovir, 20 (37.0%) tenofovir, 2 (3.7%) lamivudine and 12 (22.2%) entecavir. Therapy median duration was 38 months (IQR 20-60) in NA-treated patients. Group A showed significantly higher mtDNA/nuclear (n) DNA ratio (p = 0.000008) compared to Group C and Group B (p = 0.002). Group B showed significantly higher mtDNA/nDNA ratio compared to Group C (p = 0.017). Group A and B had significantly lower mtRNA/nRNA ratio compared to Group C (p = 0.00003 and p = 0.00006, respectively). Tenofovir and entecavir showed less impact compared to lamivudine + adefovir. mtDNA/nDNA ratio positively (Rho = 0.34, p < 0.05) and mtRNA/nRNA ratio negatively (Rho = -0.34, p < 0.05) correlated with therapy duration. BSC were significantly more frequent in Group A [10/54 (18.5%)] compared to Group B [3/53 (5.6%, p = 0.04)] and Group C [0/50, (p = 0.0009)]. In conclusion, long-term NA therapy was associated both to mitochondrial toxicity and BSC, showing significant differences in mtDNA and mtRNA levels. Tenofovir and entecavir showed lower impact on alterations, compared to 1st generation NA."
