<p>Biochemical and virological data provide compelling evidence on the differential effect of genetic background on both the type and degree of antiretroviral drug resistance in HIV-1. In regard to HIV protease, genetic background can affect the degree of protein binding caused by primary mutations and restore the function of protease (PR) to a differential degree, according to the background polymorphisms in each subtype. This effect was not discernible in the absence of typical major resistance mutations, but rather when particular backgrounds of combinations of major resistance mutations and background polymorphisms were present. In this regard, some background polymorphisms can clearly act as secondary resistance mutations.</p>
