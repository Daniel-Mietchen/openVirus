<p>Multiple clinical and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have confirmed that protease and gag are a functional unit and co-evolve when HIV is subject to drug pressure. Both clearly mutate under PI pressure and Gag mutations can act as compensatory substitutions that may increase levels of resistance and viral replication capacity. None of the recombinant phenotyping systems used for clinical samples monitors Gag. The magnitude of differences among Gag may vary between 2 to 2.5 fold between subtypes. Although this difference appears small, different subtypes might develop compensatory Gag mutations at different rates, establishing a need to take Gag into account in phenotyping. Only one study reported that a recombinant construct included Gag of clinical origin, but did not test the same subtypes as others.
