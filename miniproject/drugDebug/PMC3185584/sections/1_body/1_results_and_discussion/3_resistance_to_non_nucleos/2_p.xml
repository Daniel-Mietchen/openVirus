<p>Tissue culture selection studies have shown that a V106M mutation commonly develops in subtype C viruses following drug pressure with NVP or EFV, unlike the V106A mutation that is more commonly selected in subtype B. The basis for this difference is a nucleotide polymorphism at codon 106 in reverse transcriptase (RT) [
