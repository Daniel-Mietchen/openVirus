<p>With few exceptions, the different studies conducted in populations affected by non-subtype B viruses are too heterogeneous to permit pooling of data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-viruses-02-02493">8</xref>]. These studies have addressed different research questions and used non-equivalent NRTI backbones (e.g., ZVD/ddI and ZDV/3TC). They have also grouped mutations by drug class without information on the nature of the regimen at virologic failure, and have reported resistance in different ways (e.g., different algorithms or resistance lists), making it difficult to relate resistance mutations to a specific drug or drug combination. In order to better recognize inter-subtype differences, more longitudinal studies on response to first-line ARV combinations are needed. Of course, pre- and post-therapy genotype resistance testing is also necessary.
