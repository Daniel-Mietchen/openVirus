<p>The clinical and prognostic implications of the preferential emergence of some mutations and changes in the frequency of these mutations in select non-B subtypes need greater attention. Future research on the role of polymorphisms in non-subtype B viruses that increase in frequency after drug exposure and may contribute to drug resistance (e.g., A98G/S in RT and M36I and K20I in PR) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73-viruses-02-02493">73</xref>] and in India where resistance rates of 80% to two drug classes have been reported after failure on first-line regimens that employed NRTI/NNRTI combinations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74-viruses-02-02493">74</xref>]. No study has yet tested the degree of resistance or cross-resistance that certain mutational combinations (67N/70R/215Y) may confer 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Future studies should try to assess pre- and post-treatment genotypes in order to find associations of certain polymorphisms with drug resistance, including variations of polymorphisms in variants of the same subtype that are located in different geographical areas. This might improve the appropriateness of selection of certain drugs over others in the context of second or third line therapeutic options.
