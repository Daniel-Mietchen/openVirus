<p>In general, HIV-1 subtype diversity has not limited the overall benefit of ART (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-viruses-02-02493">Table 1</xref>). However, there are subtype differences in the type and preference of pathways of resistance with some mutations emerging almost exclusively in some non-B subtypes, e.g., the protease mutations 82M in subtype G 
 <italic>versus</italic> 82A/F/S in the others, 88D in subtype B 
 <italic>versus</italic> 88S in subtypes C and CRF02_AG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66-viruses-02-02493">66</xref>]. HIV-2 has major mutations in regard to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, which contribute to innate NNRTI resistance and rapid development of multi-class drug resistance (
 <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-viruses-02-02493">Table 1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67-viruses-02-02493">67</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68-viruses-02-02493">68</xref>]. The RT mutation V106M in subtypes C and A 
 <italic>vs.</italic> V106A in subtype B is observed with NVP and EFV. Polymorphisms at RT residue 98, common in subtype G, are associated with NNRTI resistance in subtype B and may lower the resistance barrier and duration of efficacy of NNRTIs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69-viruses-02-02493">69</xref>]. The available evidence indicates that the frequency of some resistance mutations shared by B and non-B subtypes can vary after failure of first line therapeutic regimens, as in the case of the K65R mutation; these differences in type and frequency of resistance mutations should not be underestimated. The TAM pathway 67N/70R/215Y found in subtype C in Botswana will probably be adequately detected by most resistance algorithms, since it does not involve new mutations.
