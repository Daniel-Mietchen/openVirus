<p>Overall, the majority of non-B HIV-1 subtype isolates possess wild-type susceptibilities similar to those of subtype B wild-type isolates. Compared to B subtypes, diminished susceptibilities among wild-type isolates have been found for CRF02_AG recombinant viruses in three different studies in regard to NFV and ATV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70-viruses-02-02493">70</xref>]. However, no study assigned statistical significance of drug susceptibility levels due to polymorphisms and small sample size. One study performed molecular modeling and suggested that distortions in the K26 pocket of A/G proteases appear to be responsible for a lower binding energy of NFV and hence lower susceptibility of A/G viruses to this drug [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70-viruses-02-02493">70</xref>]. Others have also found A/G isolates with lower susceptibilities to certain PIs (NFV and ATV). Only one study has detected an important proportion of WT isolates with lower susceptibilities to ATV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71-viruses-02-02493">71</xref>]. Most phenotypes have been determined by commercial or in-house assays that were developed primarily to measure B-subtype drug susceptibilities based on the laboratory adapted strains HXB2 or NL43. These studies employed a modified clone of a laboratory strain that lacks both the terminal part of Gag and most of Pol in order to generate a recombinant clone.
