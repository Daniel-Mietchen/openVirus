<p>One study revealed higher rates of accumulation of NRTI and PI resistance mutations and equal rates of emergence of NNRTI mutations in subtype B compared to C [

An observational study from southern Brazil also showed a lower relative frequency of primary resistance to PIs in subtype C as compared to subtype B and is suggestive that PI mutations may be less well tolerated at the structural level in the former subtype [
