<p>In conclusion, the differential selection of K65R pathways in subtype C is related to template differences, ddI and d4T-containing regimens, as well as Y181C in the viral backbone. Thymidine analogue pathways are favored with zidovudine-based regimens. More extensive genotypic studies are required to ascertain subtype differences in acquisition of resistance to NRTIs.
