<p>The presence of higher rates of the K65R mutation in subtype C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26-viruses-02-02493">26</xref>,
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-viruses-02-02493">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-viruses-02-02493">29</xref>] suggests that these viruses may have a particular predisposition toward acquiring this mutation, as has been described 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-viruses-02-02493">35</xref>]. Importantly, a subtype C RNA template mechanism has been proposed to explain this phenomenon that involves higher rates of K65R mutagenesis in subtype C viruses than in other subtypes (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-viruses-02-02493">Figure 1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-viruses-02-02493">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-viruses-02-02493">37</xref>]. Moreover, this mechanism is strictly template dependent and is independent of the source of the RT employed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-viruses-02-02493">36</xref>]. In subtype C, there is an intrinsic difficulty in synthesizing pol-A homopolymeric sequences that leads to template pausing at codon 65, facilitating the acquisition of K65R under selective drug pressure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38-viruses-02-02493">38</xref>]. In contrast, the subtype B template favors pausing at codon 67 that may facilitate the generation of D67N and TAMs rather than K65R pathways [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39-viruses-02-02493">39</xref>].
