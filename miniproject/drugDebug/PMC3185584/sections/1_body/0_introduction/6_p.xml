<p>Genotypic ARV resistance testing is of proven benefit in deciding on best choice of ARVs for individual treatment and serves as a repository of information on HIV resistance mutations. Several factors underscore the difficulties in defining inter-subtype differences. While genotyping can classify the major viral subtypes, significant proportions (∼15%) of infections remain unassigned or differentially assigned using different subtyping algorithms [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22-viruses-02-02493">22</xref>], due to less availability of ARV therapy, the high cost of drug resistance testing and limited opportunities for research in resource-limited areas. Furthermore, resistance tests may often be performed only on participants enrolled in study cohorts or trials but not in general practice.
