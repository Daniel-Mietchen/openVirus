<p>Most HIV infections worldwide are due to non-subtype B infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-viruses-02-02493">1</xref>]. HIV-1 group M has been classified into subtypes, circulating and unique recombinant forms (CRF and URF, respectively) because of its significant natural genetic variation. These include subtypes A–D, F–H, and J–K and many CRFs and URFs. Subtype B is the most prevalent in the Western World (Western Europe, the Americas, Japan and Australia), whilst non-B subtypes predominate in the rest of the world: subtype C in sub-Saharan Africa India, and Brazil, CRF01_AE in South East Asia, CRF02_AG in West Africa, and subtype A in Eastern Europe and Northern Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1-viruses-02-02493">1</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3-viruses-02-02493">3</xref>]. In addition, the proportion of non-B subtypes in North and South America and Western Europe is increasing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4-viruses-02-02493">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7-viruses-02-02493">7</xref>]. Combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) is now used in many areas of the world and HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has emerged in all locales. Thus, it is expected that non-B subtypes will become even more common in western countries.
