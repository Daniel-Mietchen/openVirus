<p>Similarly, evaluations of virological and biochemical data suggest that natural amino acid background can affect the magnitude of resistance conferred by many antiretroviral resistance mutations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-viruses-02-02493">19</xref>]. In contrast, many studies on antiretroviral drug resistance in non-B subtypes exposed to chronic suppressive therapy have yielded less definitive results with respect to the importance of natural HIV-1 diversity as a factor leading to differences in types of drug resistance mutations and the propensity to develop drug resistance in the first place.
