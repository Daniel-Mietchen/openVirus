<p>Over the last few years, the search for an effective treatment for orthohantaviruses infections has undergone a considerable increase [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Ribavirin (RBV), a broad-spectrum inhibitor, is the only antiviral with recognized in vitro and in vivo activity on hantavirus replication [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In China [

 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], clinical trials have been conducted for the treatment of HFRS using post-exposure, intravenous RBV but while significant results have been obtained in the first case, the second resulted ineffective, as well as the trial conducted in patients with HPS. Furthermore, the use of RBV is limited by its myelosuppression and toxicity [
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Besides RBV, the use of some nucleoside analogues resulted in being highly inhibitory in animal models [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. A few other candidates have been evaluated: Favipiravir, a pyrazine derivative endowed of anti-influenza properties and Vandetanib, a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor. The use of corticosteroids, unfortunately, does not determine benefit and immunotherapy although it has given encouraging results; in preventing and treating human hantavirus infections, it remains challenging [
