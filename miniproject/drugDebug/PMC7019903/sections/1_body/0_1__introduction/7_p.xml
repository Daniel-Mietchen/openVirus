<p>In recent times, we described a series of 5,6-dichloro1(2)phenyl-benzotriazole derivatives that are active against te human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) in low micromolar range with low cytotoxicity (CC
 <sub>50</sub> &gt;100 ÂµM) and very high selectivity when analyzed on a wide panel of positive- and negative-sense single-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, and DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In order to further investigate if these derivatives are able to inhibit viral infection processes of other negative sense RNA virus families, we subjected them (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00122-f001">Figure 1</xref>) to a broad antiviral screening including the Hantaan virus (HTNV), a segmented RNA virus of the family Hantaviridae, for which there is currently no antiviral or approved vaccine.
