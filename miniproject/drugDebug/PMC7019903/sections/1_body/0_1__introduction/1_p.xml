<p>Orthohantaviruses are classified as emerging viruses that cause two life-threatening diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and orthohantaviruses pulmonary syndrome (HPS), also known as hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have also been discovered as carriers of these viruses that are transmitted to humans through the aerosol route. They are responsible for persistent infections without evident illness signs in their hosts [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The two diseases that are orthohantaviruses-related both induce an impressive rise in blood vessel permeability, strong immune responses and inflammation and viruses such as the Hantaan virus (HTNV) and Sin Nombre virus (SNV) are the causative agents. Although orthohantaviruses are distributed worldwide, HFRS and HCPS occur generally in Eurasia and the Americas, respectively [
