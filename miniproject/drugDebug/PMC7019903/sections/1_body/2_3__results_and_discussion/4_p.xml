<p>Derivative 2n, recently described by our research group as an interesting inhibitor of HRSV entry [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], showed a remarkable EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 4 µM against HTNV, resulting in being ten-fold more potent than RBV (EC
 <sub>50</sub> = 37 µM);
