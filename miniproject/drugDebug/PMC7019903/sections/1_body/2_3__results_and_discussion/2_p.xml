<p>Compounds 1a-c, 1e-j, 2a-n, 3f, 3j-n, and 4f, 4j-n, were evaluated for their potential inhibitory activity against HTNV using a chemiluminescence focus reduction assay (C-FRA). Three compounds (2j, 2l, 2n) showed interesting inhibitory activity (i.e., ≤5 µM; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00122-f003">Figure 3</xref>). In parallel, moderate to low cytotoxicity was detected for almost all compounds, with CC
 <sub>50</sub> values mostly in the high micromolar range (&gt;30 µM) against all tested cell lines (see
