<p>Vero-E6 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at an initial density of 4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Cell cultures were then infected and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 7 days in the absence or presence of serial dilutions of test compounds. The antiviral activity was determined by chemiluminescence focus reduction assay (C-FRA), as described previously [
 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00122" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] with small modifications. Briefly, after 7 days of incubation, overlay medium were discarded and cell monolayers were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 8 min at room temperature. After fixing, the methanol was removed, and the cells let dry. Cells were rinsed twice with washing buffer, and then a rabbit anti-Malacky antibody was added at 1:1000 dilution for 1 h at 37 °C in a humidified, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. Cells were then washed five times with washing buffer and a secondary goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was added for an additional hour in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> atmosphere. After washing five times with washing buffer cells were incubated with chemiluminescent substrate immediately before the detection. Infected cell foci were detected with the CCD camera for 3 min (or Chemidoc for 30 sec).
