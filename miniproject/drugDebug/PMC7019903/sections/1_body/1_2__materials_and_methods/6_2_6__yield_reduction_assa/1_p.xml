<p>Vero E6 cells were inoculated with HTNV at an m.o.i. of 0.05 in maintenance medium and tested compounds at non-cytotoxic concentrations. Following a 1-h adsorption period at 37 °C and 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> on a rocking platform, the inoculum was removed and replaced with fresh medium containing 20 µM concentration of compounds (2j, 2l, 2n). After 3 days, the cell supernatant was harvested and centrifuged (at 3000 rpm, at 4 °C, for 10 min) to remove debris and measured for the presence of infectious orthohantavirus hantavirus. The infectious progeny virus in the cell supernatant was evaluated by chemiluminescence focus reduction assay, as described above [
