<p>All compounds were generally endowed with low cytotoxicity against cell monolayers employed in our assays to support the replication of HTNV but also against a panel of cell cultures, as reported in SM2. We identified three promising lead compounds, derivatives 2j, 2l and 2n, characterized by interesting inhibitory activity against HTNV, in vitro ten-fold more potent than the nucleoside analogue RBV, currently the only antiviral with recognized in vitro and in vivo activity. This is the first report detailing benzotriazole anti-hantavirus activity. In conclusion, the therapeutic potential of these derivatives could be considered as a good starting point for the development of second-generation effective candidates for treatment against orthohantavirus infections. </p>
