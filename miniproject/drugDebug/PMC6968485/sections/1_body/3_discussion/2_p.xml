<p>In the determination of encapsulation efficiency of AMF-loaded micelles, the micelles were first diluted with methanol, then sonicated in water-bath, filtered by 0.22 μm nylon filter membrane, and injected for analysis. During the process, it was found that the encapsulation efficiency of micelles prepared by the same ratio and method was unstable, and the encapsulation efficiency of micelles prepared by different ratios was low. Because the method of micelles preparation was the same, it was speculated that nylon filter membranes had the sorption at different degrees to AMF. Therefore, after demulsification, the sample was centrifuged twice but not filtered.</p>
