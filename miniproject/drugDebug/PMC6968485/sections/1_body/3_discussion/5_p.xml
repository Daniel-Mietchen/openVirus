<p>In the experiments of cytotoxicity and cellular uptake, we found that the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of AMF-loaded mixed micelles was much lower than that of AMF monomers, but its cellular uptake was significantly lower than that of AMF. This result could be related with the cell response (motility increment) to the antineoplastic drug over the first 6 h of exposure (Cagel et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Or it may be related to the inhibition of some extracellular signaling pathways, such as NF-kappa B/MAPKs signaling pathway and Hedgehog/Glil signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Bao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), which resulted in the abnormal growth and differentiation of cells, thus causing cell death. Under laser confocal microscopy, it can be seen that after 4 h, the cell morphology incubated with mixed nanomicelles began to change significantly, and the change in cell viability affected the absorptive capacity of cells, resulting in less cellular uptake of mixed nanomicelles. In this case, the data confirmed that the novel AMF-loaded mixed micelles we prepared can have a toxic effect on cancer cells in a different way compared with most of the micelles (Bernabeu et al.,

 <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>; Ding et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Gileva et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>; Shishir et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). The factors such as cell type and density, particle size, surface modifying ligands, and surface properties can also affect cellular uptake (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>).
