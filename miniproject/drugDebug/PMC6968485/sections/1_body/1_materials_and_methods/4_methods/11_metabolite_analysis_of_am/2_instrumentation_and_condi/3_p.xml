<p>A Triple TOF™ 5600 system with Duo-Spray™ ion sources operating in the negative electrospray ionization mode was used for the detection. The optimized conditions of mass spectrometry as follows: ion source voltage −4.5 kV; ion source temperature, 550 °C; declustering potential (DP), 60 V; collision energy (CE), −40 V + 15 eV. Atomization gas (Gas 1, N2), heat gas (Gas 2, N2), and curtain gas pressure was 55 psi, 55 psi, and 35 psi, respectively. The parent ion and the daughter ion scanning range were 50–800 Da and 50–1000 Da, respectively. Data were collected in IDA mode, and an automated calibration delivery system (CDS) was used to calibrate the MS and MS/MS automatically. The data were collected using the Analyst TF 1.6.1 software for 25 min.</p>
