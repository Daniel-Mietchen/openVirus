<p>In the study, to analyze the results of cellular uptake more comprehensively, a visual qualitative analysis was carried out. The detail method was as follows: A549 cells with good growth status were seeded in 4× culture dishes at 1.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/well, cultured overnight at 37 °C for 24 h. Then the old medium was removed and washed with PBS for three times. Add the prepared culture medium with the drug concentration at 30 μg/mL, and continue to culture at 37 °C for 1 h, 2 h, 4 h and 6 h. The fluorescence intensity of cells was observed under the laser confocal microscope at different time points. The intensity of fluorescence represented the amount of drug intake.
