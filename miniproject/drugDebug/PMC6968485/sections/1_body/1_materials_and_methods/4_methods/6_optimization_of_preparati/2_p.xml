<p>Because the ratio of drugs and excipients has a great influence on the particle size, encapsulation efficiency, and drug loading of the micelle, the ratio of AMF and excipients was optimized in this experiment. Particle size, PDI, Zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were used as the indexes. The results are shown in
