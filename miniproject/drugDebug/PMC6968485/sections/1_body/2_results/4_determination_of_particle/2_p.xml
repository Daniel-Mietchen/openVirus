<p>Three batches of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus micelles were prepared according to the ratio of 1:10:30 (AMF:TPGS:soluplus). 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0002">Figure 2</xref> shows that the nanomicelles had an average particle size of 67.33 ± 2.01 nm with a PDI of 0.080667 ± 0.021008. The surface charge of AMF-loaded mixed micelles was neutral with zeta potential of 0.84133 ± 0.041405 mV. And the encapsulation efficiency and drug loading measured by HPLC were 99.18 ± 0.76% and 2.47 ± 0.01%, respectively.
