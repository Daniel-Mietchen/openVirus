<p>It can be seen from the CMC results that when the mass ratio of TPGS to soluplus was 1:3, the CMC value was the lowest, indicating that the micelle was the most stable. And it can be seen from 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> that when the proportion of soluplus was high, the CMC value of micelle was generally low. Therefore, according to previous experience, the mass ratio of TPGS and soluplus was optimized in this experiment, especially the amount of soluplus. The result is shown in 
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. When the ratio of AMF, TPGS, and soluplus was 1:10:30, 1:10:40, and 1:10:50, all the indexes were ideal. When the mass ratio was 1:10:30, encapsulation efficiency of the micelle was the highest and the consumption of auxiliary materials was relatively minimal. Therefore, in the principle of saving reagents and cost, the final ratio of 1:10:30 was selected for micelle preparation.
