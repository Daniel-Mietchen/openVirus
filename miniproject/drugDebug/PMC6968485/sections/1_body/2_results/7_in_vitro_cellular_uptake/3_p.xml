<p>As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, it could be seen that the cellular uptake of AMF and AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles had a clear trend of increase over time. And the cellular uptake of AMF was higher than that of mixed nanomicelles, which was consistent with our previous results. From 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0006">Figure 6</xref>, it can also be seen that in the samples incubated with AMF, the morphology of the cells did not change significantly with the extension of time, and the cells had not been lysed. But in the mixed nanomicelle incubated samples, the drug gradually entered the cells with the prolongation of time, and the cells tended to die. By 6â€‰h, it can be seen that the cells had obvious lysis and the drug was gradually released. The result also suggested that under the same drug concentration, the cytotoxicity of AMF was significantly lower than that of AMF-loaded TPGS/soluplus mixed micelles.
