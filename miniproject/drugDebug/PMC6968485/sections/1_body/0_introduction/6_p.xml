<p>In recent years, researchers have studied a large number of mixed micelles by combining the outstanding advantages of different types of single micelles (Jain &amp; Kumar, 
 <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Jiang et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). In this study, polyvinyl caprolactam–polyvinyl acetate–polyethylene glycol graft copolymer (soluplus) and 
 <sc>d</sc>-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate (TPGS) were used as carriers to prepare mixed micelles of AMF. Soluplus has good solubilization for the drugs with poor water solubility, and can reduce the critical micellar concentration (CMC) value (0.76 × 10–3% w/v) and increase the drug loading (Bernabeu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; Hou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). However, in recent years, there are few studies on soluplus to improve the solubility of drugs, so the research prospect of soluplus is very broad. TPGS is widely used in the preparation of pharmaceutical formulation products as solubilizing agent, granulation aid, emulsifying agent, surfactant, ointment base, and suspending agent in pharmaceuticals (Guo et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Koulouktsi et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). And there were also researches showed that it can inhibit the effect of P-gp, and promote cell apoptosis and show certain toxicity to cancer cells (Varma &amp; Panchagnula, 
 <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Neophytou et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Bernabeu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
