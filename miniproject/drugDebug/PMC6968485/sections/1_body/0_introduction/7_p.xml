<p>Nanoparticle drugs of oral administration have to overcome the mucosal diffusion barrier and epithelial absorption barrier except ensure their integrity in the gastrointestinal tract. This requires the particle surface relatively electro-neutral and have a particle size of less than 200 nm (Wu et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Therefore, this experiment was dedicated to the preparation of mixed nanomicelles with electro-neutral surface, a particle size of less than 200 nm, high solubility, and good stability. Due to its low content in nature, the current research on AMF was mainly limited to its pharmacological activity, less research on its 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> process, and no research on its preparation. Therefore, this experiment would fill the gaps in these aspects.
