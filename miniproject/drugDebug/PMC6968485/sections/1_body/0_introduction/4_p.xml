<p>As everyone knows, when a drug enters the body, a series of metabolites are produced, and then excreted in urine and feces. In the series of biotransformation processes, there are four aspects of pharmacological consequences: (1) transforming into inactive substances; (2) transforming the drug with no pharmacological activity into active metabolites; (3) changing the types of pharmacological actions of drugs; (4) producing toxic substances (Yuan et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Liao et al., 
 <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). Therefore, it plays an important role to study the changes of drugs

In this experiment, the metabolites of the biflavone were analyzed in detail, which laid a foundation for the pharmacological research and the development of new drugs.
