<p id="Par18">The mechanisms for the development of drug-induced lung diseases are almost unknown, but they are basically classified into the two following mechanisms: cytotoxic toxicity and allergic reaction (activation of immune system cells) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Drugs causing lung disease because of cytotoxic toxicity include anticancer drugs and antiarrhythmic drugs. The anticancer agent enters the lung along with the blood flow and causes direct cell damage by contact with the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries and the alveolar epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The allergic mechanism of drug-induced lung disease occurs with Chinese herbal medicines, antibacterial drugs, rheumatoid arthritis drugs, IFN, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, etc. Antigenicity in the allergic mechanism is acquired when the drug or its metabolite binds as a hapten to lung tissue or to proteins and polysaccharides in the blood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Since LDV/SOF is a weakly cytotoxic antiviral drug, we considered that the mechanism of drug-induced lung disease in this case was caused by the allergic mechanism. The onset time of drug-induced lung diseases is a few minutes to several years after administration. In general, the onset time is usually 2–3 weeks to 2–3 months after administration [
