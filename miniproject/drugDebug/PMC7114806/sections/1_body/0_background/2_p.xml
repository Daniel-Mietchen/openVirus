<p id="Par13">In the 7th edition of the HCV treatment guidelines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], DAAs are mentioned as first-choice drugs that are essential for the treatment of hepatitis C. Although treatment with IFN has shown adverse effects in almost all patients, treatment with DAAs has few adverse effects and the response to treatment is also good as indicated above. DAAs have been widely used in recent years. The incidence of adverse reactions after a single administration of LDV/SOF was 19.1% according to the results of a phase 3 trial in Japan [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and the breakdown was headache (3.1%) as the most common, followed by nausea and constipation/pruritus (2.4% each), and sores (1.7%). The incidence of interstitial pneumonia as an adverse effect is between ≥0.1 and &lt; 5% in the case of Interferon Alfa (NAMALWA) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] according to the package insert, and there have been reports for other IFNs. The only cases of interstitial lung disease as an adverse effect of DAAs were the spontaneous report of simeprevir sodium [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] used in combination with IFN and the simultaneous administration of daclatasvir hydrochloride and asunaprevir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. LDV/SOF does not specify interstitial lung disease as an adverse effect in its package insert [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In the early post-marketing phase vigilance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] of LDV/SOF, there were reports of interstitial lung disease in 4 out of 32,700 cases with death in 1 case; however, the onset mechanism of this adverse effect remains unknown. Here we report a case of hepatitis C in which LDV/SOF administration caused drug-induced lung disease.
