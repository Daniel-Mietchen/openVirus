  <p>Organisation of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) major IE enhancer and promoter (MIEP) and select protein factors involved in its regulation. The MIEP is composed of a core promoter containing a TATA-box and the crs that mediates repression by IE2, an enhancer with proximal and distal parts, a unique element and a modulator. Nucleotide positions relative to the transcription start sites and the direction of transcription (grey arrows) are indicated. “Leftward” transcription results in mRNAs encoding the IE1 and IE2 proteins (“rightward” transcription results in uncharacterized mRNAs containing the UL127 open reading frame). Transcription factors known or predicted to bind to the individual parts of the MIEP are shown above (repressors are shown in purple). Chromatin modifiers and histone tail modifications reported to activate or repress the MIEP are shown below. A few examples of virion components and cell signalling pathways known to activate the MIEP are shown at the left and right side, respectively, of the diagram.
