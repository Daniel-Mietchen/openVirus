<p>Clinical use of artesunate for management of drug-resistant HCMV infections in stem cell or solid organ transplant recipients is considered feasible due the documented anti-HCMV activity discussed above, favourable results in a rodent animal model study [
 <xref rid="B341-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">341</xref>] and the long and safe clinical history of artesunate treatment in malaria patients [
 <xref rid="B317-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>]. The first use of artesunate in a clinical setting was a success with artesunate being reported as an effective inhibitor of HCMV replication in the treated patient [
 <xref rid="B342-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">342</xref>]. However, subsequent studies reported either mixed success or that artesunate was ineffective in controlling HCMV infection [
 <xref rid="B343-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">343</xref>,
 <xref rid="B344-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">344</xref>,
 <xref rid="B345-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">345</xref>]. Further studies are required to fully determine the differences in clinical outcomes for artesunate-treated patients, and studies with more potent artesunate derivatives may hold future promise. For example, the trimeric derivative TF27 has recently been demonstrated to display antiviral efficacy in the mouse model. MCMV replication was significantly reduced and restricted to the site of infection, preventing organ dissemination without adverse effects [
