<p>The mechanism of action by which artesunate and the various derivatives generate their anti-HCMV activity has not been fully elucidated, but the general consensus is that artesunate primarily interferes with the NF-κΒ pathway [

 <xref rid="B326-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">326</xref>,
 <xref rid="B331-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">331</xref>]. The NF-κΒ pathway is stimulated upon HCMV infection and activates the MIEP, driving expression of IE proteins and hence subsequent steps in HCMV lytic replication and pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B339-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">339</xref>]. Indeed, artesunate, along with many derivatives, has been shown to block the IE phase of HCMV replication via a reduction in expression levels of IE2, and to a lesser extent IE1 [

 <xref rid="B331-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">331</xref>]. Interaction of artesunate with a host cell factor leads to the expectation that acquisition of drug resistance would be less likely; indeed, attempts to generate artesunate drug-resistant isolates in vitro have thus far been unsuccessful [
