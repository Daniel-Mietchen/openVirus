<p>A cell-based screen designed to monitor IE2 nuclear translocation was used to identify the cardiac glycoside convallatoxin discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6dot6-viruses-12-00110">Section 6.6</xref>. A second screening approach targeting IE2 gene expression utilized a reporter cell-line in which the IE2-activated HCMV TRL4 promoter drives luciferase expression [
 <xref rid="B361-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">361</xref>]. The reporter cell-line assay was used to screen a 9600 compound library for inhibitors of early phase HCMV infection [
 <xref rid="B361-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">361</xref>]. Two hit compounds arising from the screen, 1-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridyl)piperidine-4-carboxamide and 2,4-diamino-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyrimidine termed DPCC and 35C10, respectively, have been demonstrated to potently inhibit HCMV replication as effectively as GCV [
 <xref rid="B361-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">361</xref>,
 <xref rid="B372-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">372</xref>]. DPCC was also independently identified as having potent anti-HCMV activity in an unrelated high throughput screen designed to target IE1 IFN antagonist function (assay concept described in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec7dot2-viruses-12-00110">Section 7.2</xref>) [
 <xref rid="B373-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">373</xref>]. In this screen, DPPC was alternatively termed StA-IE1-3, and a further novel hit compound with similar anti-HCMV activity termed StA-IE1-2 (1-(3-nitrophenyl)-2-(pyrido[3,2-d][1,3]thiazol-2-ylthio)ethan-1-one) was also identified [
 <xref rid="B373-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">373</xref>]. All three structurally diverse compounds act after viral entry but before IE expression, with significantly decreased IE1 and IE2 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels [
 <xref rid="B361-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">361</xref>,
 <xref rid="B372-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">372</xref>,
 <xref rid="B373-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">373</xref>]. Like the majority of compounds that have been shown to inhibit HCMV IE gene expression, the precise mechanism of action of these three compounds has not been elucidated. However, it has been postulated that they may target a cellular transcription factor or upstream signalling protein required for activation of the HCMV MIEP [
