<p>In addition to directly repurposing known kinase inhibitors, a number of cell-based screens have been performed against various targeted kinase inhibitor compound libraries [
 <xref rid="B354-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">354</xref>,
 <xref rid="B355-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">355</xref>,
 <xref rid="B356-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">356</xref>,
 <xref rid="B357-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">357</xref>]. Compound-treated HCMV-infected cells were monitored for antiviral effects via expression of a green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter [
 <xref rid="B354-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">354</xref>] or late viral protein pp28 from the HCMV genome [
 <xref rid="B355-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">355</xref>,
 <xref rid="B356-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">356</xref>,
 <xref rid="B357-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">357</xref>]. These screens have identified a number of interesting kinase inhibitors with anti-HCMV activity against laboratory and clinical strains that target a variety of cellular kinases without causing significant cytotoxicity. The lack of kinase inhibitor target specificity has made full elucidation of mechanism of action challenging, although in all cases discussed here antiviral activity has been linked to interference with IE expression or protein production without affecting viral entry. Several c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitors were identified following a 600 compound kinase inhibitor library screen and the SP600125 inhibitor was shown to inhibit JNK activation and suppress IE gene transcription [
 <xref rid="B354-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">354</xref>]. XMD7 5-aminopyrazine compounds were identified upon screening of the Gray kinase inhibitor library. These compounds target a range of cellular protein kinases to inhibit HCMV replication via a reduction in genome-wide transcription and a defect in the production of certain HCMV proteins including IE2 (86kDa, 60kDa and 40kDa species) [
 <xref rid="B355-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">355</xref>]. The proposed mechanism of action for XMD7 compounds is consistent with IE2′s role as a viral transcriptional activator, but it is not clear why only a subset of HCMV proteins is affected. CMGC kinase inhibitor RO0504985, an oxindole compound with anti-HCMV activity identified by screening a Roche kinase inhibitor library, also inhibited IE2 and pp28 protein levels [
 <xref rid="B356-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">356</xref>]. Screening of the GlaxoSmithKline kinase inhibitor set identified SB-734117, a furazan benzimidazole compound, which inhibits several proteins from the AGC and CMCG kinase groups [
 <xref rid="B357-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">357</xref>]. SB-734117 inhibited IE protein production and reduced phosphorylation of host cell transcription factor CREB and histone H3. However, disappointingly these effects did not lead to any defects in transcription from the MIEP and thus the compound’s mechanism of action remains undetermined [
 <xref rid="B357-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">357</xref>]. Overall, the wealth of preexisting kinase inhibitors and accompanying knowledge offers good potential for the identification and development of novel anti-HCMV compounds.
