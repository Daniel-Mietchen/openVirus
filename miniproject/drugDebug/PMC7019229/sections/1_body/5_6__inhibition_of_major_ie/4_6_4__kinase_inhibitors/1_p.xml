<p>A general theme in host cell signalling pathway inhibitors is to target kinases, which mediate regulatory post-translational phosphorylation modifications of pathway components. There is an abundance of kinase inhibitors, which have been identified and developed for a wide range of applications particularly cancer treatment [
 <xref rid="B353-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">353</xref>], which can potentially be repurposed as anti-HCMV compounds. Indeed, examples of kinase inhibitors (AS602868, LY294002) with activity against HCMV have already been discussed in 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec6dot3-viruses-12-00110">Section 6.3</xref>. A further example of a kinase inhibitor repurposed for anti-HCMV testing is the multi-targeted anti-cancer tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib (Nexavar), which has been shown to inhibit MIEP activity, IE expression and also later stages of HCMV replication [
 <xref rid="B172-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. The mechanism by which sorafenib inhibits HCMV was not fully elucidated due to its multitude of known kinase targets. However, inhibition of RAF1 activation was implicated but via a mechanism independent of MAPK/ERK signalling [
 <xref rid="B172-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>]. Inhibitors of CDKs also have potential as antiviral drug candidates; for example, the CDK7 inhibitor LDC4297 blocked HCMV replication with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values in the nanomolar range [
 <xref rid="B175-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. The compoundâ€™s mode of action was concluded to be multifaceted but occurs at the level of IE gene expression and interferes with HCMV-mediated inactivation of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein, which controls progression through the G1 phase of the cell cycle via its phosphorylation state and ability to bind transcription factor complexes [
 <xref rid="B175-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. Promisingly, LDC4297 has been shown to possess in vivo antiviral activity in the mouse model. MCMV replication was significantly reduced and restricted to the site of infection, preventing organ dissemination without adverse effects [
