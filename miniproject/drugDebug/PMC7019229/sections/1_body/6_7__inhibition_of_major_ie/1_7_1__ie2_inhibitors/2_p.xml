<p>WC5′s unique activity offers the possibility to develop a new mechanistic class of anti-HCMV compounds. Towards this goal, WC5 potently and selectively inhibits HCMV replication in the sub-micromolar range irrespective of testing against laboratory or clinical isolates, and its activity is comparable to GCV [
 <xref rid="B376-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">376</xref>]. Unsurprisingly, given WC5′s novel mechanisms of action, the compound similarly inhibits isolates resistant to clinically approved anti-herpesvirus DNA polymerase inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B376-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">376</xref>]. Further, when WC5 is combined with GCV, synergistic activity against HCMV replication was observed without significant increases in cellular cytotoxicity [
 <xref rid="B374-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>]. WC5 also inhibits MCMV replication, albeit with ~10-fold lower activity compared to HCMV [
 <xref rid="B376-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">376</xref>]. Importantly, WC5′s mechanism of action against HCMV and MCMV appears to be conserved, as it has been shown to block MCMV early gene transactivation mediated by the MCMV IE2 homolog ie3 [
 <xref rid="B378-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">378</xref>]. Thus, it has been suggested that the murine model may be used to test WC5 activity in vivo as a prerequisite to clinical development [
 <xref rid="B378-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">378</xref>]. Structure–activity relationship studies have been conducted with the aim of improving WC5′s potency [
 <xref rid="B374-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">374</xref>,
 <xref rid="B379-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">379</xref>]. These studies gained insight into chemical groups required for WC5 activity, and identified an analogue with an improved selectivity index compared to WC5 without compromising antiviral activity. However, analogues with significantly improved potency were not identified [
 <xref rid="B379-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">379</xref>].
