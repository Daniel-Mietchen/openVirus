<p>IE1 confers increased type I IFN resistance to HCMV [
 <xref rid="B225-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>]. This phenotype was largely attributed to nuclear complex formation between IE1 and STAT2 depending on amino acids 410–420 in the presumably disordered “acidic domain” of the viral protein downstream from the central core domain and upstream of the CTD [

 <xref rid="B226-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. The IE1-STAT2 interaction causes reduced sequence-specific DNA binding by ISGF3 and diminished activation of type I ISGs (e.g., CXCL10, IFIT2, ISG15, MX1) [

 <xref rid="B266-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. The C-terminal part of IE1 has also been reported to disrupt type II ISG activation by STAT1 homodimers, although IE1 is not believed to bind to STAT1 directly (only indirectly via STAT heterodimers) [

 <xref rid="B267-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">267</xref>]. The ability of IE1 to inhibit type I ISG induction via STAT2 interaction facilitates HCMV replication and appears to be conserved among IE1 homologs of other betaherpesviruses [

 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot3-viruses-12-00110">Section 3.3</xref>) may also contribute to the inhibition of ISG induction during HCMV infection [
