<p>IE2 is not known to interact with STAT family members, but this protein limits HCMV-induced expression of antiviral cytokine and proinflammatory chemokine genes (e.g., IFNB1, CCL3, CCL5, CCL8, CXCL8, CXCL9) [

 <xref rid="B271-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>]. A very recent report has also shown that IE2 targets interleukin 1 beta (IL1B) at both the transcript and protein level [
 <xref rid="B272-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. The underlying mechanism appears to involve inhibition of virus- or tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced binding of NF-κB to the IFN-β promoter, resulting in attenuated target gene expression [
 <xref rid="B273-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>]. Another recent report has demonstrated that IE2 inhibits IFN-β promoter activation induced by STING, a critical sensor of intracellular DNA and adaptor for type I IFN signalling. IE2 facilitated the proteasome-dependent degradation of STING and inhibited cGAMP-mediated induction of IFNB1 and CXCL10 [
 <xref rid="B274-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">274</xref>]. Taken together, these studies suggest that IE2 targets STING (and likely other proteins) post-translationally resulting in inhibition of NF-κB-dependent induction of cytokine and chemokine genes relevant to the innate immune response to HCMV infection.
