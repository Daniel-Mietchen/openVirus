<p>IE2 is known to bind sequence-specifically to DNA, but there is no convincing evidence for direct DNA binding by IE1 [

 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. However, IE1 associates with chromatin via core histones. IE1 exhibits two physically separable histone interacting regions with differential binding specificities for H2A-H2B dimers and H3-H4 dimers or tetramers. The H2A-H2B binding region was mapped to an evolutionarily conserved nucleosome binding motif (amino acids 479â€“488) within the chromatin tethering domain (CTD) at the C-terminus [

 <xref rid="B230-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. This motif docks with the acidic patch formed by H2A-H2B on the nucleosome surface [

 <xref rid="B230-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. The consequences of the IE1-nucleosome interaction have not been fully elucidated, but they appear to include alterations to higher order chromatin structure [
 <xref rid="B230-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">230</xref>]. Histone binding by IE1 might also be linked to the overall low nucleosome levels and temporal reorganization of nucleosomes across viral genomes observed during productive HCMV infection [
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B105-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. To our knowledge, transcriptional regulation via the IE1 CTD has not been experimentally addressed. Instead, it has been reported that IE1x4, a small variant form of IE1 expressed from a promoter internal to major IE exon 4, facilitates viral genome maintenance and replication during HCMV latency via a CTD-dependent mechanism. Despite a lack of experimental evidence, the mechanism is predicted to involve HCMV episome tethering to host mitotic chromosomes via nucleosome binding by IE1x4 resulting in nuclear retention and partitioning of viral genomes across latently infected dividing cells [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Although IE2 appears to have relatively little affinity for histones, both IE proteins have been shown to be present in complexes with nucleosome modifying host cell proteins. For example, IE1 binds to histone deacetylase (HDAC) 3 [
 <xref rid="B124-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>], while IE2 binds to HDAC1-3 [

 <xref rid="B231-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">231</xref>], lysine acetyltransferases CREB binding protein (CBP, KAT3A), p300 (KAT3B) and p300/CBP-associated factor (KAT2B) [

 <xref rid="B233-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>], and lysine methyltransferases G9A (euchromatic histone lysine methyltransferase 2, EHMT2) and suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 1 (SUV39H1) [
 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Accordingly, transcriptional activation of viral IE and early genes by IE1 correlates with histone acetylation, while transcriptional repression of the MIEP by IE2 involves histone deacetylation and methylation [
