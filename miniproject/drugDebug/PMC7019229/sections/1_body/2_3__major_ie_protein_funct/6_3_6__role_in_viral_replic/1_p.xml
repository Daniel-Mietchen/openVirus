<p>Various highly differentiated cell types including primary human fibroblasts are susceptible to HCMV infection and permissive for viral replication. The importance of IE1 in the viral productive cycle was first highlighted by studying laboratory-adapted high passage HCMV strains (Towne/Toledo and Towne) from which major IE exon 4 had been specifically deleted. Mutant virus replication in fibroblasts was (almost) normal at high but profoundly impaired at low multiplicity of infection [

 <xref rid="B219-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. The IE1-specific phenotype was eventually attributed to a broad reduction in viral early gene expression and a failure to form replication compartments [
