<p>Consistent with its presence during the very early stages of HCMV infection, IE1, along with several viral tegument proteins, has been recognized as a viral antagonist of cellular intrinsic immunity [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Specifically, IE1 has been shown to target three restriction factors based in nuclear organelles known as PML bodies (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec2dot1-viruses-12-00110">Section 2.1</xref>): PML (tripartite motif 19) proteins, SP100A and DAXX. Although various activities have been linked to these restriction factors, they all seem to mediate transcriptional repression of HCMV gene expression in part via chromatin-based mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>,
 <xref rid="B237-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">237</xref>]. Both IE1 orthologues of animal cytomegaloviruses as well as HCMV IE1 were shown to associate with DAXX [

 <xref rid="B239-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">239</xref>,
 <xref rid="B240-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. The sites of interaction in the two proteins have not been mapped, and it remains unclear whether binding is direct. However, transcriptional activation of the HCMV latent undefined nuclear antigen (LUNA) gene depends on relief from DAXX-mediated repression conferred by IE1 [
 <xref rid="B238-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. Most of the proteins IE1 targets remain metabolically stable, but a subset appears to be subject to proteolytic degradation [
 <xref rid="B241-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>,
 <xref rid="B242-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>,
 <xref rid="B243-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. IE1 was shown to interact physically with the N-terminal domain of SP100A and to target the restriction factor for degradation via the proteasome. This finding explains the loss of SP100 observed in the late phase of productive HCMV infection [
 <xref rid="B241-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">241</xref>,
 <xref rid="B242-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>,
 <xref rid="B244-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">244</xref>]. The relevance of IE1-mediated SP100 degradation for HCMV replication remains to be determined. Finally, it has been established that IE1 binds to PML proteins via its central core domain (amino acids 25–378) predicted to exhibit an all α-helical, femur-shaped fold [

 <xref rid="B245-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">245</xref>]. This interaction appears to interfere with PML oligomerization and de novo poly-SUMOylation [
 <xref rid="B203-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>,
 <xref rid="B246-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">246</xref>,
 <xref rid="B247-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">247</xref>,
 <xref rid="B248-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">248</xref>]. SUMOylated PML isoforms are the central organizers of PML bodies, and inhibition of SUMOylation by IE1 correlates with organelle disruption resulting in diffuse nuclear distribution of the associated restriction factors [
 <xref rid="B203-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>,
 <xref rid="B249-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>,

 <xref rid="B251-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. The loss of PML body integrity adds an additional layer to inhibition of intrinsic immunity by IE1 that extends beyond the mere targeting of individual restriction factors. Despite limited experimental evidence, PML targeting and disruption of PML bodies are considered to be key to IE1 function and HCMV replication, especially at low multiplicity of infection [
