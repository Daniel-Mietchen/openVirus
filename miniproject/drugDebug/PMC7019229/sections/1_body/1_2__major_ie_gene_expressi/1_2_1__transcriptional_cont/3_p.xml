<p>Histone deacetylases, histone demethylases and other proteins conferring repressive histone modifications to HCMV chromatin may be considered components of the intrinsic cellular immune system also known as restriction factors [
 <xref rid="B132-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Many of the best known restriction factors for HCMV reside in nuclear organelles referred to as nuclear domain 10 or promyelocytic leukaemia (PML) bodies [
 <xref rid="B133-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>,
 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>,
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. While PML bodies may confer transcriptional repression as a whole, constituents of these organelles including alpha thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked protein (ATRX), death domain-associated protein (DAXX), PML protein and SP100 nuclear antigen have been shown or proposed to act as repressors of major IE gene expression in part via chromatin-based mechanisms [
 <xref rid="B136-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>,
 <xref rid="B137-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>,
 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. More recently, cellular proteins that mediate foreign or damaged DNA sensing and signalling, including cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase, interferon (IFN) gamma-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) and stimulator of IFN genes (STING), have been identified as restriction factors of HCMV and other DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B139-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. These proteins are known or predicted to restrict IE transcription, at least indirectly, although IFI16 may activate rather than repress the MIEP [
 <xref rid="B143-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>,
