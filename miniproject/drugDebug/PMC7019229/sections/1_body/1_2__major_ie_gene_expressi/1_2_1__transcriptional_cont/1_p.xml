<p>The outcome of HCMV infection is believed to depend largely on the level and timing of expression from the major IE gene [

 <xref rid="B72-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>,
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This is the first viral gene to be transcribed following initial infection, and likely during reactivation from latency, in a process that does not require de novo viral protein synthesis [

 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Expression of the major IE gene is highly dynamic with transcription levels ranging from extremely high to negligibly low depending on the type and differentiation or activation state of the infected cell. While productive HCMV infection is linked to activated transcription, viral latency is characterized by transcriptional repression at this gene. The major IE gene is located in the unique long (UL) segment of the viral genome, close to the internal repeat elements. The organization of this gene is unusually complex, not just by viral standards, as multiple promoters and numerous transcripts including both sense and antisense RNAs have been identified in this region [

 <xref rid="B83-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Some of these promoters appear to have a specific role during latent infection or reactivation from latency [

 <xref rid="B84-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, the combined major IE enhancer and promoter (MIEP) is considered the principal driver of IE transcription during productive HCMV infection. It contains an extremely strong enhancer which has been widely utilized in heterologous expression systems. The MIEP is bidirectional and has been roughly divided into four functional entities: a core promoter (+1 to −40 nucleotides from the transcription start site), an enhancer (−40 to −550 nucleotides), a unique region (−550 to −750 nucleotides) and a modulator (−750 to −1140 nucleotides) [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00110-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The modulator’s role is largely unknown, although a cell-type specific regulatory function has been suggested [

 <xref rid="B89-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. “Rightward” transcription from the MIEP is suppressed by the unique region which binds cellular homeobox proteins and appears to function as an insulator between the enhancer and UL127 [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00110-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The core promoter is sufficient, yet not required, for low-level transcription to the “leftward” direction of the major IE gene [

 <xref rid="B96-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. It contains a TATA-box as well as the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-repressive sequence (crs) that serves as a binding site for IE2 dimers (see 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec3dot1-viruses-12-00110">Section 3.1</xref>). The enhancer hugely augments transcription from the major IE gene, in part via a number of small 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting repeat sequences (18-bp, 19-bp and 21-bp), and is required for viral replication. It may be further divided into proximal and distal enhancer halves (−40 to −300 nucleotides and −300 to −550 nucleotides, respectively) that differ in structural makeup, yet function jointly by contributing multiple 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements to provide efficient MIEP activation and viral replication. Accordingly, a long list of activating cellular transcription factors have been shown or proposed to bind to the 
 <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the enhancer, unique region and modulator. In addition, binding of several repressive cellular transcription factors to the enhancer and modulator has been reported (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00110-f001">Figure 1</xref>). The vast number of transcription factors that may activate or repress the MIEP is thought to account for much of the highly dynamic expression observed at the major IE gene [
