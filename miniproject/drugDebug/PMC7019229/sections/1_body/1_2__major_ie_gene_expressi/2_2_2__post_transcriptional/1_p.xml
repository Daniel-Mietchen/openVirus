<p>The primary transcript derived from the MIEP is subject to extensive regulation at the post-transcriptional and translational level. It undergoes alternative splicing and polyadenylation to generate multiple mRNA species assigned to either the IE1 or IE2 family [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. This differential post-transcriptional regulation is believed to involve the cellular 65-kDa U2-associated factor and ubiquitin-dependent segregase valosin containing protein p97 [

 <xref rid="B187-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. RNA sequencing showed increased IE1 and decreased IE2 splicing following p97 knockdown [
 <xref rid="B187-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>]. The processed IE1 and IE2 mRNAs accumulate with different kinetics and share the first three exons [

 <xref rid="B188-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>]. However, IE1 mRNAs contain exon 4 while IE2 mRNAs contain exon 5 sequences.
