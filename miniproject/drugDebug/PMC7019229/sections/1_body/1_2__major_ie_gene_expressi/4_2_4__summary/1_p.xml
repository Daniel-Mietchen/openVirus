<p>Highly complex interactions between a multitude of cellular and viral components at the level of DNA, chromatin and upstream signalling pathways determine the initiation and magnitude of transcription from the HCMV MIEP. The highly dynamic transcription from the major IE gene is complemented by post-transcriptional processing and translational regulation, ultimately controlling the synthesis of the IE1 and IE2 families of predominantly nuclear proteins. The major IE proteins are subject to post-translational regulation and are thought to activate the viral replicative cycle during both initial infection and reactivating from latency. It is therefore believed that the eventual outcome of HCMV infection depends on the level and timing of IE1 and IE2 expression.</p>
