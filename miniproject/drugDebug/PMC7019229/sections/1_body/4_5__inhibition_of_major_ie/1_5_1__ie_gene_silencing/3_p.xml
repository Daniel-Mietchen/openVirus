<p>RNA interference (RNAi) offers an alternative approach to targeting IE gene expression. RNAi is a cellular gene-silencing pathway that results in sequence-specific degradation of the target mRNA via complementary short-interfering (siRNA) molecules. Various siRNA or short-hairpin RNA (shRNA, processed into siRNA) molecules targeting IE1/2 mRNA have been shown to cause significant inhibitory effects on HCMV replication in cell culture. These antiviral effects correlated with reductions in IE1/2 mRNA and protein levels [

Treatment of cells with IE-targeted siRNA after HCMV infection resulted in a modest antiviral effect; this is a valuable observation as therapeutic treatment of patients after establishment of HCMV infection would be an important clinical application [
