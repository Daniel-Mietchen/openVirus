<p>HCMV is the cause of an ongoing “silent pandemic” affecting 40% to 100% of people in populations around the world. Co-evolution over millions of years has resulted in latent or low-level productive HCMV infection that persists for the life of the host in the absence of major disease symptoms. This type of persistence is due to a fine-tuned balance between our intrinsic, innate and adaptive immune responses and manifold viral countermeasures. Developmental or acquired immune system defects disrupt the delicate balance between virus and host and can result in severe disease outcomes. HCMV infection is the most common congenital (present at birth) infection worldwide, with an estimated incidence in developed countries between 0.6% and 0.7% of all live births. This incidence results in approximately 60,000 neonates born every year with congenital HCMV infection in the United States and the European Union combined [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00110" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since congenital HCMV infection parallels maternal seroprevalence, the estimated incidence in developing countries is even higher, between 1% and 5% of all live births [

More than 10% of congenitally infected children will suffer neurodevelopmental damage and other disorders present at birth or long-term sequelae including hearing loss. Consequently, HCMV has been recognized as a leading cause of birth defects. HCMV reactivation from latency or primary infection also remain a major source of morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed individuals including recipients of solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell allografts, people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and other critically ill patients. For example, HCMV infections are diagnosed in roughly 50% of all allograft recipients [
