<p id="Par4">Two key advances in the 1980s — genome sequencing and structure-based drug design — then facilitated a new approach to targeting viral enzymes, guided by rational design. Efforts to elucidate the HIV life cycle, aided by the genome sequence of the virus, revealed that a virally encoded aspartyl protease was crucial in viral replication. Specific design of protease inhibitors based on the transition-state peptidomimetic principle — replacement of the peptide linkage by a non-cleavable bond — and aided by structures of the protease ultimately led to the introduction of HIV protease inhibitors in the mid-1990s. The combination of these drugs with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors began the era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), transforming HIV infection from a death sentence to a chronically manageable disease.</p>
