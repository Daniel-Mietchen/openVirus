<p id="Par6">Meanwhile, the development of drugs against other viruses has also progressed considerably, mirroring some of the themes seen in the development of anti-HIV drugs. For example, in the early 1990s, 'transition-state' mimicry also inspired the design of influenza virus neuraminidase (also known as sialidase) inhibitors, which are currently the mainstay of pharmacological defences against an influenza pandemic. Also, the compounds and treatment strategies developed for HIV could be considered as a paradigm for the development of similar approaches for the treatment of other viral infections, in particular hepatitis C virus (HCV). Although HCV is fundamentally different to HIV, several classes of drugs targeting viral enzymes — in this case HCV RNA replicase and HCV serine protease — might one day be combined in a way similar to those targeting HIV reverse transcriptase and the HIV aspartyl protease. Importantly, for HCV, combination of antiviral drugs with immunomodulatory interferons may eradicate the infection, something that still seems a distant goal for HIV therapy.</p>
