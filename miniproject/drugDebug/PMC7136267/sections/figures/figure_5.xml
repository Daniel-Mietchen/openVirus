  <p>Apoptotic effect of the extracted pigments on human cancer cells. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The apoptosis percentages in pigment- and 5-FU-treated cancer cells after staining with annexin and propidium iodide relative to the percentages in untreated cancer cells with (
   <bold>B</bold>) Dot plot flow charts of the untreated and treated cancer cells. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Fluorescence images of pigment-treated cancer cells compared with those of 5-FU-treated cancer cells and untreated cancer cells after staining with acridine orange and ethidium bromide and investigation using fluorescence microscopy (green, yellowish-orange, and red fluorescence indicates viable, early apoptotic and late apoptotic cells, respectively) (magnification ×200). (
   <bold>D</bold>) The superior potency of pigments relative to 5-FU as caspase 3/7 activators in the treated Caco-2 cells. (

   <sub>50</sub> values reflecting the inhibitory effect of pigments and 5-FU on matrix metalloprotease (MMP) 9. All data are expressed as the mean ± SE with significance (unpaired t-test analysis) at p-value &lt; 0.05*, &lt;0.005**, &lt;0.0005***.
