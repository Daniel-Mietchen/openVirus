 <caption> Anti-HCV and anti-HBV activity of the extracted pigments. ( A) The viral clearance percentages in HCV- and HBV-infected peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) after treatment with pigments or standard viral drugs (sofosbuvir and lamivudine for HCV and HBV, respectively) at their safe doses (these percentages were estimated elative to those in untreated infected PBMCs). ( B) IC 50 values of pigments and standard viral drugs for inhibition of HCV-NS5B polymerase and DNA-dependent HBV polymerase. All data are expressed as the mean ± SE with significance (unpaired t-test analysis) at p-value &lt; 0.05*, &lt;0.005**, &lt;0.0005***. </caption>
