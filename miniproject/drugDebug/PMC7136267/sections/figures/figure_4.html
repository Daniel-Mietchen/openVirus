 <caption> Cytotoxicity effect of the extracted pigments on human normal and cancer cells. ( A) EC 50 and EC 100 (µg/ml) of pigment extract and the currently used chemotherapy agent (5-FU) towards the human normal cell line (Wi-38) and ( B) their IC 50 (µg/ml) values against four human cancer cell lines. ( C) Selectivity index (SI) of pigments against cancer cells compared with that of 5-FU. ( D) Variation in the morphology of normal and cancer cells after treatment with the extracted pigments and 5-FU (magnification ×200). All data are expressed as the mean ± SE with significance (unpaired t-test analysis) at p-value &lt; 0.05*, &lt;0.005**, &lt;0.0005***. </caption>
