<p id="Par19">The HCV and HBV are the common public types of hepatitis that lead to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The prevalence rate of HCV or HBV is above 150 million patients worldwide. The therapeutic target for HCV and HBV is blocking viral replication without any side effects on normal cells, so novel safe natural products are urgently needed

 </sup>. More interestingly, the present study explored the potent antiviral activity of the extracted carotenoids against HCV and HBV by inhibiting HCV NS5B polymerase and HBV DNA-dependent DNA polymerase which eventually suppresses HCV and HBV replication. The latter effect was indicated by the increased clearance percentage of both viruses after treatment of the infected PBMCs with pigment in comparison with that after treatment with currently used antiviral drugs
