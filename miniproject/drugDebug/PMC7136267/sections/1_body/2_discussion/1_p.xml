<p id="Par16">Haloarchaea, such as 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp., are good candidates for carotenoid production at a large scale. In addition, they have the advantage of inexpensive production and short culture processing times. Due to the lack of studies on the benefits of the carotenoids produced by haloarchaea 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. On human health, more efforts should be made to answer the rising questions about the pharmacological importance of its metabolites. In the current study, maximal carotenoid production was attained using old cultures of 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6, where the pH was adjusted to 9–11. Pigments are usually produce as a secondary metabolites, thus it is noteworthy that old cultures showed a significant increase in the production of archaeal carotenoid

 </sup>. Moreover, Rodriguez-Valera 
 <italic>et al</italic>., reported a variation of pigmentation according to the salt concentration of the medium in the genus Halobacterium
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>
 </sup>. Thus, NaCl, pH and culture age were further investigated as significant independent variables in a Box-Behnken design to identify the optimum response region for carotenoid biosynthesis in 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6. Then, a second-order polynomial function was fitted to correlate the relationship between the variables and the responses to them. The results indicated that the optimal levels of the three factors were 25% NaCl, pH 10.07, and 11-day-old culture. Sikkander 
 <italic>et al</italic>. used a Box-Behnken design to determine the optimum factors affecting carotenoid production by 
 <italic>Halorubrum</italic> sp. TBZ126, and the estimated coefficients and the corresponding 
 <italic>p</italic>-values indicated that X1 (temperature), X2 (pH) and X3 (salinity) were significant factors for both cell growth and carotenoid production by this strain

 </sup>. After extraction, the orange pigment in this study was characterized using FTIR, Raman spectroscopy, GC-MS, LC-MS and NMR methods. An analysis of the resultant peaks identified a carotenoid structure due to the the presence of olefinic proton in aromatic and aliphatic region and compounds with molecular masses close to those of oxygenated C
 <sub>50</sub> compounds with methyl groups (CH
 <sub>3</sub>) and conjugated double bonds. In turn, this result supports the notion that the isolated compounds are related to the xanthophyll carotenoid pigments that consist of oxygenated hydrocarbons with alternating single and double bond and exhibit yellow to orange colour. Various pigments, including phytoene, β-carotene, lycopene and salinixanthin carotenoids, are produced by 
 <italic>Halobacterium salinarum</italic>

 </sup>. According to Torregrosa-Crespo 
 <italic>et al</italic>., the caretenoids produced by haloarchaeo are Astaxanthin C
 <sub>40</sub>H
 <sub>52</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub>, Lutein C
 <sub>40</sub>H
 <sub>56</sub>O
 <sub>2</sub>, Canthaxanthin C

 <sub>50</sub>H
 <sub>76</sub>O
 <sub>4</sub> and Salinixanthin C
 <sub>61</sub>H
 <sub>92</sub>O
 <sub>9</sub>

 </sup>, but no records for the production of the compound found in this study which contains C
 <sub>40</sub>H
 <sub>56</sub>O
 <sub>10</sub> so far. Therefore, this compound is considered unique and specific for this strain and may be related to carotenoids due to the presence of olefinic proton. In addition Torregrosa-Crespo 
 <italic>et al</italic>., reported that there are no examples of a large-scale production of these caretenoids from haloarchae.
