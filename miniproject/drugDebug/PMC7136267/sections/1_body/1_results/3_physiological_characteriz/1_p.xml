<p id="Par7">After seven days incubation, the growth of 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 (g/L) was recorded in reference to NaCl concentration, pH and temperature variation (data not shown). The bacterium failed to grow in absence or presence of 10%, 1.71 M NaCl and the maximum growth (6.9 g) was achieved in presence of 15%, 2.55 M NaCl and declined thereafter. Medium adjusted to pH 7 and 8 supported low growth, which increased gradually with pH increase reaching the maximum value (6 g) at pH 10, while higher pH values (11 and 12) caused a remarkable decrease in growth. The bacterium coded M6 appeared to favor growth in a range of temperature (37–50 °C) and recorded the best (7.5 g) at 45 °C.
