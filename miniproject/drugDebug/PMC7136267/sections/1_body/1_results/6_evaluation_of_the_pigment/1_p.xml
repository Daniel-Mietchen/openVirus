<p id="Par11">To evaluate the hemolytic effect of the extracted pigment, it was incubated with human red blood cells (RBCs). Then the released hemoglobin was quantified at its serial concentrations to estimate doses (EC
 <sub>100</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub>) that did not cause any hemolysis and 50% hemolysis, respectively, relative to the untreated RBCs. We found that 0.792 ± 0.058 mg/ml of the prepared pigment was safe without generating any hemolysis while 4.699 ± 0.0706 mg/ml of it ruptured RBCs by 50%.
