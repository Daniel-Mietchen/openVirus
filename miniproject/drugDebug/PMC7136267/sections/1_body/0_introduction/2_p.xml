<p id="Par3">Carotenoids are lipid-soluble pigments that vary in colour between yellow, orange, and red. Carotenoids are classified based on the number of carbons in their backbones into the categories C
 <sub>30</sub>, C
 <sub>40</sub> and C
 <sub>50</sub>. Most carotenoids exist as a C
 <sub>40</sub> structure in different living organisms, including bacteria, archaea, fungi, algae, and plants

 </sup>. Meanwhile, haloarchaea can produce C
 <sub>50</sub> bacterioruberin (BR), a rare carotenoid form that contains four hydroxyl groups

 </sup>. These pigments are divided into two major groups: xanthophylls (molecules containing oxygen), such as lutein and zeaxanthin, and carotenes (nonoxygenated molecules), such as Î±-carotene and lycopene

 </sup>. The presence of carotenoids in the membrane of archaeal cells may help cells adapt to hypersaline environments by acting as a water barrier and allowing ions and oxygen molecules to permeate through the cell membrane. Additionally, BR protects bacteria from damage under intensive light and against free radical- and UV-mediated oxidative DNA damage

 </sup>. Therefore, these carotenoids can stabilize archaeal cells under high osmotic and oxidative stresses

 </sup>. The biological function of carotenoids is mostly attributed to their antioxidant properties that protect cells from oxidative damage; consequently, they improve human health
