<p id="Par2">Halophilic archaea (haloarchaea) belong to the family Halobacteriaceae. This family includes a group of microorganisms that are able to live in hypersaline environments with high salt concentrations (up to 4 M), such as solar salterns, salt lakes and salt deposits

 </sup>. Interestingly, these organisms have received increasing attention due to their ability to produce a plethora of compounds with potential applications in many fields of biotechnology, including salt-tolerant enzymes, biodegradable polyesters, exopolysaccharides, antimicrobial halocins, biosurfactants, and photon-driven retinal protein

 <italic>Natrialba</italic> is an organism in our research that belongs to the Halobacteriaceae family. However, the genus has recently been reassigned to the novel family Natrialbaceae
