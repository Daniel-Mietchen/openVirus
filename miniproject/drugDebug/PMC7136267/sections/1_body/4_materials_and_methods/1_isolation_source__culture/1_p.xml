<p id="Par21">Isolation samples were collected from Egyptian- extreme environment Wadi El-Natrun (salinities ranging from 1.5 to 5 M NaCl, pH values between 8.5 and 11and temperature up to 50 °C. The culture medium used in this study was prepared using distilled water. The pH was adjusted to 11 using Na

 </sup>. Biochemical screening for the obtained isolates was carried out in respect to different biocatalyst, biosurfactant and pigment production. Thereafter, an extremely haloalkaliphilic archaeon coded as M6 and isolated from El-Hamra Lake, Wadi El-Natrun, Egypt, was employed in this study.
