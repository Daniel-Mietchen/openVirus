<p id="Par46">The BBD data were subjected to multiple linear regressions to estimate the 
 <italic>t</italic>-value, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value and confidence level. The significance level (
 <italic>p</italic>-value) was determined using the 
 <italic>t</italic>-test. If this probability is sufficiently small, the idea that an effect was caused by varying the level of the variable under examination is accepted. Optimal values of the dedicated responseÂ were estimated using the 
 <italic>solver</italic> function of Microsoft Excel tools. The simultaneous effects of the three most significant independent factors were generated by 
 <italic>Statistica</italic> 5.0 software. The optimal conditions obtained were verified experimentally and then compared to the data calculated from the model.
