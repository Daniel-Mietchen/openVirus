 </sup> using an Agilent Technologies GC equipped with a mass selective detector, HP-5MS. A 5% phenyl methyl siloxane capillary column with dimensions of 30.0 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm was used, and helium was used as the carrier gas at 1 ml/min. The column temperature was programmed to initially be 90 °C for 1 min, followed by an increase at 8 °C/min to 205 °C, then 5 °C/min to 240 °C, and then 8 °C/min to 300 °C. The MS instrument was operated at 70 eV. The constituents were identified by a comparison of their mass spectral data with those of standard compounds from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Spectral Library.
