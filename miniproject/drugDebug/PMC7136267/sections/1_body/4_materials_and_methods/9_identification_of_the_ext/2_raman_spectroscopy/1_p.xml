<p id="Par30">A Raman Senterra instrument with a multiwavelength capability operating at 785 nm with a power of 50 mW and the wide range of 400–4000 cm
 <sup>−1</sup> was used to measure the effect of the excitation wavelength on the pigment spectrum. A laser irradiated an object in an optical microscope (laser spot = 2 µm), and the scattered light from the sample was collected by the optics of the microscope passing through holographic filters, a pinhole, and a monochromator to be detected by a charge-coupled device (CCD).
