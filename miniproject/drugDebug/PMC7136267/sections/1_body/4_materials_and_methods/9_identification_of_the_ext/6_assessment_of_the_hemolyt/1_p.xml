 </sup>. After collecting human blood in the heparin tube, it was centrifuged then the packed RBCs were harvested, washed and diluted with phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The diluted RBC suspension was mixed with the serial concentrations of the tested pigment. PBS and water were used instead of pigment as negative and positive controls, respectively. After 2 h incubation at 37 °C and centrifugation, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 540 nm. The percent of hemolysis was calculated then both doses (EC
 <sub>100</sub> and IC
 <sub>50</sub>) that cause 0% and 50% hemolysis, respectively, were estimated using the Graphpad Instat software.
