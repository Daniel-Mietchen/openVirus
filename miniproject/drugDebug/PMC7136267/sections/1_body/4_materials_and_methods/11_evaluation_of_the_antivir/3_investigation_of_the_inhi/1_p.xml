 </sup>. In brief, the assay is based on incubating an HCV-NS5B (genotype 1b-Con1)-Δ21-His 6 enzyme with heteropolymerically modified (at its 3′-end with dideoxycytidine) RNA template and radiolabelled nucleotide. Incorporation of the radiolabelled nucleotide was quantified in the presence and absence of serial concentrations of the studied pigment or standard anti-HCV drug using the TopCount NXT microplate scintillation counter (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA).
