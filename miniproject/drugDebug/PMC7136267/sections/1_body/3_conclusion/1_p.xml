<p id="Par20">We suggest here for the first time that the extracted pigment from 
 <italic>Natrialba</italic> sp. M6 (ac: MK063890) could be a new component against both cancer and viral hepatitis. This studied pigment not only exhibited caspase-induced apoptotic effects in cancer cells at noncytotoxic doses but also suppressed MMP-9-mediated cancer progression. Furthermore, this pigment was able to inhibit polymerase-dependent HCV and HBV replication. Therefore, the impact of this pigment on the other main mediators of metastatic cancer and viral hepatitis (particularly HCV) will need further investigation using animal models.
