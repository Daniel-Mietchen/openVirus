<p>Prevention and treatment of CMV infection and disease after solid organ transplant and HSCT is accomplished with use of antiviral drugs. Antiviral treatment is often complemented by reduction, if feasible, of drug-induced immunosuppression. The three antiviral drugs that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CMV treatment are the nucleoside analog GCV, and its valine-ester prod-rug valganciclovir (VGCV), the nucleotide analog CDV, and the pyrophosphate analog PFA. These three antiviral drugs are highly active against CMV, but their use is often associated with adverse effects.

 <xref rid="b9-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> For example, treatment with GCV (and VGCV), which are the workhorses for management of CMV after transplantation, is commonly complicated by bone marrow suppression that limits its use particularly as prophylaxis in HSCT recipients due to concerns for delayed (or impaired) bone marrow engraftment. Such effects of GCV (and VGCV) are also a common concern among solid organ transplant recipients who are simultaneously receiving other myelosuppressive drugs (eg, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and mycophenolate mofetil).
