<p>Letermovir is a novel terminase complex inhibitor that appears to be a promising agent for the prevention and treatment of CMV in transplant recipients. It is highly specific against human CMV, and its potency in vitro appears to be greater than GCV. Initial studies indicate its potential for prophylaxis and treatment of CMV. Its low adverse effect profile makes it ideal as a first-line drug, if it is eventually proven to be efficacious against CMV infection. Its unique mechanism of action makes its effective even against CMV with resistance to GCV, CDV, and PFA. These characteristics open many possibilities for letermovir in the future, including its potential to be used as primary prophylaxis in allogeneic HSCT recipients. Its unique property of CMV specificity, however, would require patients to be on other antiviral drugs for the prevention of other herpesviruses such as herpes simplex. Phase III trials are currently underway, and there is cautious anticipation that this novel drug will emerge from these clinical studies as a “new kid on the block” for the management of CMV infection in the vulnerable transplant population.</p>
