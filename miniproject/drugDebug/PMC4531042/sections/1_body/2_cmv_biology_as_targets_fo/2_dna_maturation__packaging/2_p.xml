<p>The CMV terminase complex is comprised of two proteins, pUL89 and pUL56, that interact synergistically.
 <xref rid="b15-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="b16-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> As noted earlier, the main function of the terminase complex is to cleave CMV concatemers into single units of functional CMV monomers.
 <xref rid="b17-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,
 <xref rid="b18-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The terminase complex further interacts with portal (viral capsid) proteins to facilitate DNA translocation into the capsid. The structure of the terminase complex is conserved across members of herpesviruses, but it is not shared with human cells. Consequently, at least in theory, drugs that interact with this complex are virus-selective and specific, and spare human cells.
