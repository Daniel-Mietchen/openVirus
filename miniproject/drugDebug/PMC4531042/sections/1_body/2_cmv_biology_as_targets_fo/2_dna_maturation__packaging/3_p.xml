<p>Specifically, the pUL56, which is encoded by 
 <italic>UL56</italic>,
 <xref rid="b19-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> participates in the DNA packaging process in three ways: it recognizes the specific sites where viral DNA will be cleaved; it produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) necessary for DNA translocation; and it combines with capsid proteins to allow translocation of DNA into the viral capsid.
 <xref rid="b12-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The subunit pUL89, which is encoded by 
 <italic>UL89</italic>,
 <xref rid="b20-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> contains an N-terminal moiety with ATPase function that provides energy for DNA cleavage and translocation
 <xref rid="b20-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> and a C-terminal side with nuclease activity responsible for DNA cleavage. Its C-terminal edge also serves as a potential site for synergistic interaction with pUL56, thereby enhancing overall nuclease activity
 <xref rid="b21-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> that cleaves CMV DNA concatamer into monomeric unit-length pieces.
 <xref rid="b22-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The cleavage sites are indicated by two conserved motifs located at the end of each unit-length monomer.
