<p>After the viral DNA concatamer undergoes cleavage, it is transported inside an empty viral procapsid.
 <xref rid="b14-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="b21-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This process is orchestrated by the interaction of the terminase complex and “portal proteins” found on the surface of viral procapsids.
 <xref rid="b14-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="b30-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The portal proteins are large macromolecules that are arranged in rings and associate with procapsid proteins, forming a “pore” that serves as a port of entry for viral DNA. The DNA translocation process requires the functional interaction among portal proteins, viral pro-capsid and the terminase complex subunits. In particular, the pUL56 forms a stable structure with viral procapsid and interacts with portal protein pUL104, forming part of the ring structure that allows DNA translocation.
 <xref rid="b30-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The ATP for DNA translocation is provided by pUL56.
 <xref rid="b31-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> To complete the termination process, there is a second DNA cleavage that liberates the unit-length monomeric genome from the remaining concatemeric DNA chain.
 <xref rid="b28-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The proteins pUL51, pUL52, pUL77, and pUL93 are believed to be part of the terminase complex or to participate in the DNA packaging process.
 <xref rid="b32-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Other proteins that may also be important to the termination process include pUL86 (major capsid protein), pUL85 (minor capsid protein), pUL46 (minor capsid protein binding protein), pUL47/48 (smallest capsid protein), pUL80.5 (assembly protein), and pUL80a (proteinase precursor protein).
 <xref rid="b13-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,
 <xref rid="b14-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="b23-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Collectively, viral termination appears to be a highly complex process that is facilitated by numerous interacting protein molecules.
