<p>Similar to GCV and VGCV, the other two approved antiviral drugs (CDV and PFA) inhibit CMV replication by interfering with the function of CMV DNA polymerase. Their incorporation by CMV DNA polymerase results in the termination of viral DNA synthesis. CMV DNA polymerase is encoded by 
 <italic>UL54</italic>. Mutations in 
 <italic>UL54</italic> have been reported (at a rate lower than 
 <italic>UL97</italic> mutation) resulting in varying degrees of cross-resistance among GCV, CDV, and PFA.
