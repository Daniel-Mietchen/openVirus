<p>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a prevalent infection that causes significant morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed patients. The management of CMV infection and disease in immunocompromised patients consists of the use of antiviral drugs, together with efforts to minimize immunosuppression. The current antiviral drugs against CMV, ie, ganciclovir (GCV), foscarnet (PFA), and cidofovir (CDV), are associated with significant adverse effects. Moreover, there is emergence of CMV strains that have developed resistance to these antiviral drugs. These circumstances limit our therapeutic options, and highlight the need to develop novel compounds with potent clinical activity against CMV.</p>
