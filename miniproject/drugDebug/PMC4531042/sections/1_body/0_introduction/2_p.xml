<p>Impeding vital stages in the life cycle of CMV has been explored as novel avenues for antiviral therapy. The disruption of the viral termination process was recently pursued as one such target for viral inhibition. Such a process relies on disrupting essential protein molecules at a step in the life cycle beyond CMV DNA synthesis. The most promising compound in this novel drug class is letermovir (previously known as AIC246). In this article, we review the development of letermovir, its mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic profile, and the results of studies that have evaluated its safety and efficacy in humans.</p>
