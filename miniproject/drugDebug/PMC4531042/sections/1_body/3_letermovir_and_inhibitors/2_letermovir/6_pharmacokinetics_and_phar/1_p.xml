<p>Systemic exposure to letermovir was measured in a Phase I single dose-escalation trial in healthy volunteers, where participants received letermovir at doses from as low as 5 mg up to as high as 320 mg daily. There was an increase in measured systemic exposure to letermovir for doses up to 240 mg daily, but there were no further increases observed for doses higher than 240 mg daily. The median time to maximum serum concentration (T
 <sub>max</sub>) was 1.5 hours, with a mean terminal half-life t
 <sub>1/2</sub> of 10 hours. When taken with food, the median T
 <sub>max</sub> was delayed to 4 hours, and peak serum concentration was reduced by 24%, although the area under the curve remained unchanged. Once-daily dosing did not differ from twice-daily dosing in terms of T
 <sub>max</sub> and t
 <sub>1/2</sub> parameters.
