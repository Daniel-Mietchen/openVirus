<p>Because it acts through a novel mechanism, letermovir-resistant CMV does not exhibit cross-resistance with currently approved anti-CMV drugs, and remains susceptible to GCV, PFA, and CDF. Interestingly, letermovir-resistant CMV strains also do not exhibit resistance to the other terminase inhibitors (benzimidazoles and sulfonamides). This finding suggests that benzimidazoles, sulfonamides, and letermovir exhibit distinct inhibitory effects on this highly complex terminase complex.
