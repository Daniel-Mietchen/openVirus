<p>In another Phase IIa randomized, controlled, open-label study performed in multiple centers in Germany, letermovir was given to 27 kidney transplant recipients as pre-emptive treatment for asymptomatic CMV viral replication that were detected by surveillance. In this study, letermovir at doses of 40 mg twice per day or 80 mg daily were given for 14 days, and this was compared with the local standard of care (which is VGCV). By day 15, all the three groups demonstrated significant declines in the number of copies of CMV DNA when compared with baseline. This clinical trial was designed as a proof-of-concept study with a small sample size, and many variables such as immunosuppression were not equally distributed given its open-label nature. However, none of the patients in this study developed CMV disease and there was a log10 drop in CMV load at the end of the 14 days of letermovir treatment (which is comparable with VGCV). Interestingly, there was a slower decline in CMV load in the letermovir group compared with VGCV (11 versus 4 days). This may be in part due to the fact that letermovir does not prevent CMV DNA production, but instead, it only inhibits its packaging into virions. A potential consequence of this finding is that viral load measurement may not be truly reflective of its antiviral efficacy during the first few weeks of letermovir treatment. Three patients in this pilot study had mutations in
