<p>Letermovir was used in a compassionate program for treatment of severe CMV disease in a lung transplant patient with prolonged disseminated disease due to multidrug-resistant CMV (A594T, C603W 
 <italic>UL97</italic> mutations; V715M and A987G 
 <italic>UL54</italic> mutations). The patient had failed to respond to standard treatment with GCV, VGCV, PFA, and CDV, off-label treatment with leflunomide, and compassionate use of CMX-001 (brincidofovir). The patient was eventually treated with letermovir, initially using a 120 mg daily dose but later escalated to 240 mg daily when there was no apparent response. At 4 weeks, the CMV load declined to a level below the limit of quantification and with symptom resolution.
