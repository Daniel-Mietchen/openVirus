<p>The target of letermovir, the viral terminase complex, is unique to herpesviruses and the drug is not known to bind to human cells, so direct toxicity in humans is anticipated to be low. The few early phase clinical trials of letermovir so far have reported a low incidence of adverse effects. Data from over 260 patients who have received letermovir in Phase I and II clinical trials showed no major changes in vital signs, electrocardiographic findings, or laboratory markers. In the Phase II trial that evaluated three different doses of letermovir compared with placebo in HSCT recipients, the drug was well tolerated, and the reported drug-related side effects were more common in the placebo group (33% versus 17% in the letermovir group).

The rate of neutropenia was very low (when indirectly compared with the neutropenia associated with the use of VGCV, 6% versus 58%, respectively) and similar to placebo.
 <xref rid="b42-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> In the study of kidney transplant recipients who received 80 mg of letermovir daily, the overall rate of adverse events was high (74.1%), but the majority of these events were not believed not to be due to letermovir. Gastroenteritis, nasopharyngitis, dyspnea, and elevation in serum creatinine were reported as potential side effects of letermovir, while other serum chemistries and hematological profile were no altered.
