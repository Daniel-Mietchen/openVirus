<p>In vitro studies that assessed the activity of letermovir on different CMV strains using the classical cytopathic effect reduction assay and green fluorescent protein-based fluorescent reduction assay showed a very potent antiviral drug, which was more potent than GCV by 400-fold in EC
 <sub>50</sub> and 2,000-fold in EC
 <sub>90</sub> values. Its potency declined only slightly after an increase in virus inoculum, suggesting that it could potentially be useful even in the setting of high viral load.

 <xref rid="b43-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Testing the drug in culture of CMV-infected fibroblasts showed that letermovir has a high efficiency in inhibiting focal expansion of the virus, and thus it can prevent cell-to-cell viral spread. Time-to-drug-addition studies showed that letermovir was effective when added as late as up to 57 hours after infection (compared with only 33 hours for GCV); this is presumed to be likely due to its effect during the later stages of viral replication (compared with GCV).
