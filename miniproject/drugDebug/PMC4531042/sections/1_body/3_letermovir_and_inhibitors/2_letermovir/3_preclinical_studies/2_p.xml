<p>Letermovir has not shown any in vitro activity against herpesviruses other than human CMV, and the drug is also not active against murine or rat CMV.
 <xref rid="b43-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> In vivo studies using a mouse xenotransplant model (transplanted with a Gelfoam sponge with infected human CMV cells) demonstrated that letermovir produced a statistically significant dose-dependent reduction of CMV titer in the transplanted cells (which was superior to VGCV).
