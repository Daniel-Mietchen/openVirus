<p>The sulfonamide BAY 38-4766 has been shown to inhibit CMV replication. CMV that is resistant to GCV, CDV, and PFA remained susceptible to BAY 38-4766, suggesting a unique mechanism of action other than viral DNA synthesis. Sulfonamide-resistant CMV strains were found to have mutations in

 <xref rid="b37-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> thereby suggesting that BAY 38-4766 interferes with the terminase complex. However, there was no cross-resistance between the sulfonamide-resistant and BCDRB-resistant strains. Thus, while these compounds interrupt the DNA maturation process, they have different resistance mutations, and are likely to act at different DNA maturation sites; these observations highlight the highly complex nature of the viral termination complex. These compounds, however, are currently not undergoing further clinical development.
