<p>Subsequent studies have shown that BDCRB inhibits the interaction of the C-terminal side of pUL56 and the portal protein pUL104. As mentioned previously, this is an essential step that facilitates DNA monomer translocation into viral procapsids. The Q204R mutation of 
 <italic>UL56</italic> is speculated as the site of action of BDCRB, and such interference with the DNA binding site by the drug would inhibit cleavage and halt the replication process.

 <xref rid="b30-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Another hypothesis is that BDCRB affects the functional structures of pUL56, which is normally a dimer of two ring-shaped structures. The point of union of these two dimers is in proximity to the zinc-finger domain affected by the Q204R mutation. Accordingly, it is possible that BDCRB inhibits the formation of pUL56 dimers and subsequently impairs the ability to recognize the DNA molecule. Notably, CMV strains resistant to TCRB and BDCRB have mutations not only in 
 <italic>UL56</italic> and 
 <italic>UL89</italic>, but also in 
 <italic>UL104</italic> (which encodes for portal proteins).
