<p>The first terminase inhibitors, 2,5,6-trichloro-1-β-D-ribofuranosyl benzimidazole (TCRB) and 2-bromo-5,6-dichloro-1-(β-D-ribofuranosyl)benzimidazole (BDCRB), were initially developed as anticancer drugs. The effect of BDCRB and TCRB on CMV replication did not involve the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis, but instead the drugs caused the production of virions that had left-end-truncated genomes inside their capsid.
 <xref rid="b33-idr-8-269" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This finding led to the suspicion that the benzimidazole compounds inhibited CMV replication at a stage distal to viral DNA synthesis. This hypothesis was reinforced when resistance mutations to BDCRB and TCRB were mapped to 
 <italic>UL56</italic> (Q204R) and 
 <italic>UL89</italic> (D344E and A355T), which encode for proteins involved in DNA processing and packaging.
