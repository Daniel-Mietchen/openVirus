Coronaviruses (CoV) are a broad family of virusesthat includes SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 strains. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 strains are usually associated with mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections, such as the common cold. By contrast, people infected with MERS-CoV, SASRS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 could develop severe respiratory illness, and many of the infected have died.
