<p id="par0165">Here we reviewed a process of BSAA development and summarized information on 120 safe-in-man agents in freely available database. We hope that further pre-clinical and clinical studies on BSAAs will be harmonized, and data collection will be standardized. Furthermore, the follow-up studies as well as the results of on-going, finalized or terminated clinical trials will be made publicly available to allow prioritization and translation of emerging and existing BSAAs into clinical practice. This would allow BSAAs to play a pivotal role in the battle against emerging and re-emerging viral diseases.</p>
