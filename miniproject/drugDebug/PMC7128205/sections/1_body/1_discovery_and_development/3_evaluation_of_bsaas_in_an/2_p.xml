<p id="par0085">Often animals require higher concentration of an experimental antiviral as compared to effective in vitro concentrations. Moreover, it is relatively difficult to achieve micromolar EC50 in vivo. For example, aminoglycoside antibiotics, kasugamycin and neomycin were successfully tested against ZIKV, FLUAV, and HSV-2 infections in mice (
