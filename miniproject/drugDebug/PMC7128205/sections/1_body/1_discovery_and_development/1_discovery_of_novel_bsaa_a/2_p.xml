<p id="par0040">Cell viability assays and cell death assays are commonly used to assess the cytotoxicity and efficacy of BSAAs (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> A). Cell viability assays include MTT, MTS, resazurin or similar assays, mitochondrial membrane potential-dependent dyes-based assays, esterase cleaved dye-based assays, ATP-ADP assays, and assays that measure glycolytic flux and oxygen consumption. Other cell death assays include LDH enzyme leakage assays, membrane impermeable dye-based assays, and apoptosis assays, such as Annexin V, TUNEL, and caspase assays (
