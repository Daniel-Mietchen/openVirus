<p id="par0025">Drug repurposing, also called repositioning, redirecting, reprofiling, is a strategy for generating additional value from an existing drug by targeting disease other than that for which it was originally intended (

 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">Pushpakom et al., 2019</xref>). This has significant advantages over new drug discovery since chemical synthesis steps, manufacturing processes, reliable safety, and pharmacokinetic properties in pre-clinical (animal model) and early clinical developmental phases (phase 0, I and IIa) are already available (

Therefore, repositioning of launched or even failed drugs to viral diseases provides unique translational opportunities, including a substantially higher probability of success to market as compared with developing new virus-specific drugs and vaccines, and a significantly reduced cost and timeline to clinical availability (
