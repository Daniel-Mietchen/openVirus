A counterpoint to this is the “one drug, multiple viruses” paradigm, which came with the discovery of broad-spectrum antiviral agents (BSAAs), small-molecules that inhibit a wide range of human viruses (

Although the concept of BSAAs has been around for almost 50 years, the field received a new impetus with recent outbreaks of Ebola, Zika, Dengue, influenza and other viral infections, the discovery of novel host-directed agents, as well as development of drug repositioning methodology.
