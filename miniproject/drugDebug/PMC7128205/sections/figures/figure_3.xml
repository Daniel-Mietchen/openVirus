Viruses are clustered by virus groups. BSAAs range from the highest to lowest number of targeted viruses. Different shadings indicate different development status of BSAAs. Gray shading indicates that the antiviral activity has not been either studied or reported. Abbreviations: ds, double-stranded; RT, reverse transcriptase; ss, single-stranded.
