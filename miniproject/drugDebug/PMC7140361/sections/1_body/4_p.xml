<p id="Par5">Finally, in Schuierer’s report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], the treated patients required lower norepinephrine doses than untreated patients on baseline, and the treated group had a longer ICU stay but not lower mortality. Moreover, they included mainly elderly patients with a median age of 69 and 72 years old. These patients are at a higher risk of dying, but they are more likely to die with the virus than because of the virus. And viral reactivation could more likely be a marker of the disease severity and/or immunosuppression associated with critical illness and therapeutics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Thus, giving antiviral drugs to these patients should therefore be considered cautiously in terms of benefit–risk ratio.
