<p id="Par4">Second, how should we monitor HSV load in patients with MV? In Schuierer’s study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], only one HSV PCR from LRT sample was performed after VAP was suspected. However, monitoring the HSV load routinely per week in MV patients and a trend of increasing HSV load may be more evident for a new infection. And an early throat swab for HSV PCR may be an early suggestion of risk factor for HSV infection in LRT. Furthermore, the concentration of the virus may be influenced by the sample quality from a sputum or BALF and lead to a difficult explanation of viral load by the quantitative PCR. Moreover, acyclovir treatment was associated with a significantly improved circulatory function in Schuierer’s study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], which may suggest a viremia-related septic shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Taken together, a standardized protocol for sample collection and sequential LRT HSV monitoring is needed, and a serum test of HSV may be valuable in detecting the development of HSV reactivation and infection in MV patients admitted to ICU.
