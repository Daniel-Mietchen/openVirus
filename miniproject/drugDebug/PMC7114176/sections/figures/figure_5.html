 <caption> BLI of rOC43-ns2DelRluc allows evaluation of antiviral therapeutics in living mice. (A) BLI of BALB/c mice treated with or without CQ after rOC43-ns2DelRluc inoculation. Mice infected intracerebrally with 100 TCID 50 of rOC43-ns2DelRluc were untreated (upper panel) or treated (lower panel) with CQ (30 mg/kg) daily, followed by daily BLI by intraperitoneal injection of Rluc substrate and capture of photon emission using an In Vivo F Pro system. A representative BLI image of one mouse is shown. Comparative time course of BLI of brain (B) and spinal cord (C) tissue of mice treated with or without CQ after rOC43-ns2DelRluc inoculation. Luciferase activity was quantified using an In Vivo F Pro system. Data represent three independent experiments and are shown as the mean ± standard deviation. Western blot analysis of brain (D) and spinal cord (E) tissue from BALB/c mice treated with or without CQ after rOC43-ns2DelRluc inoculation. </caption>
