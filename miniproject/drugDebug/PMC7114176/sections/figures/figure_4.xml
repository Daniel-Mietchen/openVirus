   <bold>BLI of the spatial and temporal progression of rOC43-ns2DelRluc infection.</bold> BLI of BALB/c mice after intracerebral (A) or intranasal (F) infection with rOC43-ns2DelRluc. BALB/c mice underwent intracerebral (100 TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) or intranasal (10
   <sup>4</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>) inoculation on day 0 with rOC43-ns2DelRluc, and BLI was performed daily by intraperitoneal injection of Rluc substrate and capture of photon emission using an In Vivo F Pro system. Representative BLI images are shown. (B–E) Data correspond to the time course after intracerebral infection. Luciferase activity was quantified using the In Vivo F Pro system, and viral titer was determined by indirect IFA of brain (B) and spinal cord (D) tissue at the indicated time points. The R
   <sup>2</sup> and 
   <italic>P</italic>-values for the linear regression analysis of brain (C) and spinal cord (E) tissue are indicated on each graph. (G–J) Data correspond to the time course after intranasal infection. Luciferase activity was quantified using the In Vivo F Pro system, and viral titer was determined by indirect IFA of brain (G) and spinal cord (I) tissue at the indicated time points. The R
   <sup>2</sup> and 
   <italic>P</italic>-values for the linear regression analysis of brain (H) and spinal cord (J) tissue are indicated on each graph. Data represent three independent experiments and are shown as the mean ± standard deviation. Western blot analysis of rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication after intracerebral (K) or intranasal (L) inoculation.
