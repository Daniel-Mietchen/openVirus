 <caption> BLI of rOC43-ns2DelRluc in mice with different genetic backgrounds. (A) BLI of the dorsal and ventral sides of mice with different genetic backgrounds. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice were intranasally infected with 10 4 TCID 50 rOC43-ns2DelRluc, and BLI was performed at 6 dpi by intraperitoneal injection of Rluc substrate and capture of photon emission using an In Vivo F Pro system. Representative graphs are shown of the dorsal and ventral views. (B) Comparison of BLI from different sides of mice with different genetic backgrounds. Data represent three independent experiments and are shown as the mean ± standard deviation. </caption>
