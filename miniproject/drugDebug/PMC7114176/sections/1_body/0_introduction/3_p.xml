<p id="p0035">Conventional assays that examine host–pathogen interactions are indispensable for demonstrating the processes of pathogen infection and dissemination. Mouse models are commonly used to study viral replication and dissemination and test potential antiviral drugs; however, this conventional approach has various limitations. The experimental animals must be anatomised at multiple time points to study the sites of infection and quantify pathogen titer, thus requiring a large number of animals. Moreover, these approaches cannot monitor the real-time spatial and temporal progression of infection in the same animal. Bioluminescence imaging (BLI) is a powerful optical technique for the molecular imaging of infectious diseases and therapies.

 <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, is purified from the marine organism 
 <italic>Renilla reniformis</italic> (sea pansy), which exhibits blue-green bioluminescence when catalysis is stimulated. Rluc is ATP-independent and oxidizes coelenterazine to generate bioluminescence (
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Lorenz et al., 1996</xref>). Upon oxidation by Rluc 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, coelenterazine produces blue light with a peak emission at ~480 nm (
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Matthews et al., 1977</xref>). Unlike other luciferases, Rluc has smaller components, high specificity and sensitivity, and can be genetically fused with other proteins, which is particularly useful when investigating pathogens with large genome restrictions (
