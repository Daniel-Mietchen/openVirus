<p id="p0150">In summary, we developed a powerful method for real-time monitoring of HCoV-OC43 replication and dissemination in the CNS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on non-invasive BLI in the CNS of living HCoV-infected mice. Furthermore, rOC43-ns2DelRluc-based BLI is a promising platform for non-invasively screening antiviral compounds

 <italic>in vivo,</italic> the screening of broad-spectrum drugs, and new approaches for studying CNS pathologies caused by respiratory viruses.
