<p id="p0140">Preclinical animal models that mimic the human pathogenesis of Beta-CoV infection are still urgently needed to develop vaccines and therapies. BLI has emerged as a powerful tool for studying animal models of viral disease, thereby enabling real-time study of viral infection, host immune responses, and the efficacy of intervention strategies 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Two animal models using BLI have been reported for studying the relationship between CoVs and their hosts and identifying anti-CoV agents (

 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Raaben et al. (2009)</xref> constructed a recombinant virus expressing Fluc based on mouse CoV (MHV-A59) and used it to study viral replication and dissemination 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>; however, MHV-A59 has a complicated tropism in mice. 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al. (2018)</xref> successfully established a human 
 <italic>dipeptidyl peptidase-4</italic>-knock-in mouse model susceptible to pseudotyped Fluc-expressing MERS-CoV, allowing MERS-CoV to be optically imaged; however, the pseudovirus was unable to replicate, and the authors could only study the entry process. Furthermore, the animal model is not suitable for simulating the pathological CNS symptoms caused by HCoV infection. In the present study, we showed that a BLI-based HCoV-OC43 animal model could be used to test antiviral drug efficacy. CNS luciferase levels accurately represented therapeutic effect, highlighting the potential of the BLI platform to evaluate antiviral drugs for treating HCoV-OC43 infection and its neurological complications by monitoring its replication and dissemination in the same animals in real-time. Although BLI technology is beneficial for studying viral replication and dissemination, it has some inherent limitations. First, hair and organ pigmentation can affect photon transmission; therefore, photon flux from tissues close to the body surface are detected more easily than those from internal organs, with light attenuating at a ~10-fold decrease per cm of tissue (

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Contag and Bachmann, 2002</xref>). This phenomenon explains why we were only able to detect strong signals from the dorsal rather than the ventral side of infected mice. Second, limited biodistribution, rapid metabolic kinetics, and higher background levels restrict the use of BLI for molecular imaging (

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Pichler et al., 2004</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Tannous et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, the genetic background of the host should be taken into account, even if they are permissive to the virus. In the present study, signals were only detected in the CNS of BALB/c mice after inoculation, despite the fact that both C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice are permissive to rOC43-ns2DelRluc. This might be due to the bioavailability of the Rluc substrate, which might not be absorbed and transported to the point of infection with Rluc-expressing viruses (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Pichler et al., 2004</xref>). This limitation could potentially be overcome by replacing the Rluc reporter in rOC43-ns2DelRluc with Fluc (
