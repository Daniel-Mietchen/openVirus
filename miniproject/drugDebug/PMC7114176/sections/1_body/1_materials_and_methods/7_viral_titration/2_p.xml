<p id="p0080">The rHCoVs-OC43 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) according to a previously described method (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Reed, 1938</xref>). Briefly, BHK-21 cells in 96-well plates were inoculated with serial 10-fold dilutions of virus, and virus-infected cells were incubated with anti-OC43-N mouse polyclonal antibodies at 72-h post -infection. Goat anti-mouse IgG (A28175) antibodies were used as the secondary antibody.
