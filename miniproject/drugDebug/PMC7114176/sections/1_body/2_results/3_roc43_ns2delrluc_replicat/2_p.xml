<p id="p0110">To confirm these observations and the dissemination of the recombinant virus, the viral load in different tissues was determined using an IFA in BHK-21 cells or real-time qRT-PCR at 6 dpi via intranasal inoculation of 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of rOC43-ns2DelRluc. In line with the symptoms, we detected high viral titers in the brains and spinal cords of both mouse strains (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A, upper), whereas low viral RNA levels were detected in the hearts and spleen, and extremely low levels were detected in the blood (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, lower), consistent with previous reports on HCoV-OC43-WT (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Dubé et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jacomy and Talbot, 2003</xref>). Immunostaining of brain and spinal cord sections from mice that underwent intracerebral infection confirmed the presence of rOC43-ns2DelRluc (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B), with Rluc detected in neuron cells labeled with MAP2 or NeuN in several areas of the CNS in both mouse strains (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C and D). These results suggested rOC43-ns2DelRluc as a promising candidate for BLI in both mouse strains.
