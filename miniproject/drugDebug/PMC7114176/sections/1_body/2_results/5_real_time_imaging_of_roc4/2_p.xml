<p id="p0120">We then used BLI to study the time course of rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication and dissemination. Briefly, individual BALB/c mice were either inoculated intracerebrally with 100 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> or intranasally with 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of rOC43-ns2DelRluc and monitored over time. Two days after intracerebral inoculation, signals were apparent in the brain from the dorsal side of the mice (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>), and at 4 dpi, the signals detected in the brain became more dispersed, and additional signals were detected in the spine (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>). Simultaneously, infected BALB/c mice exhibited severe symptoms typical of advanced disease (twitching limbs) and died soon thereafter. Following intranasal inoculation, signals emanating from the brain were observed at 3 dpi and peaked at 7 dpi, whereas signals emanating from the spinal cord were detected at 6 dpi (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>F and 
 <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">S1</xref>), and the mice died at 7 dpi. To verify whether there was a direct correlation between intensity and viral titer, BALB/c mice intracerebrally or intranasally inoculated with rOC43-ns2DelRluc were sacrificed at different time points. Viral replication determined by indirect IFA in the brains and spinal cords revealed a good correlation between relative viral load and bioluminescence intensity (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> B, D, G, and I), with a high level of correlation between the two variables (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C, E, H, and J), particularly in the intracerebral-infection group (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>C). This result confirmed the efficacy of BLI for assessing viral load in rOC43-ns2DelRluc-infected mice. Western blot analysis (
 <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>K and L) further validated the time course of rOC43-ns2DelRluc replication in the brain and spinal cord. These findings indicated that BLI revealed the temporal and spatial progression of HCoV-OC43 replication in live mice and provided a non-invasive method for sensitively quantifying small differences.
