<p id="p0105">Viral replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> depends on the genetic backgrounds of both the virus and its host. Previous studies reported that inbred BALB/c and C57BL6 mice are susceptible to HCoV-OC43 infection (

 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jacomy and Talbot, 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Noah et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, these two mouse strains were infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of rOC43-ns2DelRluc or HCoV-OC43-WT by intranasal inoculation in order to determine its infection of the respiratory tract 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. As expected, both strains presented typical symptoms of advanced disease (twitching limbs and humped back) after inoculation with rOC43-ns2DelRluc or HCoV-OC43-WT. Intranasal rOC43-ns2DelRluc inoculation led to 100% mortality in both strains, with most mice dying at 7 dpi, similar to those infected with HCoV-OC43-WT (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> A and C). Additionally, both mouse strains infected with rOC43-ns2DelRluc showed reduced body weight, similar to those infected with HCoV-OC43-WT (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B and D). According to a previous report (
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Jacomy and Talbot, 2003</xref>), C57BL/6 mice, especially those &gt;15-days old, are more sensitive to HCoV-OC43 than BALB/c. However, in the present study, we found that both BALB/c or C57BL/6 suckling mice (&lt;12-days old) infected with HCoV-OC43 at a dose of 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> showed 100% mortality and similar sensitivity. These results showed that rOC43-ns2DelRluc infection resulted in severe encephalitis and neurological symptoms in both mouse strains, suggesting that rOC43-ns2DelRluc can be used as an infection model for simulating HCoV-OC43-WT CNS infection
