<p id="Par7">Interestingly, we found that CQ and HCQ treatment caused noticeable changes in the number and size/morphology of EEs and ELs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In the untreated cells, most EEs were much smaller than ELs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). In CQ- and HCQ-treated cells, abnormally enlarged EE vesicles were observed (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, arrows in the upper panels), many of which are even larger than ELs in the untreated cells. This is in agreement with previous report that treatment with CQ induced the formation of expanded cytoplasmic vesicles

CQ treatment did not cause obvious changes in the number and size of ELs; however, the regular vesicle structure seemed to be disrupted, at least partially. By contrast, in HCQ-treated cells, the size and number of ELs increased significantly (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, arrows in the lower panels).
