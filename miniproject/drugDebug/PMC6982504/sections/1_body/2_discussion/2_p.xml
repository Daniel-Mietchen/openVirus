<p>Herein, we described a 38‐day‐old boy with CMV‐induced thrombocytopenia. Our initial diagnosis was ITP. Retrospectively, however, CMV‐induced thrombocytopenia is more suitable in the patient's diagnosis, because immune system and lymphoid activation are immature for his age and the general peak occurrence of ITP in childhood is between 2 and 5 years of age.
