<p>Acute respiratory infections are a major global health problem responsible for about 3.9 million deaths worldwide each year [

 <xref rid="B88-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. These infections are of the top five causes of mortality worldwide and the leading cause of mortality among children under five years of age in many developing countries [

 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Acute respiratory infections are most often caused by viruses. Over 200 viral serotypes are associated with human respiratory diseases [
 <xref rid="B90-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] including Influenza A and Influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human adenovirus (HAdV), human coronavirus (HCoV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBoV). In addition, two human polyomaviruses (HPyV), KIPyV and WUPyV, have been detected in patients with respiratory infections [
 <xref rid="B91-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. These infections affect all age groups, but nearly all severe episodes occur in children under five years, the elderly and immunocompromised individuals (e.g., HIV-infected patients) [

 <xref rid="B89-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In adults, viral respiratory infections are the cause of 30%–50% of pneumonia cases, 80% of asthma complications and 20%–60% of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations [
 <xref rid="B87-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Consequently, common viral respiratory infections cause a greater economic burden than many other clinical conditions in terms of medical expenses and productivity losses [

 <xref rid="B92-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. The World Health Organization has supported the monitoring of acute respiratory diseases worldwide since 1977 [
