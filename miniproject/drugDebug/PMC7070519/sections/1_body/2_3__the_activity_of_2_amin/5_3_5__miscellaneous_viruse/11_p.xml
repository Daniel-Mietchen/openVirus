<p>The antiviral activity was evaluated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> against viral strains parasitizing 
 <italic>Chenopodium amaranticolor</italic>. The ability of derivatives 
 <bold>61</bold>–
 <bold>64</bold> to control the viral infection of 
 <italic>Chenopodium amaranticolor</italic> leaves was studied at two concentrations: 1000 ppm and 100 ppm. Generally, the compounds showed good rates of viral infection control at 1000 ppm. The best results were observed for the derivatives bearing the D-xylobutyl group (compound 
 <bold>62</bold>—82% control and derivative 
 <bold>64</bold>—76% control). The substituent on the aryl ring did not significantly influence biological activity, although the compounds 
 <bold>61</bold> and 
 <bold>62</bold> having a methoxy group were slightly more active than derivatives 
 <bold>63</bold> and 
 <bold>64</bold> bearing a methyl group (
