<p>2-Amino-5-(2-sulphamoylphenyl)-1,3,4-thiadiazole 
 <bold>56</bold> reduced the replication of some DNA viruses such as adenovirus Ad17 and herpes simplex HSV-1 and RNA viruses such as Poliovirus 1, Echovirus 2 and Coxsackie virus B4 at concentrations ranging from 20 to 100 μg/mL [

 <xref rid="B103-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. In vitro experiments were performed using samples of 10
 <sup>6</sup> human aneuploid HEp-2 cells that were infected with 10 infectious units per cell. Derivative 
 <bold>56</bold> was highly active against all viral strains, significantly reducing viral replication at a concentration of 50 μg/mL. The best inhibition was recorded against Echovirus 2 virions that were completely inhibited at a concentration of 20 μg/mL (
