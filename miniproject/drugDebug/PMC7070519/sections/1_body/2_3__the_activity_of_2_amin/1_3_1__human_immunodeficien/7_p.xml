<p>Some 1,3,4-thiadiazole derivatives obtained by Hamad et al. [
 <xref rid="B66-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>] from amino acid analogs were screened for anti-HIV-1 (strain IIIB) and anti-HIV-2 (strain ROD) activity by the inhibition of the virus-induced cytopathic effect in human MT-4 cells based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) -2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. 2-(Naphthalen-2-yloxy)-
 <italic>N</italic>-((5-(phenylamino) -1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)methyl)acetamide 
 <bold>6</bold> showed in vitro inhibitory activity with EC
 <sub>50</sub> values of 0.96 μg/mL (HIV-1 strain IIIB) and 2.92 μg/mL (HIV-2 strain ROD), respectively, but low selectivity (SI &lt; 1). Structure–activity relationship (SAR) studies have suggested that the substitution of the acetamide moiety with a thiadiazole ring may lead to more active derivatives compared to other compounds bearing different heterocyclic rings. Even though anti-HIV activity and selectivity of derivative 
 <bold>6</bold> are limited compared to efavirenz (EC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 0.003 μg/mL and SI ≈ 13333), it may serve as the basis for future modification in the search for new potent non-nucleoside antiviral agents [
