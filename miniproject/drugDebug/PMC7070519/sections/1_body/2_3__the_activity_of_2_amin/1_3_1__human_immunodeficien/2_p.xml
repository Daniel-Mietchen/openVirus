<p>In the past two and half decades, different organic compounds have been developed as drug candidates for the treatment of AIDS targeting one or more stages of the virus life cycle such as absorption, fusion, entry, un-coating, reverse transcription, integration, transcription and maturation [
 <xref rid="B46-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is an essential enzyme that converts single-stranded RNA from the viral genome into double-stranded DNA before its integration into host DNA [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Since RT is a key enzyme in the life cycle of HIV-1, some HIV-1 RT inhibitors with nucleoside or non-nucleoside structures are currently used in AIDS treatment [
 <xref rid="B48-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) such as zidovudine, didanosine, zalcitabine, stavudine, lamivudine, abacavir, tenofovir or emtricitabine interact competitively with the catalytic site of the RT, while the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)—nevirapine, delavirdine, efavirenz, etc.—follow an allosteric interaction with a site adjacent to the NRTI binding site, the non-nucleoside inhibitor binding site (NNBS) [
 <xref rid="B47-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Due to their high selectivity and low cytotoxicity, NNRTIs have gained an increasingly important role in HIV infection therapy [
 <xref rid="B49-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Five drugs in the class of NNRTIs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection: nevirapine, delavirdine and efavirenz as the first generation drugs and etravirine (Intelence tablets, Janssen Therapeutics Company, 2008) and rilpivirine (Edurant tablets, Janssen Therapeutics Company, 2011) as the next-generation NNRTIs [

 <xref rid="B52-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Doravirine (MK-1439A) is a new NNRTI developed by Merck Company that completed two 48-week studies in 2017 [
 <xref rid="B53-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. Doravirine demonstrated antiretroviral activity and immunological effects similar to efavirenz with significantly fewer central nervous system adverse events [
 <xref rid="B54-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. In January 2018, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for review two new drug applications (NDAs) for doravirine, as a once-daily tablet in combination with other antiretroviral agents and as a once-daily fixed-dose combination single tablet of doravirine with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate [
 <xref rid="B55-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. On 30 August 2018, FDA approved both applications of doravirine for AIDS treatment as Pifeltro tablets (doravirine 100 mg) and Delstrigo tablets (doravirine 100 mg, lamivudine 300 mg and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg) [

 <xref rid="B57-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. Several NNRTIs (e.g., fosdevirine, lersivirine) underwent clinical development programs but were discontinued due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic, efficacy and/or safety factors [
