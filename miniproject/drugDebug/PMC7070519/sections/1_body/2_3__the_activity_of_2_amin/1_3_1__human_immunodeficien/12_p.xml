<p>Molecular modeling studies for the pyrimidyl derivative 
 <bold>10</bold> showed the formation of two potential intermolecular hydrogen bonds involving a nitrogen atom and the amino group of the thiadiazole ring and aminoacids from NNBS of RT. In addition, the electron-deficient pyrimidine ring of the ligand establishes π–π interactions with the electron-rich benzene rings of RT. Despite the docking simulation results, the inhibitory activity of compound 
 <bold>10</bold> against HIV-1 (strain IIIB) replication in MT-4 cell culture was lower than that of zidovudine. However, given the butterfly-like orientation as a necessary structural condition for antiretroviral activity, these results reveal the promising inhibitory potential of this scaffold [
