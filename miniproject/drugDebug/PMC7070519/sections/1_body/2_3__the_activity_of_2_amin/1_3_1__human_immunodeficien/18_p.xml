<p>Some glutaminase inhibitors (e.g., 6-diazo-5-oxo-
 <italic>L</italic>-norleucine, etc.) were studied in vitro for their ability to prevent the generation of glutamate by HIV-1 infected macrophages. The results support the hypothesis that glutaminase mediates glutamate generation in HIV-infected human macrophages. When glutaminase was inhibited by various inhibitors, HIV-induced glutamate production decreased and the neuronal damage was diminished [
