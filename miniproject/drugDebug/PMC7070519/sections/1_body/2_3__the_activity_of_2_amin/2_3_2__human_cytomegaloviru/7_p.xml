<p>While the synthesized derivatives have shown inhibitory activity against HCMV polymerase, their antiviral activity cannot be limited to a specific mechanism of action. These compounds may be active against cytomegalovirus by HCMV polymerase inhibition or by other mechanisms of action. In addition, during the experiments, many of these compounds also showed activity against other herpes viruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epsteinâ€“Barr virus (EBV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), and human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8). Pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts useful as antiviral agents have also been studied. Studies have been conducted for the administration of pharmaceutical preparations by parenteral, topical, oral or rectal route, depending on the purpose of their use to treat internal or external viral infections [
