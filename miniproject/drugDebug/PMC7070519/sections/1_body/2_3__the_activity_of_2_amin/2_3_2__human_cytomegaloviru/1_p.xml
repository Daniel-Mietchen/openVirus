<p>Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV, 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> family) is a ubiquitous deoxyribonucleic acid virus that infects people of all ages [

 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. HCMV infection can be acquired through horizontal and vertical transmission. HCMV spreads from infected people through direct contact with body fluids that carry the virus, such as urine, saliva, cervicovaginal secretions, sperm and breast milk. Vertical transmission through organ transplantation, from mother to child or transmission via blood transfusion, is also possible [

 <xref rid="B80-molecules-25-00942" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Blood tests indicate that 60%â€“90% of the adult population experienced HCMV infection at some time during their life [

Although most of these infections are asymptomatic, certain patient groups such as babies that are infected before birth and children or adults with weakened immune systems due to diseases or medications (e.g., HIV-infected patients, organ transplant recipients) can develop severe illnesses that require medical treatment [
