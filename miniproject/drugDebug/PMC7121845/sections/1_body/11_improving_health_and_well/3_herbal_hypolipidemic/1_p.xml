<p id="Par84">A herbal hypolipidemic DIP-LIP has been obtained from a high-altitude growing plant. It is rich in essential fatty acids like linoleic acid (26%), linolenic acid (20%) and other important fatty acids such as oleic (30%) and palmitic acid (17%). The presence of these fatty acids and total carotenoids (430 ppm) and tocopherol (1175 ppm) imparts potent bioactivities. DIP-LIP has significant hypocholesterolemic activity and inhibits cholesterol deposition in cholesterol-fed animals, besides increasing HDL cholesterol levels. DIP-LIP also exhibits significant vasorelaxant activity in aortic ring model. DIP-LIP also increases resistance to hypoxia and cold stress. DIP-LIP can be widely used for atherosclerotic cases and for its hypolipidemic and vasorelaxant properties.</p>
