<p id="Par82">Adjuvants are substances that act to accelerate, prolong or enhance antigen-specific immune responses when used with specific vaccine antigens.

Adjuvants have been used for decades as important agents for generation of strong immune response to vaccine antigens. Besides generating strong immune response, they also act as immunomodulators by influencing the type and character of antibody generated.
