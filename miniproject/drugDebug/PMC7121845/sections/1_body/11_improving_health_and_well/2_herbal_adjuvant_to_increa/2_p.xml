<p id="Par83">Antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels have shown to be significantly enhanced by DIP-HIP. Upon administration of DIP-HIP, cytokine profile correlates well with the Th1 and Th2 type of immune response. Immunization through different routes like intraperitoneal and intramuscular did not show any significant difference nor caused any muscular damage, granulomatous reaction or dystrophy. The shelf life of DIP-HIP is more than 3 years, whereas in the formulation with antigen, it is about 4 months at 40 ° C. No haemolytic activity is observed on the treatment of both human and animal erythrocytes with DIP-HIP. Incorporation of DIP-HIP results in enhancing, accelerating and prolonging the antigen specific-antibody responses in animals. Further advantages of DIP-HIP include enhancement of immunogenicity, reduction of antigen amount needed for a successful immunization and reduction of frequency of booster immunization, without any muscular damage or side effects.</p>
