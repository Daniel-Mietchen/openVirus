<p id="Par39">One of the aims of the civil/military authorities during operations is to catch hold of the miscreants alive and get complete information about their ring leaders. Particularly when they take shelter in hideouts or in house/building, it is very difficult to take them out without collateral casualties. During counterinsurgency operations, security personnel have to disarm/incapacitate agitated individuals, disperse the crowd or capture militants held up in a bunker or building. The available methods in vogue are normally lethal in nature, e.g. small arms and grenades, which result in the loss of life/bodily injuries. There is a need for a non-lethal aerosol chemical-based weapon system, which is instantaneously effective and totally safe in controlling agitated and misguided individuals and can be used to incapacitate them leading to their capture.</p>
