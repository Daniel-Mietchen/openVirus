<p id="Par38">Capsi-based products are suitable for the law enforcement agencies, police and paramilitary forces for use in the LIC-affected areas, for riot control and for protection of vital installations from sabotage, crime prevention, flushing out hiding people as well as civilian applications like personal or area protection and self-defence. Capsi-based products can be used as a handheld spray or as a hand grenade or thrown through projectile/launchers as ball or shell or through water cannon as fine spray. They have no explosive fuse for burning chilli powder and thus do not need any approval from explosive agency.</p>
