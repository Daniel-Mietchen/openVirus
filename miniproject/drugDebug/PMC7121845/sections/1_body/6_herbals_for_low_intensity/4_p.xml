<p id="Par40">In the Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE), Gwalior has developed a unique non-lethal munition, named as oleoresin-based grenades (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>). The product is totally safe, simple to operate, user-friendly and extremely useful for the above purpose. The body of the grenades is made of plastic, which melts when the grenade bursts thus making its throwing back difficult. The grenade can be thrown by hand up to 30 m to the hideouts/agitated mob. The grenades when applied emit tear gas for 60–80 s after a delay of 1–2 s, making the person come out due to lachrymation, irritation and suffocation. The product has been inducted into the services and is being used for the riot control agents by services, CAPFs, state police and other paramilitary forces. The product is useful for peacekeeping purposes and combating terrorism. It can be used to incapacitate terrorists and flushing them out from hideouts (tunnels, fields, dense jungles, broken grounds, etc.) without casualties. The grenade can be effectively used for controlling agitated and misguided individuals and can be used to incapacitate them within no time.
