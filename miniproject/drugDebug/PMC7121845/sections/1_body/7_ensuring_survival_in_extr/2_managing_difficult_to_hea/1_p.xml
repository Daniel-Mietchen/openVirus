<p id="Par44">Wound healing is classically divided into haemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodelling. Abnormalities arising due to wound per se and during the wound repair process cause a great deal of physical and mental ordeal to patients. A unique herbal formulation, viz. Herbo Healer for management of normal as well as chronic, non-healing wounds, has been developed from a single constituent of herbal origin by the Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) â€“ a constituent laboratory of DRDO (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig20" ref-type="fig">20</xref>). It promotes rapid and aesthetic healing, is rich in natural antioxidants and bioactive polyphenols/flavonoids and aids in healing of wounds by acting at cellular and molecular level. It has been proven to augment healing via wound contraction, re-epithelialization, cellular proliferation, collagen accumulation and neovascularization. Herbo Healer has antibacterial properties and has been shown to be way better than silver sulfadiazine and other iodine-based ointments. The safety and toxicological studies have proven it to be safe for dermal applications. ToT has been transferred to reputed firms.
