<p id="Par45">Snakebites are common in jungles and pose environmental hazard that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, if the snake is poisonous and the individual is not timely treated with anti-snake venom (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2008</xref>). The soldiers have to operate in jungles, where wildlife is in plenty. For the military, it is definitely an occupational hazard. The best method to reduce human-snake encounters is to be cautious and avoid them; however, this is not always possible in snake-infested areas, and snake repellents can be quite useful in such scenarios. Murdock et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1990</xref>) and Krysa-clark et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2004</xref>) have highlighted the importance of prevention and emergency field management of venomous snakebites during military exercises.
