 <xref rid="Fig21" ref-type="fig">21</xref>). The formulation is eco-friendly; it does not harm the snake, it only repels the snake so that it goes away from the area where the formulation has been used. The formulation is available in liquid and granular form; it can be used in gardens and home also. The formulation is of herbal origin and has a shelf life of 1 year under any environment conditions. Ethnic herbs, mainly from eastern India, have been used to develop the formulation. The formulation is non-toxic, non-hazardous and non-mutagenic and contains no phenolic compounds. The formulation has been found to be effective in warding off snakes from Army units, installations and residential areas in the North East region.
