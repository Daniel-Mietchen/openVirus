<p id="Par43">During trials in the Siachen glacier region, a combination of pentoxifylline, vitamin ‘C’ and low dose of aspirin along with ALOCAL (
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> cream) application in soldiers showing early signs of cold injury was found effective in reducing morbidity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig19" ref-type="fig">19</xref>). Topical application of 
 <italic>Aloe vera</italic> cream (50%) prophylactically along with tab aspirin 150 mg once daily, tab pentoxifylline 400 mg and tab vit C 500 mg three times daily and rewarming in decoction of tea leaves as therapy has been proved to be an effective remedy in preventing and ameliorating cold injuries in high altitude. The limbs of several soldiers were saved from amputation as a result of the use of this formulation in the cold, ruthless Siachen glacier sector.
