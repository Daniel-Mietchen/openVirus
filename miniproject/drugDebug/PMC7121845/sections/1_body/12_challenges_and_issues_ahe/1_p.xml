<p id="Par91">For several terrain, operation and platform-specific problems faced by our Armed Forces, there are no effective solutions available. DRDO has been making concerted efforts to consolidate and streamline research and development endeavours on herbal products to provide unique solutions to the Armed Forces. In the process, at times some spin-offs emanate, which find practical application in both military and civil setting. With a view to meeting emerging challenges, the traditional knowledge on herbs of high altitudes, desert areas, Central Himalayan and North East region, etc. is being documented, and research carried out to generate scientific data that can be useful for the Armed Forces. There is a paradigm shift towards acceptance of scientifically validated herbals as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents. The grant of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to discoveries concerning novel therapies for some of the most devastating parasitic diseases, viz. river blindness, lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and malaria, has once again highlighted the importance that herbal drugs are receiving in today’s world. Drugs derived from 
 <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic> and 
 <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> were found to be effective against parasitic diseases. However, it is a paradox that in our country, where Ayurveda has been a very successful and effective system of medicine for over 5000 years, there is still some amount of scepticism among civil health experts when it comes to acceptance of herbal drugs, and services are no exception.. This view has to change in coming times if the full benefit of scientifically validated herbal drugs has to reach the users. The realization that herbal drugs are effective and safe and can solve the emerging problems of our Armed Forces will lead to induction of more and more products to the advantage of our soldiers who operate in harsh and extreme terrain and inhospitable operational conditions. As alluded to earlier, serious endeavours are underway in DRDO towards protecting the warfighter and promoting performance through the development of scientifically validated herbal products, processes and technologies. The need of the hour is achieving greater synergy with the services and industrial partners so that the herbal products, technologies and complementary and alternative medicine can be inducted in a rapid manner for the benefit of the soldiers.
