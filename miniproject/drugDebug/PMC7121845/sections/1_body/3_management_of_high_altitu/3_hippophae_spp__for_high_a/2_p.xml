<p id="Par17">Sharma et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>) have attributed the potent in vitro antioxidant potential of the extracts of the leaves of 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> and 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides mongolica</italic> (as compared to 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides turkestanica</italic>) to the in vivo adaptogenic performance in animals during cold and hypoxia exposure under restraint stress. For adaptogenic studies, rats with oral drug supplementation were exposed to cold-hypoxia-restraint (C-H-R) stresses-induced hypothermia to determine endurance. Aqueous extracts of 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> showed maximum (99%) resistance compared to the other 
 <italic>Hippophae</italic> spp. The levels of biochemical parameters such as reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, lactate dehydrogenase, superoxide dismutase, glutathione and catalase in blood samples also revealed that the aqueous leaf extract of 
 <italic>Hippophae salicifolia</italic> exhibited superior antioxidant and adaptogenic potential and established its usefulness for high-altitude stress management.
