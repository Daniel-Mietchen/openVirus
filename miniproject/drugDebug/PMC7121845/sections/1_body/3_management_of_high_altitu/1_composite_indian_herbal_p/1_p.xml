<p id="Par11">Exposure of living organisms to adverse climatic conditions is known to cause stress, which is a non-specific response to the excess demands imposed on the body. A plethora of stressors like physical, chemical, immunological, biological and emotional factors are involved in the manifestation of stress. Soldiers staying and working in adverse climatic conditions such as cold, heat and high altitude also suffer from stress-induced disorders and at times exhibit decreased or suboptimal levels of physical/cognitive performance due to stress. Adaptogens are biologically active substances that are known to improve physical and mental performance under adverse environmental conditions and induce resistance against stressors, e.g. extreme cold and heat, pain and infections. A plethora of herbals possess adaptogenic properties and are used in different traditional systems of medicine for improving overall stress resistance. Taking leads from India’s traditional system of medicine – the Ayurveda, a formulation – Composite Indian Herbal Preparation I (CIHP I) has been developed by DIPAS to increase the physical performance of our soldiers who have to operate in high-altitude environments under extremes (Fig.
