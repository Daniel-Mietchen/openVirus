<p id="Par22">Another high-altitude herbal UV screen “Umbriel” has been specifically developed to protect the subjects from damage caused by the UV flux prevalent at high altitudes. Umbriel (a registered trademark of DRDO) is a unique combination of herbal agents developed by INMAS, DRDO. It is non-toxic, prophylactic, dermal ointment which has been scientifically tested to cut off more than 90% UV rays, prevent DNA damage, regulate melanin content in the skin, prevent immunosuppression, and counter oxidative stress and photosensitivity. This product has passed highly sensitive tests such as infrared thermography. This innovation is useful for people living in high-altitude regions, tourists visiting high-altitude areas and sportsmen participating in snow/winter games at high altitudes and people who migrate from plains to high altitudes and are unacclimatized to the extreme UV radiations prevalent at high altitudes.</p>
