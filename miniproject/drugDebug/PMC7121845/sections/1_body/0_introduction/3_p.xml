<p id="Par4">During the combat active period, the Indian military personnel are exposed to almost all of the environmental and occupational hazards in a single lifetime. The military personnel, depending on their field of activity, are exposed to various stresses in micro-environments like engine rooms of ships, submarines, aircraft cockpits, crew compartments of tanks and other combat vehicles which are usually cramped, hot, polluted by noise, smoke and toxic gases and radiation, and hence these also pose real threats to efficient performance and health of the warfighter.</p>
