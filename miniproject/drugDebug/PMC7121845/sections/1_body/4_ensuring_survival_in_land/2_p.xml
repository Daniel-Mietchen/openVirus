<p id="Par24">The purpose of survival garden is that the soldiers should be able to utilize the locally available indigenous medicinal and aromatic plants can be utilized for treating common ailments and survival during operational conditions in diverse terrain (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref>). India is extremely rich in phytobiodiversity in view of the prevailing divergent ecosystems and considerable altitudinal variations in the country. The Himalayan ranges possess huge phytobiodiversity in terms of various plant species, including angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, lichens, bacteria and fungi. Of this diversity, nearly 25% species are endemic to the Himalayas. The Himalayas are considered to be a treasure house of medicinal, aromatic, edible wild and other important plants, which have been used by the local populations for meeting their daily necessities since ages, and this long dependence on plant wealth enriched their knowledge about the multifarious uses of phytodiversity. The high-altitude regions of Ladakh and Lahaul-Spiti in the North West and Tawang in the North East are strategically important because of the international borders with China and Pakistan. The Armed Forces, deployed in these regions, have to face extreme environmental conditions, as the region is prone to landslides, heavy rainfall, cloud bursts, avalanches and natural calamities. At times, these landlocked areas become inaccessible by road and/or air. In view of the likelihood of availability of food and medicines in such areas becoming compromised under certain operational conditions, a need was felt to develop databases on wild plants that can help sustenance and survival of troops in such regions in case of an emergency. The survival garden can play an important role in helping the troops operate unhindered under any circumstances.
