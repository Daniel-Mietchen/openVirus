<p id="Par64">As alluded to earlier, 
 <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> (Himalayan mayapple) is an invaluable source of podophyllotoxin, 4′-demethylpodophyllotoxin, podophyllotoxin glycoside and other polyphenolic compounds that find application as anticancer, antiviral, antibacterial, immunostimulating and antirheumatic drugs. The aryltetralin lignans synthesized by the taxon are in great demand worldwide due to their use in the synthesis of topoisomerase inhibitors and form an integral part of the modern chemotherapeutic regimen for the treatment of a variety of cancers. The radioprotective and anti-HIV properties are further likely to increase the demand for lignans and related molecules produced by this important plant species. In order to maintain continued production of these aryltetralin lignans, the plant has to be harvested on a large scale from its natural environment, and this has resulted in the plant’s endangered status, which now finds mention in the Red Data Book. The chemical synthesis of podophyllotoxin is complicated, and in view of the difficulties in its total chemical synthesis (due to the presence of four chiral centres along with a γ-lactone and a high degree of oxygenation), problems in cultivation on large scale and failure of metabolic engineering approaches, there is a need for alternative sources of production of aryltetralin lignans. To circumvent the problem of production of radioprotective secondary metabolites, a novel endophytic fungus (
 <italic>Trametes hirsuta</italic>) was isolated from high-altitude 
 <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> with the capability to synthesize podophyllotoxin and other lignans and possessing amenability for scale-up in bioreactors (Puri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2006</xref>; Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig29" ref-type="fig">29</xref>). Methodology for consistent production of the aryltetralin lignans was established, and methods for characterization by HPLC, LC–MS, LC/MS–MS and 1H-NMR were developed and standardized. The lignans produced by the endophyte are biologically active and exhibited significant antioxidant, anticancer and radioprotective properties. This strategy promises to improve the production of these therapeutically important high-value bioactive radioprotective secondary metabolites at lower costs.
