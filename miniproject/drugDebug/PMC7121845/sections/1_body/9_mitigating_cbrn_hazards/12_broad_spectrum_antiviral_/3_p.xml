<p id="Par73">Understanding and modulating the signal transduction pathways are imperative to the development of new therapeutic agents. It is well known that the recognition of virus infection by retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA) 5, which are RNA helicases, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 can activate a cascade of signal transduction pathways leading to production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines that synchronize the removal of the virus from the host. However, it has been demonstrated that RNA-helicase-mediated innate immunity plays an important role in defending the host from infection. During endeavours to identify plant-derived antivirals that could selectively enhance ISG- and RNA-helicase-mediated antiviral immune responses, 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> was found to be effective. 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> treatment significantly promoted ISG, RIG-I and MDA 5 gene expression and an antiviral immune response against dengue virus infection. 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> treatment also induced interferon (IFN) β and other cytokines, including IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-8 in infected cells. 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> also upregulated phosphorylated eIF-2α, PKR and NF-kB in infected cells. In addition, the number of NK cells was also increased upon treatment with 
 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> in dengue virus-infected human PBMCs. Based on the studies, Diwaker et al. (

 <italic>Rhodiola</italic> induces pharmacological modulation of RIG-I, MDA 5 and ISG signal transduction pathways supporting the induction of a favourable antiviral immune response against dengue virus and, can, therefore, be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of dengue infection.
