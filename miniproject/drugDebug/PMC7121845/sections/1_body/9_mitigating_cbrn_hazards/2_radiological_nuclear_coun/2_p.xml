 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1999</xref> of the Institute of Aviation and Space Medicine, Moscow, classified prophylactic antiradiation drugs into the following categories: (i) drugs having short-term and long-term action drugs, (ii) drugs that stimulate radioresistance, (iii) drugs that suppress symptoms of primary radiation reaction, (iv) drugs that detoxify early and (v) drugs that act by absorption or elimination of radionuclides from an organism. Nair et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>) have classified radioprotective agents into three categories: (i) radioprotectors, (ii) adaptogens and (iii) absorbents. Radioprotectors include compounds like antioxidants and others that possess sulfhydryl groups. Adaptogens in general are non-toxic stimulators of radioresistance. Usually these are natural biological protectors that offer protection against low levels of ionizing radiation primarily by regulating immunity and modulating the endogenous antioxidants, thereby improving non-specific resistance in biological systems. The last category comprises of absorbents that protect against internal radiation injuries that result due to ingestion of radionuclides. Such agents prevent the incorporation and absorption of radionuclides like 
 <sup>90</sup>Sr, 
 <sup>137</sup>Cs, 
 <sup>239</sup>Pu, 
 <sup>131</sup>I, etc. A large number of plant-derived compounds are known to possess highly effective absorbent capability.
