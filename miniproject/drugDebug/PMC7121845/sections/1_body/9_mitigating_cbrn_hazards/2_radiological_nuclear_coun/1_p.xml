<p id="Par49">Attempts have been made by various researchers to classify radioprotectors into different categories. However, there is no universal classification that is unanimously acceptable. A radioprotector can be defined as a substance [element, chemical or a compound of synthetic or molecular nature or biological compound(s)] that reduces the deleterious effects of radiation, when administered to living organisms, usually prior to irradiation (prophylactic administration), while radiorecovery agents are those that help in recuperation and augment recovery once the living organism has been exposed to radiation. Most agents available today fall in the former category. Since the damage resulting due to ionizing radiation in most cases cannot be totally reversed, the currently available radiorecovery agents exhibit limited efficacy. There is immense interest now to develop both categories of agents so that radiation damage can be treated holistically.</p>
