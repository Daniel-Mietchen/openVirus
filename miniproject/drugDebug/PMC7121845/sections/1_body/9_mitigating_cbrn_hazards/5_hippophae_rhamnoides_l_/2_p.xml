<p id="Par57">The main chemical constituents include carotene and soluble sugars. The berries are rich in vitamin C content, and calcium, chromium, cobalt, iron, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, potassium, sodium, strontium and zinc have been reported to be present. Malic and quinic acid are the major (&gt;90%) organic acids present in fruit juice of species of different origin. The volatiles responsible for aroma include 3-methyl butanol, butyl pentanoate, 2-methyl propyl 3-methyl butanoate, ethyl 2-methyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate. Quercetin, isorhamnetin, rhamnetin, steroids, terpenoids, alkaloids, fatty oil, etc. are also reported to be present. 
 <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> has been widely used for the treatment of circulatory disorders, vaginal mucositis, oral mucositis, wound healing, cutaneous eruptions, lung complaints, stomach malfunctioning, duodenal ulcers, cervical erosion, scalds, skin ulcers, hepatic injury, neoplasia and gastric cancers. It is also useful for treating skin ulcers, gastric disorders/cancers, mucositis, wounds and other high-altitude disorders. 
 <italic>Hippophae</italic> has been shown to effectively protect mammals against lethal ionizing radiation and acts via multifarious ways, including free radical scavenging, immune modulation, boosting antioxidant defence, etc. 
 <italic>Hippophae</italic> protects the haemopoietic system, gastrointestinal system and central nervous system against the deleterious effects of radiation and also mitigates gamma-radiation-induced genotoxicity (Swaroop et al.
