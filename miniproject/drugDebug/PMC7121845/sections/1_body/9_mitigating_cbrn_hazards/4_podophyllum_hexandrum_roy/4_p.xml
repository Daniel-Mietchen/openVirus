<p id="Par55">Studies by our group have shown that one of the mechanisms by which 
 <italic>Podophyllum hexandrum</italic> renders radioprotection is modulation of radiation-induced oxidative stress. Podophyllotoxin and other aryltetralin lignans in combination with rutin have been shown to play a crucial role in radioprotection. Whole-body radioprotection by 
 <italic>P. hexandrum</italic> is now well established (Fig.
