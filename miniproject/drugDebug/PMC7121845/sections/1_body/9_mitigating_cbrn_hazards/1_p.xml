<p id="Par48">One of the major threats faced by the Armed Forces is attack by CBRN agents. Very few medical countermeasures are available in the armamentarium of the services to deal with such hazards, which is life threatening in nature. DRDO labs are engaged in R&amp;D on developing safe and effective CBRN countermeasures from herbals, and several leads have been obtained. Some such leads obtained vis-Ã -vis CBRN countermeasures are discussed in the ensuing sections.</p>
