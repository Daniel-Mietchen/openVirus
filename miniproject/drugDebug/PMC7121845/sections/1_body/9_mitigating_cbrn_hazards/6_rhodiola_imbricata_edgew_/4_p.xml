<p id="Par61">The reported therapeutic activities of 
 <italic>Rhodiola rosea</italic>, a close species to 
 <italic>Rhodiola imbricata</italic>, and the present study matched indicating that it is an excellent candidate for investigation of biological activity particularly related to radiation protection. Comparative analyses of the biological activities associated with the plant have also been performed. Simultaneously, screening of the novel compounds as well as the different reported categories of compounds from this plant species, presumably responsible for radioprotection, is also continuing. Studies have revealed the ability of extract to effectively tackle radiation-induced oxidative stress.
