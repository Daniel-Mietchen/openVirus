In addition, to cater to the nation&#x02019;s security needs &#x02013; both external and internal &#x02013; India has over 1.0&#x000a0;million paramilitary personnel. The military personnel are deployed in diverse harsh environmental conditions to guard national sovereignty under diverse geoclimatic conditions and diverse terrains exposing them to unique conditions that are not perhaps encountered anywhere elsewhere on the globe. Homeland security is an important component of national security. The paramilitary and military personnel inevitably have to participate in low-intensity conflict (LIC) theatres also. Besides, the Indian military has always risen to the occasion and helped in disaster management, whenever there has been a natural calamity. The Indian military personnel have also been an integral part of several successful UN peacekeeping missions.</p><p id="Par3">Keeping the physical and mental health of soldiers is paramount from an operational perspective. In addition, they need to be updated and trained to be able to utilize state-of-the-art technologies. They need to be ever vigilant, be prepared for handling any situation and protecting national interests in a rapidly changing world. In order to keep the military fighting fit for operations, there is a need to equip the soldiers with state-of-the-art technologies, often disruptive technologies, products, processes and requisite paraphernalia with a human engineering perspective to support them and handle today&#x02019;s VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous) environment. DRDO well realizes that this can be only accomplished through continuous, concerted R&#x00026;D with a focus on new technologies and product development, synergizing the private industry sector along with academia. Today&#x02019;s military operations have to be conducted seamlessly, irrespective of environmental stressors like sub-zero temperatures, torrential rains, snow, extremes of humidity, lashing winds, extreme heat, etc. and/or in a nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) environment. In the Indian military context, the environmental hazards posed due to the geographical locale often prove more lethal to the health of a soldier than the military operation itself. More than the threat from enemy bullets is the threat of fluid loss from the body under desert conditions or frostbite and high-altitude pulmonary oedema on mountaintops in winter. High pressure of the water column can limit the performance of submariners. Even those who escape sickness may face problems of performance at altitudes in the Eastern and Western Himalayas, where the atmosphere is rarefied due to low oxygen availability. In fact in Siachen sector, more lives have been lost due to the environmental conditions rather than military operations in this ruthless sector.</p><p id="Par4">During the combat active period, the Indian military personnel are exposed to almost all of the environmental and occupational hazards in a single lifetime. The military personnel, depending on their field of activity, are exposed to various stresses in micro-environments like engine rooms of ships, submarines, aircraft cockpits, crew compartments of tanks and other combat vehicles which are usually cramped, hot, polluted by noise, smoke and toxic gases and radiation, and hence these also pose real threats to efficient performance and health of the warfighter.</p><p id="Par5">The operational needs of the Indian Defence Forces necessitate operations under unforgiving and inhospitable environments, which can severely impact both physical and cognitive performance of the personnel. The Life Sciences laboratories of DRDO are engaged in R&#x00026;D with the aim to develop processes, products and technologies and effective strategies to protect and enhance the operational efficiency of the Indian Armed Forces. The mandate of the Life Sciences laboratories in Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is to optimize performance of the of the human-intensive combat force, create soldier-system fit in the various weapon development programmes and help them in meeting the unique operational requirements in conventional and nonconventional warfare situations. The R&#x00026;D activities of the laboratories are focussed on recruitment, selection and development of appropriate human capital, development of intricate life support systems and technologies to protect against extreme and toxic/lethal environments, promotion of health and well-being of warfighter and development of strategic support systems. The fields of research encompass protective equipments and clothing, physiological-psychological aspects, protection against nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) warfare and high-altitude agro-animal technologies to meet fresh food requirement of troops at high altitudes, exploiting bioenergy as emergency fuel and meeting instant food requirements for high-altitude battlefield operations.</p><p id="Par6">Over the last five decades, the endeavours of the Life Sciences cluster of laboratories have resulted in:</p><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="450571_1_En_18_Figa_HTML" id="MO1"/><p id="Par7">The Life Sciences group of laboratories of DRDO have made significant contributions towards improving the health and performance of soldiers deployed at high altitude, cold, desert, under water, both in air and space and low-intensity conflict areas. The various labs have also made immense progress in agriculture and food technology for adverse environments such as extreme altitude, space, etc. Further, these labs are also engaged in the development of novel technologies to detect, decontaminate and protect against chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) threats. Research in the various laboratories and sponsored projects cover an entire gamut of areas ranging from biomedical, food and high-altitude agro-animal and bioenergy research. Development of herbal technologies is an important area of research where attention is being focused in DRDO, in keeping with prevalence of rich traditions of diverse systems of medicine in India that have been tried, tested and proved over a period of thousands of years. Perhaps no other system of medicine has stood the test of time for such a long period.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Resurgence of Interest in Herbal Technologies in India</title><p id="Par8">Affordable, accessible and acceptable healthcare for all sections of society is the need of the hour. Meeting the health needs of population of over seven billion people, majority of which reside in developing/underdeveloped countries where the population just cannot afford costly healthcare, has necessitated the revival of traditional systems of medicine and the development of cost-effective and pragmatic strategies for the masses. Besides, the disease preventive as well as curative aspects of Indian herbal medicine, its safety and efficacy proved over thousands of years, have made it a preferred choice amongst the masses. The Indian system of medicine, Ayurveda, has evolved as a result of years of medical practice with medicinal plants in humans. India is endowed with extremely rich biodiversity and is home to innumerable medicinal and aromatic plant species which have been used extensively to prevent and/or cure diseases. Similarly, other alternative systems of health like Siddha, Unani and Homoeopathy are now officially recognized, and a ministry known as AYUSH &#x02013; Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy &#x02013; has been set up. In view of the huge population of India, it is imperative to develop cost-effective and sustainable health solutions for the public at large. Only one particular system of medicine cannot meet the health challenges posed by the burgeoning population. It is the author&#x02019;s firm belief that we have to consider the rich, Indian traditional systems of medicine for both their preventive and therapeutic aspects and utilize them for meeting the health challenges of our country. Besides, treatments for all diseases are not available in the allopathic system of medicine. The undesirable side effects of modern medicines, the mounting costs of conventional hospital-based healthcare and the emergence of lifestyle-related diseases are some of the reasons for the population to consider alternative simpler and cheaper forms of treatment. Effective and holistic treatment for several diseases like cancer, AIDS, emerging and reemerging bacterial, fungal and viral diseases, Alzheimer&#x02019;s, Parkinson&#x02019;s and several emerging and reemerging diseases are still not available in modern systems of medicine leading to more and more patients taking recourse to alternative therapies for improving the quality of life. Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> enumerates the reason why recourse to herbal medicine is the natural choice for sustainable, affordable and acceptable healthcare for the population.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Why herbal medicine is a natural choice</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>S.

Some areas of research where DRDO is focussing its attention vis-&#x000e0;-vis herbal technology development are highlighted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Documentation of traditional knowledge on herbs of some of the inaccessible areas of the country, mainly high altitude, desert and remote regions of the country, has been carried out.

A plethora of stressors like physical, chemical, immunological, biological and emotional factors are involved in the manifestation of stress. Soldiers staying and working in adverse climatic conditions such as cold, heat and high altitude also suffer from stress-induced disorders and at times exhibit decreased or suboptimal levels of physical/cognitive performance due to stress. Adaptogens are biologically active substances that are known to improve physical and mental performance under adverse environmental conditions and induce resistance against stressors, e.g. extreme cold and heat, pain and infections. A plethora of herbals possess adaptogenic properties and are used in different traditional systems of medicine for improving overall stress resistance. Taking leads from India&#x02019;s traditional system of medicine &#x02013; the Ayurveda, a formulation &#x02013; Composite Indian Herbal Preparation I (CIHP I) has been developed by DIPAS to increase the physical performance of our soldiers who have to operate in high-altitude environments under extremes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The formulation CIHP I comprises of ingredients (derived from seven different plants used in Ayurveda) and the following aqueous herbal extracts: <italic>Asparagus racemosus</italic> wild roots, 29.23%; <italic>Withania somnifera</italic> Dunal roots, 16.92%; <italic>Pueraria tuberosa</italic> DC tubers, 16.92%; <italic>Mucuna pruriens</italic> DC seeds, 8.46%; <italic>Dioscorea bulbifera</italic> Linn. rhizomes, 8.46%; <italic>Argyreia speciosa</italic> sweet whole plant, 8.46%; <italic>Piper longum</italic> Linn. fruit, 4.32%; and Asphalt extract 7.32%.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Composite Indian herbal preparations: unique adaptogens</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="450571_1_En_18_Fig2_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig></p><p id="Par12">CIHP I was tested for its adaptogenic activity using C-H-R animal model. CIHP I helped in improving resistance to C-H-R-induced hypothermia and enhanced post-stress recovery to regain Trec 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. In Border Security Force volunteers, CIHP I intake was found to restrict combat stress-induced deterioration in both physical and mental performance (Srivastava et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1996</xref>). Another Composite Indian Herbal Preparation II (CIHP II), a combination of numerous plant ingredients and minerals (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>), was tested for its adaptogenic action using C-H-R animal model. The acclimatization to hypoxia of extreme altitude was facilitated by the administration of CIHP II during exposure (Grover et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>). Both CIHP I and II augmented oxygen delivery to biological system by increasing red cell 2,3-diphosphoglyceric acid levels during hypobaric hypoxic exposure and improved cellular membrane permeability and maintenance of blood glucose and muscle glycogen levels. CIHPs also regulated the mobilization of lipids from adipose tissue and their preferential utilization for thermogenesis as compared to carbohydrates (Grover et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1995</xref>; Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2000</xref>).

India is extremely rich in phytobiodiversity in view of the prevailing divergent ecosystems and considerable altitudinal variations in the country. The Himalayan ranges possess huge phytobiodiversity in terms of various plant species, including angiosperms, gymnosperms, pteridophytes, bryophytes, lichens, bacteria and fungi. Of this diversity, nearly 25% species are endemic to the Himalayas. The Himalayas are considered to be a treasure house of medicinal, aromatic, edible wild and other important plants, which have been used by the local populations for meeting their daily necessities since ages, and this long dependence on plant wealth enriched their knowledge about the multifarious uses of phytodiversity. The high-altitude regions of Ladakh and Lahaul-Spiti in the North West and Tawang in the North East are strategically important because of the international borders with China and Pakistan. The Armed Forces, deployed in these regions, have to face extreme environmental conditions, as the region is prone to landslides, heavy rainfall, cloud bursts, avalanches and natural calamities. At times, these landlocked areas become inaccessible by road and/or air. In view of the likelihood of availability of food and medicines in such areas becoming compromised under certain operational conditions, a need was felt to develop databases on wild plants that can help sustenance and survival of troops in such regions in case of an emergency. The survival garden can play an important role in helping the troops operate unhindered under any circumstances.<fig id="Fig8"><label>Fig. 8</label><caption><p>The survival garden for soldiers can be immensely helpful during emergency situations</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="450571_1_En_18_Fig8_HTML" id="MO9"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Improving Combat Performance and Operational Efficiency</title><sec id="Sec13"><title>DIP-G-FIT: A Unique Formulation for Improved Soldier Performance</title><p id="Par25">An oriental fungus that has been used for promoting health and longevity in the Himalayan tracts of India, China, Japan and several other Asian countries has been used to develop a medicinal formulation - DIP-G-Fit for enhancing performance in soldiers (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>).

The involvement of the local populace either overtly or covertly is a common feature of most low-intensity conflicts. The low-intensity conflicts usually involve contiguous regions/states and ultimately aim to destabilize and weaken the nation. India has witnessed several low-intensity conflicts of varying nature, degree and contexts, and these pose immense problems to law enforcement agencies in general and the military in particular for handling such issues with a sense of responsibility. Use of force under difficult inevitable circumstances often results in death or maiming of local populations leading to immense furore, e.g. the use of pellet guns to disperse mobs in North India resulted in serious eye injuries to several people. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of India ruled that being a welfare state, it is the duty of the government to ensure safety of its people as well as security forces.

Particularly when they take shelter in hideouts or in house/building, it is very difficult to take them out without collateral casualties. During counterinsurgency operations, security personnel have to disarm/incapacitate agitated individuals, disperse the crowd or capture militants held up in a bunker or building. The available methods in vogue are normally lethal in nature, e.g. small arms and grenades, which result in the loss of life/bodily injuries. There is a need for a non-lethal aerosol chemical-based weapon system, which is instantaneously effective and totally safe in controlling agitated and misguided individuals and can be used to incapacitate them leading to their capture.</p><p id="Par40">In the Defence Research and Development Establishment (DRDE), Gwalior has developed a unique non-lethal munition, named as oleoresin-based grenades (Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">17</xref>).

A radioprotector can be defined as a substance [element, chemical or a compound of synthetic or molecular nature or biological compound(s)] that reduces the deleterious effects of radiation, when administered to living organisms, usually prior to irradiation (prophylactic administration), while radiorecovery agents are those that help in recuperation and augment recovery once the living organism has been exposed to radiation. Most agents available today fall in the former category. Since the damage resulting due to ionizing radiation in most cases cannot be totally reversed, the currently available radiorecovery agents exhibit limited efficacy. There is immense interest now to develop both categories of agents so that radiation damage can be treated holistically.</p><p id="Par50">Vasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1999</xref> of the Institute of Aviation and Space Medicine, Moscow, classified prophylactic antiradiation drugs into the following categories: (i) drugs having short-term and long-term action drugs, (ii) drugs that stimulate radioresistance, (iii) drugs that suppress symptoms of primary radiation reaction, (iv) drugs that detoxify early and (v) drugs that act by absorption or elimination of radionuclides from an organism. Nair et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2001</xref>) have classified radioprotective agents into three categories: (i) radioprotectors, (ii) adaptogens and (iii) absorbents. Radioprotectors include compounds like antioxidants and others that possess sulfhydryl groups. Adaptogens in general are non-toxic stimulators of radioresistance. Usually these are natural biological protectors that offer protection against low levels of ionizing radiation primarily by regulating immunity and modulating the endogenous antioxidants, thereby improving non-specific resistance in biological systems. The last category comprises of absorbents that protect against internal radiation injuries that result due to ingestion of radionuclides. Such agents prevent the incorporation and absorption of radionuclides like <sup>90</sup>Sr, <sup>137</sup>Cs, <sup>239</sup>Pu, <sup>131</sup>I, etc. A large number of plant-derived compounds are known to possess highly effective absorbent capability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>The High-Altitude Himalayan Plant Species as Radiation Countermeasure Agents (Fig. <xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">23</xref>)</title><p id="Par5500">

The priority index algorithms were used as a basis for evaluation of relevance factor of various physiological targets or bioactivity parameters specific to a particular microorganism(s) or inflammatory condition(s) in conferring antibiotic resistance over a period of time (Chakotiya et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR07">2016</xref>; Tanwar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2017a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">b</xref>). Similarly, the potential herbals identified the basis of classical bioprospection were subjected to binary, weightage and fuzzy set-based analysis using assigned relevance to each activity parameter as dependent variable. The final optimized matrix provided several potential herbal leads. These identified leads were further carried forward for evaluation of their antimicrobial activity as well as anti-inflammatory potential against a novel standardized &#x02018;vulnerable animal model&#x02019; (collagen type II-induced rheumatoid arthritis in combination with opportunistic infections involving multidrug resistant pathogens as worst-case scenario) (Tanwar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2017a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">b</xref>). The identified herbal leads (e.g. <italic>Camellia sinensis</italic>, <italic>Berberis aristata</italic>, <italic>etc.</italic>) could be utilized as novel holistic drugs in the future for the management of biothreats posed, particularly in vulnerable populations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec37"><title>Broad-Spectrum Antiviral Drugs</title><p id="Par71">There is a dearth of antiviral drugs in modern systems of medicine due to the rapid rate of mutation found in viruses. Viral pathogens pose a serious threat, especially the clinical viruses (HIV, hepatitis viruses, etc.), natural emerging viruses (avian and swine influenza strains, SARS, novel H1N1, H1N5, etc.) and viruses relevant to potential bioterrorism (Ebola, smallpox, etc.) (Rider et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). Unfortunately, there are relatively few prophylactics or therapeutics available for management of viral diseases and pandemics (Arora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010f</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). A plethora of medicinal plants exhibit promise for the treatment of viral infections, as several of them possess potent broad-spectrum antiviral activity (Arora et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2013</xref>). In the past, evaluation of antiviral activity of medicinal plants was constrained in view of the highly infectious nature of viruses and lack of suitable separation techniques for the identification of antiviral components. Development of vector-based strategies, in which non-infectious molecular clone of a virus is used for antiviral screening purposes and advancement in separation technologies, has offered promise for medicinal plants usage in modern antiviral drug discovery (Mukhtar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2008</xref>). With increase in the virulence of viruses, emergence of new viral strains and non-availability of broad-spectrum synthetic drugs, there is a need to explore plants for the development of new and potent antiviral drugs.</p><p id="Par72">DRDO has been engaged in the development of new candidate drugs for treating viral infections. <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> has been tested for its anti-dengue potential (Jain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>). Dengue virus occurs as four distinct serotypes, viz. dengue 1, 2, 3 and 4. Symptomatic dengue virus infection ranges from a self-limited febrile illness and dengue fever to a more severe disease, dengue haemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome. Medical treatment of dengue poses serious issues as virtually no targeted therapeutic agents are available to treat the disease and consequently whatever treatment is given is mostly supportive in nature. Jain et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2008</xref>) evaluated the anti-dengue activity of <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf extract in dengue virus type II infected blood-derived human macrophages. The dengue virus-infected cells were treated with <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf extract and compared with the commercially available antiviral drug &#x02013; ribavirin. The extract was able to maintain the cell viability of dengue-infected cells at par with ribavirin, along with the decrease and increase in TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b3;, respectively. Anti-dengue activity of <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> extract was further determined by the traditional plaque assay. The results suggested that the <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf extract has significant anti-dengue activity and has potential for the treatment of dengue.</p><p id="Par73">Understanding and modulating the signal transduction pathways are imperative to the development of new therapeutic agents. It is well known that the recognition of virus infection by retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG) I and melanoma differentiation-associated protein (MDA) 5, which are RNA helicases, and interferon-stimulated gene (ISG) 15 can activate a cascade of signal transduction pathways leading to production of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines that synchronize the removal of the virus from the host. However, it has been demonstrated that RNA-helicase-mediated innate immunity plays an important role in defending the host from infection. During endeavours to identify plant-derived antivirals that could selectively enhance ISG- and RNA-helicase-mediated antiviral immune responses, <italic>Rhodiola</italic> was found to be effective. <italic>Rhodiola</italic> treatment significantly promoted ISG, RIG-I and MDA 5 gene expression and an antiviral immune response against dengue virus infection. <italic>Rhodiola</italic> treatment also induced interferon (IFN) &#x003b2; and other cytokines, including IL-1&#x003b2;, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-8 in infected cells. <italic>Rhodiola</italic> also upregulated phosphorylated eIF-2&#x003b1;, PKR and NF-kB in infected cells. In addition, the number of NK cells was also increased upon treatment with <italic>Rhodiola</italic> in dengue virus-infected human PBMCs. Based on the studies, Diwaker et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2014</xref>) demonstrated that <italic>Rhodiola</italic> induces pharmacological modulation of RIG-I, MDA 5 and ISG signal transduction pathways supporting the induction of a favourable antiviral immune response against dengue virus and, can, therefore, be a novel therapeutic strategy for the management of dengue infection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec38"><title>Chemical Warfare Countermeasures</title><p id="Par74">Chemical warfare agents (CWAs) and toxic industrial chemicals (TICs) can pose problems during military conflicts and terrorism since most CWA and TIC exposures are difficult to manage as these agents have a rapid onset of action and can kill, injure or incapacitate human beings within no time. The mostly unprepared individuals get affected almost immediately; the first responders can get accidentally exposed, and the population in the vicinity can get affected rapidly. The specific mode of toxicity of these agents is varied; they are often mediated either directly or indirectly with increased oxidative stress in biological systems. Consequently, a plethora of antioxidants have been explored as potential medical countermeasures for CWA/TIC exposures. In DRDO, studies have been performed with a diverse array of CWAs, model organisms, exposure systems, target organs and antioxidants, looking at an almost equally assorted set of endpoints. Endeavours at treating CWAs/TICs with antioxidants have often met with mixed results, though exploration of antioxidants as medical countermeasures for CWA/TIC management has shown some potential. A plethora of herbal drugs have been utilized for their protective efficacy against chemical warfare agents, including extremely toxic sulphur mustard (SM). Ethanolic extract of <italic>Hippophae rhamnoides</italic> leaf (HL-EOH), water and ethanolic extract of <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> fruit (HF-W and HF-EOH) and <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> flavone from fruit (HR-flavone) were evaluated against percutaneously administered sulphur mustard (Vijayaraghavan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>). The <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> extracts (1&#x000a0;g/kg; 3 doses; po) significantly protected SM-induced lethality. Following percutaneous administration of sulphur mustard, reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione levels decreased, and malondialdehyde was elevated. Oral administration of HL-EOH and HR-flavone significantly protected against loss of body weight. Following oral administration of ethanolic leaf extract and HR-flavone, recovery GSH, GSSG and MDA levels were recorded. The authors concluded that percutaneous administration of sulphur mustard induces oxidative stress, and ethanolic extract of leaf of <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> and <italic>H. rhamnoides</italic> flavone from fruit can significantly protect against sulphur mustard-induced toxicity.</p><p id="Par75">Prophylactic effect of gossypin (3,3&#x02032;,4&#x02032;,5,7,8-hexahydroxyflavone 8-glucoside) &#x02013; an anti-inflammatory compound widely used as a herbal remedy for treating diabetes, jaundice, inflammation melanoma and glioma &#x02013; has been demonstrated against percutaneously administered sulphur mustard in mice (Gautam and Vijayaraghavan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>).</p><p id="Par76">Various antioxidants like trolox (6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) and quercetin have been shown to protect the liver and lung tissues from oxidative damage caused by sulphur mustard exposure through inhalation and percutaneous routes (Kumar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2001</xref>).

They are constantly exposed to a variety of bloodsucking insects such as mosquitoes, blackflies, ticks, mites, rat flea, sandflies and leeches during their operational postings. Insects are carriers (vectors) of dreaded diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya, etc. Various methods have been used for the ecological condition with certain limitations. Application of insecticide residual spraying causes inconvenience to children and older persons and can cause toxicity. A better method would be to use personal protection measures to protect human from the painful bites of bloodsucking organisms such as mosquito, sandfly, blackfly, rat flea and bedbugs.</p><p id="Par79">Amongst vectors, mosquitoes are responsible for causing major vector-borne diseases in India and other tropical countries. Use of repellents and insecticides is the best possible methods to keep mosquitoes at bay. Synthetic repellents used in commercially available mosquito kits are toxic to human health and detrimental to environment. A herbal mosquito repellent has been formulated using six essential oils of indigenous plant species which can be used with the help of vapourizing kit (Fig. <xref rid="Fig33" ref-type="fig">33</xref>). It is a formulation of essential oils of traditional herbs, is non-toxic as compared to the commercially available products, has natural fragrance and is eco-friendly.

A herbal adjuvant is an agent of natural origin that may stimulate the immune system and increase the response to a vaccine, without having any specific antigenic effect in itself. Adjuvants have been used for decades as important agents for generation of strong immune response to vaccine antigens. Besides generating strong immune response, they also act as immunomodulators by influencing the type and character of antibody generated. Defence Institute of Physiology and Allied Sciences (DIPAS) has developed a new herbal adjuvant, called DIP-HIP (Fig. <xref rid="Fig35" ref-type="fig">35</xref>), and compared its efficacy to standard adjuvants, viz. complete Freund&#x02019;s adjuvant and alum.<fig id="Fig35"><label>Fig. 35</label><caption><p>A novel herbal adjuvant for increasing vaccine response</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="450571_1_En_18_Fig35_HTML" id="MO36"/></fig></p><p id="Par83">Antigen-specific immunoglobulin levels have shown to be significantly enhanced by DIP-HIP. Upon administration of DIP-HIP, cytokine profile correlates well with the Th1 and Th2 type of immune response. Immunization through different routes like intraperitoneal and intramuscular did not show any significant difference nor caused any muscular damage, granulomatous reaction or dystrophy. The shelf life of DIP-HIP is more than 3&#x000a0;years, whereas in the formulation with antigen, it is about 4&#x000a0;months at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0; C. No haemolytic activity is observed on the treatment of both human and animal erythrocytes with DIP-HIP. Incorporation of DIP-HIP results in enhancing, accelerating and prolonging the antigen specific-antibody responses in animals. Further advantages of DIP-HIP include enhancement of immunogenicity, reduction of antigen amount needed for a successful immunization and reduction of frequency of booster immunization, without any muscular damage or side effects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec43"><title>Herbal Hypolipidemic</title><p id="Par84">A herbal hypolipidemic DIP-LIP has been obtained from a high-altitude growing plant.

DRDO has been making concerted efforts to consolidate and streamline research and development endeavours on herbal products to provide unique solutions to the Armed Forces. In the process, at times some spin-offs emanate, which find practical application in both military and civil setting. With a view to meeting emerging challenges, the traditional knowledge on herbs of high altitudes, desert areas, Central Himalayan and North East region, etc. is being documented, and research carried out to generate scientific data that can be useful for the Armed Forces. There is a paradigm shift towards acceptance of scientifically validated herbals as effective prophylactic and therapeutic agents. The grant of the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to discoveries concerning novel therapies for some of the most devastating parasitic diseases, viz. river blindness, lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) and malaria, has once again highlighted the importance that herbal drugs are receiving in today&#x02019;s world. Drugs derived from <italic>Streptomyces avermitilis</italic> and <italic>Artemisia annua</italic> were found to be effective against parasitic diseases. However, it is a paradox that in our country, where Ayurveda has been a very successful and effective system of medicine for over 5000&#x000a0;years, there is still some amount of scepticism among civil health experts when it comes to acceptance of herbal drugs, and services are no exception.. This view has to change in coming times if the full benefit of scientifically validated herbal drugs has to reach the users. The realization that herbal drugs are effective and safe and can solve the emerging problems of our Armed Forces will lead to induction of more and more products to the advantage of our soldiers who operate in harsh and extreme terrain and inhospitable operational conditions. As alluded to earlier, serious endeavours are underway in DRDO towards protecting the warfighter and promoting performance through the development of scientifically validated herbal products, processes and technologies.
