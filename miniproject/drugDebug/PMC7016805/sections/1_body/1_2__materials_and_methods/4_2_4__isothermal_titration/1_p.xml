<p>Measurements were made using a MicroCal VP-ITC (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) at 25 °C. For all measurements, DDX3X protein was dialyzed overnight against 20 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 10% (

 <italic>v</italic>) glycerol, 1 mM TCEP, and this dialysis buffer used to dilute RK-33. RK-33 (50 μM or 200 μM in 7.5% (
 <italic>v</italic>/
 <italic>v</italic>) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)), or an equivalent % DMSO, was titrated into a solution containing DDX3X (17 μM). Measurements were made using 7.5 µL injections and 180 s between each injection. ITC data were analyzed with Origin software version 7.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA, USA).
