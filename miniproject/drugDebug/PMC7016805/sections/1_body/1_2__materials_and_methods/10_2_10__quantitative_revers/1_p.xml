<p>qRT-PCR to estimate the number of viral genomes was performed as previously for RSV [
 <xref rid="B31-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B32-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and DENV-2 [
 <xref rid="B30-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. For WNV and hPIV-3 infections, supernatants from infected Vero cell cultures were extracted using the Isolate II RNA extraction kit (Bioline, London, UK), and the absolute number of RNA copies determined using TaqMan Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) by extrapolation from a standard curve generated from in vitro-transcribed WNV and hPIV-3 RNA. qRT-PCR conditions were 50 °C for 5 min, 95 °C for 20 s, 40 cycles of 95 °C for 3 s and 60 °C for 30 s. RT-PCR was used to detect hPIV-3 or WNV mRNA. Primers and probes used were: WNV probe: 5′-6FAM-TCACACTCTTCCGGCTGTCAATCAC-3′; WNV primers: 5′-CAAACTTTAAGGCAAGCAGGG-3′ and 5′-ATTCCTACCAATGCGTCCTC-3′. hPIV-3 probe: 5′-6FAM-CCCGGGACACCCAGTTGTGTTGCA-3′; hPIV-3 primers: 5′-CCATCTGTTGGACCAGGGAT-3′ and 5′-TGATTGCAGTCCCTCTGTGT-3′. Dose-response curves were plotted from the viral RNA copies versus the logarithmic value of the concentrations of RK-33. Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 7 software (San Diego, CA, USA). Outlier points were excluded.
