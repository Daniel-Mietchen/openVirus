<p>DDX3X-mediated ATP hydrolysis was measured using a modification of the protocol of Epling et al. [
 <xref rid="B26-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], except that activity was measured in the presence of poly(I:C), a synthetic analogue of dsRNA (InvivoGen, San Diego, CA, USA), to stimulate ATPase activity. Reactions were performed in pentaplicate in a final volume of 50 μL in 96-microwell assay plates (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) and reagents diluted using diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Reactions consisted of ATPase reaction buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 1.5 mM DTT, 1.5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>), 200 nM DDX3X (residues 1–580) or the DDX3X K230E (residues 1–580) variant as a negative control, 0.02 mg/mL poly(I:C), with RK-33 (0–250 μM) or equivalent (2% (

 <italic>v</italic>)) DMSO, and 0.3 mM ATP (Sigma-Aldrich). Following incubation for 60 min at room temperature, 100 μL Biomol
 <sup>®</sup> Green (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA), a colorimetric reagent that binds to free inorganic phosphate (Pi), was added to all wells. After 15 min at room temperature, absorbance at 620 nm, which correlates with the detection of Pi, was measured using a FLUOstar Omega plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). Phosphate standards (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY, USA) were serially diluted (0–40 μM) to generate a standard curve to enable quantitation of the Pi generated by DDX3X catalytic activity in the assay.
