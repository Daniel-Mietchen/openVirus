<p>Since (1) DDX3X is an essential host co-factor for the replication of multiple viruses, (2) inhibitors of DDX3X can act as broad-spectrum antivirals [

 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], we decided to test RK-33â€²s ability to inhibit infection by viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> families. Here, we validate DDX3X as a target of RK-33 for the first, time using a range of analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry and in vitro ATPase and RNA unwinding assays. Importantly, using cell-based infectious assays, we establish for the first time that RK-33 has antiviral activity against not only human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but also several flaviviruses including DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2), Zika virus (ZIKV) and West Nile virus (WNV). These results highlight RK-33 as a broad-spectrum antiviral agent and support the notion that DDX3X is a viable drug target.
