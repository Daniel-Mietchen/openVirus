<p>Viral infections pose a risk to human health worldwide, with an urgent need for efficacious antiviral strategies. The relatively few antivirals in use typically function by targeting a specific viral protein critical to viral replication, and hence are only effective against a single pathogen. Although potentially effective in the short-term, their use can lead to selection for drug resistant strains that threaten the long-term effectiveness of the treatment [
