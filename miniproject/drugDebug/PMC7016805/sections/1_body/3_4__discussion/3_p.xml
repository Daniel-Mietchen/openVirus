<p>REN analogues that modulate the helicase activity of target viral or host helicases have been shown to have antiviral activity against HIV-1 [

 <xref rid="B22-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], JEV [
 <xref rid="B22-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], WNV [

 <xref rid="B23-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and hepatitis B [

 <xref rid="B20-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Consistent with the antiviral properties of REN derivatives and of agents targeting DDX3X, our virus infection studies reveal here for the first time that the DDX3X-targeting REN derivative RK-33 also has antiviral properties. Notably, RK-33 exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity, inhibiting the replication of RSV from the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family, and the closely related flaviviruses DENV and WNV. Further to this, we are the first to show that RK-33 can also inhibit the replication of additional members of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> families, namely hPIV-3 and ZIKV, respectively. Our findings suggest a hitherto unrecognized role for DDX3X in hPIV-3 and ZIKV replication and may further expand the list of viruses for which anti-DDX3X agents may be effective and reinforce the antiviral properties of REN derivatives.
