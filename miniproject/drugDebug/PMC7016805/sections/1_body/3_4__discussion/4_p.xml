<p>Collectively, our findings support the idea that DDX3X-targeting agents have potential as broad-spectrum antiviral agents, and that RK-33 is one such agent, although it should be stressed that demonstration of RK-33 selectivity for DDX3X in a cellular context remains the focus of further study in this laboratory. Our data further suggest that RK-33′s ability to block DDX3X’s ATPase and RNA unwinding activities is the basis of its broad-spectrum antiviral properties.</p>
