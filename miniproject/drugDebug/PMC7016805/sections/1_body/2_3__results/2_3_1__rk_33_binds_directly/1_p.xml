<p>To confirm direct binding of RK-33 to recombinant human DDX3X (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f001">Figure 1</xref>A), we exploited the spectroscopic properties of RK-33, which absorbs strongly between 330 and 430 nm (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f001">Figure 1</xref>B), in multi-wavelength analytical ultracentrifugation experiments. We collected sedimentation velocity data at 290 and 410 nm; the latter enabled the specific detection of RK-33 either alone or in complex with DDX3X, or DDX3X K230E that harbors a substitution within motif I (Walker A) and is deficient in ATP hydrolysis and RNA-unwinding [

 <sub>20,w</sub>) of 3.6S. DDX3X data collected at both 290 and 410 nm and in the presence of 100 μM RK-33 also revealed a 3.6S species, indicating RK-33 bound directly to DDX3X (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f001">Figure 1</xref>C, pink). However, when DDX3X K230E was incubated in the presence of 100 μM RK-33 this overlapping species was absent (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f001">Figure 1</xref>D, pink), indicating a lack of complex formation. These findings imply that RK-33 binds residue K230 within the Walker A motif, which forms part of the DDX3X active site.
