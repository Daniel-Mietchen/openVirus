<p>To assess the effect of RK-33 binding on DDX3X, increasing concentrations of the agent were added to a colorimetric assay detecting DDX3X’s ability to hydrolyze ATP and generate free Pi in the presence of poly(I:C). Inhibition was clearly evident, with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) of ~40 μM RK-33 (
