<p>Next, we tested whether RK-33 could inhibit DDX3X from unwinding a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) using a helicase unwinding assay, where the fluorescent RNA products are analyzed by quantitative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Purified recombinant DDX3X (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f001">Figure 1</xref>A) was incubated with an RNA duplex, in which one strand bears a 5′ Cy5 fluorescent label, in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of RK-33. In the absence of RK-33, DDX3X (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f002">Figure 2</xref>C), was capable of unwinding the RNA duplex, as indicated by the appearance of ssRNA. As expected, DDX3X K230E remained incapable of unwinding RNA in the presence of RK-33 (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f002">Figure 2</xref>F). In contrast, DDX3X unwinding activity was progressively impaired by increasing concentrations of RK-33, with an IC
 <sub>50</sub> of 35 μM (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f002">Figure 2</xref>A). Together, these findings establish that RK-33 binding can inhibit DDX3X’s ability to both hydrolyze ATP and unwind RNA, consistent with RK-33 binding to the Walker A motif.
