<p>Since RK-33 has only been tested for its anticancer properties, we tested its ability to limit infection by key members of the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> (RSV and hPIV-3) and 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (WNV, DENV-2, ZIKV) families. Vero cells were infected at an MOI of 1 with RSV [
 <xref rid="B34-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], hPIV-3, DENV-2 [
 <xref rid="B30-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], ZIKV [
 <xref rid="B32-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="B35-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or WNV [
 <xref rid="B35-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], followed 2 h later by the addition of increasing concentrations of RK-33. Then, 22 h later, virus production was quantified by plaque assays and qRT-PCR analysis of the cell supernatant (DENV-2, ZIKV, WNV, hPIV-3) and cell lysates (RSV). Strikingly, RK-33 potently inhibited not only DENV-2, ZIKV and WNV (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="cells-09-00170-f003">Figure 3</xref>D,E), with EC
 <sub>50</sub>s of ≤10 μM (see 
 <xref rid="cells-09-00170-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for pooled data). These results were consistent with qRT-PCR analysis indicating that RK-33 inhibited all viruses with comparable EC
 <sub>50</sub> values (
