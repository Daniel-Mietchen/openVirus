 <xref rid="B11-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Since DDX3X plays a role in the replication of various viruses [

 <xref rid="B7-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-cells-09-00170" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], we set out here for the first time to confirm RK-33â€²s ability to bind directly to DDX3X, inhibit its enzymatic activities, and test its ability to inhibit a range of viral infections.
