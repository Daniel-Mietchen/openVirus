  <p>RK-33 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of infectious virus. Vero cells were infected with (
   <bold>A</bold>) dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV-2), (
   <bold>B</bold>) Zika virus (ZIKV), (
   <bold>C</bold>) West Nile virus (WNV), (
   <bold>D</bold>) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or (
   <bold>E</bold>) human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV-3) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 for 2 h, after which virus was removed, and fresh medium containing 2% FBS was supplemented with the indicated concentration of RK-33. Released virus samples (for hPIV-3, DENV-2, ZIKV and WNV) or cell-associated samples (for RSV) were collected 22 h later, and viral titres (expressed as plaque forming units (pfu) per mL) determined by plaque assay. Dose-response curves were plotted from the viral titres (pfu) versus the logarithmic value of the concentrations of RK-33. Results represent the mean +/âˆ’ standard deviation (SD) for duplicate wells from a single assay, representative of two (n = 2) independent experiments. See 
   <xref rid="cells-09-00170-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for pooled data from the two assays.
