  <p>RK-33 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of virus replication. Vero cells were infected with (
   <bold>A</bold>) DENV-2, (
   <bold>B</bold>) ZIKV, (
   <bold>C</bold>) WNV, (
   <bold>D</bold>) RSV or (
   <bold>E</bold>) hPIV-3 at an MOI of 1 for 2 h, after which virus was removed, and fresh medium containing 2% FBS or 2% FBS supplemented with the indicated concentration of RK-33. Released virus samples (for hPIV-3, DENV-2, ZIKV and WNV) or cell-associated samples (for RSV) were collected 22 h later, and viral RNA (vRNA) copies determined by qRT-PCR. Dose-response curves were plotted from the vRNA copies versus the logarithmic value of the concentrations of RK-33. Results represent the mean +/âˆ’ SD for duplicate wells from a single assay, representative of two (n = 2) independent experiments. See 
   <xref rid="cells-09-00170-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for pooled data from the two assays.
