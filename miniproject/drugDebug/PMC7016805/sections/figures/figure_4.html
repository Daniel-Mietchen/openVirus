 <caption> RK-33 is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of virus replication. Vero cells were infected with ( A) DENV-2, ( B) ZIKV, ( C) WNV, ( D) RSV or ( E) hPIV-3 at an MOI of 1 for 2 h, after which virus was removed, and fresh medium containing 2% FBS or 2% FBS supplemented with the indicated concentration of RK-33. Released virus samples (for hPIV-3, DENV-2, ZIKV and WNV) or cell-associated samples (for RSV) were collected 22 h later, and viral RNA (vRNA) copies determined by qRT-PCR. Dose-response curves were plotted from the vRNA copies versus the logarithmic value of the concentrations of RK-33. Results represent the mean +/âˆ’ SD for duplicate wells from a single assay, representative of two (n = 2) independent experiments. See Table 1 for pooled data from the two assays. </caption>
