<p>Three randomized controlled clinical trials reported the effects of hepatoprotective agents on liver fibrosis markers, HA, IV-C and PIIIP. From the three studies, the test and control groups consisted of 121 and 118 subjects, respectively. The heterogeneity between the studies was statistically significant (I2 &gt; 50%). Thus, a random-effects model was used. The results indicated that hepatoprotective agents were indeed associated with improved indices of hepatic fibrosis compared to placebo: HA (WMD = -55.65, 95% CI [-75.00, -36.31]), IV-C (WMD = -29.23, 95% CI [-41.21, -17.25]), PIIIP (WMD = -53.79, 95% CI [-69.03, -38.55]) (
