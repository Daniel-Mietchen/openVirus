<p>Five randomized controlled clinical trials were employed to test the efficacy of two hepatoprotective agents compared to only one to treat patients with chronic hepatitis B. There were 618 subjects in the two hepatoprotective agents, and the single hepatoprotective agent groups, respectively. The heterogeneity between the studies was statistically significant (I2 &gt; 50%). Using a random effects model, meta-analysis showed that the two hepatoprotective agents group was better than the single agent to reduce ALT, AST, GGT, ALP and TBIL levels in patients with hepatitis B. ALT (WMD=-31.44; 95% CI [-48.57,-14.32]), AST (WMD = -14.54; 95% CI [-29.24, 0.16]), GGT (WMD = -26.98; 95% CI [-54.66ï¼Œ0.70]), ALP (WMD = -29.86; 95% CI [-52.65, -7.07]), TBIL (WMD = -4.84; 95% CI [-9.86, 0.18]) (
