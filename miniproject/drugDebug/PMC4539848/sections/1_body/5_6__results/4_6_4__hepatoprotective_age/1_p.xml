<p>Five randomized controlled clinical trials reported the effects of three hepatoprotective agents compared with placebo on liver function indexes in patients with chronic hepatitis B, including ALT and TBIL. In these trials, the control and treatment groups included 144 and 140 subjects, respectively; since there was no significant heterogeneity between the studies (I2 &lt; 50%), a fixed effect model was applied. Meta-analysis showed that all three hepatoprotective agents significantly decreased ALT levels in patients with hepatitis B. NAC was associated with greater efficacy compared to UDCA and silibinin. The impact of UDCA and silibinin on ALT levels in patients with hepatitis B were considerable: NAC (WMD = -25.66; P = 0.0002, 95% CI [-39.02, -12.31]), UDCA (WMD = -22.32; P = 0.03, 95% CI [-42.28, -2.36]), silibinin (WMD = -22.40; P = 0.11, 95% CI [-49.52, 4.72]) (
