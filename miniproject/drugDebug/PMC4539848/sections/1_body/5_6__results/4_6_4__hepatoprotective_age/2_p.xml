<p>UDCA was superior over NAC and silibinin to reduce TBIL in patients with hepatitis B. Meta-analysis showed that NAC (WMD = -2.56; P = 95% CI [-4.95, -0.17]), UDCA (WMD = -3.48; 95% CI [-7.37, -0.31]), silibinin (WMD = -2.09; 95% CI [-8.70, 4.52]). However, the differences were not statistically significant (I2 = 0%) using a fixed-effects model (
