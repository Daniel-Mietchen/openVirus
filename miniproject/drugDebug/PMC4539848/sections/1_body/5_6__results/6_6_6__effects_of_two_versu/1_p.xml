<p>Three randomized controlled clinical trials reported the effects of combining two hepatoprotective drugs compared to a single agent on the recovery rate of liver indicators in patients with hepatitis B; 173 subjects who used a combination of two agents were compared to 123 subjects who used only one agent. The heterogeneity between the studies was statistically significant (I2 = 0%, P = 0.98). Therefore, a fixed-effects model was used. Compared with the single agent group, meta-analysis showed that using a combination of two hepatoprotective drugs was more effective than only one in restoring liver indicators to normal levels (two hepatoprotective agents group vs. single hepatoprotective agent group = 75.2% vs. 49.5%). ALT (72.3% vs. 48.7%, RR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.01, 2.04]), TBIL (77.8% vs. 50%, RR = 1.53, 95% CI [1.21, 1.95]). The recovery rate of the group that used two hepatoprotective agents was 25.7% higher than the one treated by a single agent, (RR = 1.50, P &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI [1.23, 1.83]) (
