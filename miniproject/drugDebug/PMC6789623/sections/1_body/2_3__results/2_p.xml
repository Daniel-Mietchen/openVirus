<p>LiCl and DG inhibit PDCoV replication. Next, we investigated the effect of LiCl and DG on the replication of PDCoV in LLC-PK1 cells. PK-1 cells were infected with PDCoV at MOI 0.05 for 1 h and treated with 10–60 mM LiCl or 125–1250 μg/mL DG for 24 h. The relative mRNA expression was detected by real-time qPCR. Treatment with 10–60 mM LiCl or 125–1250 μg/mL DG inhibited viral mRNA levels significantly (

 <sub>50</sub>. We found that 10–60 mM LiCl or 125–1250 μg/mL DG significantly inhibited viral replication compared to mock-treated cells (
