<p>Given the lack of specific antiviral therapies to control PDCoV infection, searching for effective small-molecule inhibitors active against PDCoV is a high research priority. Antiviral reagents include directly acting antivirals (DAAs), which can directly act on viral components (proteins or genomes), and host-acting antivirals (HAAs), which can act on hosts [

 <xref rid="B16-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Although DAAs are more virus-specific, viruses quickly develop resistance [

Antiviral methods based on host cellular mechanisms have potential advantages in reducing virus drug resistance and dealing with viral emergencies. Therefore, the search and development of HAAs has aroused more and more interest. An interesting feature of HAAs is their broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which allows for immediate treatment without a lead time being required to develop a specific therapy [

With the emergence of new viruses threatening human health, the discovery of new functions in existing clinical drugs is often used in the screening of modern emergency therapies. Traditional broad-spectrum antiviral drugs have shown antiviral activity against many types of viruses [
 <xref rid="B17-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For example, ribavirin has antiviral activity against Hantavirus [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], H1N1 influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B21-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], Dengue virus [
 <xref rid="B22-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], and Chikungunya virus [
 <xref rid="B23-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Therefore, the discovery of new antiviral functions for existing clinical drugs is still an important strategy against PDCoV infection.
