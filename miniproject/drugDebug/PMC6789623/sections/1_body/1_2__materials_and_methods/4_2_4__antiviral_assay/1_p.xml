<p>To investigate the antiviral efficacy of LiCl and DG against PDCoV replication, cells were infected with PDCoV (MOI 0.05) at 37 °C for 1 h. Unbound viruses were removed by washing with cold PBS. The cells were then incubated with LiCl (60 mM) or DG (1250 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 24 h. As a control, another set of cells were infected with the same dose of PDCoV without drug treatment. Subsequently, the antiviral efficacy was evaluated by analysis of viral RNA (vRNA) levels and viral loads.</p>
