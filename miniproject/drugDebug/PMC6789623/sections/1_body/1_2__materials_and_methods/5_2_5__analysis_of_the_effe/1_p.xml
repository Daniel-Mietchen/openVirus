<p>LLC-PK1 cells were seeded into 12-cell plates and grown to 100% confluence for 24 h. Non-toxic concentrations of LiCl (60 mM) or DG (1250 μg/mL) were mixed with the virus (MOI 0.05), and the mixtures were then added to the cells, followed by incubation for 1 h at 4 °C. As a control, the cells were infected with the same dose of PDCoV without drug treatment. After washing with cold PBS, the levels of vRNA in the cells were determined by real-time qPCR.</p>
