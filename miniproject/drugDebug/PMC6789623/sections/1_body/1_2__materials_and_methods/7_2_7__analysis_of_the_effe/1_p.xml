<p>The cells were infected with PDCoV (MOI 0.05) at 4 °C for 1 h. Unbound viruses were removed by washing with cold PBS. The cells were then incubated with LiCl (60 mM) or DG (1250 μg/mL) at 37 °C for 2 h. As a control, another set of cells were infected with the same dose of PDCoV without drug treatment. After removing the unbound viruses by washing with cold PBS (pH 3.0), the levels of vRNA in cells were determined by real-time qPCR.</p>
