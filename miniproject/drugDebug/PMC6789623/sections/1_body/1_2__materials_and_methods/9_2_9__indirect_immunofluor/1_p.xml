<p>After infection, the cells were fixed with cold polysorbate for 30 min at room temperature and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. After washing five times with PBS, cthe ells were incubated with rabbit anti-N antibody (1:500) at 4 °C for 12 h. The cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:100, KPL, Colton, CA, USA) at 37 °C for 30 min. After washing five times with PBS, the cells were incubated with DAPI (1:1000, diluted in PBS) at room temperature for 20 min. Fluorescence was observed under a Nikon ECLIPSE TS100 fluorescence microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan).</p>
