<p>Total cellular RNA was extracted using the RNApure Tissue &amp; Cell Kit (CWBIO, Nanjing, China). The primers for PDCoV M and β-actin genes were: PDCoV-F, 5′-ACAATCGACCACATGGCTCCAA-3′, PDCoV-R, 5′-CAGCTCTTGCCCATGTAGCTTCA-3′, β-actin-F, 5′-CTCCATCATGAAGTGCGACGT-3′, β-actin-R, 5′-GTGATCTCCTTCTGCATCCTGTC-3′ [
 <xref rid="B1-pathogens-08-00144" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The quantity of vRNA was determined using a LightCycler96 (Roche, Germany) and HiScript II One Step qRT-PCR SYBR Green Kit (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The relative level of RNA expression was determined by the 2
 <sup>−ΔΔCT</sup> method. β-actin mRNA level was used as a loading control. The mean RNA level of the mock-treated group was set at 100%.
