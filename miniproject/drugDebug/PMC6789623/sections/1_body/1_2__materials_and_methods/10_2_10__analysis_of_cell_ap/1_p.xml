<p>Apoptosis was investigated using the AnnexinV Alexa Fluor647/PI kit (FMSAV647-100) by flow cytometry. LLC-PK1 cells were detached using Accutase Cell Detachment Solution (FMS-AT 100) for 5 min and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min. The cells were washed twice with PBS and re-suspended with 500 μL of binding buffer at a concentration of 10
 <sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Then, 5 μL of AF647-conjugated AnnexinV and 10 μL of PI were added to the cells, which was followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min in the dark. Flow cytometry was carried out in a Becton Dickinson Accuri C6 FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Accuri C6 Plus, BD Medical Devices (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China).
