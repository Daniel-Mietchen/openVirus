 <caption> Time-dependent effect of LiCl and DG on PDCoV replication. ( A) Outline of the experimental set up. ( B, C) LLC-PK1 cells were incubated with PDCoV (MOI 0.05) for 1 h, followed by treatment with 60 mM LiCl ( B) or 1250 μg/mL DG ( C) at the indicated time (hpi). The viral titer in LLC-PK1 cell lysates was calculated using the method of Reed and Muench. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments; ns, no significant difference; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
