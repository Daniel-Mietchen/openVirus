 <caption> Antiviral effect of DG on PDCoV replication. ( A) The relative viral RNA level was determined by real-time qPCR. ( B). The viral titer (log 10 TCID 50/ mL) in LLC-PK1 cell lysates was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. ( C) At 24 h post-infection, PDCoV (MOI 0.05) replication in LLC-PK1 cells was determined by IFA. Green fluorescence represents the PDCoV replication, while blue fluorescence represents the nuclear distribution. ( D) The fluorescence intensity in C was quantified with the software ImageJ. Quantification of PDCoV infected cells from the IFA images is presented as percentage, taking 0 μg/mL DG as 100%. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments; ns, not significant difference; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001. Scale bar, 250 μm. </caption>
