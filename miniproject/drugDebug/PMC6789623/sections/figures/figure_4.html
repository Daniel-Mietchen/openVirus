 <caption> Effect of LiCl and DG on different stages of the PDCoV replication cycle. ( A). The levels of vRNA in cells treated with 60 mM LiCl during viral attachment and entry were determined by real-time qPCR. ( B) Same experiment as in A but using DG at 1250 μg/mL. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments; ns, no significant difference; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
