 <caption> The viricidal effect of LiCl and DG on PDCoV. ( A) PDCoV virions were incubated with 60 mM LiCl at 37 °C or room temperature. The viral titers (log 10 TCID 50/ mL) were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. ( B) Same experiment as in A but using DG at 1250 μg/mL. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, ns, no significant difference; * p &lt; 0.05; ** p &lt; 0.01; *** p &lt; 0.001. </caption>
