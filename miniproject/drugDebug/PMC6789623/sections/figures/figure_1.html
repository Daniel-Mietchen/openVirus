 <caption> Cytotoxic effect of LiCl and DG treatment in LLC-PK1 cells. ( A) Chemical structure of diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG). Cells were treated with 0–100 mM LiCl ( B) or 50–5000 μg/mL DG ( C) for 36 h. The relative cell viability was evaluated by the CCK-8 Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The data are expressed as the mean ± SD of three independent experiments. The dotted line indicates the 80% cytostatic concentration (CC 80). </caption>
