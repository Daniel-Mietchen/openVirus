  <p>Antiviral effect of LiCl on porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) replication. (
   <bold>A</bold>) The relative viral RNA level was determined by real-time qPCR. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The viral titer (log
   <sub>10</sub> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/
   <sub>mL</sub>) in LLC-PK1 cell lysates was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. (
   <bold>C</bold>) At 24 h post-infection, PDCoV (MOI 0.05) replication in LLC-PK1 cells was determined by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Green fluorescence represents PDCoV replication, while blue fluorescence represents the nuclear distribution. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The fluorescence intensity in C was quantified with the software ImageJ. Quantification of PDCoV-infected cells from the IFA images is presented as percentage, taking 0 mM LiCl as 100%. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments; ns, not significant difference; *
