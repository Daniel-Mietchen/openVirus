 <caption>
  <p>The viricidal effect of LiCl and DG on PDCoV. (
   <bold>A</bold>) PDCoV virions were incubated with 60 mM LiCl at 37 °C or room temperature. The viral titers (log
   <sub>10</sub> TCID
   <sub>50</sub>/
   <sub>mL</sub>) were calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Same experiment as in A but using DG at 1250 μg/mL. Values represent the mean ± SD of three independent experiments, ns, no significant difference; *
