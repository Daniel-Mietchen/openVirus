 <caption> Effect of LiCl and DG on cell apoptosis caused by PDCoV infection. The cells were incubated with PDCoV (MOI 0.05) for 1 h. Thereafter, the supernatant was removed, and DMEM supplemented with 60 mM LiCl or 1250 Î¼g/mL DG was added. At 36 hpi, the rates of cell apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. </caption>
