<p id="Par7">At present, more than 200 clinical trials for COVID-19 treatment have been carried out in medical institutions all over China. The drugs and the therapies include anti-AIDS drugs, influenza medications, glucocorticoid, traditional Chinese medicines/injections, stem cell transplantation, etc. However, drug clinical trials for COVID-19 children are very limited. As of February 28, 2020, one registered drug clinical trial of traditional Chinese medicine for the prevention of COVID-19 infection in children was found in the China Clinical Trial Registry Center; another clinical trial of darunavir and cobicistat for treatment of COVID-19 in children has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. The designs of the two clinical trials are not so scientific with unclear age range defined in the inclusion criteria.</p>
