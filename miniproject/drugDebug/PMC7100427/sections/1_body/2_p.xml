<p id="Par3">The treatment guidelines are very cautious about recommending antiviral drugs for children. Almost all guidelines highlight that there are no effective antiviral drugs for children at present. The Interim Guidance for Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 infection (the Sixth version) issued by the National Health Commission of China is only available for adults in the field of antiviral treatments. The recommended antiviral drugs are interferon-α (IFN-α), lopinavir/ritonavir, ribavirin, chloroquine diphosphate and arbidol [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] which have been used in the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. Based on the available evidences, IFN-α nebulization can be used in children, and it has shown good safety profiles under most circumstances. However, children are particularly sensitive to the accumulation of chloroquine phosphate in the body, which could possibly induce severe retinopathy, ototoxicity and cardiotoxicity. On the other hand, it lacks data on the safety of using lopinavir/ritonavir and abidor for children under 2 years of age. In the absence of adequate evidence for efficacy and safety, experts have not reached on an agreement on using ribavirin in the pediatric population. Guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in children (Second Edition) recommend the use of IFN-α, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin in children, without specifying age limitation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The recommended dosage of ribavirin infusion varies in different medical literatures. Some suggest intravenous infusion of ribavirin administered at a dose of 10 mg/kg every time (maximum 500 mg every time), 2–3 times daily [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], whereas others recommend 10–15 mg/kg per day, divided into 2–3 times daily [
