<p>Blood oxygen saturation and blood gas analysis are both essential to identify patients at higher risk of developing respiratory distress. Oxygen saturation (SaO2) of 94% or less while patients are breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of less than 300 mmHg are suggestive of respiratory illness.</p>
