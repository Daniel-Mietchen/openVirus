<p>Many studies document the potential effects of the antiviral drugs (darunavir, lopinavir, and ritonavir) to reduce viral load and eventually to prevent the respiratory complications (

Remdesivir has potential a broad-spectrum activity against viruses such as MERS and SARS in vitro and experimental animal models (
