<p>Tocilizumab is a humanized antiinterleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibody that inhibits interleukin-6 signaling used as treatment in rheumatoid arthritis. Tocilizumab is administered intravenous experimentally in the treatment of COVID-19 disease in China and now in Italy with some encouraging results (

Sarilumab is the other antiinterleukin-6-receptor monoclonal antibody drug that could be used to treat Covid-19 patients in order to reduce the pulmonary inflammation and to prevent the onset of respiratory distress. At present there is no scientific evidence even if in Italy Sarilumab is used experimentally in some patients. Future clinical investigations will help to better define the use of these agents.
