<p>The pathogen that causes COVID-19 disease is a new coronavirus that has been isolated in the late January 2020, called SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Coronaviruses are a big group of extremely diverse single-stranded RNA viruses. Considering the relationship of its genetic sequence to that of other known coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 probably originated in bats. The animal that host SARS-CoV-2 between a bat reservoir and humans is unknown (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>). Even though this new coronavirus has some genetic structures that matching with the other coronavirus, it has specific gene sequences that are substantially different from the gene sequences of other known coronaviruses (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>).
