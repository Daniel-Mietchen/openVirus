<p id="p0025">Since the approval of FilmArray respiratory panel tests, only a few studies have evaluated the clinical impact after implementation of the multiplex PCR respiratory panel on patients with less severe acute reparatory illness.

Because of undifferentiated clinical manifestation between bacterial and viral infection, antibiotic overuse in this population is common. In this study, we aimed to assess the impact of implementing a diagnostic algorithm that combines rapid respiratory viral surveillance and PCT tests on older patients presenting to the ED with severe acute respiratory illness. We conducted a prospective cohort study in the ED of 2 urban medical centers. Clinical impact was evaluated through a comparison of the experimental cohort with a propensity score (PS)â€“matched historical cohort.
