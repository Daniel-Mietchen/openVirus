<p id="p0105">Cost is an important consideration for the large-scale clinical implementation of rapid multiplex PCR testing. Previous analyses showed that rapid multiplex PCR testing was the most cost-effective testing strategy for the detection of influenza in children.

 </xref> The cost-effectiveness of respiratory panel testing is highly influenced by the prevalence of influenza and the proportion of patients treated with antivirals. The significant improvement in influenza diagnosis and antiviral treatment in our study suggests that a combination of respiratory panel and PCT testing may be cost-effective in our study setting. Such speculation, however, requires future validation.
