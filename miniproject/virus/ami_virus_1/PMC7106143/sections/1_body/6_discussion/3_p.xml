<p id="p0095">Our results showed that the proposed diagnostic approach could reduce intravenous antibiotics treatment duration by 4.44Â days without compromising patient outcomes. Historically, it has been advised to complete the course of intravenous antibiotics treatment despite the resolution of clinical symptoms. However, there is little evidence to support this practice.

 </xref> It is noteworthy that the identification of respiratory virus alone may not be sufficient to reduce antibiotic use because of the concerns regarding mixed virus-bacteria coinfection, especially influenza with pneumococcus infection.

 </xref> Low serum level of PCT may help alleviate the concerns of mixed infection. In addition, communicating the results to the treating physicians is important.

 </xref> Although we did not have a formal antibiotic stewardship team, the study nurse communicated the results to the treating physicians and promoted antibiotics stewardship. Another finding is the underdiagnosis of influenza in older adult patients. Older adult patients were less likely to undergo a provider-ordered influenza test. They usually lack the typical presentation of influenza-like illness and may present with respiratory distress or confusion.

 </xref> A recent study showed that the diagnosis of influenza based on clinical grounds alone was associated with a suboptimal sensitivity of 36% and a specificity of 78%.
