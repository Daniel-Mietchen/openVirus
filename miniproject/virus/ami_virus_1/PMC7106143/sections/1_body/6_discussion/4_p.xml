<p id="p0100">The proposed algorithm for respiratory virus infection diagnosis and antibiotic stewardship may also have implications for nursing home (NH) residents. Acute respiratory virus infection outbreaks are a common problem in NHs.

 </xref> A recent systematic review reported a 1.21% to 85.2% annual incidence of influenza or RSV infection in long-term care facilities.

 </xref> Other than influenza and RSV, human metapneumovirus is the third most common causative pathogen for NH respiratory infection outbreaks.

 </xref> NHs often do not have on-site equipment to evaluate suspected infection; therefore, a lower threshold for antibiotic prescription is common. It is estimated that approximately two-thirds of NH residents received antibiotics each year, and up to 75% of the treatment is inappropriate. NHs become the reservoirs for resistant bacteria within a community.

 </xref> Although the present protocol cannot be implemented in NHs, it can be used among severe NH patients who are transferred to the ED. In a less severe outbreak, the nasopharyngeal samples of NH residents can be collected and sent to contracted laboratories for respiratory panel testing. The early detection of acute respiratory infection enables early isolation of infected patients and early antiviral drug administration, which can prevent or contain a respiratory virus infection outbreak.
