 </xref> showed that patients receiving respiratory panel testing were more likely to undergo single doses or brief courses of antibiotics treatment. Respiratory panel testing was also associated with a reduced length of stay and improved influenza detection and antiviral use. However, they did not find that routine use of respiratory panel testing could reduce the proportion of patients treated with antibiotics, which they ascribed to the initiation of antibiotics before the results of PCT in many patients. A pre-post study showed that the use of the respiratory panel decreased the time to diagnosis of respiratory viruses, hospital admission rate, length of stay, number of chest radiographs, and duration of antimicrobial use.

 </xref> combined the respiratory panel and PCT tests, but found no significant differences in overall antibiotic exposure between the experimental and standard-of-care groups. Nevertheless, they found significantly fewer patients discharged on antibiotics and a shorter duration of therapy in a subgroup of patients with positive viral and negative PCT testing results. They stressed the importance of proactive communication between the antibiotics stewardship team and physicians.
