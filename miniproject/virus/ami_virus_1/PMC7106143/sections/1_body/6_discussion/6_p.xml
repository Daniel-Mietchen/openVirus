<p id="p0110">Our results have to be interpreted in light of several limitations. First, PCT tests were not used in the comparison cohort. We cannot determine the impact of the viral panel and PCT tests separately. Second, the study nurse only enrolled patients during working hours of weekdays. Selection or spectrum bias is less likely because we did not find significant difference in the outcomes of patients presenting to the ED on different time shifts. Third, the postdischarge follow-up data of the historical comparison cohort cannot be retrieved. We therefore could not compare the duration of oral antibiotics between the 2 cohorts. The reduction of intravenous antibiotic duration alone is important because it has been shown to be a strong risk factor for the development of resistant bacteria strains. Fourth, the generalization of the results to other settings should be taken into consideration. The long hospitalization duration in our study was due to old age, severe illness, and low hospitalization cost.

The strengths of our study include the older adult population, the twin-center prospective cohort design, the simple antibiotic stewardship algorithm, and the comparison to a PS-matched cohort.
