<p id="p0085">This prospective cohort study reports the clinical impact of rapid molecular diagnosis of respiratory pathogens in conjunction with PCT testing on older adult patients presenting to the ED with severe acute respiratory illness. The results showed 21.3% of older adult severe acute respiratory illness patients to be having respiratory virus infection, with influenza, RSV, and human rhinovirus/enterovirus being the 3 leading pathogens. We demonstrated that the new diagnostic approach was associated with increased discontinuation or de-escalation of antibiotics, reduced length of intravenous antibiotics treatment, and improved influenza detection and antiviral use.</p>
