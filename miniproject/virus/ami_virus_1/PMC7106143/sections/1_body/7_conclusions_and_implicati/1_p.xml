<p id="p0115">The findings of our study support the use of rapid multiplex PCR respiratory panels in conjunction with the PCT test for early diagnosis of respiratory viral infection and to inform optimizing antibiotic use in older adult patients presenting to the ED with severe acute respiratory illness. Respiratory viral infection outbreak is common in nursing homes. Performing the proposed diagnostic approach on patients transferred from NHs may enable early detection of the causative pathogens and early isolation of infected patients. As the cost per test is still high, institutions should develop a protocol to prevent indiscriminate testing with multiplex PCR and provide proactive real-time feedback to treating physicians for antimicrobial stewardship. Further studies are needed to assess the incremental value of multiplex PCR viral testing compared with PCT testing alone in the management of patients with severe acute respiratory infection in the ED.</p>
