<p id="p0045">During the study period, the study nurse identified eligible patients and explained the study protocol to the treating physicians and patients. Eligible patients received a rapid molecular test with 17 respiratory viruses and a PCT test. The results of the respiratory panel or PCT tests were communicated to the treating physicians directly by the study nurse as soon as they were available and were kept in the medical records. The study nurse reminded the treating physician of the recommendation of antibiotic treatment based on different viral and PCT testing results. The detection of influenza initiates isolation or neuraminidase inhibitor use. The detection of a virus with an elevated serum PCT level (≥0.25 ng/mL) may indicate the possibility of a superimposed bacterial infection and justify the continual use of antibacterial treatment in patients with non–influenza virus infection and combined antiviral and antibacterial treatment in patients with influenza infection. A positive result for respiratory virus with a low serum PCT level and stable clinical manifestation may allow early discontinuation or de-escalation of empiric antibiotics. De-escalation was defined as changing to a narrower-spectrum antibiotic or shifting the intravenous antibiotics to oral form. A negative respiratory virus test result with a low serum level of PCT (&lt;0.25 ng/mL) would prompt clinicians to consider noninfectious causes of respiratory distress, such as acute exacerbation of obstructive airway disease, acute decompensated heart failure, or fluid overload.</p>
