<p id="p0020">Despite the availability of highly accurate viral testing results, the discontinuation or the de-escalation of antibiotics still raises concerns because mixed virus-bacteria coinfection, especially influenza with pneumococcus, is common in older adults.

 </xref> In this study, we proposed a diagnostic approach that combines the multiplex PCR respiratory panel with procalcitonin (PCT) tests to better guide the antibiotic treatment. PCT is a precursor of calcitonin that is constitutively secreted by C cells of the thyroid gland and K cells of the lungs. In healthy individuals, PCT is normally undetectable (&lt;0.01 ng/mL). When stimulated by endotoxin, PCT is rapidly produced by parenchymal tissue throughout the body. Unlike C-reactive protein, PCT does not respond to sterile inflammation or viral infection.

 </xref> This distinctive characteristic makes PCT a valuable diagnostic marker. Multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that PCT levels of &lt;0.25 μg/L can guide the decision to withhold antibiotics or stop therapy early.
