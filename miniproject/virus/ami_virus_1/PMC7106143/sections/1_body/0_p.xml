<p id="p0010">Community-acquired respiratory tract infections are among the most common reasons for emergency department (ED) visits and can be caused by both viral and bacterial pathogens. Identification of the pathogen causing symptoms is critical for rapid institution of adequate antiviral or antibiotic therapy. Because of the challenges in differentiating between viral and bacterial pathogens, patients with viral respiratory infections are usually underdetected, and unnecessary antibacterial agents are more likely to be administered. Therefore, laboratory tests providing accurate and timely determination of the infectious agents associated with viral respiratory diseases are important. A broad array of tests is available to detect viral respiratory agents. Rapid antigen tests are available for influenza A and B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), but these tests have low sensitivity and specificity.
