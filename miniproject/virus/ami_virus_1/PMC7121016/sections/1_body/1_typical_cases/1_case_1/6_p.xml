<p id="Par19">This is a case of influenza virus pneumonia, demonstrated by chest X-ray as interstitial inflammation in both lungs. Chest X-ray demonstrates primary influenza virus pneumonia mainly as interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia, early with poorly defined but enhanced lung markings, predominantly in bilateral lower lung fields. In addition, the lung markings show an increased density, resembling to GGO. During the progressive stage, the lung fields are demonstrated with reticular opacity and reticular nodular opacity, with nodules smaller than 5 mm. Such opacities may be concurrently demonstrated with poorly defined but enhanced lung markings. The lesions are commonly located in both lower lung fields and around the hilum. Chest CT scan demonstrates small nodular opacity in lungs, GGO, tree-buds sign and mosaic like perfusion, interlobular septal thickening, subpleural line, adjacent pleural thickening and pleural effusion. By radiology, the condition of this case was mild, present difficulty for the diagnosis, which depended on rich experience of the radiological clinician.</p>
