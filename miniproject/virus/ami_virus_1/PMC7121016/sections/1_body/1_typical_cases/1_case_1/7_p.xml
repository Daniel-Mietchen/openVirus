<p id="Par20">In this case, influenza virus pneumonia manifested as interstitial pneumonia should be differentiated from other viral pneumonia, such as hand-foot-mouth virus pneumonia and measles virus pneumonia. The initial lesions of hand-foot-mouth virus pneumonia are mainly interstitial changes with an extensive distribution and possible involvement of each lung lobe. The lesions commonly distribute bilaterally, with enhanced and deranged lung markings in both lungs as well as common grid like and cords like opacity. Along with the progression of the lesions, chest X-ray demonstrates changes of the lesions, with peripheral spread of the lobular lesions along bronchi and inflammatory consolidation of alveoli and adjacent lung tissue. The lesion may also invade alveolar duct, alveolar sac and alveoli in the lung lobule to cause lobular inflammatory exudation, demonstrated as small patches of increased density opacity confined within lung lobe or segment. There are more exudation opacities in the upper lung lobes than in the lower lung lobes and more in the right lung lobes than in the left lung lobes. Chest X-ray demonstrates measles virus pneumonia as flakes or diffuse ground glass opacity and/or thickened bronchovascular bundles. CT scan demonstrates poorly defined centrilobular nodules, ground glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening as well as lobular or segmental consolidations. Adenovirus pneumonia is demonstrated as thickened and blurry lung markings as well as small nodular opacities along lung markings in the middle and medial parts of bilateral middle and lower lung fields, possibly with fused lesions.</p>
