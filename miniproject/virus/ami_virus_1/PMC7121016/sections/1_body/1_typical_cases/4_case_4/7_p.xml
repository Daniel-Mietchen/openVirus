<p id="Par44">ARDS is the typical manifestation of advanced stage acute lung damage, which is basically diffuse capillary damage of lung with increased permeability due to intrapulmonary or extrapulmonary serious disease. Its pathological changes include pulmonary edema, hyaline membrane formation and pulmonary atelectasis, with clinical manifestations of acute respiratory failure syndrome characterized by progressive respiratory distress and intractable hypoxemia. The radiological abnormalities of ARDS are related to leakage of edema fluid containing a large amount of protein and its filling into the alveolar cavity after damage to the alveolar epithelium or diffuse damage to alveolar wall. And its staging by radiology is closely related to the pathological changes, including the exudative stage, the proliferative stage and the fibrosis stage, with intercorrelationship and overlapping. Chest X-ray commonly demonstrates diffuse opacity in both lungs, and detectable lesions of the underlying disease, e.g. severe pneumonia induced by a variety of pathogens. CT scan demonstrates uneven distribution of the lesions: (1) with almost no abnormality in the gravity independent region (e.g. supine, anterior thoracic cavity); (2) with GGO in the anterior and middle thoracic cavity; and (3) with consolidation in the gravity dependent region.</p>
