<p id="Par28">The disease should be mainly differentiated from measles virus pneumonia, pulmonary alveolar pneumonia and allergic pneumonia. Chest X-ray demonstrates measles virus pneumonia as flakes or diffusely distributed GGO and/or thickened bronchovascular bundles. By CT scan, measles virus pneumonia is demonstrated as poorly defined centrilobular nodules, ground glass opacity, interlobular septal thickening as well as lobular or segmental consolidation opacities. Bacterial pneumonia is mainly demonstrated as alveolar pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia. Alveolar pneumonia is mainly demonstrated as lobar consolidation opacity with high uniform density or consolidation opacity occupying part of lung lobe, with air bronchogram inside. Bronchial pneumonia is demonstrated as thickened lung markings, with poorly defined nodular opacity or poorly defined flakes of opacity. Allergic pneumonitis is a non-asthmatic allergic lung disease caused by a group of different allergens. Chest X-ray may show no abnormalities or diffuse interstitial fibrosis, commonly with bilateral patches or nodular infiltration, thickening of the bronchial lung markings or small acinar like changes. CT scan shows thickened bronchovascular thickening, poorly defined small patches of and ground glass opacities along the bronchovascular bundles. The demonstrations by CT scan are irregular, possibly with inconsistencies between radiological findings and clinical symptoms.</p>
