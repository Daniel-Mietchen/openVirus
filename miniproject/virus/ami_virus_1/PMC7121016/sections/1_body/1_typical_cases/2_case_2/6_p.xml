<p id="Par27">This case of influenza virus pneumonia is typically as virus pneumonia. Chest X-ray demonstrates primary influenza virus pneumonia as interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia, with initial radiological signs of enhanced but poorly defined lung markings, predominantly in bilateral lower lungs. The lung markings also show increased density resembling to ground glass opacity. During the progressive stage, the lung fields are demonstrated with reticular and reticular nodular opacities, with nodules smaller than 5 mm. Such opacities can be concurrently demonstrated with enhanced but poorly defined lung markings. The lesions commonly distribute in both lower lung fields and around the hilum. The demonstrations by CT scan are diversifying and overlapping, including small nodules in lungs, tree-buds sign with sporadic and centrilobular distribution, ground glass opacity with lobar distribution, diffuse ground glass opacities accompanied by thick interstitial change as well as interlobular septal thickening, subpleural line, adjacent pleural thickening, and pleural effusion. The radiological findings are in consistency with the histopathological demonstrations.</p>
