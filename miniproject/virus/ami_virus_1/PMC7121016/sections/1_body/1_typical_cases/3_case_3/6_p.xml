<p id="Par35">This is a case of influenza complicated by bacterial pneumonia, with typical signs of lobar pneumonia. Lobar pneumonia is commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, with sudden and acute onset and a short course of illness. Chest X-ray demonstrates bacterial pneumonia as alveolar pneumonia (lobar pneumonia) or bronchial pneumonia (lobular pneumonia). Alveolar pneumonia is mainly demonstrated as lobar consolidation with high uniform density or consolidation with high uniform density occupying a part lung lobe, with air bronchogram inside. The lesions at different sites show different radiological signs, with lesions involving one lung lobe or multiple lung lobes. Bronchial pneumonia is demonstrated as thickened lung markings, with poorly defined nodular or flakes of opacity in a diameter of 6â€“8 mm. And the large poorly defined patches of opacity with uneven density is actually overlapping opacities of multiple lobular alveolitis. Occlusion of bronchi by mucus is demonstrated as lobular atelectasis or focal emphysema, while occlusion of bronchiole causes radiological sign of a small triangle shaped lung atelectasis. The lesions are commonly located in the medial parts of both lower lung fields, with more lesions in the posterior lung lobe than in the anterior lung lobe, which distribute along bronchial branches with smooth air flow in the segmental and lobar bronchi. Congestion, edema and inflammatory exudation of terminal bronchiolar mucosa may cause obstructive emphysema, which is demonstrated as increased transparency of both lung fields, extended thorax, widened intercostal space, and lowered flat diaphragm. CT scan demonstrates uniform shaped consolidations with lobar distribution, with air bronchogram inside, and poorly defined nodular and patches of opacity in different sizes along bronchical bundle as well as lobular atelectasis or focal emphysema.</p>
