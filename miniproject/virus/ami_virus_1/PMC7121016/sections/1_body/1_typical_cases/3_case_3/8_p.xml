<p id="Par37">Chest X-ray demonstrates viral pneumonia mainly as interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia. During its early stage, chest X-ray demonstrates enhanced but poorly defined lung markings, predominantly in the both lower lung fields, with increased density like GGO. During the progressive stage, the lung fields are demonstrated with reticular opacity and reticular nodules, which mainly distribute in both lower lung fields and around the hilum, with a diameter of less than 5 mm. During the advanced stage, bronchiolar inflammatory occlusion causes cystic changes in different sizes, with honeycomb like lung. The lung is demonstrated with shrinkage, elevated diaphragm and shift of interlobar fissure. CT scan demonstrates small nodules, ground glass opacity, tree-buds sign and mosaic like perfusion. Klebsiella pneumonia is an acute lung inflammation caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae, which commonly occurs in populations of those with chronic alcoholism or malnutrition and the elderly. Chest X-ray demonstrations can be classified into 3 types: increased lung markings type; lobular type or diffuse pneumonia type; and lobar consolidation type or lung abscess type. Compared to chest X-ray, CT scan can more favorably display the lesions. In its early stage, Klebsiellar pneumonia is demonstrated with lobular sporadic distribution of patches or irregular dense opacities, which involve multiple lung segments and fuse rapidly to show lobar consolidation in the right upper lung lobe. Due to the thick exudated fluid from the lesion, the interlobar fissure is demonstrated to drop. The lesions are susceptible to necrosis, followed by formation of lung abscess, which is commonly multiple small cavities with a diameter of less than 2 cm. The healing proce ss of these cavities is long, commonly with residual extensive fibrosis. Mycoplasma pneumonia is an acute respiratory infection and pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumonia, with common occurrence in both children and adults. Most of the patients show cold agglutination test positive. In its early stage, chest X-ray demonstrates increased poorly defined lung markings and blurry cloud like or homogenous opacities, commonly in the middle and lower lung fields. Such opacities adjacent to the hilum are dense, and its density gradually lightens along with its distance from the hilum, with poorly defined boundary and involvement of partial lung lobe. Mycoplasma pneumonia with lobar lesion can not be differentiated from lobar pneumonia induced by other pathogenic bacteria. Chest CT scan mainly shows ground glass like opacity in lungs, nodular or small patches of consolidation with air cavity, thickened bronchovascular bundle, buds-in-tree sign, large consolidation as well as accompanying mediastinal lymphadenectasis and pleural effusion.</p>
