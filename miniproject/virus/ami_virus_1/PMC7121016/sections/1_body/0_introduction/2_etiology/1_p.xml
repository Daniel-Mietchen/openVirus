<p id="Par3">In the year of 1971, WHO officially issued the nomenclature system of influenza virus, and the influenza virus is divided into 3 types based on the antigenic properties of the virus nuclear protein since then, type A, type B and type C. Influenza virus is an RNA virus, which is the most stable in an environment with a pH value of 6.5–7.9 and is intolerant to high temperature. It loses its pathogenicity after heated to a temperature of 56 °C for several minutes, and can be inactivated at a temperature of 100 °C for 1 min. In an environment with a low temperature, the virus is more stable, being capable of surviving for more than 1 months at a temperature of 4 °C, and more than 5 months at a temperature of −70 °C. The influenza virus is sensitive to dryness, ultraviolet radiation, and commonly used disinfectants such as ethanol and iodophor.</p>
