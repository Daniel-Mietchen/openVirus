<p id="Par13">Chest X-ray shows alveolar pneumonia (lobar pneumonia) or bronchial pneumonia (lobular pneumonia). Alveolar pneumonia is mainly demonstrated as lobar consolidation opacity with high homogeneous density or consolidation opacity with high homogeneous density occupying part of lung lobe, possibly with air bronchogram. Due to the different location of the lung lesions, the radiological demonstrations are accordingly different, with one or multiple lung lobes involved. Bronchial pneumonia is demonstrated as thickened lung markings, with poorly defined nodular opacity in diameters of 6â€“8 mm or poorly defined flakes of opacity. Large poorly defined patch of opacity with uneven density is the result of overlapping lesions of lobular alveolitis. Bronchial obstruction by mucus is demonstrated as lobular atelectasis or focal emphysema in the diseased area. Bronchiolar occlusion may cause a small triangular shaped lesion of atelectasis. The lesions are commonly located in the medial parts of both lower lung fields, with more lesions in the posterior lung lobe than in the anterior lung lobe. And the lesions distribute along bronchi, with smooth air flow in the segmental and lobar bronchi. Terminal bronchiolar mucosa may be subject to congestion, edema and inflammatory exudation to cause obstructive emphysema, which is demonstrated as increased transparency of both lungs, thoracic extension, widened intercostal space, lowered and flat diaphragmatic muscle. CT scan demonstrates consolidation with uniform shape, lobar distribution and inner air bronchogram as well as poorly defined nodular and patches of opacity in different sizes that distributes along bronchial bundles. In addition, lobular pulmonary atelectasis and focal emphysema are also shown by CT scan.</p>
