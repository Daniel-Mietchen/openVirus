<p id="Par12">Chest X-ray demonstrates mainly interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia, initially with poorly defined thickening of the lung markings, predominantly both lower lung field significantly; increased density of the lung markings resembling to GGO. During the progressive stage, the lung fields are demonstrated with grid like opacity and network like nodular opacity, with the nodules smaller than 5 mm. Such signs may be concurrently shown with thickened and blurry lung markings, with a distribution in both lower lung fields and around the hilum. In the late stage, cystic changes are shown in different sizes due to bronchiolar inflammatory occlusion in honeycomb like lungs, in addition to shrinkage of lungs, elevated diaphragm and shift of interlobar fissure. CT scan demonstrates small nodular opacity, GGO, tree-bud sign and mosaic like perfusion as well as interlobular septal thickening, subpleural line, adjacent pleural thickening, and pleural effusion.</p>
