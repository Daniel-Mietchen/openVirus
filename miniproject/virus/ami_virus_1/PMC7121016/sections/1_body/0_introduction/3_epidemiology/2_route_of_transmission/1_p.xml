<p id="Par5">Influenza virus exists in the respiratory secretions of the patients or persons with asymptomatic infection and spreads via airborne transmission. By talking, coughing or sneezing, the virus spreads into air along with droplets or aerosols, and causes infection after their being inhaled into susceptible individuals. The virus can also spread via direct or indirect contacts to the mucosa in the oral cavity, nasal cavity, and eyes.</p>
