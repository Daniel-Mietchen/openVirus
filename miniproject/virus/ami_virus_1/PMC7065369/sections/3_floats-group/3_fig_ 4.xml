  <p>Screenshot of HealthMap’s ‘outbreaks near me’ taken on 17 February 2020. User location has been correctly detected in the United Kingdom, and the expanded news box for London, UK, shows a number of news stories about nearby COVID-19 cases in the UK (nine cases as of 17 February 2020). China’s ‘close contact detector’ platform (see below) expands this concept of ‘outbreaks near me’ in a very much more detailed fashion (much finer location granularity). (HealthMap uses base map data from Google.)</p>
