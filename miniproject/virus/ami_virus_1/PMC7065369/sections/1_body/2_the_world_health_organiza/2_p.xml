<p id="Par14">Prior to 18 February 2020, the WHO and JHU CSSE dashboards had some interesting differences. Each had a vastly different total case count as can be seen in Figs.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> (both taken on 16 February 2020). The WHO dashboard reflected laboratory-confirmed cases, whereas JHU CSSE included cases diagnosed using a symptom array plus chest imaging (accounting for some 18,000 additional reports). However, as of 19 February 2020, both dashboards are in sync, displaying similar total case counts.
