<p id="Par17">The WHO is updating its COVID-19 dashboard automatically using ArcGIS GeoEvent Server to push updates to a single feature service multiple times per day. The WHO dashboard optimisation measures include moving tiled data off its server and into ArcGIS Online tiled services to benefit from Esri’s content delivery network. This allows good map performance at 10–12 levels of zoom.</p>
