<p id="Par27">The WorldPop research group at Southampton University, UK, used historical data and patterns from Baidu’s location services and international flight itineraries to better understand population movements out of Wuhan prior to the city’s lockdown, look at travellers’ volumes and destinations across China and the world, and compile a predictive global risk map for the likely spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus from its epicentre in Wuhan. According to WorldPop’s analysis, within mainland China, the cities of Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Chongqing are all identified as high-risk, while the most ‘at-risk’ places worldwide are Thailand (1st), Japan (2nd) and Hong Kong (3rd), followed by the USA (6th), Australia (10th) and the UK (17th). Detailed results and maps can be accessed on the WorldPop online portal [
