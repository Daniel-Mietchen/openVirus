 <italic>should be expected to happen more frequently moving forward</italic>” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In other words, it is not a question of 
 <italic>if</italic> another outbreak will occur, but 
 <italic>when</italic> and 
 <italic>where</italic>. Viruses like SARS-CoV-2 know no country or continent boundaries.
