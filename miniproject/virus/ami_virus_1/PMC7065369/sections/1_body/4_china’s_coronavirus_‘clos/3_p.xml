<p id="Par24">A related and complementary voluntary system was implemented in Guangzhou Underground (Guangdong Province, China), so that if a person is later diagnosed with coronavirus, it would be easier to track her/his transport routines and notify related passengers who boarded the same metro carriages. Starting on 17 February 2020, every metro carriage in Guangzhou Underground displays a unique QR code that passengers are invited to scan once they board the carriage. They then need to quickly fill in an online form that appears on their phone, which includes name, ID No. (optional), gender, their starting metro station and their destination station. As each carriage has a unique QR code, if the passenger walks into another carriage during transportation, s/he will have to scan the new QR code of that carriage and (auto) fill in the corresponding form again. If the passenger’s journey involves changing to other metro lines to reach their final destination, then s/he will have to repeat the same process for every additional carriage they board (Fig.
