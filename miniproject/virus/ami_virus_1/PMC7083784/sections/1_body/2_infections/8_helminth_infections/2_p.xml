<p id="p0110">Neglected intestinal helminthic infection is a major health concern worldwide. Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections have affected about 24% of world population in 2016 and are more prevalent in developing countries (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Faraji et al., 2016</xref>) and transition occurs through contaminated water or food or via skin. The infection is associated with multiple factors including low-income, poor sanitation of food, food habits and close relationship with animal reservoirs (

For example, the prevalence rate of ascariasis and Strongyloidiasis was estimated to be 0.1% and 0.3%, and the infection rate with hookworms is &lt;1% in population while infection with

 <italic>Enterobius</italic> is relatively common (

Free-living stages of some soil transmitted helminths are highly resistant which leads to persistence in the soil for years and possible outbreaks of infections are expected. It is known that developmental stages of helminths in the environment before infecting the host mainly depend on humidity (
