<p id="p0065">The importance of dysentery including amoebic or bacillary dysentery is more bolded in summer season floods. A high incidence of diarrheal disease has reported from Ethiopia in 2009. The other flood in 2008 in Mozambique resulted to an outbreak of cholera (

Post flood gastrointestinal problems risk is lower in countries with high income, although the risk is depended with the depth of flooding. Another outbreak of non-viral based gastrointestinal diseases has been reported during Katrina in about 4% of sheltered evacuees which was associated with over-crowding, poor sanitation and compromised health levels among them (

Outbreaks of hepatitis E have frequently been reported in endemic areas and are in association with water contamination (person to person transmission only causes 2.2% of all new cases). This type of hepatitis occurs in large scale and affects great populations including pregnant women. An outbreak of hepatitis E in Kaupur, India in 1991 resulted to 48 deaths which 13 of them were pregnant women (
