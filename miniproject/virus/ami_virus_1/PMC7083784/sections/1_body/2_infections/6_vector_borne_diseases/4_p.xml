<p id="p0095">Leishmniasisas one of the most important neglected tropical diseases, is caused by several species of the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> and transmitted by the bite of female sandflies. These zooanthroponoses are mainly classified into cutaneous, visceral and mucocutaneous forms (
