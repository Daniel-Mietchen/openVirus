<p id="p0025">Various risk factors in favor of infectious diseases such as overcrowding, disruption of sewage disposal, poor standards of hygiene, poor nutrition, negligible sanitation and human contact among refugees provide suitable conditions for increasing the incidence of such diseases after flooding and can cause epidemics (

Moreover, in areas where many infectious diseases are endemic or there have been some reports of occurrence, an association between the displacement of people and dramatic increase of human exposure to vectors and pathogens is expected (
