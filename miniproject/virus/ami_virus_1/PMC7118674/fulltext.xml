In China, although containment measures have significantly reduced new cases of COVID-19, in other countries, this reduction has not been similar. In Colombia, despite the implementation of the rules established by the national government, exists an elevate concern both for mortality and for the limited capacity of the health system to respond effectively to the needs of patients infected and requiring intensive care by the respiratory complications associated with this infection.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0015">The data collected so far on the number of infected people and the evolution of the epidemic are imprecise. Even though to date in Colombia (March 19, 2020) there are no deaths yet, nor patients in intensive care by COVID-19, the diagnoses of infection by SARS-CoV-2 have increased (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>
). In this country, since the first case was reported (March 6, 2020), the number of infected patients follows an exponential trend, like other countries in the region, except Ecuador, with a lower incidence. If this trend continues, in a week (until March 26, 2020) or two (April 2, 2020), there will be 2581 and 40,535 infected patients, respectively, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>

Regarding to the current COVID-19 data available from Colombia, the proportion of patients in that age group is 15%, and of them, 4.7% needing hospitalizing, proportion which is lower than in other age groups. Additionally, as of March 19, most cases are imported (64%).<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr"><sup>3</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0025">On the other hand, according to the official reports of the World Health Organization (updated to March 19, 2020), in Latin American countries the first cases of mortality by COVID-19 occurred in Argentina after the 12th day of the first case was diagnosed, and in Panama was the first death was reported after the sixth day. This situation differs from European countries, where COVID-19 associated deaths started until after the 23rd of the first diagnosis (France). Additionally, the reports curve of some European countries has a slower start compared to Latin American countries. This situation may be due to a higher degree of alertness in this region, motivated by the experiences of European and Asian countries, leading to earlier diagnostic tests (early detection). Additionally, in Europe, at the beginning of the infection, the diagnoses were oriented to people with symptoms.</p><p id="p0030">The ability of the health system to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a factor that can influence the diagnosis and reporting of cases. By March 18, 2020, Italy had already carried out 148,657 tests (31,506&#x02013;21.2% -positive), South Korea: 286,716 (8320&#x02013;2.9% - positive), and Colombia: 2571 tests (93&#x02013;3.6% - positive). Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed should be like the number of people tested, the values may differ because some people need a duplicate of the test. The reason for this is that there are &#x0201c;false negative&#x0201d; results.<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4</sup></xref> However, the ability of a health system to perform these tests greatly influences the case fatality rate, as the denominator determines its value. Therefore, conducting random tests in the people infected with symptoms or disease decrease in the case fatality rate. In China, where they have done a random SARS-CoV-2 screening, the severity of the infection has shown that: 80% of the cases present mild symptoms, 15% severe, and 5% critical. For its part, in Spain, the behavior is more worrying (60% mild, 30% will require hospitalization, and 10% intensive care).<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr"><sup>5</sup></xref>

From an <italic>immunological perspective</italic>, the Latin-American environmental condition characterized by a higher frequency of rains (like in Colombia and other tropical countries without the classic seasons), associated with a higher frequency of viral respiratory infections, caused by different types of viruses, could be related with a persistent exposition and training of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which allows an efficient response to respiratory viral infections, with better clinical evolution and, therefore, lower complications and mortality.<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>

Additionally, that strategy is more effective in supporting the suppression of epidemics when combined with the social distancing of the entire population; the effect of school closure is further to amplify the breakdown of social contacts between households, and thus suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the closure of colleges and universities may be insufficient to mitigate an epidemic in isolation.<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr"><sup>12</sup></xref>
</p><p id="p0070">Colombia is one of the countries that have reported the first case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in fewer days, compared to other countries in the region and Europe. Therefore, the predictions for COVID-19 in Colombia may be affected by the early and strong measures taken, and it is necessary to make a continuous analysis of the expansion and evolution SARS-CoV-2 infection and disease in this country, to evaluate de results of them. The WHO, with all the actions and data received at the global level, has begun to establish the strategies that must be structured to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, such as: a) prepare and be ready, b) detect, protect and treat, c) reduce and suppress transmission, and d) learn, innovate, improve and Improve.</p><p id="p0075">Based on these analyses and predictions, for now, Colombia could be in a better position regarding other countries for SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 evolution, supported in early actions aimed to suppress virus transmission and the lower percentage of high-risk population for COVID-19 (older adults). The expansion, complications and mortality are highly variable, even in neighboring countries; therefore, the data cannot be extrapolated, either to the worst-case like Italy or the best case like Finland (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec1.5"><title>Colombia could have different endpoints from Spain and Italy</title><p id="p0080">Predictions of COVID -19 evolution for Colombia, based on its behavior observed in Italy and Spain are very fearful, because they imply that this country lacks the response capability required for caring of all the patients who could become infected and, especially, for patients who will require admission to intensive care units. Therefore, there is a widespread fear of the high impact on morbidity, mortality and social costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. However, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean. Some differences support this hypothesis in favor of Colombia, such as: a) a lower percentage of the population at risk (by age); b) a possible better immunological capacity (due to the greater exposure to outbreaks of respiratory infections during the year); c) the characteristics of tropical regions that reduces the speed of virus transmission, and d) earlier implementation of preventive health policies. Finally, it is essential to highlight the difference between being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presenting the COVID-19; in Colombia, as of March 19, 2020, only 8% of the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 required hospitalization, and no patients have required intensive care unit (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="other" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>CSSEGISandData</surname></name></person-group><article-title>CSSEGISandData/COVID-19 [Internet]</article-title><comment>[cited 2020 Mar 20].
