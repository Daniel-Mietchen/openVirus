<p id="p0050">In Colombia, according to the National Institute of Health, consultations and hospitalizations for acute respiratory infections have at least two peaks during the year: the first between March to June, with May and June being the months with the highest number of cases; and the second between September and December. These peaks are associated with the rainy seasons that characterize those periods. From an 
 <italic>immunological perspective</italic>, the Latin-American environmental condition characterized by a higher frequency of rains (like in Colombia and other tropical countries without the classic seasons), associated with a higher frequency of viral respiratory infections, caused by different types of viruses, could be related with a persistent exposition and training of the innate and adaptive immune responses, which allows an efficient response to respiratory viral infections, with better clinical evolution and, therefore, lower complications and mortality.
