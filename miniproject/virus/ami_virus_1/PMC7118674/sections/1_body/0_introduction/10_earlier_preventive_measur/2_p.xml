<p id="p0065">Neil M Ferguson et al., conclude that the closure of schools and universities will have a positive impact on containing the COVID-19 epidemic, under the assumption that children transmit viruses as much as adults do. Additionally, that strategy is more effective in supporting the suppression of epidemics when combined with the social distancing of the entire population; the effect of school closure is further to amplify the breakdown of social contacts between households, and thus suppress SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, the closure of colleges and universities may be insufficient to mitigate an epidemic in isolation.
