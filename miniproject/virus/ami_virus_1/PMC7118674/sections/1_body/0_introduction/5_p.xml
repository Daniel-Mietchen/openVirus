<p id="p0030">The ability of the health system to detect the SARS-CoV-2 infection is a factor that can influence the diagnosis and reporting of cases. By March 18, 2020, Italy had already carried out 148,657 tests (31,506–21.2% -positive), South Korea: 286,716 (8320–2.9% - positive), and Colombia: 2571 tests (93–3.6% - positive). Although the number of SARS-CoV-2 tests performed should be like the number of people tested, the values may differ because some people need a duplicate of the test. The reason for this is that there are “false negative” results.

 </xref> However, the ability of a health system to perform these tests greatly influences the case fatality rate, as the denominator determines its value. Therefore, conducting random tests in the people infected with symptoms or disease decrease in the case fatality rate. In China, where they have done a random SARS-CoV-2 screening, the severity of the infection has shown that: 80% of the cases present mild symptoms, 15% severe, and 5% critical. For its part, in Spain, the behavior is more worrying (60% mild, 30% will require hospitalization, and 10% intensive care).
