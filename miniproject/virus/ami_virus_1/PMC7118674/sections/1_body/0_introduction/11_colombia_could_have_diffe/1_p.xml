<p id="p0080">Predictions of COVID -19 evolution for Colombia, based on its behavior observed in Italy and Spain are very fearful, because they imply that this country lacks the response capability required for caring of all the patients who could become infected and, especially, for patients who will require admission to intensive care units. Therefore, there is a widespread fear of the high impact on morbidity, mortality and social costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Colombia. However, it is possible to establish that the situation in this country will be different from in European Mediterranean. Some differences support this hypothesis in favor of Colombia, such as: a) a lower percentage of the population at risk (by age); b) a possible better immunological capacity (due to the greater exposure to outbreaks of respiratory infections during the year); c) the characteristics of tropical regions that reduces the speed of virus transmission, and d) earlier implementation of preventive health policies. Finally, it is essential to highlight the difference between being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and presenting the COVID-19; in Colombia, as of March 19, 2020, only 8% of the patients positive for SARS-CoV-2 required hospitalization, and no patients have required intensive care unit (
