<p id="p0055">A study by Mohammad M. Sajadi et al., showed that the distribution of viral respiratory infection outbreaks depends on latitude, temperature, and humidity. As temperature and humidity are known factors that influence survival of SARS- CoV, MERS- CoV, and influenza viruses, it is plausible to consider that in tropical countries, like Colombia, the SARS-CoV-2 survival and spread could be lower.
