<p id="par0070">Of the 558,130 included medical records, 472,482 (84.7%) included diagnoses of febrile seizures along with additional diagnoses. Of these records, we investigated 32,337 (6.8%) that included virus-related diagnoses. The influenza virus was the most common etiology of infection, according to these records (16,809, 52.0%), followed by enterovirus (12,571, 38.9%), and these two viruses accounted for the majority of cases (29,380, 90.9%). Rotavirus, RSV, and adenovirus cases were also included. However, the frequencies of these viral infections were much lower than those caused by influenza virus and enterovirus. Other viruses accounted for less than 1% of all viral infections (
