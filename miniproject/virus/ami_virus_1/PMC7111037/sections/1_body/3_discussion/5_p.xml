<p id="par0100">After influenza virus and enterovirus, the next most frequent viruses in our study were rotavirus, RSV, and adenovirus. Rotavirus causes gastrointestinal infection and is prevalent in winter 
 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. RSV, a respiratory virus, is prevalent in winter and is the most common cause of acute bronchiolitis in children younger than 2 years 
 <xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The incidence of adenovirus infection remains fairly consistent throughout the year 
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In our study, the seasonal distribution patterns of rotavirus, RSV, and adenovirus infection were similar to those reported in previous studies. All these viruses appear to be associated with febrile seizures.
