<p id="Par13">Zikavirus (ZikaV) is a flavivirus , which is in the arbovirus group that includes two additional virus subgroups – alphaviruses and bunyaviruses. ZikaV had been considered, originally a relatively mild or benign virus. However, the other related viruses have been known for several years to be associated with several severe and often fatal diseases, including central nervous system disorders, viral meningitis, encephalitis, and many other serious health outcomes. Arboviruses are often in the forefront of discussions regarding public health and their global prominence is a major public health concern. In addition to ZikaV, these viruses include dengue (DEN), Japanese encephalitis (JE), West Nile virus (WNV), chikungunya fever (CHIK), hemorrhagic fevers such as Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV) [
