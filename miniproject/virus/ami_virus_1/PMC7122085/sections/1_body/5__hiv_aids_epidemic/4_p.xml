<p id="Par57">The public misconceptions and misinterpretations of the HIV/AIDS epidemic did not help the scientific attack on this disease; it resulted in a limited embracing of the scientific approach by communities to solve medical issues. Early on, after this virus was discovered, immunologists speculated that HIV infection could perhaps be managed through a vaccine approach [
