<p id="Par7"> Viral infections are a continued and expanding threat to global public health and are under continual epidemiological and medical scrutiny. Viral infections cause approximately 11 million deaths, annually, of which 1 million were due to HIV/AIDS, for example, in 2010 [

These fatalities are heightened with the periodic epidemics and pandemics of various strains of influenza, Ebola, continued HIV and HCV spread, TB, and many other viruses. These emerging and periodically re-emerging epidemic diseases pose an ongoing threat to global health security. At the end of 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) Department of Pandemic and Epidemic Diseases (PED) was monitoring worldwide viral outbreaks of avian influenza, coronaviruses (MERS-CoV, SARS), Ebola, Hendra, influenza (seasonal, pandemic), Nipah, Rift Valley fever, viral hemorrhagic fevers (including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever), yellow fever, and ZikaV [

The global spread of ZikaV has evolved into a global pandemic since its original emergence in the Americas, since 2015; ZikaV has evolved into a highly virulent and pathological virus for children and adults, becoming a current unparalleled pandemic. The spread of viral diseases is generally associated with fear that can hinder public health efforts [
