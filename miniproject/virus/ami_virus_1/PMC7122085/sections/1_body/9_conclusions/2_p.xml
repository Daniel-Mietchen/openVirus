<p id="Par72">From the viewpoint of evolution and at the molecular level, HIV and ZikaV are widely divergent although they entered the human framework near each other in tropical Africa. For example, their mutation rates are divergent. The mutation rate of HIV is 4.1 ± 1.7 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> mutations per base in a viral genome of 9749 bp. That means that there are about 39.97 mutations per genome for HIV-1. This is the most rapid mutation rate of any living organism on planet Earth. However, in comparison, the mutation rate of ZikaV, in vivo, is 12–25 bases a year, in a viral genome of 10,272 bp. However, comparisons of HIV-1 and ZikaV mutation rates are made difficult because their mutation rates are not measured or reported under identical laboratory or epidemiological conditions [
