<p id="Par67">The expansion of the ZikaV pandemic has been disturbingly like the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Initially, the HIV/AIDS epidemic was difficult to diagnose, the modes of transmission were not understood and the risk groups were unknown, thus, in retrospect, making the proliferation of this disease all but certain. The recent emergence of ZikaV mirrors similar delays in public health action and understanding that initially accelerated the spread of HIV/AIDS globally. Without a comprehensive and collaborative approach, ZikaV will have a similar damaging effect, globally, as the HIV/AIDS epidemic has had during the past decades.</p>
