<p id="Par81">Acclimated environments have an artificially multitude of chemical compounds (toxic, carcinogenic, radioactive) and biological (pathogenic) issued by a variety of sources, depending on the physical conditions (air humidity, air temperature, inadequate ventilation) of the environment. The air recirculation phenomenon is responsible for the increase of pathogenic microorganisms in the order of 1000 to 100,000 times in relation to the external air (Lee et al.,

Incorrect cleaning filters and ducts of air conditioning provide the development of microbial particles including viruses that may lead the occupants of air-conditioned environments contracting respiratory infections or allergic diseases. Viruses can persist in sufficient number to act as sources of infection for several hours, weeks or even months.
