<p id="Par85">Ventilation filters of two large public buildings were sampled to determine the presence of human respiratory viruses by polymerase chain reaction and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, two filters were positive for influenza B virus, and one filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Filters are installed in HVAC systems of buildings to protect ventilation equipment and maintain healthy indoor air quality. These filters process enormous volumes of air. Building HVAC filters may be used as a method of detection for airborne viruses. They may yield valuable information on the epidemiology and aerobiology of viruses in air that can report to the development of methods to prevent airborne transmission of viruses (Goyal et al.,

Numerous practical recommendations for design and operation of HVAC systems are needed. Following the recommendations will result in less pollution and increased indoor environmental quality (Hanssen,

Basic strategies of source control should not to make indoor air sterile but keep indoor environments dry, maintain good hygienic conditions in ventilation systems, apply effective filtration on mechanical supply ventilation, and use masks in the event of respiratory illness. The importance of hands in the transmission of viruses is well recognized and many of the studies relate specifically to handwashing.
