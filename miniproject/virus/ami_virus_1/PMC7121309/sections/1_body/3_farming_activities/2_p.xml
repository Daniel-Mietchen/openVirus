<p id="Par54">In animal slaughterhouses handling out cattle and sheep is hypothesized that these environments would contain significant amounts of bioaerosol due to the mechanical processes used to kill and process animals, a high degree of splashing and fluid handling, and also a high relative humidity of the environment. Workers on these conditions and meatworkers having exposure to a number of significant zoonotic diseases including leptospirosis, parapoxvirus, human papillomavirus subtypes HPV2, HPV4 and HPV7 are known to be at occupational health risk. These workers are also affected by a higher-rate of malignancies of the lung compared to the general population (Hall et al.,

The findings highlight the lurking dangers of using contaminated surface water and the need for routine monitoring of such waters for protection of public health (Sibanda and Okoh, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2012</xref>). Workers in concentrated animal feeding operations are at risk of adverse respiratory outcomes from exposures to indoor contaminants. Is indispensable an optimal management of indoor air quality, preventing the transmission of infectious respiratory disease to workers and animals (Kim et al.,
