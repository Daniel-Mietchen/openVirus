<p id="Par53">Farming, one of the oldest professions of mankind, is by far the one that employs the largest number of individuals worldwide. Although outdoor country work is supposedly healthy, farmers are at risk of respiratory diseases because of their work environment. It is very well established that chronic and acute respiratory diseases have been associated with work in confinement operations, like under-floor manure pits. Respirable dust and asphyxiating gases such as hydrogen sulphide, carbon dioxide, methane, and ammonia in high concentrations were measured on these area stations (Reeve et al.,

Faeces of deer mice can be contaminated with the Hantavirus, which can cause a devastating infection in humans, an influenza-like syndrome that often leads to respiratory failure. Farmers should wear protective respiratory equipment when cleaning building areas where mouse droppings are present. Farms are also the usual sources of influenza outbreaks. Influenza viruses infect pigs or poultry that can be transferred from animals to humans even without a mutation. This has so far been the case of the Influenza A virus subtype H5N1 that, to date, only infected farmers in close contact with birds (Cormier,
