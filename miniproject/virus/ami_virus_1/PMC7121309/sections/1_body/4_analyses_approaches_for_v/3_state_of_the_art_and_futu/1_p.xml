<p id="Par77">The assessment of viral contamination and/or infections play a key role in reducing global viral disease associated burden. It is currently acknowledged that the advances and development of molecular assays such as PCR, qRT-PCR, genotyping and multiplex assays endorsed important improvements in viral assessments regarding sensitivity, specificity, speed, simplicity and cost-effectiveness. Nevertheless, the developments of new approaches that can provide alternatives to evade the limitations of nucleic acid amplification techniques are of foremost importance. In this context, currently nanobiosensors represent a new promising tool for virus detection. This methodology, still at research stage, encompasses the technology of viral disease biosensors with nanoparticles and nanomaterials, focused on the development of miniaturized biosensors with high sensitivity, specificity, and stability. This state of the art technology aims to deliver an alternative tool for effective and rapid viral disease diagnosis with no requirement of highly trained personnel or heightened laboratory facilities (Kizek et al.,
