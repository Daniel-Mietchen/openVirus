<p id="Par71"> Currently, it is a consensus among researchers that methodologies based on nucleic acid amplification techniques offer advantages compared with traditional methods such as inoculation on embryonated eggs and cell culture, due to higher sensitivity, specificity and fast results, which will be further discussed. A comparison between the different viral identification methods is presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">7.1</xref>. The efficacy of sampling methodologies for viruses in environmental samples is still a matter of intense debate. A meta-analysis study performed with the aim to assess the efficacy of virus concentration methods associated to the molecular detection of adenovirus demonstrated that for detection in environmental samples qPCR or Nested-PCR should be prioritized over PCR; in water samples (e.g. rivers or lakes) ultracentrifugation should be associated with nested-PCR and that microfiltration membrane, ultrafiltration, and qPCR must be associated for assessment of treated and untreated sewage samples (Silva and Melo,
