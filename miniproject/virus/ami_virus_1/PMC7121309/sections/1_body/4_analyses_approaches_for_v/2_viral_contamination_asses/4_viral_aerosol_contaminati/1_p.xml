<p id="Par75">Airborne diseases are caused by pathogens transmitted through the air, that may be spread through coughing, sneezing, resuspension of dust, spraying of liquids, or similar activities likely to generate aerosol particles or droplets. The World Health Organization (WHO) has suggested that aerosol exposure may be the major route for spreading viral diseases (World Health Organization, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2010</xref>). Environmental monitoring of airborne viruses could provide an early indicator of dangerous viruses in the air. Filtration methods that may utilize gelatin membrane filters, impaction collectors and impingers are usually used to collect viral aerosols. Sampling using air filters for several hours with posterior extraction and nucleic acid amplification can increase the sensitivity of virus detection. Currently, well-established filter/real-time qPCR assays are performed to successfully measure viral aerosols. The prevalence of respiratory tract infections is intrinsically associated with respiratory viruses which account for high percentage of pediatric as well as adult infections. A study performed in a pediatrics department of a medical center, detected influenza A virus, human adenovirus, and enterovirus in aerosol samples trough filtration method combined with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) technique (Tseng et al.,
