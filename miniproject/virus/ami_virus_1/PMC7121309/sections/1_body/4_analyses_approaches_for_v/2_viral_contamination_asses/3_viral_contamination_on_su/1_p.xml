<p id="Par74">Viruses can be transmitted directly from individual to individual via sneezing, coughing and touching, or indirectly via the environment. The prevalence of pathogenic viruses in healthcare settings potentially transmitted by airborne, droplet and contact represents a significant threat for both workers’ and patients’ health. Thus, most of the presently performed studies regarding virus contamination of surfaces have focused on clinical settings, as demonstrated in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">7.3</xref>. The data resultant from these studies is of foremost importance since it can allow the identification of critical locations and direct the selection of infection control measures for health-care settings to decrease viral associated nosocomial infections. Protocols regarding transmission based precautions in both hospital personnel and patients are continuously updated at the international level (La Rosa et al.,
