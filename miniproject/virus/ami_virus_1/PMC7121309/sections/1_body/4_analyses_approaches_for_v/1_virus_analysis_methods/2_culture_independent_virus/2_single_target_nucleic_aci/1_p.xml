<p id="Par65"> The fundamental principles of nucleic acid amplification techniques are based on the thermostable polymerase-based target nucleic acid amplification which results in the production of millions of copies of the targeted sequence. These amplification products are then analyzed through diverse techniques. The advances in molecular analysis techniques lead to the development of the real-time PCR where the target amplification and detection steps, using fluorescent dyes, occur concomitantly. This methodology uses copulated software that monitors the thermal cycler data at every cycle and produces a quantitative amplification plot for each reaction. Thus, RT-PCR allows the performance of viral load assays to quantitatively assess the amount of virus in a sample. Furthermore, a modification of polymerase chain reaction, nested polymerase chain reaction (nested PCR), has been developed in order to decrease non-specific binding in products. This methodology encompasses two sets of primers, used in two successive PCR runs, whereas the second set intended to amplify a secondary target within the first run product. Currently, nucleic acid amplification techniques are considered the gold standard for rapid and accurate detection of viruses, compared to methodologies such as shell vial cell cultures.</p>
