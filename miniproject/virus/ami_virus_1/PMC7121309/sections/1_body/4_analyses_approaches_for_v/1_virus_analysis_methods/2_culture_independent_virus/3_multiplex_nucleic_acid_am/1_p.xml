<p id="Par66">Multiplex PCR assays were developed based on single target nucleic acid amplification methodologies with the aim to quantify multiple nucleic acid targets using specific probes to diverse viral targets in a single PCR reaction, allowing the assessment of viral co-infections. Currently, for respiratory viruses three FDA-approved platforms for multiplex PCR assays are available.
