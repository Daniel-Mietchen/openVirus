<p id="Par70">Currently, DNA sequencing is considered one of the most valuable, accurate and consistent methodologies for microorganisms identification and is applied in contexts were quick and precise identifications are required. This method is used to determine the exact sequence of a certain stretch of DNA. Several new sequencing technologies have been developed (next generation sequencing) with the aim to provide fast/efficient techniques for analysis of microorganisms bioburden. Genotyping assays utilize a combination of PCR and nucleic acid sequencing to identify viral genotypes. Genotyping methodology allows for the identification of genetic variants and can be performed via genotyping chips or arrays, depending on the variants of interest and resources available. Viral genotyping is mostly utilized to provide relevant clinical data to predict therapeutic responses to antiviral drugs and/or epidemiologic comparison.</p>
