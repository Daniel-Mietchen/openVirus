<p id="Par63"> The recent adaptation of cellular cultures to shell vials with subsequent direct or indirect immunofluorescence technique has dramatically decreased the time of diagnostics for clinical samples from weeks to less than 48 h by staining for early antigens of viral infections. Currently, this methodology is the most sensitive, non-molecular viral detection method, utilized for the identification of viruses such as respiratory viruses, enterovirus and adenovirus among others. Although embryonated chicken egg inoculation is still considered the “gold standard” method for influenza virus isolation and propagation, several primary cells as well as continuous cell lines have also been developed for influenza virus isolation and replication (Jianqiang Zhang,
