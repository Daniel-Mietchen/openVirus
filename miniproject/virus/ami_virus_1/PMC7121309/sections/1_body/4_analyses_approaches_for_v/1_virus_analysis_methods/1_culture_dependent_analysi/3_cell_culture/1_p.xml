<p id="Par62"> Mammalian cell culture technology has become a prominent and fundamental field in modern biotechnology, especially in the area of human health and has replaced embryonated eggs as the preferred methodology for virus growth and replication. Cellular cultures rely on techniques such as media changes, passaging, and transfection under aseptic conditions to avoid contaminations (e.g. bacteria, yeast, among others). Presently, numerous valuable cell monolayers are commercially available, and are regularly utilized in clinical laboratories for the diagnosis of virus infections. Some of the most utilized cell are HeLa derivative (Hep2), rhesus monkey kidney cells (RhMK), human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5), human lung carcinoma cells (A549), among others. These cell lines are selected for their ability to support the replication of a wide variety of clinically relevant viruses due to their ability to express cell type-specific factors that contribute to pathology during viral infection. For instance A549 cell line is considered representative of the Alveolar Type II pneumocytes of the human lung as it exhibits features of an ATII epithelial cell phenotype. Applying such methodology enables the isolation of diverse viruses, such as adenovirus, CMV, RSV, influenza A &amp; B, parainfluenza viruses types 1 to 3, VZV, as well as the Ebola virus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and human metapneumovirus (hMPV).</p>
