<p id="Par56">Virus started to be propagated in whole animals or embryonated chicken eggs before the use of cell culture methods. Virus cultivation in embryonated eggs is intrinsically dependent on the utilized egg, which must be sterile and the shell should be intact and healthy. The inoculation of the samples is made by injection into the fluid of the egg through a hole drilled in the shell. Viral growth and multiplication is revealed by embryo death, cell damage or through the formation of typical pocks or lesions on the membranes. The selection of the sites of viral inoculation in embryonated eggs is dependent of the studied virus, as each virus has different preferential location for growth and replication.
