<p id="Par64">The development of nucleic acid amplification techniques has endorsed the advance of molecular tools for virus identification using low specimen quantity with higher sensitivity and specificity, at the same time dramatically decreasing the time for identification. Currently these methodologies are accepted as the gold standard for clinical virology and have been utilized for the identification of different viruses in environmental samples from diverse contexts.</p>
