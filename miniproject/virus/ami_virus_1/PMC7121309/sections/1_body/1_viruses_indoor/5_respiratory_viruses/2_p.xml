<p id="Par14"> Despite all the progress of the last decades in the prevention and care of health, respiratory infections represent one of the major causes of disease in humans. This group remains the leading cause of outpatient consultation as well as antibiotic prescription and work absence. The chronic infections, causing disability, have the most important impact on quality of life. The main effect of the inadequate quality of indoor air is in respiratory system. Most studies focus on the influenza virus, but in general, we can say that a total concentration of viruses, in a variety of environments such as classrooms, health institutions, restaurants, offices and others corresponds to an average 4.7 ± 2.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> particles per cubic meter, without significant differences between the different indoor environments. Also, is estimated that the viral particles inhaled daily indoor correspond approximately to 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup>. Respiratory viruses can be transported over considerable distances by air currents and be inhaled, penetrating deep into the respiratory system (Prussin II et al.,
