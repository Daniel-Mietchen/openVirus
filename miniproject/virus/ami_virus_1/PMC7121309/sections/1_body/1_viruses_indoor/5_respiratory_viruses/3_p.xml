<p id="Par15"> Droplet transmission occurs when viruses travel on relatively large respiratory droplets (&gt;10 μm) that people sneeze, cough, or exhale during conversation or breathing, primary aerosolization. A single cough can release hundreds of droplets, up to 40,000, at speeds of up to 50–200 miles per hour, each droplet containing millions of viral particles. Aerosol droplets travel only short distances (1–2 m) before settlings on surfaces, where viruses can remain infectious for hours or days. Secondary aerosolization can occur when air displacements disperse the viruses back into the air from contaminated surfaces (La Rosa et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>). Transmission occurs through air droplets, aerosol and fomites that may come into contact with nasal and conjunctival epithelium. The etiological viral agents involved include: influenza virus types A and B, parainfluenza viruses types 1, 2, 3, and 4, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, and rhinoviruses/enteroviruses (Paba et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2014</xref>). The acute respiratory infections are the result of active multiplication of microbiological agents in the respiratory system when favourable conditions of the host exist. Viral or bacterial ethology, predisposing factors related to anatomical factors, immune changes, colonization of the naso and oropharynx, and the spread of these infections is favoured by the continuity of the epithelia of the respiratory system and a continuum between upper and lower airways. The upper and lower respiratory infections are in most cases (60%) of viral origin.
