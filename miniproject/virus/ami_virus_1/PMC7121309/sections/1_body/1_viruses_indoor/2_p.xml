<p id="Par10"> For instance, faeces can contain up to 10
 <sup>12</sup> viruses particles per gram and vomit up to 10
 <sup>7</sup> per millilitre, so the potential transfer contamination from hands to surfaces is frighteningly considerable. The most important source of potentially pathogenic viral aerosol is other humans and other means, as the flushing of a toilet that can aerosolize significant concentrations of airborne viruses. Virusesâ€™ survival on fomites is influenced by temperature, humidity, pH and exposure to ultraviolet light.
