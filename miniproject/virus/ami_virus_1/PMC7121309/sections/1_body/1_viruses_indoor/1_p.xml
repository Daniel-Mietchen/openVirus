<p id="Par9"> The main source of indoor viruses is the human being. Viruses are spread by air currents after resuspension of material scattered by aerosols droplets or saliva. We can say that viral infections are probably the most common acquired diseases indoor that affect man, knowing approximately a thousand types of different viruses involved. It is estimated about 60% of total human respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, with a rapid spread in the community, being a cause of high morbidity and decline in quality of life and productivity, since viruses can be easily transmitted, especially in crowded and poorly ventilated environments. It is well-known that viruses are shed in large numbers, with transmission routes extraordinary diverse, including direct contact with infected persons, faecal-oral transmission (through contaminated food and water), droplet and airborne transmission, and can survive for long periods on surfaces or fomites, emphasizing the possible role of surfaces in the transmission of viruses (Barker et al.,
