<p id="Par11"> Particle size, depth of penetration and the minimum dosage of the agent capable of causing disease are implicated in the infectivity. In addition, it is also important to be conscious of the risk groups, the most susceptible to contracting infection when exposed to microorganisms, conditioned by factors such as a weakened immune system, the children, the elderly, the pregnant women, the chronically ill, especially those suffering from respiratory or cardiovascular disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and acute exacerbations are frequent complications, thought to be caused by interactions between host factors, bacteria, viruses and changes in air quality producing increased inflammation in the lower airway with a long-lasting adverse influence on health status (Celli and Macnee,

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2007</xref>). Approximately of 50% of acute exacerbations of COPD are associated with symptoms of viral infections of the respiratory tract by rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus and influenza. Studies have shown that respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), influenza and parainfluenza virus (HPIV), and human enterovirus infections may be associated with virus-induced asthma, leading to diseases such as pneumonia or death (Tsukagoshi et al.,
