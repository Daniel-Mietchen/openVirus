<p id="Par35">Human adenovirus (AdV) is a non-enveloped, icosahedral virus of the genus Mastadenovirus, family Adenoviridae. There are more than 60 types classified into seven strains from A to G, defined via biological and molecular characteristics. Clinical manifestations are highly heterogeneous, ranging from upper and lower respiratory tract infections to gastroenteritis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, conjunctivitis, hepatitis, myocarditis and encephalitis. The burden of disease manifests as pneumonia, bronchiolitis, otitis media, conjunctivitis, and tonsillitis. The adenoviral detection rates indicate the potential contamination of the environment, with adverse effects on public health. Adenoviruses can cause severe or life-threatening illness, particularly in immunocompromised patients, children and the elderly. Some types are capable of establishing persistent asymptomatic infections in tonsils, adenoids, and intestines of infected hosts, and shedding can occur for months or years (Lessa et al.,
