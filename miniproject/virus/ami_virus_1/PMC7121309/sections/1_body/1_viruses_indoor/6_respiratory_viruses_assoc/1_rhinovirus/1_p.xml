<p id="Par19"> Rhinovirus (RV) is a small RNA virus belonging to the Picornaviridae family. More than 100 immunologically distinct serotypes have been identified and new serotypes are continuously emerging. This virus is responsible for more than 50% of cases of common cold, being the virus with the highest morbidity among respiratory diseases. In children causes bronchitis. Although the method of transmission of RVs is in doubt, they are thought to be mainly transmitted via large droplets, but indirect contact with contaminated fomites has also shown to transmit infection or by aerosols. Itâ€™s known that RV need only 10 s of contact (hand-to-hand) for infecting another person. The recurrence of viral infections is predominantly associated with an immune response to a serotype that does not provide immunity to reinfection with another serotype for the same virus (Ballow,
