<p id="Par29">The relative importance of the aerosol transmission route for influenza remains controversial. To determine the potential for influenza to spread via the aerosol route, the authors 6x measured the size distribution of airborne influenza A virus. Collected size-segregated aerosol samples during the 2009–2010 flu season in a health centre, a day-care facility and on board of aeroplanes. Filter extracts were analysed using quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Half of the 16 samples were positive, and their total virus concentrations ranged from 5800 to 37,000 genome copies m23. On average, 64% of the viral genome copies were associated with fine particles smaller than 2.5 mm, which can remain suspended for hours. Modelling of virus concentrations indoors suggested source strength of 1.6 + 1.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> genome copies m23 air h21 and a deposition flux onto surfaces of 13 + 7 genome copies m22 h21 by Brownian motion. Over 1 h, the inhalation dose was estimated to be 30 +18 median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50), adequate to induce infection. These results provide quantitative support for the idea that the aerosol route can be an important mode of influenza transmission (Yang et al.,

They cause severe colds, croup, bronchitis and pneumonia in children and adults and in infants the virus can cause life-threatening disease. Infection is probably spread by aerosols in addition to direct contact with contaminated surfaces. The persistence of PIV on hospital surfaces contaminated with patients’ secretions was noted as a potential source of transmission (Barker et al.,
