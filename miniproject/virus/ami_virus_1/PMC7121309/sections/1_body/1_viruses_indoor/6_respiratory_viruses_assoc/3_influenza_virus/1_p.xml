<p id="Par25">Influenza virus (IV) is one of the most common and highly contagious infectious diseases and can occur in people of any age. Influenza or flu produces an acute infection of the respiratory system with high transmissibility and global distribution. Is a RNA virus belonging to the Orthomixoviridae family which is subdivided into three distinct antigenic serotypes: A, B and C, causing moderate to severe acute febrile illness, resulting in variable degrees of systemic symptoms, ranging from mild fatigue to respiratory failure and death. Strains A and B have greatest potential epidemic, causing more versions of the flu. The flu vaccine only protects against viruses A and B. Influenza C viruses are antigenically stable, cause subclinical disease and do not cause epidemics. The influenza A and B have multiple subtypes that still suffer mutations, emerging new strains with consequent increased risk of epidemics or pandemics.</p>
