<p id="Par24">RSV is highly contagious and transmission can occur when infectious material comes into contact with mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth or nose, and possibly through the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough. Also result from contact with contaminated environmental surfaces, the commonest mode of transmission in school classrooms and day care centres. Transmission with fomites predominates over droplet contact can be transmitted by the airborne route. RSV RNA is detected in air samples from the hospital rooms of infected patients at large distances from the patientâ€™s bedside. Particles containing RSV RNA were detected in airborne throughout a health care facility, particles small enough to remain in the air for an extended period and to be inhaled deeply into the respiratory tract (6). Evidence shows that direct and indirect contact is a key factor in transmission hands, touching surfaces contaminated with fresh secretions from RSV-infected infants (Barker et al.,
