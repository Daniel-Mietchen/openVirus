<p id="Par28">On buildings ventilation systems Influenza A and B were detected (along with other groups of viruses), meaning that contamination exists in the surrounding environment. Several reviews consider three modes of transmission of influenza, not mutually exclusive, by large droplets, self-inoculation of the nasal mucosa by contaminated hands and the aerosol transmission, the mode of the greatest impact for infection, since it requires specialized personal protective equipment. Influenza virus RNA was directly detected in aerosol particles generated by normal breathing in patients with influenza and collected through an orinasal facemask; particles of 5 mm or less have a significant penetration into the respiratory tract all the way to the alveolar region. Increasing evidences point towards a role for aerosol transmission in the spread of influenza, at least over short distance where exposure to both aerosol and large droplets occurs. In most settings where there is adequate ventilation, long-range transmission does not appear to occur so frequently (Tellier,
