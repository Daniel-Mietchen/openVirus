<p id="Par26">The continuing threat of pandemics by the human influenza virus suggests an urgent and constant surveillance. Despite the vaccination continues to be considered the intervention of containment of infection, the viruses A (H1N1), A (H3N2) and influenza B persist with a global distribution and with such a power of infectivity that Influenza activity management has been undertaken by the Centres for Diseases Control. Influenza A (H3N2) has a uncontrolled and potential infectivity demonstrating a much greater transmissibility than A (H1N1) and B viruses (Chen and Liao,

Influenza affects all age groups, but it is the elderly and persons with underlying health problems who are at particular risk from complications of influenza and are more likely to require hospitalization. Both influenza virus A and B revealed to survive on hard surfaces such as stainless steel and plastic for 24 ± 48 h and on absorbent surfaces such as cloth, paper and tissues for up to 12 h (Barker et al.,

Influenza virus is transmitted by droplets, through the coughing and sneezing of infected persons, but it can also be transmitted by airborne droplet nuclei as well as by contact, either through direct skin-to-skin contact or through indirect contact with contaminated environments (La Rosa et al.,
