<p id="Par36">Modes of transmission are also diverse, primarily spread by the respiratory route, person-to-person contact, fomites, and occasionally by airborne aerosols. Since AdVs are able to infect a wide range of tissues, they can be excreted in large numbers in different body fluids during the acute illness, including oral secretions and faeces. The spread by the fecal-oral route happens through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. Small doses of AdV in aerosols resulted in infection accompanied by febrile acute respiratory disease, sometimes with pneumonia. Humidity affects the viability and dispersal of AdVs in aerosol. These viruses tend to survive best at high relative humidities. Aerosols seem to be very resistant to UV air disinfection. Adenovirus outbreaks have been documented in different indoor environments, including health care facilities, schools, military hospitals and barracks, throughout the year (La Rosa et al.,
