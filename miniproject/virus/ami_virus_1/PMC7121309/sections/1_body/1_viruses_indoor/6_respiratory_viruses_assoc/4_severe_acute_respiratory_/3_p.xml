<p id="Par33">The most common mode of transmission is contamination by warm air indoor, by water droplets generated by coughs or sneezes, but may be transmitted through the airborne route as well. Transmission in an aircraft from an infected person to passengers located seven rows of seats ahead had been described. Aerosol generated by the building’s sewage systems is also responsible. Many health care workers were infected after endotracheal intubation and bronchoscopy procedures which often involve aerosolization. These observations indicate the possible role of more remote modes of transmission, including airborne spread by small droplet nuclei, and emphasize the need for adequate respiratory protection in addition to strict contact and droplet precautions when managing SARS patients. Contaminated fomites or hospital surfaces might contribute to spread. It is known that these viruses may live on hands, tissues and other surfaces for up to 6 h and up to 3 h after droplets have dried. Airborne spread of the virus appears to explain the happened large community outbreaks of SARS (Ignatius et al.,
