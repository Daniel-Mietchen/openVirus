<p id="Par20"> Rhinoviruses can survive on environmental surfaces for several hours. Infectious viruses have been recovered from naturally contaminated objects in the surroundings of persons with RV colds. Aerosols are generated by coughing, talking, sneezing and even simply breathing (Huynh et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2008</xref>). Rhinovirus outbreaks in health care facilities, capable of determining severe infections and also death have been documented (MacIntyre et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2012</xref>). RVs have also been detected in transport vehicles (La Rosa et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>). Even in the common cold, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses predominate (Barker et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>; Heikkinen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>), but the role of rhinoviruses is the most prominent, in particular are responsible for outbreaks of the common cold in the general community such as schools, day care centres and hospitals (Barker et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2001</xref>; Heikkinen et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>; La Rosa et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2013</xref>). Rhinoviruses and coronaviruses also cause a greater disease burden in elderly people living at home, compared with influenza or syncytial viruses.
