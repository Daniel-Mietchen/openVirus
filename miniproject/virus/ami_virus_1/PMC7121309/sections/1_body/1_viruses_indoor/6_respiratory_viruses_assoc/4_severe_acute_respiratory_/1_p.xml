<p id="Par31">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a respiratory illness caused by a type of coronavirus from the Coronaviridae family, which can cause mild to moderate upper respiratory illness, such as the common cold or develop into potentially severe pneumonia. This virus is known as SARS-CoV. The SARS epidemic broke out in 2002â€“2003 in southern China, and spread to other regions of Asia and also to Europe and North America. It caused more than 8000 infections worldwide with an approximately 10% fatality rate, along with enormous economic losses. One or a few trivial mutations at the receptor-binding surface of a virus may lead to dramatic epidemic outcomes by facilitating cross-species infections and human-to-human transmission of the virus (Li,
