<p id="Par39">The disease occurs most often in the winter, with annual epidemics occurring from December to June. The highest rates of illness occur among infants and young children. A large proportion of hospital admissions due to gastroenteritis in children less than 5 years old are caused by rotavirus. Some adults acquired rotavirus infections a few days after their childrenâ€™s illnesses, suggesting that the children rather than the parents brought infection into the home, though disease tends to be mild. Immunity after infection is incomplete, but repeated infections tend to be less severe than the original infection.</p>
