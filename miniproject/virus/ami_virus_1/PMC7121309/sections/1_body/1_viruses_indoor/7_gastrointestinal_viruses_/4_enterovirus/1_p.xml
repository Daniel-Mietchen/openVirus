<p id="Par43">Enteroviruses (EVs) are members of the Picornaviridae family, a large and diverse group of small RNA viruses present worldwide. In humans, EVs target a variety of different organs causing gastrointestinal, respiratory and myocardial and central nervous system diseases. In temperate climates, enteroviral infection occurs primarily in the summer and early fall. Although the majority of infections are asymptomatic or result in a self-limited illness, fatalities do occur, especially in neonates or individuals with B-cell immunodeficiency. Enterovirus outbreaks in neonatal units and school nurseries, reflects the susceptibility of infants to EVs infection, leading to extensive discussion on control measures and interventions.</p>
