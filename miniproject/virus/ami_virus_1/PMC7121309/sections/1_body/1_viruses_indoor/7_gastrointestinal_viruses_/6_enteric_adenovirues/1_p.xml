<p id="Par47"> Human adenoviruses (AdV) are classified into 47 serotypes and six subgenera (Aâ€“F) with different tropisms are associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis in schools, paediatric hospital and nursing homes. They may be second to rotavirus as a cause of gastroenteritis in young children, especially newborns, mainly caused by serotypes AdV 40 and AdV 41 of subgenus F. The clinical characteristics include watery diarrhea accompanied by vomiting, low grade fever and mild dehydration. Institutionalized persons, immunocompromised persons and Transplant recipients seem to be among the most severely affected, with mortality rates as high as 60%. Respiratory symptoms are infrequent but some studies have suggested that adenovirus infections may be involved with chronic airway obstruction, pulmonary dysplasia, myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy, mononucleosis-like syndromes, sudden infant perinatal death and, perhaps most intriguingly, the development of obesity. Although these associations may or may not be causal, understanding adenovirus transmission seems to be the key to their further study. Adenoviruses are the most UV-resistant viruses, and their detection is now a key indicator of water quality (Uhnoo et al.,
