<p id="Par46"> Faecal-oral spread is the primary transmission mode and the foodborne and waterborne transmission. Airborne transmission of NoV is also a cause of acute viral gastroenteritis. Sources of contaminated aerosol are diverse. Droplets being inhaled can be deposited in the upper respiratory tract, and subsequently be swallowed along with respiratory mucus. Aerosol droplets produced during vomiting could settle onto indoor surfaces that might then be transferred to hands of exposed individuals through physical contact, or deposited on the floor from which they can be resuspended by human movement and turbulence. Aerosol droplets can also be generated from toilet flushing. Transmission via fomites is documented. The viruses were identified in indoor environments such as hospitals, schools, kindergartens, restaurants, care facilities, hotels and concert halls as well as airplanes, buses and cruise ships (Morillo and Timenetsky Mdo,
