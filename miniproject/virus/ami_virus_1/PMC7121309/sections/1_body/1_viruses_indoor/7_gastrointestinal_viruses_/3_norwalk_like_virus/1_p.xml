<p id="Par41">Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), RNA virus belonging to Caliciviridae family, also known as small round structured viruses or caliciviruses, are an important cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks and are spread frequently through contaminated food or water. Projectile vomiting associated with NLVs is probably a major source of cross-infection because it is estimated that 3Ã—107 particles are distributed as an aerosol into the environment during a vomiting attack. Carpets can also serve as reservoirs of infection.</p>
