<p id="Par44">Faecal-oral transmission is the major mode of transmission. Other important routes of transmission are person-to-person contact and the inhalation of airborne viruses in respiratory droplets. Infectious coxsackievirus, a member of the EV genus, in large droplets and droplet nuclei generated by coughs and sneezes as well as in the air of rooms contaminated by such discharges, transmit this viral infection by the airborne route. Aerosol transmission is suspected of having contributed significantly to the EV epidemic which infected up to 300,000 children and caused 78 deaths in Taiwan in 1998 (Chang et al.,
