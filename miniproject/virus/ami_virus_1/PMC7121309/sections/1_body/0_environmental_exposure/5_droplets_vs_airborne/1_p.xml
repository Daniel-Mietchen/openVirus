<p id="Par6">Droplet transmission is not to be confused with airborne transmission. Aerosols are suspensions in air (or in a gas) of solid or liquid particles, small enough to remain airborne for a prolonged period of time because of their low settling velocity. Droplets do not remain suspended in the air. Airborne transmission depends on viruses from evaporated droplets or dust particles that can remain suspended in the air for long periods. Droplet transmission occurs when viruses travel on relatively large respiratory droplets (&gt;10 μm) that people sneeze, cough, or exhale during conversation or breathing (primary aerosolization) (La Rosa et al.,
