<p id="Par8"> Once aerosolized, aerosols virusesâ€™ particles may travel significant distances through buildings before being captured and retained by HVAC filters, or they pass through as well, because most HVAC filters are not 100% efficient in capturing particles. The rapidity with which airborne viruses are inactivated during transport or after filter capture is uncertain and merits additional study. Analysis of ventilation filters certainly could play a role in the epidemiology of infectious diseases caused by pathogens released into the environment, suiting all the different situations of confinement (Goyal et al.,
