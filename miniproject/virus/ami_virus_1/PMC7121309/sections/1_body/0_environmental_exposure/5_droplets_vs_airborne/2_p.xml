<p id="Par7">The transport and the settling of a bioaerosol are affected by its physical properties and the environmental parameters that it encounters. Size, density and shape of droplets or particles, air currents, relative humidity and temperature, determine the capacity of generation of airborne bioaerosols from liquid suspensions, undergo desiccation, whereas those generated as dusts or powders partially rehydrate. The presence of moulds indicates a problem with water penetration or high humidity. Bioaerosols can be transmitted at long distances. Small particle aerosols, as shown during endotracheal intubation, are transmitted to persons in the immediate area near the patient. Viruses’ inductors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), influenza and norovirus are transmitted from patients primarily by contact and/or droplet routes, while airborne transmission occurs over a limited distance (Srikanth et al.,
