<p id="Par51">In a hospital paediatric unit when there was an increase in the number of children suffering from rotavirus gastroenteritis, on the surfaces in direct contact with children (thermometers, play mats and toys) rotavirus was detected in 63% of samples compared with 36% for surfaces without direct contact (telephones, door handles and washbasins). Rotavirus was also found in hand washings of 19% of attendants of patients with non-rotavirus diarrhoea, indicating that they may have come into contact with other attendants and patients in adjacent beds. This highlights the potential for contaminated hands to spread the infection (Soule et al.,
