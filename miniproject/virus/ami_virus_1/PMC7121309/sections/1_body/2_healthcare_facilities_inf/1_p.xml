<p id="Par48">Indoor air quality proves to be of great importance in hospitals due to the spread of air microorganisms maximizing nosocomial infections. Reports about infections correlated with the presence of viral aerosols in indoor air remain scarce. During and after illness, viruses are shed in large numbers in body secretions, including blood, faeces, urine, saliva, and nasal fluid (La Rosa et al.,

Occupants are a potential source of microorganisms as they shed the microorganisms from the skin squamous and the respiratory tract. Ventilation causes dilution thus reducing the microbial load. Sinks, wash-basins and drains, nebulisers, humidiphiers, and cooling towers are the potential sources which colonize on the moist surfaces. Sweeping of floors, changing of bed linens and entry into the hospital buildings through ventilation ducts also can be the sources of airborne microorganisms. Since exposure levels are high, this may be an issue for immunocompromised patients (Srikanth et al.,
