<p>These findings were published at least 4 years before the virus hit the island of Saint Martin in September 2013. Yet the American and Caribbean preparedness and response to the introduction of CHIKV was precarious; as of 2017, only Canada, Cuba, and Chile did not observe autochthonous cases in the region, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) reported 631 chikungunya deaths among 2.5 million cases [

Considering only 3 states of northeastern Brazil (Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte e Bahia) and 4 countries/territories in the Americas (Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guadeloupe, and Martinique), an excess mortality of more than 14,000 deaths during chikungunya epidemics has been estimated for the years 2014 to 2016, mainly concentrated among the elderly [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007575.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. There is no comprehensive estimate of excess mortality for Colombia and Brazil (after 2016), the countries that recorded the largest CHIKV epidemics, along with the Dominican Republic. Nonetheless, if a similar excess mortality pattern is considered, more than 35,000 deaths caused primarily or secondarily by CHIKV infection may have occurred in the Americas and the Caribbean in about 4 years (2014–2017).
