  <p>Temporal distribution of the weekly incidence proxies for influenza A/H3N2 from 2010 to 2019. Epidemic week 1 corresponds to calendar week 36. Blue lines indicate the week at which the prediction of the epidemic size took place in each season, corresponding to the time at which the sum of the incidence of influenza A/H3N2 in the past 5 weeks exceeds the statistically chosen threshold 
   <italic>h</italic> = 480,000 cases. Red lines indicate the prediction timing, corresponding to the time at which the complementary cumulative incidence from week 1 exceeds the chosen threshold 
   <italic>h
