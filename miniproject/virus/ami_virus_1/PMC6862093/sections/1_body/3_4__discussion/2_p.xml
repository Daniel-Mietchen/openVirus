<p>The present study verifies that seasonal influenza virus types interact with each other, and negative correlations are seen around the time at which the predominant type becomes predictable. Our findings indicate that it is vital to account for the introduction of viruses during real-time prediction of any type of seasonal influenza because the incidences interfere with each other. As long as different influenza virus types continue to co-circulate, it must be remembered that the epidemic size is not determined according to transmissibility and herd immunity alone. Goldstein et al. [
 <xref rid="B17-ijerph-16-04179" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] first conducted an epidemiological analysis of interference among co-circulating influenza viruses in a state-specific setting of the United States [
