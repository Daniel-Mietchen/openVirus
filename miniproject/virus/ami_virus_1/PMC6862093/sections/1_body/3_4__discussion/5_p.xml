<p>Despite these limitations, we believe that the present study sufficiently characterizes interacting influenza virus type structures, using data from 47 prefectures during nine influenza seasons in Japan. Such interaction among seasonal influenza viruses allowed us to predict the size of influenza epidemics during the early phase of the season. Our findings provide useful insight into influenza forecasting and preparedness for future influenza pandemics.</p>
