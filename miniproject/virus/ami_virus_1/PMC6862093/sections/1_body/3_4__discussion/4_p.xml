<p>Four limitations of this study must be discussed. First, there was no systematic sampling scheme used for virus surveillance data. For instance, severe cases with influenza A/H3N2 might have been more frequently sampled at hospitals than influenza A/H1N1; thus, the examined empirical data cannot reveal the full picture of all infected individuals. Second, vaccination was underway in each season, although only older people with underlying comorbidities receive routine vaccination against influenza in Japan. Homologous vaccines could have modified our results. Third, various heterogeneities were ignored, including spatial heterogeneity with respect to the predominant virus type and age specificity with respect to acquired immunity to a specific virus type. Fourth, whereas we epidemiologically identified a strong signature of interactions among different types of influenza viruses, the exact mechanisms behind our observations have yet to be elucidated.</p>
