<p>In observing negative correlations with incidence between index and complementary viruses, we also showed that the underlying mechanisms of interactions might differ for the interaction between influenza A/H3N2 and A/H1N1 and that between influenza type A and B viruses. As for the latter interaction, the consistent pattern of influenza type A virus predominance, followed by predominance of influenza type B virus, is indicative of differential seasonal preference or other mechanisms that have yet to be identified. In relation to stockpiling of oseltamivir in planning for potential simultaneous epidemics of different virus types, our findings indicate that the epidemic peak of pandemic virus may coincide with that of another influenza type A virus, although the epidemic peak of pandemic virus may not coincide with that of influenza type B virus. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that the population was largely susceptible to historically emerged pandemic viruses in the 20th and 21st centuries at the time of their emergence and perhaps more susceptible in comparison with seasonal influenza virus of the same subtype. Thus, the interference between pandemic and seasonal influenza viruses (type A) could be more abrupt than the interactions among seasonal viruses. In fact, influenza A/H3N2 was seldom observed during the course of the 2009 pandemic.</p>
