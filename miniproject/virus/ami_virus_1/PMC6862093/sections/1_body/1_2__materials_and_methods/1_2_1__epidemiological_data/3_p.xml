<p>Japanese influenza surveillance monitors influenza trends from calendar week 36 to calendar week 35 (from October to the end of September in the subsequent year). Epidemiological week 1 corresponds to calendar week 36. Because the epidemic size of A/H1N1 in 2009 was exceptionally high owing to the A/H1N1 pandemic, and our aim in this study was to investigate the interference among seasonal influenza viruses, we analyzed data from calendar week 36 in 2010 to calendar week 35 in 2019.</p>
