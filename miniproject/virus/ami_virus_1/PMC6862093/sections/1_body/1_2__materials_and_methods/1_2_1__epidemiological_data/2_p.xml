<p>Here, we used a proxy measure of the type-specific incidence (A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B), calculating the incidence as the product of the weekly number of reported influenza cases and the proportion of virus type identification for the week among the three virus types. Throughout this article, we define the index virus as the dominant virus type in an epidemic season. When choosing one virus type as the index, we defined the sum of the incidence of the other two virus types as the complementary incidence.</p>
