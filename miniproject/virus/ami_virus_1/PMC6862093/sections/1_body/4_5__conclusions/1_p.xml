<p>We examined the interaction among seasonal influenza viruses (influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and B) using sentinel and virus surveillance data in Japan. Co-circulating influenza viruses interact with each other as far as the size and peak timing of the epidemic, indicating that epidemic dynamics are not determined by transmissibility and herd immunity alone.</p>
