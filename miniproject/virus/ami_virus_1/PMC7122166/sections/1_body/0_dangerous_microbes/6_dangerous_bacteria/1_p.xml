<p id="Par16">Bacteria resistant to antibacterial drugs have developed rapidly among staphylococci (MRSA), enterococci (VRE), tuberculosis bacilli (multidrug-resistant mycobacteria) and gram-negative rods (ESBL) in the last 30–50 years. From 2009 to 2010 onwards, super-resistant gram-negative rods (CRE, CPE) have increased rapidly with transmission of genes with total drug resistance (NDM-1) [

    <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> is producing lethal toxins and spores that can survive in the environments for 100 years or more. Minimum infectious dose is 1–3 spores, and toxin-producing anthrax may cause skin, lung or intestinal anthrax, dependent on the transmission via contact, air or food. The non-skin anthrax has a very high lethality. Today, about 2000 people are infected each year, from eating or handling infected meat. During peace time, there are few incidents of threats using bioterror weapons like anthrax. However, autumn 2001 anthrax was spread in the United States by “powder letters” [

Tularemia is a zoonotic disease or colonization among wild animals as rodents and hares and may survive at colder seasons for long periods in water, amoebas, birds and insects like ticks. The infection (skin, lung, intestine) is transmitted via contact with infected animals, inhalation of airborne bacteria, contaminated water and ticks.
