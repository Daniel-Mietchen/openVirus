<p id="Par8">VHF virus and a number of other special viruses are considered to cause the world’s most dangerous infections with very high mortality, lack of therapeutic possibilities and often absence of effective vaccines. Such viruses are identified as high-risk agents or “biohazard-level 4” agents and are treated at the highest level of infection protection with strict isolation measures [

They are mostly vector borne by insects and animals (zoonosis), dependent on a tropical-subtropical climate and temperature. Therefore, the colder zones in Europe, America, Asia and Australia are nearly free from more such serious infectious agents (see the table below) [

    <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>). SARS and MERS (
    <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>) may be spread globally as nosocomial infections. MERS is a newly discovered coronavirus-zoonosis (dromedaries, bats, etc.) and acts as SARS, also with a tendency for nosocomial spread in hospitals, still going on in the Middle East. [
