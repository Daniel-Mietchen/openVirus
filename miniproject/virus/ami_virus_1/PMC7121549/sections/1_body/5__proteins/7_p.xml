<p id="Par22">The F protein is synthesized as an inactive precursor called F0, which consists of two domains, F2 (1–130 amino acids) and F1 (137–574 amino acids), and also has a cleaved peptide (131–136 amino acids). The F1 subunit is anchored to the membrane. The F1 subunit is relatively well preserved and is greatly affected in its function by deletions or substitutions of amino acids [
