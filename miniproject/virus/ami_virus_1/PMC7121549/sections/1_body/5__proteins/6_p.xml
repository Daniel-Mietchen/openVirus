<p id="Par21">The glycoprotein F has 574 amino acids with a molecular weight of 70 kDa, and the gene that encodes it has 1903 nucleotides. Identified as a fusion protein, it is responsible for the attachment of the viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell, releasing nucleocapsid directly within the cytoplasm. Also, it is responsible for the fusion of the cell infected with neighbor cells, favoring the formation of the syncytium [
