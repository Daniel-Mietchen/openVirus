<p id="Par24">The glycoprotein G is the viral attachment engaged in the adsorption of virus, and it has been shown that antibodies against the G glycoprotein inhibited the binding of virus to the cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The glycoprotein G is of special interest for showing the largest variability between the viral isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] and can support large deletions or multiple amino acid substitutions without loss of function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. This variability among strains of HRSV is a signature feature that can alter the pathogenicity and adaptation of the virus and contribute to the ability of the virus to cause repeated infections and outbreaks by escaping the immune system. The glycoproteins F and G are the most important proteins involved in a protective immune response [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], and antibodies against them show strong neutralization activity in vitro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>].
