<p id="Par16">In cells infected with HRSV, 11 proteins have been identified. Of these, 2 are nonstructural proteins, NS1 and NS2, present in abundance in the cells, but in small amounts in the virion. The others are structural proteins, M (matrix) and M2-1(transcriptiol elongation factor) proteins, N (nucleoprotein), P (phosphoprotein), L (large polymerase), and M22 nucleocapsid viral proteins, and 3 are surface glycoproteins G (attachment), F (fusion), and SH (small hydrophobic) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] and therefore are the most studied.
