<p id="Par19">The M proteins (PM, 27 kDa) and M2-1 (PM, 22 kDa) are internal and not glycosylated, possessing, respectively, 194 and 256 amino acids, and the genes that encode them have 958 and 961 nucleotides, respectively. The M protein mediates the association of nucleocapsid with the viral envelope [
