<p id="Par17">The NS1 (molecular weight PM, 15.5 kDa) and NS2 (PM, 27 kDa) proteins have, respectively, 139 and 124 amino acids, and the genes that encode these have 532 and 503 nucleotides, respectively. Their functions are not well understood, but it is presumed that they are related to the structural regulation of RNA synthesis, the morphogenesis of the virion, or the interaction with the host cells [
