<p id="Par18">The proteins P, L, and N are associated with genomic RNA and nucleocapsid, forming the ribonucleoprotein complex, considered as the minimum unit necessary for transcription and replication of the virus. The P protein is highly phosphorylated and acidic and has a key role in the regulation of the transcription and replication process. It has 241 amino acids and a molecular weight of 35 kDa, and the gene that encodes it has 914 nucleotides. The nucleoprotein N has 391 amino acids and a molecular weight of 43.4 kDa, and the gene that encodes it has 1203 nucleotides and is the main structural protein of the nucleocapsid, closely associated with the genomic RNA. The L protein, consisting of 2165 amino acids with a molecular weight of 250 kDa, is the largest viral protein. The gene that encodes the L protein has 6578 nucleotides [
