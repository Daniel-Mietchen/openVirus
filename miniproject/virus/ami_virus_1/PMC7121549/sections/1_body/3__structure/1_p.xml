<p id="Par13">The virion is pleomorphic with a diameter of 150–300 nm and is composed of an internal nucleocapsid of helical symmetry and an envelope derived from the host cytoplasmic membrane; viral glycoproteins that protrude from the envelope as 11- to 20-nm projections, separated by intervals of 6–10 nm, are involved in the processes of adherence and penetration of the virus. The viral genome is composed of a single-stranded RNA molecule, not segmented, and with negative polarity. Each infectious particle contains only one functional copy of the genome (Fig.
