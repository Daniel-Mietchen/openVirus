<p id="Par14">The virus contains a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome with 15,222 nucleotides (nt), with molecular weight of 5 × 10
 <sup>6</sup> Da, which serves as a template for transcription of messenger RNAs (mRNAs), encoding for 11 proteins. The genome transcription takes place in the 5′ → 3′ direction. The 3′-region of the genomic RNA consists of a region of 44 nucleotides that presumably contains the viral promoter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. The first 30 nt in this region are highly susceptible to inactivation by the insertion or deletion of nucleotides. This region is followed by 10 genes that encode 11 proteins, in the following order: 
 <italic>NS1</italic>, 
 <italic>NS2</italic>, 
 <italic>N</italic>, 
 <italic>P</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic>, 
 <italic>SH</italic>, 
 <italic>G</italic>, 
 <italic>F</italic>, 
 <italic>M2</italic>, 
 <italic>L</italic>. The last gene, 
 <italic>L</italic>, is followed by a region that is more tolerant to the insertion or deletion of nucleotides [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>].
