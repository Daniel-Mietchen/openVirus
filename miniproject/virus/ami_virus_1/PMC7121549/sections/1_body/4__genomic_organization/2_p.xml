<p id="Par15">The first nine genes are separated by inter-gene regions ranging from 1 to 52 nt in size, which apparently do not have an important role in the modulation of gene expression and show little conservation among isolates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The beginning of each gene contains a conserved signal (gene start signal) composed of nine nucleotides, 3′-CCCCGUUUA, except for the 
 <italic>L</italic> gene, which presents the following differences as underlined: 3′-
 <italic>CCCUGUUUUA</italic>. The genes end with a semi-conserved sign (gene end signal) composed of 12 or 13 nucleotides whose sequence is 3′-UCAAUNAAAUUU, which drives the end of transcription and polyadenylation. The last two genes, 
 <italic>M2</italic> and 
 <italic>L</italic>, have in common 68 nt. Consequently, the gene 
 <italic>L</italic> has the initiation of the transcript inside the M2 gene [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The M2 has two ORFs (open reading frames), which give rise to proteins M2-1 and M2-2. The organization of the gene of HRSV is schematized in Fig.
