<p id="Par30">In 2012, Eshaghi et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] detected in group A one repetition of 72 nucleotides (GTCAAGAGGAAACCCTCCACTCAACCACCTCCGAAG GCTATCTAAGCCCATCACAAGTCTATACAACATCCG) in the C-terminal portion of the gene (G), being the largest duplication described in this group. This new genotype was called ON1 and was found in 10% of HRSV isolates. In 2013 this ON1 genotype was found in 75% of all isolates in Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>], and in 2015 the ON1 genotype had attained natural dominance and become the predominant genotype circulating in different areas of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. This area is specifically targeted for neutralizing antibodies, and these types of changes of structure can lead to changes in immunogenicity and pathogenicity of the virus. However, additional studies are still required to explore the pathogenicity, transmissibility, and replication of this new variant .
