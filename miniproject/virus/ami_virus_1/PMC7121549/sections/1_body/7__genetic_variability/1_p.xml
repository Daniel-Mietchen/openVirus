<p id="Par28">The variability of the G protein is concentrated in the extracellular domain, where two variable regions have a high content of serine and threonine, between 69 to 164 and 207 to 298 amino acids , with approximately 56% divergence between groups A and B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Interspersing this region of high variability, there is a conserved region with a small segment of 13 amino acids (164â€“176) and four cysteine residues (C173, C176, C182, C186), which are well preserved in all samples of HRSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>], suggesting that this region is responsible for binding the virus to a cell receptor. However, data about the region for genotypes that emerged after 2010 are currently lacking.
