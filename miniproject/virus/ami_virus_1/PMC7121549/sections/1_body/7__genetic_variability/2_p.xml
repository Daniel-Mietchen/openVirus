<p id="Par29">The genotyping of HRSV-A and HRSV-B is based on the variability of the G-protein gene. For HRSV A, 11 genotypes were reported and designated as GA1, GA2, GA3, GA4, GA5, GA6, and GA7 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], SAA1 (South Africa, A1) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>], and more recently, NA1, NA2, NA3, and NA4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. For HRSV-B, 17 genotypes have been described and designated as GB1, GB2, GB3, and GB4 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>], SAB1, SAB3 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>], BA1–BA6 (Argentina) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">109</xref>], BA7–BA10 (Japan) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and B11 (Korea) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Interestingly, strains belonging to genotype BA of HRSV-B exhibited duplication of 60 nucleotides (nt) in the second variable region protein gene 
 <italic>G</italic>, but were not associated with more severe clinical manifestations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>]. In Brazil, the only genotypes circulating currently from HRSV-A are NA2, NA3, and ON1 and BA genotyping from HRSV-B.
