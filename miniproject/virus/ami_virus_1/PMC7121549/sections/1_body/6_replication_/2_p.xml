<p id="Par26">The virus enters into the cell through fusion with the cell membrane. After penetration, the viral envelope remains as part of the cell membrane. The nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm and begins the process of transcription of the viral genome by the viral polymerase. The genes are transcribed in sense 3′ → 5′ with a sign promoting to the 3′-side [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition to the transcription and translation of proteins, another important step is the replication of the viral genome, which produces an intermediate positive (+ ssRNA), which will serve as a template to generate more copies of the viral genome (ssRNA). All the replication process takes place in the cytoplasm [
