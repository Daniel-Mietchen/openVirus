<p id="Par25">The cell receptor specific for the glycoprotein G was first identified by Krusat and Streckert [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], who showed that preincubation of the virus with heparin inhibited the infection in cell culture and that the G protein binds heparin. These results suggest that heparin or other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) similar to heparin, present on the cell surface, are involved in the binding of the virus to the cell. The binding site of the glycoprotein G to the heparin (or another GAG) was mapped between the 184 and 198 amino acids of the protein G for group A and among the 183 to 197 amino acids for group B. Martinez et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] confirmed that the presence of these receptors is critical for the binding of the virus.
