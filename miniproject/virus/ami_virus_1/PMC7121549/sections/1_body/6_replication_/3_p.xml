<p id="Par27">The maturation of the virus occurs in the first instance, with the combination of proteins N and P to the genomic RNA and subsequent addition of other auxiliary proteins to the nucleocapsid. The surface glycoproteins are inserted into the cytoplasmic membrane of the host cell . In the next step the matrix protein interacts by noncovalent forces to the cytoplasmic tails of the surface glycoprotein. The assembled internal structures of the virus interact with this surface and drive the budding, with the release of the virus, when the virus acquires the lipoprotein envelope [
