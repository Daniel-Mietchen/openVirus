<p id="Par52">The rapid antigen detection tests (RADTs) are dipstick-based immunoassays that allow for the rapid, qualitative detection of RSV antigen (viral fusion protein) directly from nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, or nasal/nasopharyngeal wash specimens from symptomatic pediatric patients. The RADTs provide a result in 15 min, compared to approximately 90 min for a conventional IFA test and 2â€“3 h for ELISA [

These methods, although effective, may present several drawbacks, including price and skilled personnel. All these issues pose a challenge to hospitals and pediatric clinics to apply the best medical management for monitoring or treatment of children with suspected infection.
