<p id="Par50">Hughes et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] compared the three diagnostic techniques for HRSV: isolation in cell culture , direct and indirect immunofluorescence (IFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Both immunofluorescence-based methods detected more positive samples (showed higher sensitivity) than viral isolation. However, 15% of the samples found positive by viral isolation were negative by immunofluorescence, demonstrating the need for the use of at least two diagnostic methods.
