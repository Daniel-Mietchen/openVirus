<p id="Par49">The isolation in cell culture , regarded as the gold standard, can be carried out in a wide variety of human and animal cell lines, but HEp-2 and HeLa cells are the most used [

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">12.4</xref>). Nevertheless, as viral isolation in cell culture is difficult, the diagnosis of infection is most often accomplished by detection of HRSV antigens in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells by immunofluorescence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">12.5</xref>) or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, faster methods that do not require the presence of infectious viral particles. These last two methods require the adequate preparation of the specimens by removing excess mucus. Finally, success of the immunofluorescence technique, aside from well-trained personnel and well-prepared samples, requires a minimum number of infected cells to enable a correct diagnosis [
