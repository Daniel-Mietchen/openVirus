<p id="Par48">The laboratory diagnosis of HRSV can be carried out by the direct detection of viruses, viral antigens, or the viral genome or, indirectly, based on the detection of specific antibodies. For the routine clinical laboratory diagnosis using respiratory secretions as biological samples, the procedures may include viral isolation in cell culture, antigen detection by immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and viral RNA detection by reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best samples are those obtained by aspiration or washing nasopharyngeal secretions [
