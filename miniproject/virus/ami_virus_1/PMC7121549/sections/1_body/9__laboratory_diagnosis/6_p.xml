<p id="Par53">Serological diagnoses can be made through neutralization assays, complement fixation, or determination of class-specific immunoglobulins (IgG, IgM) by ELISA or immunofluorescence techniques. The diagnosis is based on the increase in antibody titer between acute and convalescent titers, performed in serum or saliva [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. The serology offers limited value in the diagnosis of primary infection in children less than 6 months of age because 40% of these cases present no increase in antibody titer. However, in infants and adults, the serology is regarded as a good indicator of reinfections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. The serology, therefore, is not the most appropriate method for diagnosis of infection by HRSV, having, however, great importance in clinical and epidemiological studies [
