<p id="Par57">Alternative approaches to identify vaccine-relevant epitopes include the identification of neutralizing RSV protein epitopes to which a protective immune response can be safely generated and the development of modern pre- and post-RSV fusion (F) protein subunits. One obstacle to developing an RSV vaccine has been the difficulty in inducing long-term protective immunity, as evidenced by the repeated infections throughout life and the incomplete protection afforded to recipients of immune prophylaxis. In addition, an immunogenic approach targeted to a single neutralizing epitope mapped to the site A region may generate a focused immune response against RSV F, but in general, the polyclonal response generated by site A-based vaccines has been characterized by poor binding to intact RSV F protein, modest in vitro neutralization, and no evidence of protection to RSV challenges in vivo.</p>
