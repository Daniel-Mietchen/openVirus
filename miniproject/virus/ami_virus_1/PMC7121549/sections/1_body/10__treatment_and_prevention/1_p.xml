 <sc>d</sc>-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide), a nucleoside analogue of the guanosine, licensed since 1986, is the treatment of choice for RSV. Its use is indicated in the form of aerosol for the treatment of serious diseases caused by HRSV. Although several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of ribavirin in inhibiting replication of the virus and the improvement of clinical conditions, resulting in a decrease in the need for supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation in children with lower respiratory tract infection, chronic lung disease, and infection in immunocompromised individuals, lately there has been controversy about the benefits of its use. Since 1989, several studies have appeared indicating that the use of ribavirin has minimal effect on disease outcome caused by HRSV, not showing evidence of decreased duration of hospitalization or the need of supporting therapy, in addition to the high cost and extended treatment (12 h or more of inhalation) [
