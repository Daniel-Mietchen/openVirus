<p id="Par56">Development of an RSV vaccine has been hampered by the incidence of enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) following vaccination with formalin-inactivated RSV in the 1960s. Since its failure, multiple live virus vaccines have been developed, as well as other vaccine platforms, including virus-like particles, peptide-based vaccines, protein subunit vaccines, and plasmid DNA-based vaccines. Many of these vaccines have been evaluated in animals, and a few have been studied in humans. None, however, has shown sufficient promise to move toward licensure. It is clear that a better understanding of virus and host factors that contribute to both disease and protective immunity is still necessary to develop safe and effective RSV vaccines.</p>
