<p id="Par58"> Palivizumab (Pz) (Synagis; MedImmune) is a humanized IgG monoclonal antibody that neutralizes HRSV through interaction with the HRSV F glycoprotein. Pz is the only FDA-approved prophylaxis against HRSV infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Five monthly Pz injections spanning the annual HRSV epidemic period have been shown to reduce hospitalizations among high-risk children in the U.S. However, the quasi-species nature of RNA viruses allows rapid emergence of escape mutants to the immune pressure . The increasing use of Pz in high-risk children and immunocompromised patients provides opportunities for Pz-resistant mutants to arise and persist among humans [
