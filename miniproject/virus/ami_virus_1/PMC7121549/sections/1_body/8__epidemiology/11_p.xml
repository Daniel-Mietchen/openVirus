<p id="Par46">Fortunately, fatalities from infection by HRSV are uncommon, and estimates indicate that the number of deaths is around 200â€“500 a year, 80% of which are of children under 1 year of age. However, mortality may increase significantly in children who present some background that predisposes to more serious diseases, such as congenital heart diseases and lung diseases , and premature infants, in which mortality by HRSV infection is around 10%, 5.5%, and 4.6%, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. High mortality rates may also be observed in individuals with immunodeficiency, congenital or induced by chemotherapy against cancer [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] or from organ transplants, especially in the first 20 days after the transplant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Among bone marrow transplant recipients, the mortality of those who become infected with HRSV can reach 45% [
