<p id="Par41">Differences in pathogenicity between the two groups are not clear. Hall et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] and Imaz et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>] verified increased severity in children infected with group A, although Zelaya et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>] found greater severity in children infected with group B. Other authors did not observe significant differences in pathogenicity between the groups [
