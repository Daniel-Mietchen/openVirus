<p>A case-control study to determine the effects of SARS on pregnancy compared 10 pregnant and 40 non-pregnant women with the infection at the Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00194" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. There were 3 deaths among the pregnant women with SARS (maternal mortality rate of 30%) and no deaths in the non-pregnant group of infected women (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006). Renal failure (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.006) developed more frequently in pregnant SARS patients when compared with the non-pregnant SARS group. Six pregnant women with SARS required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) (60%) and 4 required endotracheal intubation (40%), compared with a 12.5% intubation rate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.065) and 17.5% ICU admission rate (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.012) in the non-pregnant group.
