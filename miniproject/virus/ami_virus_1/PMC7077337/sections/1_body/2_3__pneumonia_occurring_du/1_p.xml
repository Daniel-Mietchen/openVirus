<p>Pneumonia arising from any infectious etiology is an important cause of morbidity and mortality among pregnant women. It is the most prevalent non-obstetric infectious condition that occurs during pregnancy [

 <xref rid="B18-viruses-12-00194" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. As with other infectious diseases, the normal maternal physiologic changes that accompany pregnancy—including altered cell-mediated immunity [
 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00194" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and changes in pulmonary function—have been hypothesized to affect both susceptibility to and clinical severity of pneumonia [

The case fatality rate (CFR) for pregnant women infected with influenza during the 1918–1919 pandemic was 27%—even higher when exposure occurred during the 3rd trimester and upwards of 50% if pneumonia supervened [
 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00194" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. During the 1957–1958 Asian flu epidemic, 10% of all deaths occurred in pregnant women, and their CFR was twice as high as that of infected women who were not pregnant [
 <xref rid="B24-viruses-12-00194" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The most common adverse obstetrical outcomes associated with maternal pneumonias from all causes include premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and preterm labor (PTL), intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and neonatal death [
