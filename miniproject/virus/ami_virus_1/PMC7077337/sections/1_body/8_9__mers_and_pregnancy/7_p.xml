<p>Outside of the Middle East the only confirmed case of MERS in pregnancy occurred in 2015 in South Korea. Jeong et al. [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00194" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] reported that a 39-year-old patient was exposed during the 3rd trimester following contact with a patient having MERS. Despite abrupt vaginal bleeding and rupture of membranes, the patient recovered fully and delivered a healthy infant at 37 weeks and 5 days gestation. Subsequent testing of the infantâ€™s blood did not detect any IgG, IgM, or IgA antibodies to MERS-CoV.
