<p id="Par30">DNA microarray is a rapid method for virus identification. Proof of concept has already been shown in at least two cases where DNA microarray identified pathogen when all the other method for diagnosis failed. Currently the biggest problems in designing probes for diagnostic arrays are in designing conserved probes at genus level. In viral genera, getting conserved probes which would identify all the virus in the genus is next to impossible for almost all genera; as a consequence genus has to be arbitrarily subdivided based upon sequence conservation within the genus. This strategy has not been adopted though in MDA array the probes have been selected based upon conservation but not on uniqueness within a subgroup. Another problem with using microarray is the sequence heterogeneity within the virus species. All the unique probes of a virus species would not bind to all the isolates so a threshold has to be set for making prediction. The capacity of chips is going up, the new-generation chips can incorporate a million probes, while the number of viruses reported in ICTV is just above 2000; however the number of virus sequence reported and stored in NCBI database is in hundreds of thousands. Thus it is possible to make probes for all the sequences and incorporate them in a chip, but doing that would create problems in interpretation of results because of cross-hybridization signals. The one way to avoid cross-hybridization signal is to reduce the size of probes which is currently set at about 70-mer. Microarray is costly as camper to PCR, and so it is generally restricted to the few commercial laboratories that can possess the capital, or those laboratories developing expertise in this field. This is a long procedure for the numbers of genes involved in this technique. ViroChip pan-viral microarray recently used deep sequencing technology to 17 respiratory samples collected from individuals infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus early during the pandemic and deep sequencing which can test for thousands of potential pathogens simultaneously. Consequently diagnostic strategy of rapid ViroChip-based testing followed by deep sequencing could show to be a useful public health response to infectious disease outbreaks in the future (Yadav et al.

The use of microarray in pathogen identification is still an intensive area of research. The new design strategies are constantly coming up. It is hoped that in near future a very precise and cost-effective chip would be developed, but to increase its practical usage in clinical microbiology laboratories, it has to become more affordable, be convenient to handle, and be accurate.
