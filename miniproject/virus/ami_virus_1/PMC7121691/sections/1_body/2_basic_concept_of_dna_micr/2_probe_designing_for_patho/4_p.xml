<p id="Par20">Jabado et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2008</xref>) used protein families database (Pfam) as the basis for designing conserved oligonucleotide probes. Their strategy for finding conserved region entails identifying short conserved region and corresponding nucleic acid region. First they identified most conserved nonoverlapping 20 amino acids sequences then extracted corresponding nucleotide sequences. If the gaps were found, the flanking regions were taken into account. The sequences which were not part of Pfam were extracted and homologous gene clustered. All clustered sequence was searched for common motifs with software such as MEME. Three motifs were selected for each sequence cluster. The nucleic acid sequence extracted for each protein motif was used for probe design. The conditions for probe design were ≤5 mismatches to the template, a
