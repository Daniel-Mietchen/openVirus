<p id="Par18">The probes for rotavirus were selected by using the following criteria: lengths of about 20 nucleotides, melting temperatures between 65°C and 75°C, and two or more mismatches with homologous sequences in other genotypes (Chizhikov et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>). For orthopoxviruses, C23L/B29R gene sequences of different orthopoxvirus species were aligned using clustalx software to find variable regions suitable to design species-specific oligoprobes. Criteria for oligoprobe design were as follows: one or more mismatches with other orthopoxvirus species, length of 13–21 nucleotides, and predicted melting temperatures between 36°C and 58°C (Majid et al.
