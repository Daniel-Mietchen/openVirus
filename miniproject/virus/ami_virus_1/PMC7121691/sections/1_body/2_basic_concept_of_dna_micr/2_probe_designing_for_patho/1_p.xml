<p id="Par17">Probes, which are short DNA sequences that are similar to parts of the sequence of target, are the most important constituent of a microarray chip. Probe has to be specific to a pathogen only, and then only it can identify a pathogen unambiguously. Besides specificity probe designing requires consideration of many other factors, which influence hybridization processes such as guanine/cytosine (G/C) content, melting point, secondary structure, sequence specificity, polynucleotide tract, and probe length. Probe length affects the sensitivity and specificity of hybridization, while other factors contribute to nonspecific hybridization. Maximizing the specificity and the sensitivity are often conflicting goals in terms of achieving probe design. Some well-known examples for microarray chips are as follows.</p>
