<p id="Par19">One of the very first microarray chips to utilize a generalized computational algorithm to find conserved regions among viral pathogens was by Wang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2002</xref>). The oligonucleotide probe length used in this chip was 70-mer. The chip based on this conserved sequence was used to identify a coronavirus from the then unknown SARS-coronavirus samples. Chou et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>) developed a comprehensive algorithm for designing conserved probes. They assumed that a virus genus (G) is a collection of n viruses, in which each virus v
 <sub>i</sub> (i = 1, …, n) is associated with a subset of G. Comparison of this virus with another virus in the genus identifies similar sequences. The similarity was defined as having either (i) more than 75% local sequence similarity in a 50-bp window with any virus or (ii) &gt;15 consecutive bases pairing. From these set of conserved sequences, those sets are picked up which would identify the entire virus in the genus alone or in combination. It was not necessary that a single conserved sequence would pick up the entire virus in the genus. From the conserved sequences, 70-mer conserved probe were selected based on the following criteria: (i) GC content between 40% and 60%, (ii) &lt;5 continuous mononucleotide repeats, (iii) &lt;25-bp BLASTN sequence identity matches, and (iv) ≤15 consecutive bases pairing with other viral sequences in the noncognate viral genus (Chou et al.
