<p id="Par21">Pan-Microbial Detection Array (MDA) is the most comprehensive array designed for virus diagnosis. This array includes probes for all the virus sequences present in the database at the time of designing. The designing strategy used for this array was family based. First, the sequence of all the viruses reported for virus families was grouped, and from the group, all the sequences similar to human and nonfamily virus sequences were removed. From the resultant viral sequences, probes were designed irrespective of the location or the gene using primer 3. The primers were selected on the basis of conservation within family and the number of probes per target sequence which was 50 probes per target sequence (Gardner et al.
