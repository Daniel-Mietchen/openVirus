<p id="Par22">The clinical samples for identification of a virus are collected from different places, from different animals, and from different sources. The clinical samples could be blood, a swab from the nose, vagina, or mouth, tissue and stool, or any other. Most of these samples have been tested in microarrays. Foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) was identified in ticks collected from a livestock market in Nairobi, Kenya (Sang et al.

The clinical samples for microarray analysis are collected in solutions (like RNAlater) which makes RNA stable or directly in trizol for RNA isolation (Wang et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2002</xref>). This method employs anchored random nonamer primers for cDNA synthesis, nonspecific amplification, and introduction of amino-allyl nucleotide into the amplification product. Labeling is done by covalent binding of fluorescent dye (cyanine with aminoallyl group of nucleotide (Jabado et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2002</xref>; Gardner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Hybridization is done overnight, and the temperature of hybridization is defined by the probe sequences which vary between 65°C and 70°C (Tan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2003</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2003</xref>; Jayaraman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>; Gardner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2010</xref>). Hybridization signals are generated by using light of a predefined wavelength to stimulate the emission of the fluorescent signal. The amount of emission is determined by the amount of fluorescent dyes bound, which is correlated with the amount of targets-probe hybrids at the spot.
