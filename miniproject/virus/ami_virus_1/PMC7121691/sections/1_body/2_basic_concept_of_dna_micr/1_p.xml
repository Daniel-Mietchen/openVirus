 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1999</xref>). Since unlike Southern blot, in microarray, target is labeled not probes, target can be hybridized to a large number of probes and consequently microarray chips have the capacity to simultaneously detect tens or hundreds or thousands of specific nucleic acid targets present in biological samples in a single experiment (Schena et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1995</xref>). Microarrays have been used in a large number of applications such as genome-wide genotyping, expression profiling, RNA detection, protein arrays, and pathogen nucleic acid detections (Petricoin et al.
