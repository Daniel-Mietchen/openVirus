<p id="Par5">Research on various aspects of animal diseases particularly diagnosis is carried out regularly to develop effective measures to guarantee animal health through containment of emerging diseases. Many viral diseases have been eradicated from globe by taking effective control measures. Smallpox was the first viral disease to be eradicated globally followed by Rinderpest or cattle plague. In the last 30Â years or so, about 40 new viral diseases have been identified (Zappa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2009</xref>). A recent study has shown that by 2020, about 10 new human diseases would emerge compared to the past, and mobility of humans and animals have increased; with this, rate of spread of disease has also increased (Morens and Fauci 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2013</xref>). It has become vital to have an arsenal of diagnostic techniques which can identify a pathogen whether new or old in shortest possible time to combat effective control measures. New technologies are being developed in molecular biology at a very rapid rate and many of them are being applied in diagnosis. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is once such technique which was developed for amplification of a fragment of DNA in the early 1980s (Mullis

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2006</xref>). Multiplex PCR allows detection of more than one species of virus in a single assay (Elnifro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2000</xref>). However, these techniques have limitations of multiplexibility and versatility and require extensive prior knowledge of the sequences to be amplified (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2009</xref>).
