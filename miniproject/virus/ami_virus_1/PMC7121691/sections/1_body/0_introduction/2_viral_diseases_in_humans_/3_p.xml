<p id="Par6">Another technique, microarray, developed in mid-1990s (Kostrzynska and Bachand 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>) for studying gene expression, is now being increasingly applied for diagnostics. Microarray consists of thousands to millions of oligonucleotide probes representing different genes of known or unknown pathogens deposited or directly synthesized on a surface in an ordered fashion (Anderson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2008</xref>; Manoj 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR01">2009</xref>). These numbers give huge capability to microarray to detect and quantitate hundreds and thousands of genes simultaneously. The capability of microarray to detect a large number of genes was used for diagnosis at the beginning of this century when the SARS corona virus was identified using a diagnostic microarray chip (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2002</xref>). Since then several microarray chips have been developed and tested (Wang et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2003</xref>; Mart√≠n et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2006</xref>; Chiu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2006</xref>; Quan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2007</xref>; Gardner et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2015</xref>).
