<p id="Par3">Microbes are encountered in all walks of human life and there prevails a constant interaction. The vast majority of the bacteria in the body are rendered harmless by the protective effects of the immune system, and a few are beneficial. In fact, the relationship between microbes and humans is delicate and complex. Ten times as many microbes live on or inside your body. The microbes living in our digestive system break down food and produce useful vitamins. The millions of microbes that coat our skin and intestinal lumen form a protective barrier against more dangerous microbes. Without them, our bodies would be open to microbial attack. In spite of these benefits, a relatively small number of microbes are harmful to humans. Many diseases and epidemics are caused by microbes: the plague during the Middle Ages, smallpox, AIDS, influenza, food poisoning, and anthrax. These diseases result in severe illness, or even death. As scientists learn more about bacteria, fungi, and viruses, they are better able to treat and prevent these diseases (Yadav et al.
