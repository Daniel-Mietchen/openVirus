<p id="Par7">A virus is identified by showing presence of its proteins or nucleic acids or via an immunological response to the host. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks with respect to sensitivity, specificity, efficiency, and feasibility. Depending on the virus type, concentration, and circumstances under which the viral sample was collected, certain methods may be more effective than others. The most commonly used methods to detect and identify different viruses can be broadly divided into four categories, that is:

   <p id="Par8">Electron microscopy: A direct method for detecting virus requires purified and high concentration of virus, but only experienced technician then discerns the virus by its physical structure features. Viruses such as poxviruses and herpes viruses can be easily identified using this technology (Nii

   <p id="Par9">Virus isolation in cell culture: Another method is to grow the virus in cell cultures (Leland and Christine 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>) and observe for virus-induced changes such as cell rounding, disorientation, swelling, shrinking, or death in the cells. This method is time-consuming, has low sensitivity, and also cannot be used for viruses like hepatitis B, parvovirus, and papillomavirus, which cannot grow in cell culture (Goldsmith and Miller 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>).

   <p id="Par10">Immunofluorescence-based assays: ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) (Voller et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1978</xref>), one of the widely used methods for detecting viruses, relies on the presence of antigens or antibodies in bodily fluids.

   <label>D.</label>
   <p id="Par11">Molecular techniques: Molecular biology techniques based on nucleic acid sequences are advanced and much faster than any other techniques and are now mostly used for virus diagnosis (Kreuze et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>).
