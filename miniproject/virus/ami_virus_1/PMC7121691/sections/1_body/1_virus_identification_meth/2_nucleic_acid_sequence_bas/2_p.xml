<p id="Par13">Like PCR and real-time PCR, DNA microarray is a genome-based method which was originally developed for studying variation in gene expression but has since been adapted for pathogen detection. It has huge multiplex capability and can screen for all the known pathogen in one experiment (Wilson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2002</xref>; Bryant et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>). The DNA microarray also called DNA chip has high sensitivity and specificity (Kostrzynska and Bachand 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). The microarray chip used for diagnostic purpose contains thousands of different oligonucleotide probes specific to respective pathogens. The probes designed for diagnostic assays are unique to a specific pathogen with respect to all the other pathogen genomes and also to host other nonspecific genome sequences present in the clinical samples. Specially designed software are used for designing probes and also for data analysis.
