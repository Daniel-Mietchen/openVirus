<p id="Par12">Large-scale availability of genomic and nucleotide sequences of disease-causing agents in public databases (GenBank of the USA, European molecular biology laboratory of Europe, and DNA databank of Japan) and progress in nucleic acid amplification techniques have enabled application of nucleic acid-based techniques for pathogen identification. These techniques include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Mullis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1990</xref>), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Tomita et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR056">2008</xref>), ligase chain reaction, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification/isothermal amplification (NASBA, (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>), strand displacement amplification (Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2013</xref>), Qb replicase method (An et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2003</xref>), and branched DNA probes (Baumeister et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2012</xref>). The PCR is one of the most commonly used methods for virus detection (Cunningham 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). Real-time PCR, an innovation of PCR, is one of the most sensitive methods of detecting pathogens (Mackay et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2002</xref>). Both PCR and real-time PCR have limited multiplexing capability.
