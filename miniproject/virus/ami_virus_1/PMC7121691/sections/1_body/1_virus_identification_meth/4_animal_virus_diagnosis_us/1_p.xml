<p id="Par15">Microarray technique is one of the most recent diagnostics in veterinary field (Feilotter 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2004</xref>). Jack et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>) developed a microarray assay for identifying viruses that cause vesicular or vesicular-like lesions in livestock animals. They were able to differentiate foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), swine vesicular disease virus, vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV), BHV-1, orf virus, pseudocowpox virus, bluetongue virus serotype 1, and bovine viral diarrhea virus 1 (BVDV1). Leblanc and co-researcher (

 <italic>Pestivirus</italic> genus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, i.e., classical swine fever virus, border disease virus, and BVDV1 and 2, which allowed specific and sensitive virus detection. They concluded that based on the simplicity of the assay, the protocols for hybridization and magnetic bead detection offer an emerging application for molecular diagnosis in virology that is amenable for use in a modestly equipped laboratory. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV) were detected in a cDNA microarray (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>). GreenChip array facilitated the discovery of Ebola virus, in the porcine respiratory illness outbreak in the Philippines (Barrette et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2008</xref>). Canine coronavirus (CCoV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), feline coronavirus (FCoV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), turkey enteritis coronavirus (TCoV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), and human respiratory coronavirus (HRCoV) are identified based on microarray hybridization (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). Sharma et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2012</xref>) have designed microarray chip for identification of animal viruses; the chip successfully identified the new castle disease virus in sheep and mixed infection of bovine viral diarrhea 2 and bovine herpes virus 1 (Ratta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>) in cattle.
