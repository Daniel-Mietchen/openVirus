<p id="Par28">Sequencing is one technique that transformed biology from qualitative to a quantitative science and leads to the emergence of bioinformatics as an important discipline. Initially, sequencing started with radioisotope-labeled sequencing products analyzed on slab gels. This slow process was overtaken by fluorescent labeling and capillary electrophoresis that improved speed and data quality of sequencing. Recently the next-generation sequencing platforms have made possible massive parallel sequencing without the need for lengthy electrophoresis. There are various approaches for next-generation sequencing like sequencing by hybridization, microelectrophoresis, cyclic array sequencing and real-time observation of single molecules. These diverse approaches and sophistication of next-generation sequencing have brought great challenges for bioinformaticists to tackle alignment, sequence scoring, data assembly, storage, and release of huge amounts of data (Kunin et al.
