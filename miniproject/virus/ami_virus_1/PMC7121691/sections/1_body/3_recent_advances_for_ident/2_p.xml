<p id="Par25">Various molecular techniques have emerged in the recent decades offering speed combined with specific and sensitive detection. They are simple, rapid and reliable, and dependent on the presence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) that code for the proteins. These methods include polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarrays, metagenomics, next-generation sequencing, and many others. Detection of DNA is now possible on a single molecule, and high-throughput analysis allows thousands of detection reactions to be performed at once, thus allowing a range of characteristics to be rapidly and simultaneously determined. Some of the recent molecular detection methods can be performed in the laboratory or clinical settings and also at the farm site. Although some of these techniques provide immediate result, many require extensive computational approaches for analysis and interpretation of the data.</p>
