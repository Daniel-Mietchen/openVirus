<p id="Par26">Metagenomics is recently introduced where we study the genomic content of an environmental sample of microbes. It is a derivation of conventional microbial genomics, with the key difference being that it bypasses the requirement for obtaining pure cultures for sequencing. Metagenomics holds the promise of revealing the genomes of the majority of microorganisms that cannot be readily obtained in pure form. Since the samples are obtained from communities rather than isolated populations, metagenomics may serve to establish hypotheses concerning interactions between community members. This process begins with sample and metadata collection and proceeds with DNA extraction, library construction, sequencing, read preprocessing, and assembly. Community composition analysis is employed at several stages of this workflow, and databases and computational tools are used to facilitate the analysis. Advances in the throughput and cost-efficiency of sequencing technology are fueling a rapid increase in the number and size of metagenomics datasets being generated. However, bioinformaticists are faced with the problem of how to handle and analyze these datasets in an efficient and useful way (Tringe and Rubin
