<p id="Par27">Information from metagenomics studies will be fully exploited only if appropriate data-management and data-analysis methods are in place. One was that the data were immediately accessible in a form suitable for computer analysis; another was that the data were freely available, without impediment to all researchers, be they in academia or industry. The three nucleic acid sequence archives GenBank, EMBL-Bank, and DDBJ have spearheaded the cause of free availability of sequence information. In the process sequences of a large number of fragments have been registered in the international DNA databanks. However, the details of function of the sequence are not available and are of limited use. Analysis and comparison of complex metagenomic data is driving the development of a new class of bioinformatics and visualization software. The field is moving forward rapidly, driven by enormous improvements in sequencing technology and the availability of many complementary technologies. Analysis and clustering of metagenomic sequences with the help of bioinformatics tools according to phenotypes and genomes might in future help in environmental preservation (Kunin et al.
