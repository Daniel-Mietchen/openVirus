    "The chapter defines Emerging Infectious DiseasesÂ (EIDs) and provides an historical and scientific overview, to illustrate how emerging diseases have evolved over the last few decades. For various reasons, including to control and curb the spread of these diseases, global funders, researchers and epidemiologists have established in Africa, and together with African governments set up research centers both during the pre- and post-colonial era to better understand the causative agents, epidemiology and control of infectious diseases. The chapter provides historical and current perspectives of some of these research centers, including their role in the detection and control of human and animal diseases in Africa. Given the immense health and economic burdens of EIDs on both the human and animal populations in Africa, there is an urgent need for African countries to own the means and processes of disease prevention and control, and invest in preparedness measures against the outbreak of diseases."
