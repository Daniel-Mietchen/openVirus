<p id="Par080">It has been 50 years or more since many African countries became independent. During this period, Africa has experienced numerous disease outbreaks, many of which have become endemic and uncontrolled. It is sorrowful and painful to note that Africa remains the verdant pasture for EIDs despite global improvements in disease surveillance systems and better reliable laboratory diagnostic facilities. Behind Africaâ€™s failure to successfully control EID outbreaks is the pervasive state of poor governance in many African countries, with governments continuing to pay lip service to health issues including disease control, and African healthcare systems remaining weak despite repeated EID outbreaks. In the absence of good governance, priorities get misplaced and an atmosphere of poor planning and corruption is easily promoted resulting in poor allocation and mismanagement of funds for disease control and surveillance. It is essential for African governments to note that a healthy population is a sine qua non for orderly economic and social development, and that EID outbreaks negatively impact national economies and other development plans. It is only through good governance and political/economic stability that African countries can improve health security and prevent EIDs and preventable loss of life.</p>
