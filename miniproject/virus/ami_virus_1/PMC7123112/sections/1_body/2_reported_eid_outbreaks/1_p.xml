<p id="Par49">Despite the systems in place for preventing EIDs, the frequency of outbreaks have remained stable over the past decades. Between 1980 and 2017, more than two dozen EID outbreaks have been reports. Whilst some of these were re-emerging pathogens, there were more than ten newly emerging infectious diseases reported for the first time in humans during this time (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">3.1</xref>). Unsurprisingly, most of these newly reported EIDs are new zoonotic viral infections or mutated forms of previously circulating viruses. Discussions of the epidemiology, the pathogen characteristics, and clinical features of these EIDs is beyond the scope of this chapter.
