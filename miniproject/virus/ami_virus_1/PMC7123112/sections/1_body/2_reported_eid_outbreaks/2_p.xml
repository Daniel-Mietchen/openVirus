<p id="Par50">The increase in EID outbreaks in part reflects advances in medical and technological capabilities to detect and diagnose infections. However, increased globalisation, changes in global climate and human behaviour, natural and man-made disasters (poverty, war),Â weak healthcare systems, and lapses in public health measures all contribute to the increase in EIDs. The importance of these factors is borne in the fact that the majority of EIDs represent changes in the epidemiology, virulence or adaptation of previously known pathogens, with novel pathogens accounting for a minority of EID outbreaks.</p>
