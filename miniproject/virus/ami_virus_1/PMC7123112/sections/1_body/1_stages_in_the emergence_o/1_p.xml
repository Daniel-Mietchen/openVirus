<p id="Par12">An EID outbreak occurs in stages, the first of which is often the introduction of the new pathogen into the host population, or in the case of a previously existing pathogen, its establishment and dissemination within the new population and beyond. Whilst most of the EID outbreaks in recent history have resulted from zoonotic infections, only a few of the many zoonotic pathogens that periodically infect humans become adept at transmitting or propagating themselves. Human activity, however, is making this transition increasingly easy by creating efficient pathways for pathogen transmission around the globe.</p>
