<p id="Par6">The most developed of these early research establishments was perhaps the Medical Research Council (MRC) Unit in The Gambia. Established in 1947, it has since led infectious disease and public health research, making significant contributions in the prevention of endemic and emerging pathologies in the region including malaria, tuberculosis and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic>. It remains a beacon of excellence in bench, field and clinical research on infectious diseases, training and hosting some of Africa’s leading scientists and producing a significant proportion of the region’s research output. During the peak of the HIV epidemic in West Africa, the Unit supported the establishment of a field station in Caio, Guinea Bissau dedicated to the study and prevention of HIV infection. The MRC Unit in The Gambia is now incorporated within the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, and continues to forge partnerships with several other institutions in the West African region.
