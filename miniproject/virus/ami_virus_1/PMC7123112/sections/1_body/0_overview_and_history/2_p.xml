<p id="Par3">Although the phrase “emerging diseases” has been used in scientific literature and publications since the early 1960s (Maurer

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>) and early 1980s respectively that concern over EIDs and the use of the term became more widespread. Key landmark events and publications, notably the first conference on the prediction and prevention of EIDs jointly hosted by the Rockefeller University and National Institute for Health (NIH) in May 1989, and publication by the Institute of Medicine (IOM) in 1992 identifying the significance of EIDs and providing a guide for their recognition and prevention, stirred interest and attention towards EIDs and opened doors for more research, funding and publications (IOM 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1992</xref>). The establishment of the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED), devoted to rapidly disseminate information on infectious disease outbreaks and promote communication and collaboration amongst the international infectious diseases community during EID outbreaks, shortly followed this conference and publication. The Centres for Disease Control (CDC), in 1995, launched the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal, dedicated to rapidly disseminate reliable information on the emergence, prevention and elimination of EIDs.
