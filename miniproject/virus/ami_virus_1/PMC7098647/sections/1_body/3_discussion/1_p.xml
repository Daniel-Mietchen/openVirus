<p>Typically, small-scale laboratory experiments, such as experiments in vector access to host plants, are employed to investigate epidemiological parameters such as retention period (of the pathogen in the vector). In this paper, we have derived explicit solutions for the acquisition and inoculation response curves that these experiments produce, which we reduced to a set of formulae for curve gradients. The formulae, when compared with empirical gradient values, are used to estimate epidemiological parameters. The method proved very accurate when tested on simulated datasets (for which the true parameter values were known). To date, there remains much to be learned concerning the detailed epidemiology of 
 <italic>Cassava brown streak virus</italic> (CBSV) that is spreading on an east-west axis across sub-Saharan Africa, and is currently threatening regional food security. We applied our methods to a recent CBSV access period dataset [

 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> whitefly) than had previously been assumed. We also found from dynamic simulations of the access period experiments that our estimate for retention period is consistent with the additional ‘transmission’ and ‘persistence’ experiments reported in Maruthi 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
