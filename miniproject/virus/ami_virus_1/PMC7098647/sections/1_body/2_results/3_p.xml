<p>We then applied the procedure to the data of Maruthi

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] in which a CBSV isolate from southern, coastal Tanzania was tested in relation to cassava host plants using insects of a

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. When the procedure, i.e., the method of matching gradients, was applied to the data of Maruthi

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], the mean retention period was found to be approximately 1.6
 <italic>h</italic>. In addition, we found that the mean acquisition period was approximately 0.55
 <italic>h</italic> and the mean inoculation period was approximately 48
 <italic>h</italic> (units of expected duration; 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). At first sight a 48
 <italic>h</italic> inoculation period appears surprisingly long, however, in reality this is an expected value that comprises not only the length of time it takes for inoculation processes to occur, but also the likelihood that inoculation events actually lead to plant infection. In addition, the death rate, 
 <italic>f</italic>, which was found to be very close to zero (≈ −0.003), was set to zero here and in subsequent dynamic simulations.
