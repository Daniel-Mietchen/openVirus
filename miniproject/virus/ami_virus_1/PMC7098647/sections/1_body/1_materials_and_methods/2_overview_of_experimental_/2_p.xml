<p>The virus inoculation assay procedure involves confining a cohort of potentially virus-bearing insects to a healthy plant for virus inoculation. After a fixed period of access to the healthy plant (inoculation access period), the insects are removed, and the plant is assessed for infection. Inoculation success is evaluated as the proportion of plants showing symptoms [

Note that for IAP experiments, since the first step involves virus-bearing insects, it is always necessary to place healthy insects on an infected plant for a fixed ‘test’ AAP in advance of the IAP experiment itself. The process is performed for a fixed inoculation access period with
