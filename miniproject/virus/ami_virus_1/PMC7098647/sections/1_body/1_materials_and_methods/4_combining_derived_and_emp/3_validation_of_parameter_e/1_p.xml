 <italic>et al</italic>. describe a further two experiments involving access period arrays beyond the basic access period experiment: ‘transmission’ and ‘persistence’ experiments [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007724.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The first was designed to assess ‘transmission’ as the cohort size of insects is increased for fixed acquisition and inoculation access periods. In the second experiment, ‘persistence’ of the virus in an insect vector is measured by exposing the insects to a sequence of three plants; the original infected plant, a dummy healthy plant and finally the success of transmission is tested on a third, healthy plant. By allowing the insects to feed on the intermediate healthy plant (for potentially different exposure times) the persistence of the virus in the vector could be assessed.
