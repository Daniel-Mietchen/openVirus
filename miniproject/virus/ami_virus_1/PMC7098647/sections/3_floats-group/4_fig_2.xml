  <p>In A: acquisition response curve, in B: inoculation response curve. In A-B gray curves indicate the 2.5th-97.5th percentile range of simulations (i.e., demarcating 95% of simulations with darker shades of gray for percentile bands near the median). Solid ruby curves indicate the mean of simulations. Dotted black curves show the mathematical solution (i.e.,

   <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007724.e007">Eq 6</xref> in B). Figure inset shows the correspondence between computer simulations and mathematical solutions. Computer simulation involved reproducing the access period experiments using event-based stochastic simulation, with the epidemiological parameters assigned the values listed in the ‘True value’ column of
