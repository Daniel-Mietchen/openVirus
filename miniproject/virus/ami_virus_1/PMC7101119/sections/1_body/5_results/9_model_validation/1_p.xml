<p>We validated the model against known Zika outbreaks in the United States including Puerto Rico since late 2015, including Miami-Dade County (Florida), Brownsville County (Texas), and Puerto Rico, with separate tests across each of Puerto Rico’s 8 health regions. Overall, the model accurately predicted the dynamics and absolute case counts for each site tested (R
