<p>We found that natural seasonality in births results in waves of first- and second-trimester pregnancies that are out-of-phase with peak Zika virus infections in the model (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel A) and thus confers significant population-level protection against early-trimester exposures (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>, panels B, C). Our model indicates that birth seasonality alone reduced risk for Zika virus exposure during first- (versus second- and third-) trimester exposures by 11% (relative risk 0.89 [95% CI 0.80â€“0.99]; p = 0.012).
