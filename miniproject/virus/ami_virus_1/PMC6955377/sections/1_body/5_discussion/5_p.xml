<p>Using phylodynamic analyses we have revealed key molecular processes affecting the evolution of influenza B virus that have contributed to immune escape and the resulting strong epidemic waves observed in recent years. Future research into immune responses to the NA and the effects of epistatic gene interactions are needed to understand their effect on the antigenic and genetic evolution and global circulation of influenza B virus. Addressing these aspects can potentially aid modeling to predict future circulating lineages, assist in forecasting the timescale of epidemic outbreaks, and also inform the development of universal influenza vaccines that are the cornerstone of current research efforts aimed at the prevention and control of influenza.</p>
