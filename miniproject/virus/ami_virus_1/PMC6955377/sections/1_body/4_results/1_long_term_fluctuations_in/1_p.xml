<p>Estimation of changes in relative genetic diversity using a Gaussian Markov Random Fields smoothing of the Bayesian skyline plot showed that the highest levels of relative genetic diversity of the Victoria lineage occurred during the 2010–2011 and 2016–2017 seasons, with a period of decline from 2011 to 2015 (

 </ext-link>). These patterns show that the evolutionary dynamics of the Victoria and Yamagata lineages have considerably changed, with both lineages exhibiting overall increases in global genetic diversity. These results also suggest that the recent Yamagata viruses are evolving at a faster rate than in the previous decades.
