 </ext-link>), older viruses appeared to have undergone fewer interclade reassortment events than viruses circulating from 2015 onwards. Taken together, comparison of the evolutionary histories of each gene segment showed variation in reassortment patterns within both lineages, with greater rates observed during periods of greater genetic diversity, showing a correlation between reassortment and relative genetic diversity of influenza B viruses.
