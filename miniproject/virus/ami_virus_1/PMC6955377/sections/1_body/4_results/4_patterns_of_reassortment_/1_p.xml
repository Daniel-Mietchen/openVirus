<p>We observed long-term changes in reassortment patterns, with frequent interlineage reassortment between Victoria and Yamagata viruses prior to 2016, wherein the NA and NP genes of some Victoria isolates were acquired from Yamagata viruses, but interlineage reassortment has not been detected since (

This suggests that interlineage reassortments has led to the selection of 2 distinct Victoria and Yamagata genomes that are likely fit and presently outcompete emerging novel interlineage reassortants. The recent lack of reassortment between the Victoria and Yamagata lineages is consistent with observations in seasonal influenza A viruses, where emergence of between-subtype reassortants (e.g., between A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09) is rare.
