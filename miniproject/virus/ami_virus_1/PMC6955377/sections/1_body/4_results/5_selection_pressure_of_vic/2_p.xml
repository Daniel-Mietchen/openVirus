<p>The NA and NS genes of both the Victoria and Yamagata lineages were under a greater selection pressure (mean estimated ratios of nonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions [d

 <sub>S</sub>: 0.28 and 0.23] and NS genes [d

 <sub>N</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> ratios in the internal versus external branches of the HA gene was higher for the Victoria lineage (ratio = 1.1) compared with the Yamagata lineage (ratio = 0.73), indicating the Victoria HA was subject to stronger immune pressure. Conversely, in the NA, the Yamagata lineage showed a higher d
 <sub>N</sub>/d
 <sub>S</sub> (ratio = 1.20) in the internal versus external branches compared to the Victoria lineage (ratio = 0.96). In addition, more sites are positively selected in the NA of both Victoria and Yamagata viruses than the HA gene, showing that the NA protein is under greater pressure and potentially exhibiting a greater rate of antigenic drift. These results suggest that the NA is contributing significantly to the evolution of influenza B virus.
