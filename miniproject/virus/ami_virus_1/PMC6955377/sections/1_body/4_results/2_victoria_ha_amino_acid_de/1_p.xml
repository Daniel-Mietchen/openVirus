<p>Ancestral amino acid reconstruction of the HA of Victoria viruses shows that following the period 2011–2015, when the relative genetic diversity was the lowest, 3 amino acid substitutions (D129G, I180V, and R498K) occurred in quick succession in 1 of the subclades of clade 1A, both in the stem and antigenically dominant head domain of HA (

 </xref>). However, since this period, Victoria clade 1A has diverged into multiple cocirculating clades (1A.1–1A.4). Notably, HA variants with 2-amino acid (2-aa) or 3-amino acid (3-aa) deletions have emerged independently on 4 occasions in each of the cocirculating clades and cocirculate with those that do not have a deletion. This has led to a marked increase in genetic diversity of Victoria viruses, resulting in multiple cocirculating clades that have rapidly spread worldwide (see below).
