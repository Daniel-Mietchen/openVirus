<p content-type="flushleft">Two lineages of influenza B viruses (“B/Victoria/2/87-like” and “B/Yamagata/16/88-like,” respectively, referred to as the Victoria and Yamagata viruses or lineages) cocirculate to contribute substantially to the ∼290,000–650,000 annual influenza-attributed global deaths (
 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics, and the clinical presentations of infection by both types are largely indistinguishable, with young children and the elderly being more susceptible to infection (

Unlike influenza A viruses, which periodically emerge from animals to cause pandemics and circulate as single predominant antigenic variants, the Victoria and Yamagata lineages emerged as antigenic variants following divergence of influenza B viruses during the 1970s, and both lineages have cocirculated globally at least since 2001 (

 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>), whereas the trivalent vaccines, which contains only 1 of the lineages, are frequently mismatched with respect to the circulation of the dominant influenza B lineage in a given season, resulting in low vaccine efficacy (

 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). A universal vaccine that targets both B virus lineages remains a public health priority (
