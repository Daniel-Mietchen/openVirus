<p>Influenza B viruses exhibit complex evolutionary dynamics, whose drivers are not fully understood (

The hemagglutinin (HA) gene of the Victoria and Yamagata viruses evolve at a slower pace than in influenza A virus lineages, although the Victoria lineage undergoes faster rates of lineage turnover, with an average of 3.9–5.1 y, compared to the Yamagata lineage average of 6.3–7.2 y (
 <xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Interestingly, despite slower antigenic turnover, Yamagata viruses infect a considerably older population (

 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), and diverged prior to 2000, resulting in the long-term cocirculation of 2 antigenically distinct clades (clades 2 and 3), while exhibiting an epidemiological pattern of alternating antigenic dominance between seasons (
