<p>Viral RNA was extracted from 2,147 human influenza-positive nasopharyngeal swab samples or cultured isolates collected from 2 hospitals (Singapore General Hospital and National University Hospital) and National Public Health Laboratory during 2011–2019, using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and subtyping was performed by real-time RT-PCR. Influenza A virus was detected in 1,493 samples and influenza B in 654 samples. A subset of influenza B samples was selected for full genome sequencing using either Sanger or next generation sequencing (NGS) methods. For Sanger sequencing, the viruses were passaged in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney SIAT–1 cells and sequenced using previously published primers (

 <xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The PCR products were quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kits (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and subsequently diluted to 1 ng/µL for library preparation using the Nextera XT DNA library preparation kits (Illumina). The libraries were pooled and run on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform with a read length of 2 × 250 bp at the Duke-NUS Genome Biology Facility. The NGS reads were quality checked with FastQC as implemented in UGENE v1.28 (
 <xref rid="r34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), and the adaptors were removed in Trimmomatic v0.36 (
 <xref rid="r35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). Short reads were then mapped to a known reference genome using the BWA algorithm in UGENE, and consensus sequences were obtained. A total of 158 influenza B genomes (76 Victoria and 82 Yamagata) were generated.
