 <caption>
  <p>Phylogeography and age distribution of influenza B viruses. (
   <italic>A</italic>) Proportion of ancestral geographical location states estimated on the phylogenetic trunk of Victoria (VIC) and Yamagata (YAM) viruses through time. Shaded areas represent estimated ancestral location state proportions in each location. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Patterns of migration rates are shown on a 2D matrix where each cell corresponds to mean migration rates between pairwise geographic locations. Blue and purple cells denote Victoria and Yamagata, respectively. Abbreviations for location states: Africa (AF), East Asia (EA), Europe (EU), Middle East/West Asia (ME/WA), North America (NAm), Oceania (OC), South America (SAm), South Asia (SA), and Southeast Asia (SEA). (
   <italic>C</italic>) Age density distribution of influenza B virus by lineage. The violin plot indicates the distribution, and the box-plot indicates the interquartile range (IQR). The median ages are represented by a notched horizontal line. The vertical line indicates the 1.5X IQR, and the outliers are represented by dots. The Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test was used to compare the median ages, with statistical significance indicated by 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001. (
   <italic>D</italic>) Age density distribution of Victoria clade 1A viruses with multiple amino acid deletions on the HA protein. Orange plot represents viruses with 2-aa deletion (clade 1A.1), green plot indicates viruses with 3-aa deletion (clade 1A.2–1A.4), and gray plot indicates viruses with no deletion. Mann–Whitney 
   <italic>U</italic> test 
   <italic>P</italic> values indicated by 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05.
