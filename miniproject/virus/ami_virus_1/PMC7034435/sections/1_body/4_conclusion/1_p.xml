<p>Besides usual hosts (small ruminants, wild ungulates), PPRV has the potential to infect large ruminants, camels and other unusual hosts. Cross-species transmission, from small to large ruminants/unusual hosts may be prevented by extensive and further-strengthened disease surveillance, coupled with appropriate diagnostics and vaccine constructs. Therefore, for effective disease eradication programmes worldwide (GEP-PPR) under the GF-TADs programme, it is imperative to explore the role of large ruminants and unusual hosts to better elucidate disease epidemiology, particularly in disease-enzootic regions.</p>
