<p>In addition, two reports highlight the susceptibility of PPRV for Asiatic lion and dogs, because of the detection of PPRV genomes in routine screenings of pooled tissue samples and nasal swabs, respectively (Balamurugan, Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ratta et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Although PPRV has a close antigenic relationship with CDV, which is a common pathogen for dogs and lion, the PPRV-positive Asiatic lion (Balamurugan, Sen et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and one of the three PPRV-positive dogs (Ratta et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>) were found negative for CDV. Interestingly, two of the PPRV-positive dogs had gastroenteritis, while the other was suspected of suffering from canine distemper. However, the detection of PPRV antigens/nucleic acids in nasal swabs and tissues from dog and Asiatic lion is probably due to these animals having been fed PPRV-infected sheep/goat meat or contaminated fomites. In PPR-endemic countries, dogs usually live in companionship or in close proximity to domestic small ruminant farming, thereby, there is a likely chance of transmission of viruses from infected hosts to dogs.
