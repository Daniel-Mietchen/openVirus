<p>Clinical PPRV infection and seroconversion in camels are continuously being reported from endemic regions in Africa, the Middle-East and Asia (
 <xref rid="t0001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Thus far, all clinical signs including histological and pathological findings related to digestive and respiratory systems, have been found similar to general features of PPR in small ruminants (Khalafalla et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Zakian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In these studies, PPRV has mainly been detected by immunocapture (ic) ELISA and/or RT-PCR from tissue samples characterised by lesions (Khalafalla et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Kwiatek et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Zakian et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0068" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Moreover, abattoir studies on slaughtered animals report detection of PPRV antigens in lung tissue in animals with lesions, indicating a history of pneumonia (Saeed et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0059" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Intisar et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Most likely, these findings indicate a viral shedding, for example in faeces and nasal discharges, with the possibility for further virus transmission, although this has to be verified. Indeed, ocular discharges from one camel displaying clinical signs resembling PPR were found PCR-positive in a recently published study from Kenya (Omani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), strongly indicating that camels do shed PPRV. This study characterised an outbreak in camels, referred to as “camel sudden death syndrome”, where animals displayed fever, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis with ocular discharges, loss of body condition and general weakness, thus resembling PPR in small ruminants. Sheep and goat flocks herded side by side to camels showed typical signs of PPR, and PPRV of the same lineage (III) was also detected in one of the goats (Omani et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Contrary to these findings, a recent study observed no clinical infection of PPR in camels after experimental exposure and claimed that camels play no epidemiological role in the spread of the disease (Fakri et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). Indeed, little evidence has been shown regarding the transmission of the virus by shedding from infected camels, and there is still a controversy around the involvement of camels in the spread of the disease. Possibly in natural conditions, an animal facing stress caused by environmental change, co-infections and other factors, could lead to an impaired general condition that favours pathogens to clinically affect atypical hosts (Chapman et al. 
 <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to further investigate camel susceptibility to PPRV, in both natural and experimental conditions.
