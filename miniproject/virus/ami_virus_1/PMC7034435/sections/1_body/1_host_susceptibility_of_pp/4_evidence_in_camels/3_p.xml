<p>Taken together, camels do not seem to be a dead-end host, and virus transmission between sheep, goats and camels needs to be considered when controlling PPRV. Whether PPRV is the single etiological cause of clinical signs in camels, resembling PPR in sheep and goats, has yet to be proven by further studies. Clinical and subclinical PPRV infection in camels, cattle and water buffalo may indicate novel aspects on the epidemiology and pathogenesis of PPRV, with implications for the mechanism of adaptation of the virus in a new host niche. Simultaneously, although there is an unapparent clinical infection demonstrated, virus secretion has also been reported in wild camels, cattle and buffalo (reviewed in Aziz-ul-Rahman et al.
