<p id="Par3">Analysis of viral sequence involves use of certain tools that are employable on any novel sequence, for example, gene identification, ORF identification, functional annotation and phylogeny. However, due to small genome size, viruses have complex methods to maximize the coding potential of genomes and evolution. Many viruses utilize overlapping reading frames or translational frameshifts to code for multiple proteins from limited genome sequences. Also, higher rates of mutations and recombination between related viruses pose a challenge in accurate phylogenetic and evolutionary analysis of viruses using general-purpose softwares. Lately, enormous growth in the volume and diversity of viral sequences in the databases has been seen. Now, it has become imperative to organize data of these viral sequences in virus family-specific resources tailored for accurate analysis of a specific virus.</p>
