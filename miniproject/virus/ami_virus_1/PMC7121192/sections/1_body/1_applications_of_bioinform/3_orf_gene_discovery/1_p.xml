<p id="Par5">An open reading frame (ORF) is the part of genome that translates into a protein. Finding ORF is one of the key steps in viral genome analysis. It forms the basis for further analysis such as homologous search, predicting proteins, functional analysis and viral vaccine and antiviral target discovery. If an ORF translates a surface protein that is unique to that virus, it may elicit immune responses and could potentially be a vaccine candidate. ORF Finder by NCBI is a ORF prediction program (Rombel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2002</xref>). The program outputs a range of each ORFs along with its protein translation in six possible reading frames from the input DNA sequence. It can be used to search newly sequenced DNA for potential protein encoding sequences and to verify predicted proteins using SMART BLAST or BLASTP (Altschul et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1990</xref>). However, the web version of the program is limited to a query sequence length of 50 kb only. A standalone system has no limitation on length but is available only for the Linux 64 operating system. NEG8, a 167-codon novel ORF in segment 8 of influenza virus, was visualized using ORF Finder (Clifford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2009</xref>). Using the ORF Finder in association with the basic local alignment search tool BLAST, 154 ORFs were found in the Hz-1 virus genome (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2002</xref>). Due to small genome size, viruses employ multiple strategies to maximize the coding potential including frameshifts and alternative codon usage. Thus, virus-specific programs have been developed to overcome these challenges. GeneMark (
