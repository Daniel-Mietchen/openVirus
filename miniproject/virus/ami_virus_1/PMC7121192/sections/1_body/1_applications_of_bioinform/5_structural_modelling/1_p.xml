<p id="Par7">Three-dimensional prediction of viral proteins can be used to predict the correlation between actual protein structure and antigenic sites, folding surfaces and functional motifs. Such structural modelling tools may be implicated to identify and design novel candidates for antiviral inhibitors and vaccine targets. Secondary structures may be predicted using the tool PredictProtein (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.predictprotein.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.predictprotein.org/</ext-link>) (Rost et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2004</xref>). Using this online tool, along with secondary structures, solvent accessibility and possible transmembrane helices can be predicted. Further, it also provides expected accuracy of prediction methods. SWISS-MODEL (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://swissmodel.expasy.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://swissmodel.expasy.org/</ext-link>) is a popular tool for the prediction of a 3-D structure of a protein. 3-D structure prediction programs usually employ homology searching using similar and known protein structures as templates. One of the most commonly used database for such templates is Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Reddy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2001</xref>). Output from the SWISS-MODEL program includes the template selected, alignment between the query sequence and the template, and the predicted 3-D model. Results of SWISS-MODEL are, however, only sent by email (Figs.
