<p id="Par2">Viruses are notorious to infect all forms of life ranging from bacteria to chordates. In humans, viruses are known to cause infectious diseases such as influenza, hepatitis, AIDS, diarrhoea, encephalitis, dengue fever and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2017a</xref>), Zika (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2017b</xref>), etc. Despite the vaccines and treatments for such diseases, morbidity and mortality both occur as a result of the viral infections. Viral disease of animals not only affects the production but also is a threat to humans (Saminathan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2016</xref>). A rapid growth in the availability of sequencing methods and a vast amount of viral sequence data have been generated during recent times. Thus, it is imperative to decipher this data using more advanced tools such as bioinformatics resources. A large number of bioinformatics tools that can aid in the analysis of viral genomes and develop preventive and therapeutic strategies have been developed for human as well as animal viruses. This chapter will introduce virologists to some of the common as well virus-specific bioinformatics tools that the researches can use to analyse viral sequence data to elucidate the viral dynamics, evolution and preventive therapeutics.
