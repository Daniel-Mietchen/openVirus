<p id="Par34">Although the chapter elaborates on viruses-specific bioinformatics programs, most of these programs are designed for human viruses. Nevertheless, there are bioinformatics tools that are animal-virus specific, but these are limited in number. Henceforth, in many cases, researchers have to switch to either human virus-specific tools or other generic tools. Application of such tools for studying animal viruses or animal diseases, in many situations, may not be as accurate as with specialized tools. The users should take precautions while using the settings of such tools. Furthermore, the results, thus obtained, also need to be scrutinized. Therefore, development of new bioinformatics programs/tools that are specifically designed for animal viruses/diseases should be taken up robustly. Specialized tools will provide much accurate results and predictions, thereby accelerating the bioinformatics researches in the field of animal viral diseases.</p>
