<p id="Par33">Various researches in animal viral diseases are being conducted at the genomic level. Often, handling an enormous data obtained from sequencing is daunting to researchers. The chapter categorically provides a list of bioinformatics approaches that are useful in data mining. There are tables that list all such bioinformatics programs as per the applications. The tables also list databases that organize information on human and animal viruses such as genomic data, ORFs, oligonucleotides, etc. An illustration has also been provided in the chapter showing the application of the tool PredictProtein, which is used for prediction of three-dimensional structures of viral proteins. The major goal of the chapter has been to provide a roadmap to bioinformatics approaches in the field of animal viral diseases.</p>
