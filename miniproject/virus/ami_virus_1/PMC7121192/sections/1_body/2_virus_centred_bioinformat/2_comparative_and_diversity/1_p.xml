<p id="Par9">Viruses are one of the most diversified and dynamic microorganisms. With increasing viral genome sequencing, there was a need to develop bioinformatics tools to compare and analyse the voluminous data. To meet this requirement, one such downloadable software package is Base-By-Base, which aids in analysis of whole viral genome alignments at single nucleotide level (Brodie et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2004</xref>). Moreover, with the online resource Genome Information Broker for Viruses (GIB-V), comparative studies can be made using the generic tools such as ClustalW, BLAST and Keyword Search algorithms (Hirahata et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>). Another downloadable web server tool, ViroBLAST, is an exclusive BLAST tool that can be used for queries against multiple databases (Deng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2007</xref>). Sequences from a variety of viral strains can be analysed simultaneously using the Alvira software, which is a multiple sequence alignment tool that provides graphical representation as well (Enault et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>). Furthermore, comparative analysis of genes and genomes of coronavirus can be carried out by using the CoVDB (coronavirus database) (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2008</xref>).
