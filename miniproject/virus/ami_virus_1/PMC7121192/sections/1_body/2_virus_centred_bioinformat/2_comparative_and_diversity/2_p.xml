<p id="Par10">The digital resource ViralZone is designed specifically to comprehend viral diversity and acquire information on viral molecular biology, hosts, taxonomy, epidemiology and structures (Hulo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). The Simmonics program was upgraded to the simple sequence editor (SSE) software package, wherein the user-given sequences can be aligned and annotated and further can be analysed for diversity and phylogeny (Simmonds 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2012</xref>). Evolutionary changes in viral genome lead to polymorphisms in their proteins, which in turn result into changes in viral phenotype such as viral virulence, viral-host interactions, etc. The digital database, ViralORFeome, not only stores all variants and mutants of viral ORFS, but also provides tools to design ORF-specific cloning primers (Pellet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2010</xref>). Further, degenerate primer pairs can be selected and matched to amplify user-defined viral genomes using the online tool PriSM (Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2011</xref>). The recent advances in next-generation sequencing and technologies have facilitated to study viral population at an advanced level. The viral population biodiversity and dynamics can be studied using the first such tool developed, PHACCS (Phage Communities from Contig Spectrum), that can analyse the shotgun sequence data to estimate the structure and diversity of phages (Angly et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2005</xref>). Later on, more tools/resources were developed to analyse viral metagenomics sequences, such as Viral Informatics Resource for Metagenomic Exploration (VIROME), Viral MetaGenome Annotation Pipeline (VMGAP) and Metavir (Lorenzi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2011</xref>, Roux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>, Wommack et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2012</xref>). Novel viruses can be identified from a pool of specimen types using a specific computational pipeline, VirusHunter (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2013</xref>).
