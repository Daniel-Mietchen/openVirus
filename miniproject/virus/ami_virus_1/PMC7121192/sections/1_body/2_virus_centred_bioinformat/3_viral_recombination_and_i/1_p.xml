<p id="Par11">The phenomenon of genetic recombination in viruses is responsible for the emergence of new viruses, increased virulence and host range, immune evasion and development of antiviral resistance. This distinct process of viral recombination can be detected by two bioinformatics tools, viz. jpHMM (Jumping Profile Hidden Markov Model) and ViReMa (Virus Recombination Mapper) genomes (Schultz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2009</xref>; Routh and Johnson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). The jpHMM, a web server, can be used for predicting recombination in HIV-1 and HBV, whereas ViReMa, a downloadable software, can be used to analyse next-generation sequencing data. Additionally, another software called VIPR HMM (Viral Identification with a PRobabilistic algorithm incorporating hidden Markov model) can detect recombinant and non-recombinant viruses using microbial detection microarrays (Allred et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2012</xref>). Further, viral genome sequences can be searched for degenerate locus of recombination (lox)-like sites by a web server called SeLOX (Surendranath et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2010</xref>). A downloadable software, VIRAPOPS, is a forward simulator that allows simulation of RNA virus population (Petitjean and Vanet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2014</xref>). With this software, the drastic changes in rapidly evolving RNA viruses such as mutability, recombination, variation, covariation, etc. can be simulated to predict their effects on viral populations. SeqMap is a tool capable of identifying viral integration sites (VIS) from ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR), linear amplification-mediated PCR (LAM-PCR) and nonrestrictive LAM-PCR (nrLAM-PCR) reactions and mapping short sequences to the genome (Hawkins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2011</xref>). Further, VIS can also be detected by three more distinct tools, VirusSeq, ViralFusionSeq, and VirusFinder (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>, Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>, Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2013</xref>). For more precise VIS prediction, all four tools can be employed by virologists.
