 <bold>siRNA:</bold> A siRNA is similar to miRNA that operates within the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway. It interferes in expression of specific genes and, therefore, is used in post-transcriptional gene silencing. VIRsiRNAdb is an online curated repository that stores experimentally validated research data of siRNA and short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting diverse genes of 42 important human viruses, including influenza virus (Tyagi et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2012</xref>). The current database includes experimental information on siRNA sequence, virus subtype, target gene, GenBank accession, design algorithm, cell type, test object, method, efficacy, etc. A web-based software, siVirus, is an antiviral sRNA design software that allows analysis of influenza virus, HIV-1, HCV and SARS coronavirus (Naito et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2013</xref>). A Perl script, called Paparazzi, enables reconstitution of viral genome using a viral siRNA in a given sample (Vodovar et al.
