 <bold>miRNAs:</bold> A microRNA (miRNA) is a small, regulatory, non-coding RNA molecule that regulates the translation or stability of viral and host target mRNAs, thereby affecting viral pathogenesis. This host-viral regulatory relationship can be investigated by a database called ViTa, capable of curating known viral miRNA genes and known/putative target sites of host miRNA (Hsu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2007</xref>). ViTa exploits miRanda and TargetScan to scan viral genomes and determine miRNA targets. ViTa is also capable of annotating the viruses, virus-infected tissues and tissue specificity of host miRNAs. Subtypes of viruses, for example, influenza viruses, and the conserved regions in various viruses can also be compared using the ViTa database. Viral miRNA candidate hairpins can be predicted using the database Vir-Mir. It serves as a platform to query the predicted viral miRNA hairpins (based on taxonomic classification) and host target genes (based on the use of the RNAhybrid program) in human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, rice and
