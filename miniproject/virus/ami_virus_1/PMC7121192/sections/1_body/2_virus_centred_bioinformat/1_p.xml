<p id="Par8">For long, bioinformatic analysis of viruses utilized common bioinformatics tools developed for other organisms. However, analysing viral genomes using general bioinformatics tools could compromise the accuracy and sensitivity of analysis. Virus genomes are too small (e.g. &lt; 10Â kb) to compute statistics with their codon usage. To maximize the coding potential, viruses work with unusual codon usage patterns comprising of overlapping coding and non-coding functional elements. Additionally, viruses also rely on other translational mechanisms such as stop codon read-through, frameshifting, leaky scanning and internal ribosome entry sites. Comparative genomic analysis of viruses is complicated by the fact that highly conservative sequences may not be coding for anything. Presence of overlapping pairs may be indicated by conservation for the sequences where there is overlapping of CDSs and/or non-coding functional elements. Novel virus types comprise of new CDSs that are different than previously known CDSs. There are multiple databases and tools available for analysis of human viruses; however, there are still only a limited number of resources designed specifically for veterinary viruses. In this section, some of the databases and resources useful for the analysis of veterinary viruses are discussed (Table
