<p id="Par23">There are web-based tools available to predict and analyse structural aspects of viruses. The LearnCoil-VMF is a computational tool that allows to predict coiled-coil-like regions in viral membrane fusion proteins (Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1999</xref>). The membrane fusion proteins are known to be diverse and share no sequence similarity between most pairs of viruses in the same or different families. The LearnCoil-VMF is also capable of characterizing the core structure of these membrane fusion proteins.
