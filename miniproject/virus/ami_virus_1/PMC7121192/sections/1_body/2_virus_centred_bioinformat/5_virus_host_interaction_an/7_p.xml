<p id="Par20">A primer design tool, PrimerHunter, allows to design highly sensitive and specific primers for virus subtyping by PCR (Duitama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2009</xref>). PrimerHunter allows predicting specific forward and reverse primers with respect to a given set of DNA sequences. PhyloType is a web-based as well as downloadable software that uses parsimony to reconstruct ancestral traits and to select phylotypes (Chevenet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2013</xref>). RotaC is an automated genotyping tool for group A rotaviruses (Maes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2009</xref>). It works by comparing a complete ORF of interest to other complete ORFs of cognate genes available in the GenBank database by performing BLAST searches.
