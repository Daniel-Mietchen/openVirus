<p id="Par17">VGO is a web-based genome browser that allows viewing and predicting genes and ORFs in one or more viral genomes. It also allows performing searches within viral genomes and acquiring information about a genome such as locating genes, ORFs, start/stop codons, etc. Within genome, the sequences can be searched for regular expression, fuzzy motif pattern, genes with highest AT composition, etc. Using VGO, comparative analyses can be made between different viral genomes. VGO uses the graphical user interface (GUI) for constructing alignments and display orthologues in a set of genomes. It also allows searching the translated genome for matches to mass spec peptides.</p>
