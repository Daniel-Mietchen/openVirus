<p id="Par21">VirOligo is a database of virus-specific oligonucleotides. The VirOligo database acts as a repository for virus-specific oligonucleotides for virus detection (Onodera and Melcher 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2002</xref>). The database comprises of Oligo data and Common data tables. The Oligo data table enlists PCR primers and hybridization probes that are used for viral nucleic acid detection, while Common data table contains PCR and hybridization experimental conditions used in their detection. Each Oligo data entry provides information on the name of the oligonucleotide, oligonucleotide sequence, target region, type of usage (PCR primer, PCR probe, hybridization or other), note and direction of the PCR oligonucleotide (forward or reverse). Each oligonucleotide entry also contains direct links to PubMed, GenBank, NCBI Taxonomy databases and BLAST. On the updated version of VirOligo as of September 2015, the database contains complete listing of oligonucleotides specific to various animal viruses. The viruses are vaccinia virus; canine parvovirus; porcine parvovirus; rodent parvovirus; tobamovirus; potyvirus; borna virus; bovine herpesvirus types 1, 3, 4 and 5; bovine viral diarrhoea virus; bovine parainfluenza 3 virus; bovine respiratory syncytial virus; bovine adenovirus; bovine rhinovirus; bovine coronavirus; bovine reovirus; bovine enterovirus; foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus; and alcelaphine herpesvirus.
