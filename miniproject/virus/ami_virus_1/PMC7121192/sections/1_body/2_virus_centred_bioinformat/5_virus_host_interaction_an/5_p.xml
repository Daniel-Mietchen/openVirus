<p id="Par18">VIGOR is a gene prediction online tool that was developed by J. Craig Venter Institute in 2010. It started with gene prediction in small viral genomes such as coronavirus, influenza, rhinovirus and rotavirus. With the updated version in 2012 (

With VIGOR, based on sequence similarity searches, users are able to predict protein coding regions, start and stop codons and other complex gene features such as RNA editing, stop codon leakage and ribosomal shunting. Further, various features such as frameshifts, overlapping genes, embedded genes, etc. can be predicted in the virus genome. Additionally, a mature peptide can be predicted in a given polypeptide open reading frame. VIGOR is also capable of genotyping influenza virus and rotavirus. Four output files – a gene prediction file, a complementary DNA file, an alignment file, and a gene feature table file – are produced by VIGOR. GenBank submission can be directly done using the gene feature table.
