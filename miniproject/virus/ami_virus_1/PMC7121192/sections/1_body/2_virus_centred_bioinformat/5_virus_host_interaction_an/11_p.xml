<p id="Par24">VIPERdb (Virus Particle Explorer database) is a web-based database that enables manual curation of icosahedral virus capsid structures (Carrillo-Tripp et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). This database serves as a comprehensive resource for specific needs of structural virology and comparatives of data derived from structural and computational analyses of capsids. With the updated version, VIPERdb (2), capsid protein residues in the icosahedral asymmetric unit (IAU) can be deduced using Phi-Psi (Phi-Psi) diagrams (azimuthal polar orthographic projections) (Ref:

These diagrams can be depicted as dynamic interface and surface residues and interface and core residues and can be mapped to the database using a new application programming interface (API). This aids in identifying family-wide conserved residues at the interfaces. Additionally, Jmol and STRAP are built in the system to visualize an interactive model of viral molecular structures.
