<p id="Par22">Virus-PLoc is a web server for prediction of subcellular localization of viral proteins within host and virus-infected cells (Shen and Chou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2007</xref>). Another web server developed a little later, iLoc-Virus, is a multi-label learning classifier that predicts the subcellular locations of viral proteins with single and multiple sites (Xiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2011</xref>). Similarly, a most recent web server, pLoC-mVirus (Cheng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2017</xref>), is a new predictor that identifies subcellular localization of viral proteins with both single and multiple location sites. It works by extracting information from the Gene Ontology (GO) database and is claimed to be more successful than the state-of-the-art method, iLoc-Virus, in predicting subcellular localization of viral proteins. AVPpred is an antiviral peptide prediction algorithm that contains the peptides with experimentally proven antiviral activity (Thakur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2012</xref>). The prediction is based on peptide sequence features, peptide motifs, sequence alignment, amino acid composition and physicochemical properties. VIPS is a viral internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) prediction system that can predict IRES secondary structures (Hong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2013</xref>). VIPS uses the RNA fold program that predicts local RNA secondary structures, RNA align program that compares predicted structures and pknotsRG program (Reeder et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2007</xref>) that calculates the pseudoknot structures. VaZyMolO, a database that deals with viral sequences at protein level, defines and classifies viral protein modularity (Ferron et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2005</xref>). It extracts information of complete genome sequences of various viruses from GenBank and RefSeq and organizes the acquired information about modularity on viral ORFs (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">23.1f</xref>).
