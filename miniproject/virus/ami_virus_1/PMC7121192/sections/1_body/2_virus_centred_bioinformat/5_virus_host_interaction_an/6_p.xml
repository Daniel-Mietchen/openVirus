<p id="Par19">Genome Annotation Transfer Utility (GATU) facilitates quick and efficient annotation of similar target genome using the reference genomes that have already been annotated. Later, the users can manually curate the annotated genome. The newly annotated genomes can be saved as GenBank, EMBL or XML file format. Although it doesn’t provide a complete annotation system, GATU serves as a very useful tool for the preliminary work in genome annotation. GATU utilizes tBLASTn and BLASTn algorithms to map genes onto the new target genome by using an annotated reference genome. As a result, majority of the new genome’s genes are annotated in a single step. With GATU, users can also identify open reading frames present in the target genome and absent from the reference genome. These ORFs can further be scrutinized by using other bioinformatics tools such as BLAST and VGO, which can determine if the ORFs should be included in the annotation. Multiple-exon genes and mature peptides can also be analysed using GATU.</p>
