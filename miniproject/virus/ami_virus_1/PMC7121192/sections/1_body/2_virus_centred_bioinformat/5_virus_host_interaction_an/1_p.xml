<p id="Par14">Host-pathogenic interactions play an important role in determining the pathogenicity of a pathogen or immune evasion mechanism of a host. To comprehend such interactions between viral and host cellular proteins, various databases and softwares are available. One such database is PhEVER that enables to explore virus-virus and virus-host lateral gene transfers by providing evolutionary and phylogenetic information (Palmeira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). This distinct database catalogues homologous families between different viral sequences and between viral and host sequences. It compiles the extensive data from completely sequenced genomes (2426 non-redundant viral genomes, 1007 non-redundant prokaryotic genomes, 43 eukaryotic genomes ranging from plants to vertebrates). Thus, it enables compiling of various proteins into homologous families by selecting at least one viral sequence, related alignments and phylogenies for each of these families.
