<p id="Par25">VIDA is a database that organizes animal virus genome open reading frames from partial and complete genomic sequences (Alba et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2001</xref>). Presently, VIDA includes a complete collection of homologous protein families from GenBank for 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Papillomaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Poxviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Arteriviridae</italic>. The homologous proteins in VIDA include both orthologous and paralogous sequences. VIDA retrieves virus sequences from GenBank and the files are parsed into subfields. The parsed fields contain all the information such as GenBank accession number, GenBank identifier (GI numbers), protein sequence source, sequence length, gene name and gene product. In order to eliminate 100% redundancy, the virus protein sequences thus retrieved are filtered and a list of synonymous GIs is created for reference. The ORFs from complete and partial virus genomes are further organized into homologous protein families, on the basis of sequence similarity. Furthermore, the structure of known viral proteins or homologous to viral proteins is also mapped onto homologous protein families. VIDA also provides functional classification of virus proteins into broad functional classes based on typical virus processes such as DNA and RNA replication, virus structural proteins, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, transcription, glycoproteins and others. This database also provides alignment of the conserved regions based on potential functional importance. Apart from functional classification, VIDA also provides a taxonomical classification of the proteins and protein families. The protein families serve as a tool for functional and evolutionary studies, whereas alignments of conserved sequences provide crucial information on conserved amino acids or construction of sequence profiles.
