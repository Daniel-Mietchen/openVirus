<p id="Par27">Using the VBRC, each of the viral gene and genome can be curated. As a result, a comprehensive and searchable summary is acquired that details about the genotype and phenotype of the genes. The role of the genes in host-pathogen relationships is also being emphasized in these curations. Additionally, the VBRC also houses multiple analytical tools such as tools for genome annotation, comparative analysis, whole genome alignments and phylogenetic analysis. Further, this database also looks forward to include high-throughput data derived from other studies such as microarray gene expression data, proteomic analyses and population genetics data.</p>
