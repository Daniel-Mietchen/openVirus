<p id="par0070">The epicentre of the epidemic in China provided an early warning for Europe to allow the preparation of preventive measures, and specific organisational processes were rapidly adopted. Patients returning from China, and in particular from Hubei province are quarantined for 14 days. Anyone who develops symptoms that could suggest a coronavirus infection are encouraged to call a single emergency number and if COVID-19 is suspected, they are managed at their location by a specialised medical team equipped with PPE to prevent viral contamination, and when necessary, hospitalised in an intensive care unit. In ICUs suspected and confirmed cases are isolated with protective measures against staff contamination and placed in specific rooms with a negative pressure airflow. Based on the experience of SARS-CoV and H1N1 influenza outbreaks, seriously ill patients are referred to specialised units that have ECMO capability if required. Although one 80-year old Chinese tourist with co-morbidities has died in hospital, the majority of patients who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 to date have not yet shown signs of severe respiratory failure and some have been discharged from hospital after the contagious period. Currently, ICUs continue to manage patients with severe H1N1 influenza, utilising ECMO when indicated, and are therefore well prepared for the treatment of severe contagious viral infections.</p>
