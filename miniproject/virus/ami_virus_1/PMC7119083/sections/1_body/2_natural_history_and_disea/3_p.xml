<p id="par0020">As of 16th February 2020, only 4Â deaths have been reported outside China, but the mortality of COVID-19 reported in initial hospitalised cohorts in China ranges from 4.3 to 15% 
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0255" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. These findings should be interpreted in context since the hospitalised cohorts may have a significantly higher mortality than community patients with mild symptoms who may not seek hospital care.
