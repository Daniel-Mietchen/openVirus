<p id="par0025">Infection is confirmed by positive test to SARS-CoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR, isolation in cell culture of SARS-CoV-2 from clinical specimens, or rising serum antibody concentrations. If laboratory confirmatory tests are not available, clinical and epidemiological criteria such as those advocated by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) may be used (

Based on current best evidence, supportive treatment and organ support remain the focus of ICU care. Specific treatments such as the use of corticosteroids to control the inflammatory response, and antivirals, particularly the combination of lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been used, but are unproven to improve outcomes 
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The cautionary experience of SARS-CoV provided a lesson of the desperate pursuit to find effective treatment. During this outbreak, the use of high-dose corticosteroids (&gt; 3 g methylprednisolone in the acute phase of disease) used to modulate the immune response was not conclusively shown to improve outcomes, but resulted in devastating steroid induced complications
