<p id="par0010">Initially termed 2019-nCoV, sequencing showed that now officially named SARS-CoV-2 is 80â€“89% similar to bat severe acute respiratory syndrome related coronaviruses found in Chinese horseshoe bats 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. In addition, it is about 79% akin to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and 50% related to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The latter two coronaviruses have their immediate origins from civets and camels, respectively

 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Currently, while human to human transmission is certain, the mechanism of transmission remains controversial

 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. Although it is likely that COVID-19 transmission is primarily via droplets and fomite contact, airborne transmission events cannot yet be excluded. Transmission via the faecal-oral route remains a possibility as SARS-CoV-2 RNA, but not live virus, has been detected in stool 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. Molecularly, like SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 virus likely uses ACE-2 as entry receptor, which is highly expressed in the lung and gastrointestinal tract
