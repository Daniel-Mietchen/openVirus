<p id="par0035">Lack of clear knowledge of the mechanisms of COVID-19 transmission makes it difficult to develop evidence-based infection control protocols to prevent transmission to healthcare workers (HCW) and other patients. Certainly, ICU HCW are at particularly high risk of nosocomial transmission because of potential exposure to aerosolised respiratory secretions during intubation, tracheal suctioning, bronchoscopy and respiratory circuit disconnection, as well as environmental contamination

Thus, it is currently prudent to assume higher precautionary measures in ICU than those currently recommended by the CDC (respiratory droplet and contact precautions). Suspected or confirmed cases should ideally be isolated in a negative pressure airborne infection isolation room (AIIR) with sufficient air changes (&gt;Â 12/h) and personnel trained to use personal protective equipment (PPE) for airborne precautions. All support and sanitary staff, often forgotten, should also receive appropriate PPE and infection control training, particularly as there may be a risk of faecal transmission 
 <xref rid="bib0235" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. If full airborne precautions are not possible due to limited facilities or overwhelming numbers of cases, other measures that may decrease risk of nosocomial transmission include cohorting of patients in dedicated wards, or physical separation, supported by disciplined use of PPE, universal contact and droplet precautions and adequate ward ventilation
