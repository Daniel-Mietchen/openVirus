<p id="par0075">Should community outbreaks occur globally, the management of critically ill patients with COVID-19 infection will be challenging. The lack of specific treatment is compounded by uncertainties about its mode of transmission and clinical outcomes. Given these knowledge gaps, it becomes essential that as much robust high-quality evidence as possible is gathered in the early stages of the disease. A strong appeal is made for the ICU community to come together globally, and for the contribution of data by all ICUs to local, regional and international databases. COVID-19 patients pose risks to ICU staff, but the precise magnitude of this risk is currently unclear. Adequate precautions, good hand hygiene, plentiful supplies of properly fitted N-95 masks and other essential PPE, filters for circuits, clear and robust protocols, teamwork and communication are all needed to address these concerns. ICU management teams have the responsibility to make these needs known to relevant authorities to ensure proper forward planning and adequate procurement. Painful lessons were learned from the recent SARS-CoV and influenza epidemics. It is time to apply what we have learned, and rise to the challenge of COVID-19.</p>
