<p id="par0055">Standard use of rapid sequence induction to avoid or minimise BVM ventilation may be preferable as BVM was previously associated with SARS-CoV nosocomial infection 
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Pre-oxygenation under these conditions using a well-sealed BVM with appropriately placed viral filter is recommended. Directly connecting the ventilator circuit to the ET tube immediately after intubation, rather than the BVM resuscitator, eliminates the need to reconnect and facilitates expired gas scavenging. In-line “closed suctioning systems” should be used to maintain a closed circuit.
