<p id="par0040">Limited data suggests that the use of high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) may prevent intubation in severe hypoxemic respiratory failure 
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Within the ICU, and with HCW protected by high-level PPE (including an N95 mask), non-invasive ventilation (NIV) and HFNO use during SARS-CoV and 2009 influenza epidemic was not clearly associated with an increased risk in HCW

 <xref rid="bib0320" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, a recent meta-analysis demonstrated that there may be an increased risk of viral transmission to HCW who treated patients receiving NIV 
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Since the mode of COVID-19 transmission remains unclear and mortality benefit of HFNO and NIV in severe pneumonia is unproven, we do not currently recommend their use in suspected or confirmed cases of COVID-19. If used, patients must be closely monitored in ICU or high care areas, and airborne respiratory precautions strictly adhered to.
