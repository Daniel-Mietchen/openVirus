<p id="Par3">The recent influenza pandemic in 2009 caused by influenza A/H1N1 reassortant with high human-to-human transmissibility, demonstrated the unpredictable nature of emerging viruses and importance of continuous surveillance. During the 2009–2010 influenza season, the 2009 H1N1 virus infected approximately 61 million persons and caused an estimated 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths in the USA [

In addition to the human toll, annual influenza epidemics and pandemics carry substantial economic consequences in health-care utilization costs, intervention costs, and reduced productivity. The cost of annual influenza epidemics in the USA is estimated to range between $52 and $199 billion [
