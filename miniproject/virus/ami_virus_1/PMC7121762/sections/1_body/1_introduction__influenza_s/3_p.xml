<p id="Par5">The US national influenza surveillance systems include syndromic, clinical, and virologic monitoring. Information on influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza hospitalizations, influenza and pneumonia associated mortality, influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and laboratory testing of a subset of specimens from patients with ILI to characterize the circulating viruses are reported. These surveillance systems are resource-intensive [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and require sustained funding for epidemiologic and virologic information gathering at the national and local levels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Enhanced and timely syndromic surveillance methods that use electronic health records (EHR) could improve the assessment of influenza medical and economic disease burden and associated risk factors leading to identification of at risk population groups, targeted and appropriate public health interventions, and estimates of economic burden associated with the disease [

EHRs capturing information using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes lend themselves to efficient quantitative analyses and have been used in numerous epidemiologic studies and influenza surveillance [
