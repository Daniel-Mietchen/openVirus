(2010) found a wide range of hospitalization rates (0–93.8 %), ICU admission rates (0–36.4 %), and fatality rates (0–38.5 %) among influenza cases. The fatality rate was significantly higher (25–41.4 %) among patients admitted to the ICU. A prospective study in Canadian population measured the outcomes of severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) cases as mortality, length of stay (LOS) in an ICU, and duration of mechanical ventilation. In this study of 215 critically ill patients, 81 % required mechanical ventilation, the median ICU stay was 12 days, and 17.3 % died within 90 days [
