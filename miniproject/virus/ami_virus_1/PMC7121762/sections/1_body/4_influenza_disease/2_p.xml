<p id="Par33">Interventions to prevent or mitigate the impact of epidemics and pandemics include vaccination, antiviral drug therapies, and non-pharmaceutical methods. Vaccination is considered the most effective prevention method because it creates herd immunity by protecting not only the vaccinated individual but also precluding the viral transmission to those who did not receive the vaccine.

Novel therapeutic technologies against influenza offer great promise such as the use of siRNA and ribozymes delivered by intranasal spray or retroviral carriage [
