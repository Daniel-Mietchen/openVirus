<p id="Par44">Lung diseases were the most frequently reported chronic conditions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza case fatalities with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) most prevalent in adults and asthma in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">83</xref>]. Regardless of asthma severity, its prevalence tends to grow with escalating influenza disease severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>]. Influenza virus infection is known to exacerbate asthma and asthma is a known risk factor for influenza infection. It was the most frequently reported underlying medical condition in pediatric deaths associated with influenza A/2009 H1N [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">83</xref>]. The impact of asthma may also depend on the circulating influenza viruses. In a Canadian studies of pediatric population hospitalized with influenza, children with pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 were significantly more likely to have asthma (22 %) than those with seasonal influenza during the 2004–2009 seasons (6 %) although there were no difference in severity or clinical presentation of asthma between the pandemic and seasonal pediatric influenza cases [

Patients with chronic lung and airways diseases such as COPD are at a greater risk for severe morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection. Evidence suggests that bacterial coinfections in COPD cases may further impact the disease severity. In a study of patients hospitalized with severe COPD in Italy, viral infection was detected in 23.4 % and viral-bacterial coinfection in 25 % of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbation. Influenza was one of the most frequently identified infections adversely effecting lung function and extending hospital stay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">110</xref>]. Although many national guidelines recommend influenza vaccination, there is only limited evidence that vaccine is effective in COPD patients. However, some observational studies suggest that vaccine reduces both hospitalizations and mortality [
