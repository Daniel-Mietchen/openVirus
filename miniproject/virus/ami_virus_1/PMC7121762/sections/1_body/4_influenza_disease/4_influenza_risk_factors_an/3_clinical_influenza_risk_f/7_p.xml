<p id="Par45">The association between diabetes Type1 and Type 2 and a greater risk for influenza associated complications may be explained by adverse impact of excessive blood glucose on immunity, as well as heart, kidney, and lung functions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">112</xref>]. Influenza surveillance data in Wisconsin and New Mexico during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicated that diabetes was the second most frequent comorbidity following asthma and was present in 16â€“20 % of hospitalized influenza cases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">105</xref>]. Van Kerkhove et al. (2011) reported that diabetes was an underlying chronic condition in 9 % of influenza-associated hospitalizations and 13.6 % of cases admitted to the ICU in a sample representing 19 countries with diverse populations and health-care systems. Diabetes was present in 8 % of influenza A/H1N1 associated fatalities in England [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>], and 29 % of fatalities in New Mexico [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">105</xref>]. The higher proportion of diabetes in New Mexico potentially could be due to a higher than 50 % obesity among hospitalized patients older than 18 years. Diabetes prevalence is on the rise in the USA, especially among the aging population, reaching almost 27 % prevalence among persons 65 years of age or older [
