<p id="Par47">In a study of influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the 2003â€“2004 influenza season, 33 % of the children had neuromuscular or neurologic disorder [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">116</xref>]. Louie et al. (2006) further confirmed that neurologic diseases with the potential to compromise respiratory function were present in more than 25 % of severe influenza cases among children. NNMD were the most prevalent chronic diseases associated with respiratory failure in hospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis followed by chronic lung and chronic heart conditions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">117</xref>]. Pediatric deaths due to pandemic influenza five times exceeded the annual average number of deaths caused by seasonal influenza viruses during the five proceeding seasons. Neurologic disorders were the most frequent comorbidities found in influenza-associated pediatric deaths [
