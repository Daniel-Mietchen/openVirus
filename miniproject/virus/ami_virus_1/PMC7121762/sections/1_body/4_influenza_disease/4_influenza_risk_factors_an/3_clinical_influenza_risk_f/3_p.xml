<p id="Par41">During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, a greater proportion of immunocompromised HIV-positive persons were hospitalized with influenza compared to HIV prevalence in general population but the H1N1pdm-associated disease severity and mortality were not substantially affected. In a US study of hospitalized patients with confirmed 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, there was no statistically significant difference between the proportion of immunosuppressed patients among those with pneumonia (10 %) compared to patients without pneumonia (14 %) [

However, in high HIV prevalence populations, influenza may pose a higher morbidity and mortality risk due to compromised immune functions and the presence of tuberculosis, hepatitis, and other comorbidities [
