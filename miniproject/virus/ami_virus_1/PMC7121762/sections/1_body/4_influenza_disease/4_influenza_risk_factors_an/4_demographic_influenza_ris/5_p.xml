<p id="Par56">During the seasonal influenza epidemics older adults and young children are usually at a higher risk for severe disease and death. The proportion of influenza-attributable deaths during the 1994–2000 influenza seasons in Canada increased with age from 2 % in 65–69 age group to 5 % in persons 90 years and older. The case fatality rate for influenza hospitalized patients increased from 4 to 30 % for population 50–64 years to 90 years or older respectively and over 90 % of deaths occurred in persons older than 65 years of age [
