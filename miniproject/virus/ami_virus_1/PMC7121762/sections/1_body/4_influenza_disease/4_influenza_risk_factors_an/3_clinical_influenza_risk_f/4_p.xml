<p id="Par42">Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or after hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) have suppressed immune functions and are susceptible to infections including seasonal or pandemic influenza viruses. Influenza infection outcomes in HCT recipients vary depending on the influenza virus type and subtype [

Males were especially at high risk for developing pneumonia. Timely antiviral therapy mitigated the influenza disease severity in children and adult recipients of HCT [
