For both the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and A/H3N2 2007–2008 epidemic seasons, the proportion of records with comorbidities among severe cases (64.7 % and 62.9 % respectively) and among those who died in the hospital (62 and 63.4 %) was similar and significantly higher than among the hospitalizations with moderate disease (45.4 and 46.2 % respectively). The hospitalized patients with any comorbidity had greater odds of severe seasonal and pandemic influenza (OR = 2.21 and 1.97 respectively) and inpatient death (OR = 1.96 and 2.02 respectively) [
