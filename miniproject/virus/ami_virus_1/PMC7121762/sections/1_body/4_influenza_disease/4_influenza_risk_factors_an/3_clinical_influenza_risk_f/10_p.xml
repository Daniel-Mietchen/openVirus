<p id="Par48">During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, obese individuals with body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m
 <sup>2</sup> were at a higher risk for influenza infection; they were more likely to be hospitalized and were disproportionately represented among the patients in ICUs, those with longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital stay, and those who died compared with those who were not obese [

In a study of California adults the prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity among influenza cases was 1.5 and 2.8 times higher respectively than the US population average. The odds ratio (OR) for fatality among the extremely obese (BMI &gt; 40) patients was 2.8–4.2 [

These findings corroborated the results of Kwong, Campitelli, and Rosella (2011) suggesting that obese individuals were at a greater risk for hospitalization than persons with normal weight during 12 pre-pandemic influenza seasons with OR = 1.45 and 2.1, for individuals with BMI 30-34.9 and ≥35 respectively.
