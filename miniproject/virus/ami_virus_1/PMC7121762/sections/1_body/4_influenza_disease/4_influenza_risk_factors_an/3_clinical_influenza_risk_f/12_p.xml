In a review of publications on 2009 H1N1 pandemic epidemiology in the Northern Hemisphere, Falagas et al. (2010) reported that 4.5–17.4 % of hospitalized cases were pregnant women and they comprised 11.5–18.2 % of ICU admissions. Compared to nonpregnant women diagnosed with influenza, they were seven times more likely to be hospitalized and twice more likely to have fatal outcomes [

In a UK study of a population with an estimated 6 % prevalence of pregnancy, 21 % of patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza 2009 H1N1 were pregnant and the majority of them were in the second or third trimester. The case fatality rate ranged between 1 and 6 % [
