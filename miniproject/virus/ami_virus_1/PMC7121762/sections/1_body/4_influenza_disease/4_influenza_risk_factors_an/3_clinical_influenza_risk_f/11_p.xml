<p id="Par49">The association between obesity and infection can be explained by impaired immune response or by strain of infection on respiratory system and reduced mechanical function of lungs and airways. Obese persons consume high percentage of oxygen to maintain normal respiratory function; they have increased airway resistance and may suffer from hypoventilation and chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract altering the immune function and the ability to respond to challenges to respiratory system [

The role of obesity as an independent risk factor may be difficult to ascertain, especially in studies with a limited sample size, as it is often directly correlated with other underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) known to increase risk for influenza infections and severe outcomes [
