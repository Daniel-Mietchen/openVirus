<p id="Par32">The impact of influenza epidemics or pandemics on the affected population has been associated with predominantly circulating viral types and subtypes and their relation to the preexisting immunity of the human host [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">72</xref>]. Influenza infections may cause especially severe disease in populations already burdened with a high prevalence of chronic pulmonary conditions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">85</xref>]. Galiano et al. (2012) suggested that the major determinant of influenza disease severity was host-related and included immune response, individual genetic background, and likely environmental factors surrounding human host and the virus. They based their hypothesis on the fact that a complete sequence of the A/Fujian/411/2002-like H3N2 virus isolates from cases that died and those who survived did not reveal any genetic differences that could be associated with disease severity or increased mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">64</xref>]. Because the mechanisms by which viruses evolve and adapt to human hosts remain undetermined and the seasonal influenza disease continues to cause substantial public health threat, identifying the most vulnerable population groups in a timely manner remains a critical component of public health response.
