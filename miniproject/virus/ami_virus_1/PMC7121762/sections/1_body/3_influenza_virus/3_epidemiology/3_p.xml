<p id="Par26">In temperate climates, influenza epidemics occur in a seasonal pattern during the colder months of the year, while in the tropical climates, influenza circulates all year round with patterns associated with rainy seasons. Multiple reasons for this periodicity such as sunlight, temperature, humidity, human mobility, and contact rates, and functions of the immune system have been explored without arriving at a definitive conclusion [

Yang and Marr (2011) suggested that the winter seasonality can be partially explained by higher concentration of droplet-suspended influenza viruses in heated buildings due to lower humidity. Other environmental factors, such as colder temperature and reduced ultraviolet radiation, are also independently associated with virus survival and seasonality. Temperature and humidity also effect the human immune system, diminishing the blood flow and leukocyte supply in low temperatures while increasing viral shedding [

Lowen and Palese (2011) confirmed that cold and dry conditions facilitated viral transmission through aerosolized droplets, while warm or humid environment (30 Â°C, 80 % RH) prevented the viral spread. They proposed that seasonal pattern of influenza epidemics in temperate climate occurs due to viral transmission by aerosolized droplets, while year-round infections occur through fomites or direct contacts in tropical climate. The exception to this pattern was the 2009 spring outbreak of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1, which possibly could be explained by the increased frequency of transmission via direct contact due to the absence of human immunity to the novel antigenic strain. Variations in temperature and humidity did not affect viral spread by direct contact [
