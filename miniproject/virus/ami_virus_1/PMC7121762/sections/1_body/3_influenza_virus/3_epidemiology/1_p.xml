<p id="Par24">Despite the investments in influenza research, surveillance, and prevention efforts, influenza virus remains a cause of respiratory infection in the USA and in the world. Annual influenza-associated deaths in the USA range between 3,349 and 48,614 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">62</xref>] and, on the average, 200,000 are hospitalized due to severe disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">63</xref>]. The variations in mortality can be attributed to difference in the circulating viral types and subtypes. The average mortality rates are 2.7 times higher during the seasons when influenza A(H3N2) subtype is predominant as compared to seasons when influenza B or other influenza A subtypes are the predominantly circulating viruses. During a typical influenza season, severe illness and death occur most frequently among individuals 65 years and older (89.4 %) or children younger than 2 years of age [
