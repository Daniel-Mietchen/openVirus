 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">79</xref>]. A distinguishing feature of the 2009 H1N1 virus, also observed in previous pandemics, was the off-season timing for the start of the pandemic and young age prevalence among influenza cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. In Mexico in the early stage of the pandemic, 87 % of deaths were reported for patients 5- to 59-years-old [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">81</xref>] compared to a typical influenza season when estimated 90 % of deaths occur in this age group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">82</xref>]. Among hospitalized patients 68.8 % of fatalities occurred among adults 19–64 years of age during the 2009 pandemic while 74.9 % fatalities occurred among patients 65 years and older during the preceding influenza season [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Underlying medical conditions contributed to disease severity in all age groups. Cross-reactive immunity was found more frequently among persons older than 60 years of age due to earlier exposure to influenza A/H1N1 strains derived from the 1918 pandemic virus [
