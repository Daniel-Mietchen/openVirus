<p id="Par29">The sequence data of the 1918 influenza a H1N1 virus suggest that the virus was not a reassortant but rather all eight viral segments were novel with no prior immunity in the human population. In contrast, the viruses that caused the 1957 (H2N2) and 1968 (H3N2) pandemics were direct descendants of the 1918 influenza and evolved from the existing strains through reassortment events with genes from avian influenza viruses [

The H2N2 virus with two surface proteins new to humans caused the Asian pandemic, resulting in approximately 70,000 deaths in the USA and two million deaths worldwide. The 1968 H3N2 “Hong Kong'” virus was associated with 34,000 deaths in the USA and approximately 1,000,000 excess deaths globally. The disease caused by the pandemic H3N2 was relatively mild and the virus became seasonal and is circulating to date [
