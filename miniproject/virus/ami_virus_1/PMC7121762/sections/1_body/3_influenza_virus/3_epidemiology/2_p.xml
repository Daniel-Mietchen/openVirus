<p id="Par25">Influenza viruses are transmissible among humans via the respiratory rout. During seasonal epidemics and pandemics, each case transmits the virus at 2–3 day interval to 1.1–1.8 and 1.5–5.5 individuals respectively [

The human-to-human transmission occurs in one of the three ways: direct contact with infected persons, touching object contaminated with the virus and then transferring it from hands to mucus surfaces of the nose or eyes, and inhaling virus-containing droplets produced by infected person when coughing or sneezing [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">67</xref>]. The efficiency of influenza transmission aerosolized in droplets depends on the size of the droplet, viral concentration, and humidity. Yang and Marr (2011) demonstrated that the concentration of infectious influenza virus in cough droplets is inversely related to the relative humidity (RH) in indoor settings, while the droplet size is directly related to relative humidity. In a dryer environment, the smaller droplets tend to stay in the air longer, infecting larger number of sensitive hosts. In a humid environment, the virus in large droplets settles on objects (fomites) and can survive for several days. Viable influenza viruses in mucus were detected on paper money bills after 48 h and in some cases up to 17 days [
