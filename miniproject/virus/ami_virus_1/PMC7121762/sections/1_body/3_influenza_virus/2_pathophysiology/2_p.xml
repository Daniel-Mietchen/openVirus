<p id="Par22">It is an enveloped single stranded RNA virus with a genome fragmented into eight segments encoding 11 proteins. The surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) play the most important role in viral infection and transmission. HA attaches the virus to the target cellâ€™s sialic acids receptors facilitating the viral RNA entry into the cell. The NA enzymatic activity cleaves the sialic acid releasing the newly produced viral particles [
