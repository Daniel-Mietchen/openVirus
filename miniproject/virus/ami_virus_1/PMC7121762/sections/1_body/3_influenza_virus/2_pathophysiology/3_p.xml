<p id="Par23">The annual epidemics are caused by influenza A and influenza B, but only influenza A can adapt to multiple hosts and emerge as a novel virus causing pandemics. Antigenic drift due to mutations in HA and NA genes allows the virus to evade preexisting antibodies in the human immune system conferring the pathogenicity and virulence. Antigenic shift occurs when influenza viruses containing diverse HA and NA subtypes coinfect the same host, triggering a reassortment event and producing progeny with genomic segments from both parental viral subtypes [
