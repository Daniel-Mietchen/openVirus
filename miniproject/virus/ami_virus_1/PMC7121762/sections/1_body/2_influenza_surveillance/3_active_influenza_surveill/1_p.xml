<p id="Par10">In the USA, the national influenza surveillance is lead by the CDC as a collaborative effort of state and local health departments and laboratories, health-care providers, hospitals, and clinical laboratories. The data on circulating influenza viruses and the disease activity including incidence, morbidity, and mortality is collected year round, compiled, and published weekly with a 1–2-week reporting delay [

Influenza virologic surveillance throughout the USA is conducted by approximately 140 laboratories comprising the WHO and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks. They collect information on the proportion of influenza A and B positive respiratory specimens and determine influenza A subtypes. A subset of the influenza positive samples, especially if the subtypes cannot be determined by standard diagnostic tests, are sent to CDC for further characterization by gene sequencing to monitor emergence of novel viruses and antiviral resistance [

The second component of the surveillance system is the Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) comprised of approximately 3,000 health-care providers voluntarily reporting all outpatient visits and the number of visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) stratified by age group. The percentage of weekly ILI visits weighted to reflect the population size of reporting states are compared to the national baseline of ILI visits outside of influenza season to monitor ILI activity levels in each state [

Vital statistics offices in 122 participating US cities report the total number of deaths and the number of deaths caused by pneumonia or influenza (P&amp;I) stratified by age groups. Statistical methods are used to calculate the weekly level of P&amp;I mortality above the seasonal baseline or epidemic threshold. In 2004, pediatric influenza-associated mortality for children 0–18 years of age became a nationally notifiable condition. Influenza Hospitalization Network comprised of hospitals in over 80 counties in 14 states collects information from hospital records and reports on laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations for children and adults. The information on geographic spread of influenza activity is augmented by State and Territorial health department epidemiologists’ reports [
