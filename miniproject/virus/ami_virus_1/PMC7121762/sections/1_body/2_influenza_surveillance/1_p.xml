<p id="Par8">Every year, emerging and reemerging influenza viruses lead to tens of millions of respiratory infections and up to 500,000 fatalities worldwide. Unpredictability of antigenic drift or antigenic shift leading to emergence of viral strains with limited or no immunity in human population results in variable disease spread and severity. A novel high pathogenicity virus adapted to human-to-human transmission could cause a global pandemic with millions of deaths [

Timely detection and reporting of disease in specific populations through an effective biosurveillance system is the most promising strategy for mitigating the impact from disease outbreaks caused by naturally occurring epidemics or bioterrorism events [

Monitoring influenza outbreaks is of particular interest because they represent a proxy for research of potential biothreat surveillance systems. Early clinical symptoms of many biologic warfare agents such as aerosolized
