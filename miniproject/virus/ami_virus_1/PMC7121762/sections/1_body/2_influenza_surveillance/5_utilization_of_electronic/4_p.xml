<p id="Par19">Findings from these studies demonstrate that large datasets of electronic medical records are an essential component of influenza epidemic surveillance. Integration of ICD-9 diagnosis codes into more complex disease detection algorithms can further improve the sensitivity and specificity of surveillance systems based on electronic medical records [

However, this approach is limited if electronic records are fragmented between different providers using different disease algorithms whereas the ICD-9 codes even though potentially less specific are standardized among all users and may be more applicable to nationwide surveillance [
