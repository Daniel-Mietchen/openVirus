<p id="Par17">Information from electronic medical records captured through surveillance platforms or stored in local or centralized databases has been used in numerous studies for monitoring disease incidence, prevalence, severity, risk factors, and medical care decisions. Analyses of electronic medical records were employed to augment the traditional approaches [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] during respiratory seasons in the USA. Standard surveillance was not sufficient during the recent influenza 2009 H1N1 pandemic when several states, including New York [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">41</xref>], Wisconsin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">42</xref>], and California [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR420">43</xref>] implemented additional information gathering methods based on electronic medical records to gain a more complete understanding of the ongoing pandemic severity. EHR-based surveillance systems such as Electronic Medical Record Support for Public Health (ESP) implemented in Ohio and Massachusetts and BioSense were successfully used for analyzing ICD-9 diagnosis codes, reporting notifiable disease cases, surveillance of ILI, identification of influenza or upper respiratory infection risk factors among hospitalized patients, and for monitoring diabetes prevalence, risk factors, and disease severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The results of influenza risk factor analyses based on ICD-9 coded data overall agreed with earlier observations based on primary data collected through the Emerging Infections Program during 2005–2008 influenza seasons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">44</xref>] and in Manitoba, Canada during 2009 H1N1 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">45</xref>] as well as with laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations reported to the CDC during the 2009 pandemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">47</xref>] demonstrated that optimally selected ICD-9 code groups can be used in an automated surveillance system drawing information from electronic medical records for accurate monitoring of influenza activity. In this study of the US Air Force personnel and their dependents outpatient visits the syndromic surveillance results correlated with the results of sentinel ILI surveillance conducted by the CDC. Placzek and Madoff (2011) used administrative hospital discharge records to estimate the hospitalization rates and characterize patients hospitalized with ILI during the seasonal flu epidemics and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Massachusetts. They evaluated two sets (“maximum” and “minimum”) of ICD-9 diagnosis codes for their relevance and accuracy in identifying influenza-associated hospitalizations and disease severity and concluded the proposed minimum ICD-9 criteria more accurately reflected the actual influenza cases. ICD-9 coded diagnosis alone or in conjunction with other electronic health data were used in monitoring of ILI severity and risk factors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">48</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">49</xref>], and for modeling early detection of local respiratory disease outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This approach was adopted for other disease surveillance, such as SARS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">50</xref>], diabetes incidence and management [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and pertussis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">51</xref>]. The study results suggest that timely ILI surveillance is feasible using ICD-9-CM coded electronic medical records and emphasized the importance of the appropriate ICD-9-CM code selection for case definition for accurate assessment of disease activity and severity [
