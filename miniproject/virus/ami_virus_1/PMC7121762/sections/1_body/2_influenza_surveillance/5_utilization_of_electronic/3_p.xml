<p id="Par18">Current influenza surveillance systems are resource intensive and provide limited information on patients at-risk for severe influenza. To date, no study has been conducted using a large sample of electronic health records (EHR) to examine the risk factors for influenza in hospitalized patients across the USA. Larger data sets of EHRs will enable the creation of statistically significant age-specific models of influenza severity and predict more representative influenza risk factors and vulnerable groups. A recent study utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) which is a repository of eight million electronic hospital discharge records from 1,000 participating hospitals in over 43 states representing approximately 20 % of all US hospitalizations [

Results from the retrospective unmatched case–control study of NIS patients hospitalized with influenza during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and severe A/H3N2 2007–2008 epidemic seasons confirmed the utility of using an existing electronic resource to identify comorbidities and demographic risk factors for severity of clinical outcomes associated with pandemic and epidemic influenza viruses [
