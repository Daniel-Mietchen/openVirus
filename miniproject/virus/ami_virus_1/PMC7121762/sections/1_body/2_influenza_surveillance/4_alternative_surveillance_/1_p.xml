<p id="Par12">In addition to the active surveillance efforts, alternative methods such as syndromic surveillance, electronic patient records from emergency room or ambulatory doctor visits, and hospital discharge records have been used for surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases with growing frequency [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">33</xref>]. Syndromic surveillance provides clues on disease patterns collected from multiple information sources such as emergency department visits, ambulatory health-care visits, calls to health information hotlines, Internet health information seeking, and over-the-counter medication purchases. Indication of potential disease outbreak from syndromic surveillance is usually available before laboratory test results are reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. ESSENCE, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics is an example of syndromic surveillance system implemented by the Department of Defense (DoD) to automatically download data from the electronic health records of military personnel and their families. The system captures information coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) standards from over 300,000 weekly outpatient visits to US military treatment facilities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It monitors disease outbreaks based on health care utilization patterns and uses ICD-9-CM codes to group diagnosis into one of the eight disease syndromes. Another national electronic surveillance system, BioSense, launched in 2003 and operated by the CDC collects and analyzes ICD-9-CM coded data from outpatient visits to health-care facilities and emergency departments, hospitalized patients, laboratory tests, and information on over-the-counter medications sold in pharmacies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">34</xref>]. Although different studies reported variable utility of syndromic disease surveillance systems for local disease outbreaks, the majority of them indicated that it was useful for monitoring respiratory disease activity and the annual influenza seasons [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">35</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">36</xref>]. Sensitivity of ICD-9-CM based detectors of acute respiratory disease and influenza epidemics varied from 44 to 79 % for acute respiratory disease to 100 % for influenza outbreak [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">37</xref>] and specificity ranged between 96 and 97 % [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Sensitivity was found to be moderate and likely not sufficient to detect a small disease outbreak, e.g., in the event of a local bioterrorism incidence. However, ICD-9-CM coded data can be useful for influenza surveillance when accuracy, completeness, and timeliness are carefully considered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] before using such data for decision making.
