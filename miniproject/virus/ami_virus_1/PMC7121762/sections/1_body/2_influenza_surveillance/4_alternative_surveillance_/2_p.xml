<p id="Par13">For a comprehensive influenza surveillance system, it is critical to include hospitals that would collect epidemiological and virological information on severe cases. This data enables characterization of severe ILI, identification of at risk population groups, tracking of genetic changes in the circulating viruses, and serve as a monitoring tool for emerging pandemics [

Although these studies can inform vaccination and therapy decisions, majority of them have a limited sample size, are recourse intensive, and the results are not generalizable on the national level. The lack of this data became especially apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when the disease incidence rate was very high resulting in declaration of phase 6 pandemic while the disease severity on a national level was not ascertained [

Hospital-based electronic surveillance is a cost-effective approach to identify influenza season-specific populations at high risk for ILI complications and fatal outcomes. Detailed clinical information on each individual case is coded in patientsâ€™ records and can be used to augment active surveillance in public health response planning and implementation [
