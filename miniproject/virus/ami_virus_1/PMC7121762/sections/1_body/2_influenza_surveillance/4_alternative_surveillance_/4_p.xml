<p id="Par15">An approach to influenza surveillance monitoring ILI health-seeking Internet queries was launched by Google and CDC during the 2007–2008 influenza season. The system analyzed logs of Web searches related to ILI information and reported data with only 1 day lag instead of the usual delay of 1–2 weeks. The accuracy of the ILI estimates was 85–96 % as compared to the actual disease incidence reported by CDC influenza surveillance [

A Health Map Web based data collection system was employed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to monitor the Internet, compile, and report influenza activity in geographically diverse locations through an interactive map. Data was collected from news media, blogs, and other nontraditional sources as well as from the WHO, CDC, and the public health agency of Canada. The median lag between reported and confirmed cases ranged from 9 to 18 days with considerable variations between the countries influenced by public health infrastructure, political system restricting information, and media coverage. The nontraditional information sources may enable earlier detection of outbreaks and epidemics, expand population coverage, improve sensitivity of emerging diseases detection, and place the epidemic or pandemic in the context of the affected population [
