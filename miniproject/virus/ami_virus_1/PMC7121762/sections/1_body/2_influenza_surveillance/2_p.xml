<p id="Par9">Surveillance of infectious diseases can be conducted using passive or active approaches. Active methods based on laboratory testing and case reporting are usually resource intensive and require ongoing reporting by participating physicians, hospitals, and laboratories [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Only a subset of specimens can be tested [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and cases are often underreported. Passive syndromic surveillance methods may be less accurate but they are also less expansive and enable assessment of the disease spread and severity in the population. Implementing syndromic surveillance based on signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and large volumes of other health related data for disease of interest can greatly improve the quality and timeliness of passive surveillance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Information acquired integrating both methods can generate a more complete picture of an outbreak or an epidemic [
