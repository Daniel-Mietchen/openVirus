Surveillance of severe disease cases can contribute to a more effective public health preparedness and response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction: Influenza Surveillance and Disease Burden</title><p id="Par3">The recent influenza pandemic in 2009 caused by influenza A/H1N1 reassortant with high human-to-human transmissibility, demonstrated the unpredictable nature of emerging viruses and importance of continuous surveillance. During the 2009&#x02013;2010 influenza season, the 2009 H1N1 virus infected approximately 61 million persons and caused an estimated 274,000 hospitalizations and 12,500 deaths in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. This novel virus caused severe morbidity and mortality in pregnant women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and younger adults with 87 % of deaths occurring in persons younger than 65 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition to the human toll, annual influenza epidemics and pandemics carry substantial economic consequences in health-care utilization costs, intervention costs, and reduced productivity. The cost of annual influenza epidemics in the USA is estimated to range between $52 and $199 billion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par4">Individual risk factors for severe outcomes of influenza infection vary between seasons and are associated with circulating influenza virus types and subtypes, as well as with individual demographic characteristics, such as age, ethnicity, and clinical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular, lung, and neurological diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Due to variations in influenza virus activity, the capacity to respond to seasonal epidemics and pandemics depends on the availability of accurate and timely information and swift and early identification of pandemic and epidemic strains.</p><p id="Par5">The US national influenza surveillance systems include syndromic, clinical, and virologic monitoring. Information on influenza-like illness (ILI), influenza hospitalizations, influenza and pneumonia associated mortality, influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and laboratory testing of a subset of specimens from patients with ILI to characterize the circulating viruses are reported. These surveillance systems are resource-intensive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and require sustained funding for epidemiologic and virologic information gathering at the national and local levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Enhanced and timely syndromic surveillance methods that use electronic health records (EHR) could improve the assessment of influenza medical and economic disease burden and associated risk factors leading to identification of at risk population groups, targeted and appropriate public health interventions, and estimates of economic burden associated with the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. EHRs capturing information using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes lend themselves to efficient quantitative analyses and have been used in numerous epidemiologic studies and influenza surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">With the growing focus of the US health care system on the meaningful use of electronic medical records, one of the practical applications is expanding biosurveillance and preparedness capabilities, such as surveillance of influenza severity and associated risk factors during seasonal epidemics and pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Traditional influenza surveillance data are based on laboratory testing of a limited number of samples, case reporting by participating health care providers, hospital-based primary data, and deaths reported by statistics offices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Data extracted from electronic medical records can enrich reporting of risk factors for disease severity or clinical diagnoses, even in the absence of laboratory testing, and augment the traditional surveillance. In addition, monitoring patients EHRs may enable detection of disease outbreaks for which no laboratory diagnostics were requested including emerging pathogens and biothreat events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">The timely reporting of information on circulating influenza viruses and the disease burden associated with seasonal and pandemic influenza is essential for optimal public health response, identification of vulnerable populations, and for prevention and patient management strategies. Large electronic datasets of hospital discharge records, such as the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS), could provide information on risk factors for disease enhancing influenza surveillance methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The use of much larger more representative national population repositories from existing electronic medical records can potentially augment or replace small hospital case series studies often employed for assessment of influenza severity.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Influenza Surveillance</title><p id="Par8">Every year, emerging and reemerging influenza viruses lead to tens of millions of respiratory infections and up to 500,000 fatalities worldwide. Unpredictability of antigenic drift or antigenic shift leading to emergence of viral strains with limited or no immunity in human population results in variable disease spread and severity. A novel high pathogenicity virus adapted to human-to-human transmission could cause a global pandemic with millions of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Timely detection and reporting of disease in specific populations through an effective biosurveillance system is the most promising strategy for mitigating the impact from disease outbreaks caused by naturally occurring epidemics or bioterrorism events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Influenza virus surveillance informs selection of the annual vaccine strains and guides antiviral therapy. Monitoring influenza outbreaks is of particular interest because they represent a proxy for research of potential biothreat surveillance systems. Early clinical symptoms of many biologic warfare agents such as aerosolized <italic>B. anthracis</italic>, tularemia, and smallpox resemble influenza like illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Surveillance of infectious diseases can be conducted using passive or active approaches. Active methods based on laboratory testing and case reporting are usually resource intensive and require ongoing reporting by participating physicians, hospitals, and laboratories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Only a subset of specimens can be tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and cases are often underreported. Passive syndromic surveillance methods may be less accurate but they are also less expansive and enable assessment of the disease spread and severity in the population. Implementing syndromic surveillance based on signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and large volumes of other health related data for disease of interest can greatly improve the quality and timeliness of passive surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Information acquired integrating both methods can generate a more complete picture of an outbreak or an epidemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Active Influenza Surveillance</title><p id="Par10">In the USA, the national influenza surveillance is lead by the CDC as a collaborative effort of state and local health departments and laboratories, health-care providers, hospitals, and clinical laboratories. The data on circulating influenza viruses and the disease activity including incidence, morbidity, and mortality is collected year round, compiled, and published weekly with a 1&#x02013;2-week reporting delay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Influenza virologic surveillance throughout the USA is conducted by approximately 140 laboratories comprising the WHO and National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) laboratory networks. They collect information on the proportion of influenza A and B positive respiratory specimens and determine influenza A subtypes. A subset of the influenza positive samples, especially if the subtypes cannot be determined by standard diagnostic tests, are sent to CDC for further characterization by gene sequencing to monitor emergence of novel viruses and antiviral resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The second component of the surveillance system is the Illness Surveillance Network (ILINet) comprised of approximately 3,000 health-care providers voluntarily reporting all outpatient visits and the number of visits due to influenza-like illness (ILI) stratified by age group. The percentage of weekly ILI visits weighted to reflect the population size of reporting states are compared to the national baseline of ILI visits outside of influenza season to monitor ILI activity levels in each state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Vital statistics offices in 122 participating US cities report the total number of deaths and the number of deaths caused by pneumonia or influenza (P&#x00026;I) stratified by age groups. Statistical methods are used to calculate the weekly level of P&#x00026;I mortality above the seasonal baseline or epidemic threshold. In 2004, pediatric influenza-associated mortality for children 0&#x02013;18 years of age became a nationally notifiable condition. Influenza Hospitalization Network comprised of hospitals in over 80 counties in 14 states collects information from hospital records and reports on laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations for children and adults. The information on geographic spread of influenza activity is augmented by State and Territorial health department epidemiologists&#x02019; reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">In addition to the CDC surveillance systems, the armed forces operate the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS) to protect military personnel and their families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">30</xref>]. Respiratory Infections surveillance is one of the GEIS programs contributing to the global influenza surveillance network. The program leverages established laboratory and research facilities in host countries and collaborations with global partners. Its activities are coordinated and information regarding circulating influenza viruses, disease burden, and epidemiology is shared with CDC, WHO, and host countries. The data is also used in research and for development of vaccines and diagnostics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">31</xref>]. International influenza surveillance is accomplished through the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network collaborating centers including the CDC. Global influenza surveillance information is shared through the WHO FluNet tool and it provides advance signals of influenza activity and trends, informs selection of annual vaccine strains, and enables member countries to better prepare for upcoming influenza season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">32</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Alternative Surveillance Methods</title><p id="Par12">In addition to the active surveillance efforts, alternative methods such as syndromic surveillance, electronic patient records from emergency room or ambulatory doctor visits, and hospital discharge records have been used for surveillance of influenza and other infectious diseases with growing frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">33</xref>]. Syndromic surveillance provides clues on disease patterns collected from multiple information sources such as emergency department visits, ambulatory health-care visits, calls to health information hotlines, Internet health information seeking, and over-the-counter medication purchases. Indication of potential disease outbreak from syndromic surveillance is usually available before laboratory test results are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. ESSENCE, the Electronic Surveillance System for the Early Notification of Community-based Epidemics is an example of syndromic surveillance system implemented by the Department of Defense (DoD) to automatically download data from the electronic health records of military personnel and their families. The system captures information coded in accordance with the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) standards from over 300,000 weekly outpatient visits to US military treatment facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. It monitors disease outbreaks based on health care utilization patterns and uses ICD-9-CM codes to group diagnosis into one of the eight disease syndromes. Another national electronic surveillance system, BioSense, launched in 2003 and operated by the CDC collects and analyzes ICD-9-CM coded data from outpatient visits to health-care facilities and emergency departments, hospitalized patients, laboratory tests, and information on over-the-counter medications sold in pharmacies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">34</xref>]. Although different studies reported variable utility of syndromic disease surveillance systems for local disease outbreaks, the majority of them indicated that it was useful for monitoring respiratory disease activity and the annual influenza seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">36</xref>]. Sensitivity of ICD-9-CM based detectors of acute respiratory disease and influenza epidemics varied from 44 to 79 % for acute respiratory disease to 100 % for influenza outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">37</xref>] and specificity ranged between 96 and 97 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Sensitivity was found to be moderate and likely not sufficient to detect a small disease outbreak, e.g., in the event of a local bioterrorism incidence. However, ICD-9-CM coded data can be useful for influenza surveillance when accuracy, completeness, and timeliness are carefully considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] before using such data for decision making.</p><p id="Par13">For a comprehensive influenza surveillance system, it is critical to include hospitals that would collect epidemiological and virological information on severe cases. This data enables characterization of severe ILI, identification of at risk population groups, tracking of genetic changes in the circulating viruses, and serve as a monitoring tool for emerging pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">38</xref>]. Hospital based case series studies yield valuable information on risk factors for sever influenza during an ongoing or past influenza seasons. Although these studies can inform vaccination and therapy decisions, majority of them have a limited sample size, are recourse intensive, and the results are not generalizable on the national level. The lack of this data became especially apparent during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when the disease incidence rate was very high resulting in declaration of phase 6 pandemic while the disease severity on a national level was not ascertained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Hospital-based electronic surveillance is a cost-effective approach to identify influenza season-specific populations at high risk for ILI complications and fatal outcomes. Detailed clinical information on each individual case is coded in patients&#x02019; records and can be used to augment active surveillance in public health response planning and implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par14">Advances in information technologies enabled new global and national surveillance methods and real time information sharing among multiple stakeholders. Monitoring indicators other than the traditional information captured by health-care providers can be a cost effective approach to augment respiratory disease surveillance. Rise in purchases of over-the-counter cold medications, school absenteeism, Internet health information searches, and utilization of health advice phone lines were shown to correlate with increased influenza activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The rise in health information seeking preceded doctors&#x02019; visits by about 1 week and was also correlated with media coverage of the health concern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">39</xref>].</p><p id="Par15">An approach to influenza surveillance monitoring ILI health-seeking Internet queries was launched by Google and CDC during the 2007&#x02013;2008 influenza season. The system analyzed logs of Web searches related to ILI information and reported data with only 1 day lag instead of the usual delay of 1&#x02013;2 weeks. The accuracy of the ILI estimates was 85&#x02013;96 % as compared to the actual disease incidence reported by CDC influenza surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. A Health Map Web based data collection system was employed during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to monitor the Internet, compile, and report influenza activity in geographically diverse locations through an interactive map. Data was collected from news media, blogs, and other nontraditional sources as well as from the WHO, CDC, and the public health agency of Canada. The median lag between reported and confirmed cases ranged from 9 to 18 days with considerable variations between the countries influenced by public health infrastructure, political system restricting information, and media coverage. The nontraditional information sources may enable earlier detection of outbreaks and epidemics, expand population coverage, improve sensitivity of emerging diseases detection, and place the epidemic or pandemic in the context of the affected population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">40</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Utilization of Electronic Health Records in Influenza Research and Surveillance</title><p id="Par16">While electronic surveillance based on nonclinical data such as over-the-counter medication sales, school absenteeism, and health information seeking may provide preliminary signs of potential infection spread, prompt release of electronic health records (EHR) containing diagnosis and clinical outcomes can lead to a more informative and timely disease surveillance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Increasing utilization of patient electronic records could play an important role in attaining public health objectives and complimenting other information sources.</p><p id="Par17">Information from electronic medical records captured through surveillance platforms or stored in local or centralized databases has been used in numerous studies for monitoring disease incidence, prevalence, severity, risk factors, and medical care decisions. Analyses of electronic medical records were employed to augment the traditional approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] during respiratory seasons in the USA. Standard surveillance was not sufficient during the recent influenza 2009 H1N1 pandemic when several states, including New York [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">41</xref>], Wisconsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">42</xref>], and California [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR420">43</xref>] implemented additional information gathering methods based on electronic medical records to gain a more complete understanding of the ongoing pandemic severity. EHR-based surveillance systems such as Electronic Medical Record Support for Public Health (ESP) implemented in Ohio and Massachusetts and BioSense were successfully used for analyzing ICD-9 diagnosis codes, reporting notifiable disease cases, surveillance of ILI, identification of influenza or upper respiratory infection risk factors among hospitalized patients, and for monitoring diabetes prevalence, risk factors, and disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The results of influenza risk factor analyses based on ICD-9 coded data overall agreed with earlier observations based on primary data collected through the Emerging Infections Program during 2005&#x02013;2008 influenza seasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">44</xref>] and in Manitoba, Canada during 2009 H1N1 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">45</xref>] as well as with laboratory confirmed influenza hospitalizations reported to the CDC during the 2009 pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">47</xref>] demonstrated that optimally selected ICD-9 code groups can be used in an automated surveillance system drawing information from electronic medical records for accurate monitoring of influenza activity. In this study of the US Air Force personnel and their dependents outpatient visits the syndromic surveillance results correlated with the results of sentinel ILI surveillance conducted by the CDC. Placzek and Madoff (2011) used administrative hospital discharge records to estimate the hospitalization rates and characterize patients hospitalized with ILI during the seasonal flu epidemics and the 2009 H1N1 pandemic in Massachusetts. They evaluated two sets (&#x0201c;maximum&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;minimum&#x0201d;) of ICD-9 diagnosis codes for their relevance and accuracy in identifying influenza-associated hospitalizations and disease severity and concluded the proposed minimum ICD-9 criteria more accurately reflected the actual influenza cases. ICD-9 coded diagnosis alone or in conjunction with other electronic health data were used in monitoring of ILI severity and risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">49</xref>], and for modeling early detection of local respiratory disease outbreak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This approach was adopted for other disease surveillance, such as SARS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">50</xref>], diabetes incidence and management [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and pertussis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">51</xref>]. The study results suggest that timely ILI surveillance is feasible using ICD-9-CM coded electronic medical records and emphasized the importance of the appropriate ICD-9-CM code selection for case definition for accurate assessment of disease activity and severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par18">Current influenza surveillance systems are resource intensive and provide limited information on patients at-risk for severe influenza. To date, no study has been conducted using a large sample of electronic health records (EHR) to examine the risk factors for influenza in hospitalized patients across the USA. Larger data sets of EHRs will enable the creation of statistically significant age-specific models of influenza severity and predict more representative influenza risk factors and vulnerable groups. A recent study utilized the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) which is a repository of eight million electronic hospital discharge records from 1,000 participating hospitals in over 43 states representing approximately 20 % of all US hospitalizations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Antigenic drift due to mutations in HA and NA genes allows the virus to evade preexisting antibodies in the human immune system conferring the pathogenicity and virulence. Antigenic shift occurs when influenza viruses containing diverse HA and NA subtypes coinfect the same host, triggering a reassortment event and producing progeny with genomic segments from both parental viral subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">53</xref>].

Annual influenza-associated deaths in the USA range between 3,349 and 48,614 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">62</xref>] and, on the average, 200,000 are hospitalized due to severe disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">63</xref>]. The variations in mortality can be attributed to difference in the circulating viral types and subtypes. The average mortality rates are 2.7 times higher during the seasons when influenza A(H3N2) subtype is predominant as compared to seasons when influenza B or other influenza A subtypes are the predominantly circulating viruses. During a typical influenza season, severe illness and death occur most frequently among individuals 65 years and older (89.4 %) or children younger than 2 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">62</xref>].

The human-to-human transmission occurs in one of the three ways: direct contact with infected persons, touching object contaminated with the virus and then transferring it from hands to mucus surfaces of the nose or eyes, and inhaling virus-containing droplets produced by infected person when coughing or sneezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">67</xref>]. The efficiency of influenza transmission aerosolized in droplets depends on the size of the droplet, viral concentration, and humidity. Yang and Marr (2011) demonstrated that the concentration of infectious influenza virus in cough droplets is inversely related to the relative humidity (RH) in indoor settings, while the droplet size is directly related to relative humidity. In a dryer environment, the smaller droplets tend to stay in the air longer, infecting larger number of sensitive hosts. In a humid environment, the virus in large droplets settles on objects (fomites) and can survive for several days.

Yang and Marr (2011) suggested that the winter seasonality can be partially explained by higher concentration of droplet-suspended influenza viruses in heated buildings due to lower humidity. Other environmental factors, such as colder temperature and reduced ultraviolet radiation, are also independently associated with virus survival and seasonality. Temperature and humidity also effect the human immune system, diminishing the blood flow and leukocyte supply in low temperatures while increasing viral shedding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">69</xref>]. Lowen and Palese (2011) confirmed that cold and dry conditions facilitated viral transmission through aerosolized droplets, while warm or humid environment (30 &#x000b0;C, 80 % RH) prevented the viral spread. They proposed that seasonal pattern of influenza epidemics in temperate climate occurs due to viral transmission by aerosolized droplets, while year-round infections occur through fomites or direct contacts in tropical climate. The exception to this pattern was the 2009 spring outbreak of the swine-origin influenza A H1N1, which possibly could be explained by the increased frequency of transmission via direct contact due to the absence of human immunity to the novel antigenic strain. Variations in temperature and humidity did not affect viral spread by direct contact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">66</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Influenza pandemics are caused by novel viruses for which the world population has no immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">72</xref>].

Heart and lung disease were also frequent comorbidities with diabetes and kidney disease among the influenza case fatalities. In a dataset pooled from multiple countries in Europe, Asia, and America chronic heart disease was present in 7.1 % of all hospitalized patients with pH1N1 infection, 10.9 % of ICU admissions, and 12.1 % of deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>].</p><p id="Par44">Lung diseases were the most frequently reported chronic conditions for the 2009 H1N1 influenza case fatalities with the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) most prevalent in adults and asthma in children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">83</xref>]. Regardless of asthma severity, its prevalence tends to grow with escalating influenza disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>]. Influenza virus infection is known to exacerbate asthma and asthma is a known risk factor for influenza infection. It was the most frequently reported underlying medical condition in pediatric deaths associated with influenza A/2009 H1N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">83</xref>]. The impact of asthma may also depend on the circulating influenza viruses. In a Canadian studies of pediatric population hospitalized with influenza, children with pandemic H1N1 influenza in 2009 were significantly more likely to have asthma (22 %) than those with seasonal influenza during the 2004&#x02013;2009 seasons (6 %) although there were no difference in severity or clinical presentation of asthma between the pandemic and seasonal pediatric influenza cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">108</xref>]. Asthma was also more prevalent among the children admitted to ICU with pH1N1 and developing pH1N1-associated pneumonia compared with seasonal influenza in 2006&#x02013;2009 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">109</xref>]. Patients with chronic lung and airways diseases such as COPD are at a greater risk for severe morbidity and mortality associated with influenza infection. Evidence suggests that bacterial coinfections in COPD cases may further impact the disease severity. In a study of patients hospitalized with severe COPD in Italy, viral infection was detected in 23.4 % and viral-bacterial coinfection in 25 % of patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbation. Influenza was one of the most frequently identified infections adversely effecting lung function and extending hospital stay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">110</xref>]. Although many national guidelines recommend influenza vaccination, there is only limited evidence that vaccine is effective in COPD patients. However, some observational studies suggest that vaccine reduces both hospitalizations and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">111</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The association between diabetes Type1 and Type 2 and a greater risk for influenza associated complications may be explained by adverse impact of excessive blood glucose on immunity, as well as heart, kidney, and lung functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">112</xref>]. Influenza surveillance data in Wisconsin and New Mexico during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic indicated that diabetes was the second most frequent comorbidity following asthma and was present in 16&#x02013;20 % of hospitalized influenza cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">105</xref>]. Van Kerkhove et al. (2011) reported that diabetes was an underlying chronic condition in 9 % of influenza-associated hospitalizations and 13.6 % of cases admitted to the ICU in a sample representing 19 countries with diverse populations and health-care systems. Diabetes was present in 8 % of influenza A/H1N1 associated fatalities in England [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">113</xref>], 14.4 % fatalities in a large international sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>], and 29 % of fatalities in New Mexico [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">105</xref>]. The higher proportion of diabetes in New Mexico potentially could be due to a higher than 50 % obesity among hospitalized patients older than 18 years. Diabetes prevalence is on the rise in the USA, especially among the aging population, reaching almost 27 % prevalence among persons 65 years of age or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">114</xref>].

Persons with NNMD also may have an increased susceptibility to recurrent respiratory infection due to diminished ability to protect airways through cough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">90</xref>] and a higher risk (OR, 5.6) of influenza-related neurologic complications such as seizures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">115</xref>].</p><p id="Par47">In a study of influenza-associated pediatric deaths during the 2003&#x02013;2004 influenza season, 33 % of the children had neuromuscular or neurologic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">116</xref>]. Louie et al. (2006) further confirmed that neurologic diseases with the potential to compromise respiratory function were present in more than 25 % of severe influenza cases among children. NNMD were the most prevalent chronic diseases associated with respiratory failure in hospitalized children with laboratory-confirmed influenza diagnosis followed by chronic lung and chronic heart conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A study of pediatric deaths reported to CDC during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic showed that 43 % of case fatalities had neurologic disorders. Majority of the children also had additional comorbidities such as heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">117</xref>]. Adult patients who developed pneumonia as a consequence of influenza 2009 H1N1 infection were more than twice as likely to have a neurological disease compared to patients who had no complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">102</xref>]. Neurological disorders found among patients hospitalized due to influenza included Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, developmental delay, history of stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">102</xref>], seizures, spinal cord injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">90</xref>], neuromuscular disorders, hydrocephalus, and epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">117</xref>]. Pediatric deaths due to pandemic influenza five times exceeded the annual average number of deaths caused by seasonal influenza viruses during the five proceeding seasons. Neurologic disorders were the most frequent comorbidities found in influenza-associated pediatric deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">117</xref>] underscoring the importance of continues surveillance of disease severity and the need for timely characterization of risk factors during an ongoing influenza season.</p><p id="Par48">During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, obese individuals with body mass index (BMI) exceeding 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were at a higher risk for influenza infection; they were more likely to be hospitalized and were disproportionately represented among the patients in ICUs, those with longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital stay, and those who died compared with those who were not obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">118</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">119</xref>]. In a study of California adults the prevalence of obesity and extreme obesity among influenza cases was 1.5 and 2.8 times higher respectively than the US population average. The odds ratio (OR) for fatality among the extremely obese (BMI&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;40) patients was 2.8&#x02013;4.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">120</xref>]. These findings corroborated the results of Kwong, Campitelli, and Rosella (2011) suggesting that obese individuals were at a greater risk for hospitalization than persons with normal weight during 12 pre-pandemic influenza seasons with OR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.45 and 2.1, for individuals with BMI 30-34.9 and &#x02265;35 respectively.</p><p id="Par49">The association between obesity and infection can be explained by impaired immune response or by strain of infection on respiratory system and reduced mechanical function of lungs and airways. Obese persons consume high percentage of oxygen to maintain normal respiratory function; they have increased airway resistance and may suffer from hypoventilation and chronic inflammation of the respiratory tract altering the immune function and the ability to respond to challenges to respiratory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">119</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">120</xref>]. The role of obesity as an independent risk factor may be difficult to ascertain, especially in studies with a limited sample size, as it is often directly correlated with other underlying health conditions (e.g., diabetes and heart disease) known to increase risk for influenza infections and severe outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">118</xref>]. However, because more than 35 % of adults in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">121</xref>] and 500 million worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">122</xref>] are obese it may be a major contributor to excess morbidity and mortality associated with influenza and warrants further investigation.</p><p id="Par50">Pregnancy has been reported as a risk factor for seasonal and pandemic influenza infections and severe disease outcomes using historical and current data. About 50 % of pregnant women infected with influenza developed pneumonia during the 1918 and 1957 pandemics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">123</xref>]. Pregnancy was reported to be a risk factor for infection with influenza and severe disease outcome during the influenza A/2009 H1N1 pandemic as well. In a review of publications on 2009 H1N1 pandemic epidemiology in the Northern Hemisphere, Falagas et al. (2010) reported that 4.5&#x02013;17.4 % of hospitalized cases were pregnant women and they comprised 11.5&#x02013;18.2 % of ICU admissions. Compared to nonpregnant women diagnosed with influenza, they were seven times more likely to be hospitalized and twice more likely to have fatal outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>]. In a UK study of a population with an estimated 6 % prevalence of pregnancy, 21 % of patients hospitalized with laboratory confirmed influenza 2009 H1N1 were pregnant and the majority of them were in the second or third trimester. The case fatality rate ranged between 1 and 6 % [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The rate of respiratory hospitalizations among pregnant women in Nova Scotia during non-pandemic influenza seasons between 1990 and 2002 was almost 8 times higher for pregnant women than the year before they became pregnant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">124</xref>]. Pregnant women with comorbidities such as asthma, anemia, and heart or renal disease were at the greatest risk for influenza-associated hospitalization.</p><p id="Par51">The findings on influenza severity association with pregnancy were not consistent. In several countries as the level of disease severity increased the proportion of pregnant women diminished and the odds ratio for death among hospitalized pregnant women was &#x0003c;1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>]. Interestingly, in a study of ILI hospitalized patients during the 2007&#x02013;2010 influenza seasons, pregnancy was protective against pneumonia (OR 0.4), possibly due higher likelihood of hospitalizing pregnant women with severe respiratory infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">125</xref>]. This observation was supported by a UK study reporting that maternal outcomes were no more severe that for nonpregnant women of similar age hospitalized for influenza [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An increased susceptibility to influenza infection and severe disease among pregnant women could be partially explained by changes in immune response due to lower plasma levels of adiponectin regulating macrophage activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">119</xref>]. An additional explanation could be psychosocial changes that may occur during pregnancy such as perceived increased stress, anxiety, and negative mood which also were shown to alter the immune functions and increase the risk for respiratory tract infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">126</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Demographic Influenza Risk Factors</title><p id="Par52">In addition to clinical comorbidities demographic characteristics and socioeconomic conditions also can increase the risk for influenza infections. Close human contacts in crowded housing during the influenza season, influenza vaccine uptake in a community, awareness of influenza transmission routs, and following the non-pharmaceutical prevention practices effect influenza virus spread and attack rates in population. The risk for influenza infection may also vary in individuals from different racial/ethnic backgrounds and age groups.</p><p id="Par53">Historically, higher attack rates and more severe disease outcomes were observed among minorities since 1900s including during the 1918 influenza pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">127</xref>]. In an analysis of influenza 2009 H1N1 cases pooled from 19 countries, Van Kerkhove et al. (2011) reported that indigenous populations and minority groups were disproportionately represented among hospitalized influenza cases and fatalities in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, while in Mexico and Thailand minority groups did not carry excess disease burden. In a Canadian case&#x02013;control study of laboratory-confirmed pH1N1 cases, 37 % were represented by the First Nation residents. The odds ratio was 6.52 for the First Nation individuals being admitted to the ICU compared to other ethnic groups even when controlling for socioeconomic status, age, residency settings, comorbidities, and time to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">45</xref>]. Similar results for influenza severity were observed in the USA where the risk for pH1N1 influenza hospitalization in New Mexico was 2.6 times higher among American Indians, 1.7 times higher for Blacks, and 1.8 times higher for Hispanics compared to non-Hispanic Whites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">105</xref>]. Surveillance data from 12 states showed that the rate of mortality attributed to pH1N1 was four times higher among the American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN ) and they had the highest rate (81.0 %) of underlying health conditions than all other ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">128</xref>]. Higher proportion of pediatric hospitalizations among minorities was observed during the pre-pandemic seasons as well, including the 2000&#x02013;2001 season [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">129</xref>] and 2003&#x02013;2004 when influenza A/Fujiian was the prevalent circulating virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">116</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Although the reasons for disparities in influenza susceptibility and severity among the racial and ethnic populations are not fully identified several explanations have been proposed including socioeconomic status and resulting differences in living conditions, crowding, health behaviors, and access to medical care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">96</xref>]. Cultural differences may affect utilization of available health care or vaccination uptake. Difference in genetic susceptibility and higher prevalence of chronic conditions associated with increased risk for influenza disease severity may also impact the attack rates and the disease outcome in ethnic minority communities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>].</p><p id="Par55">Traditionally populations at the extremes of the age spectrum, young children and older adults are the most vulnerable groups during seasonal influenza epidemics while pandemics exhibit a characteristic shift towards younger adults in influenza-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">80</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">130</xref>]. Persons younger than 65 years of age accounted for a greater proportion of deaths during all three pandemics in the twentieth century as well as during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic when young adults were at an increased risk for morbidity and mortality. Age was an independent risk factor for severe disease outcomes and death. In a study of hospitalized influenza cases in Washington State the odds of ICU admission or death were 4.4 and 5.9 times greater among adults 18&#x02013;49 years and 50&#x02013;64 years of age respectively compared with children younger than 18 years when controlling for other risk factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The lower influenza incidence rate and mortality among adults over 64 years observed during pandemics could be explained by antigen recycling mechanism, a partial protection due to earlier exposure to a similar virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">65</xref>]. However, if infected, this age group had the highest mortality rate among the hospitalized patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>] potentially due to the presence of comorbidities, effect of medications, and bacterial coinfections. Explanations for severe disease among young adults included antibody-dependent enhanced infection and strong inflammatory response in the lungs leading to lung injury and ARDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Once infected with a novel influenza virus younger persons may retain long-lasting immunity better than older persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR129">130</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">During the seasonal influenza epidemics older adults and young children are usually at a higher risk for severe disease and death. The proportion of influenza-attributable deaths during the 1994&#x02013;2000 influenza seasons in Canada increased with age from 2 % in 65&#x02013;69 age group to 5 % in persons 90 years and older. The case fatality rate for influenza hospitalized patients increased from 4 to 30 % for population 50&#x02013;64 years to 90 years or older respectively and over 90 % of deaths occurred in persons older than 65 years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].

Developing immune system and absence of immunity to circulating viruses in young children and weakened immune response to vaccination among the older adults renders both groups especially susceptible to seasonal influenza infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">99</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">Although the health conditions described in this chapter contribute to influenza virus susceptibility and severity of the disease, their prevalence and impact may vary during different influenza seasons. During the 2009 influenza pandemic, only one third of the 70,000 hospitalized cases representing 19 countries had an identified chronic clinical comorbidity while approximately two thirds of hospitalized cases and 40 % of fatal cases did not have any identified preexisting disease. For the 2009 influenza pandemic, the overall difference in demographic and clinical factors between the disease severity groups and moderate disease controls suggests that age, sex, race, and all clinical conditions of interest showed overall statistically significant association with influenza severity. However, pregnancy was not associated with influenza severity for women of childbearing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

Susceptibility to influenza and severity of the disease is affected by multiple factors including characteristics of the circulating virus strain, genetics of the host, prior infection history, comorbidities, age, and environmental factors. The unpredictability of the virus&#x02013;host interactions and consequences to population&#x02019;s health underscores the need for continuous timely and informative influenza surveillance. Clinical surveillance is critical for identification of at risk population groups which also may change depending on the circulating virus as well as for monitoring the disease spread in the population and severity. Syndromic surveillance based on nonclinical indicators may contribute to a signal of epidemic spread and increase of cases. To better predict viral strains for effective vaccines and monitor novel emerging viral strains that could cause epidemics it is critical to continue and expand viral surveillance on an International level. While electronic surveillance based on nonclinical data such as over-the-counter medication sales, school absenteeism, and health information seeking may provide preliminary signs of potential infection spread, prompt release of electronic health records (EHR) containing diagnosis and clinical outcomes can lead to a more informative and timely disease surveillance. Increasing utilization of patient electronic records could play an important role in attaining public health objectives and complimenting other information sources.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>No conflict of interests.</p><p>Lone Simonsen, President of Sage Analytica, Inc., graciously donated the NIS dataset used in our research study for which we are currently preparing a manuscript of our detailed results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
