  <p>Predicted survival curves (time from first HBeAg-positive result to clearance) at ages 10, 20, and 50 years. Significant covariates included in the model are age at diagnosis of HBsAg (including a nonlinear effect), an interaction of initial recorded status of HBeAg (positive or negative) and age, and the number of HBeAg measurements recorded. The overall probability of clearing HBeAg within 10 years was 72.5 %. In those who cleared HBeAg, the median time to clearance was 5.6 years (range, &lt;1 to 29.4 years). Older carriers were significantly more likely than younger ones to clear HBeAg (
