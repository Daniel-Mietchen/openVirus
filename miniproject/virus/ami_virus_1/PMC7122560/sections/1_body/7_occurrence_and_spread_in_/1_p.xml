<p>In the broadest terms, viral propagation within an individual depends on properties such as the efficiency of spread from cell to cell, either by direct involvement of contiguous cells or by transport via body fluids to other susceptible cells; the number of cells infected; and the consequences of viral multiplication on the cell itself and on the organism as a whole. Further biochemical and physiologic details of these cellular processes are the subjects of more basic science texts. The next several sections are concerned with the occurrence and propagation of infection in populations, along with factors that influence those events.</p>
