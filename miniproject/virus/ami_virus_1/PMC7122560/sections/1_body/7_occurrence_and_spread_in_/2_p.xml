<p>Survival of human viruses depends on their long-term viability in human populations. Sustained viability, in turn, depends on the patterns of occurrence and propagation—within a host and between hosts. A virus must be capable of (1) infecting a host chronically without killing its cells; (2) infecting a host acutely and severely but escaping from the dying host cells as an intact, replicable entity in a manner that ensures its transport to a new susceptible host; or (3) infecting chronically or acutely but rapidly adapting to biological adversity such as exhaustion of susceptible hosts. Herpesviruses and other persistent viruses have evolved to establish durable relationships with their immunologically competent hosts. Arboviruses can destroy their hosts as long as the former can survive and replenish themselves in their nonhuman reservoirs and vectors. It is the viruses like influenza A and HIV, endowed with the greatest adaptability in the form of antigenic variation, that pose the greatest threat because they are not self-limited in their pathogenicity or in their dependence on favorable environmental conditions. Without its capacity for antigenic variation, influenza virus would, like measles or rubella virus, probably depend for survival on the temporal accumulation of new susceptibles. However, as noted earlier HIV has the powerful dual advantage of a retrovirus—capacity not only to vary its antigenic structure but also to establish latency for years.</p>
