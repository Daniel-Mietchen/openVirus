<p>Direct inoculation of viruses into the blood requires some object sharp enough to penetrate the skin and the wall of a blood vessel. That can happen naturally through the bite of an arthropod vector (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec20" ref-type="sec">8.1.7</xref>) or iatrogenically through an injection, either with an inadvertently contaminated needle (e.g., by an injection drug user or in medical practice) or for administration of medicinal blood products (e.g., a transfusion). The agents best known for transmission by this route include hepatitis viruses (HBV, HCV, and HDV), retroviruses (HIV and HTLV), and herpesviruses (EBV, CMV). The mechanism of transmission for each of these viruses is similarly straightforward, with the likelihood of infection dependent on a combination of the intrinsic viral properties described above (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref>), the delivery mechanics, and the dose or the size of the inoculum delivered.
