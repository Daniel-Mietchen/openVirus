<p>The major enteric viruses are enteroviruses, rotaviruses, and calici-, polio-, echo-, and coxsackieviruses, along with HAV and HEV. Adenoviruses and reoviruses also multiply in and shed from the intestinal tract, but this route of transmission is not usually of epidemiologic importance. Despite their name, although enteroviruses multiply in cells lining the gastrointestinal tract, they rarely produce local disease there; they rather target the central nervous system and skin and produce their major symptoms and pathology in those organs. Likewise, hepatitis A and E viruses attack the liver, not enteric mucosal cells.</p>
