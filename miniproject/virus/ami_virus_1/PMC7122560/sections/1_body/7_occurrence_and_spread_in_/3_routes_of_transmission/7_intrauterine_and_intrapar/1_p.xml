<p>Viruses may infect the fetus either by direct contact via the birth canal or by hematogenous spread via the placenta to the fetus within the uterus. Herpes simplex virus and CMV infections can initiate intrauterine infection by more direct local contact, whereas CMV, hepatitis B, rubella, varicella, and HIV all infect the placenta by the hematogenous route. CMV is the most common congenital infection, whereas congenital rubella has sharply declined wherever vaccination has become routine. Acquisition of EBV or HBV in the early postnatal period is associated with persistence of infection and substantially increased risk of subsequent cancer (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_32, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_34, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_40 and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_41).</p>
