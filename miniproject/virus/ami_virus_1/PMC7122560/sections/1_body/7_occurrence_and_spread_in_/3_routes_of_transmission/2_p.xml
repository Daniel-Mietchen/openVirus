<p>Some viruses are released from cells at the end of the cycle of multiplication. Others do not complete this cycle (incomplete viruses), and some are less effective at escaping (e.g., vaccinia). Many viruses are released from cells by budding, acquiring a lipoprotein coat or envelope as they go through the cell membrane; these include herpesviruses, togaviruses, myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and coronaviruses. Nonenveloped viruses not released by budding are the adenoviruses, parvoviruses, poxviruses, picornaviruses, and reoviruses. Some of these latter are released by cell lysis. Once released, viruses find their way to new hosts via one or more portals such as the respiratory tract (influenza, adenoviruses, RSV), skin (VZV and smallpox virus), blood (HIV, HTLV-I and HTLV-II, HBV, HCV, and arboviruses), gastrointestinal tract (enteroviruses, noroviruses, caliciviruses), genital tract (HIV, HTLV-I, HSV-2, and HPV), and placenta (rubella, HIV, CMV, HSV-1, and HSV-2). A more detailed presentation of these major routes of spread follows.</p>
