<p>Various other factors that affect airborne transmission of respiratory viruses include the intensity and method of propulsion of discharges from the mouth and nose, the size of the aerosol droplets created, and the resistance to desiccation. Much of the early work on the transmission of respiratory viruses was done by Knight and his group [

Direct transmission of infection occurs via personal contact such as kissing, touching of contaminated objects (hands, handkerchiefs, soft drink bottles), and direct impingement of large droplets produced by coughing or sneezing. These last two behaviors are regarded as personal contact because of the short range of the heavy droplets formed.
