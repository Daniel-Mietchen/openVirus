<p>Direct penetration of intact skin is a less common route of viral entry, and when it occurs, the viruses are usually carried in fluid or some other vehicle. Human papillomaviruses, the agents causing warts, enter through abraded skin and anogenital epithelium; prions, the agents of kuru, may also gain access that way. With rabies, viral penetration of the skin invariably involves an animal bite or some other source of contaminated biological fluid.</p>
