<p>Aerosolization of certain viral agents may occur from suction devices and from catheters in intensive care units and from blood products in dialysis units. These include not only respiratory and intestinal agents but also agents such as HBV that circulate cell-free in the blood and cell-associated viruses such as CMV, EBV, HIV, and HTLV-1. Viruses aerosolized from urine or fecal material can be inhaled; hantavirus and arenaviruses are examples of agents that may be spread by aerosols created from soil containing the rodent urine or feces in which those viruses are excreted.</p>
