<p>High concentrations of particles of rhinovirus (and other viruses, including influenza) on fingers, hands, and hard surfaces indicate that infection via hands may be at least as important a route of spread as aerosols containing lower concentrations. This is supported by the continual inadvertent contact of hands with the nose or eyes [
