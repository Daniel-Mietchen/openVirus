<p>They also create aerosols varying in size up to &gt;20 μm that permit transmission of infection at a distance. Dispersion of an aerosol depends on air currents and on particle size. In still air, a spherical particle with a unit density of 100-μm diameter requires 10 s to fall the height of the average room (3 m), and 40-μm particles require 1 min, 20-μm particles 4 min, and 10-μm particles 17 min. This means that particles under 10 μm have a relatively long circulation time in the ordinary room. Particles 6–10 μm or larger in diameter are more readily trapped upon direct impact in the nose and nasopharynx. Further into the airway, flow diminishes to the point where smaller particles 0.5–5 μm in diameter settle on the tracheal and bronchial walls by sedimentation, and particles of 0.5 μm in diameter or smaller can enter and deposit in the alveoli. As infectious secretions are discharged in large numbers by coughing or sneezing, the initially hygroscopic particles of 1.5-μm diameter lose moisture and shrink in ambient air and then regain their original dimensions from the saturated air as they are again deposited in the respiratory tract. Of course, virus particles in an aerosol may not necessarily settle at a level in the respiratory tree with the optimally susceptible cells for that agent.</p>
