<p>Viruses can directly infect susceptible cells of the oropharynx, but to induce intestinal infection, virus-containing material must be swallowed, successfully resist the hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the bile acids in the duodenum, and access susceptible cells in the intestine. Viruses with envelopes do not normally survive exposure to these acids, salts, and enzymes in the gut.</p>
