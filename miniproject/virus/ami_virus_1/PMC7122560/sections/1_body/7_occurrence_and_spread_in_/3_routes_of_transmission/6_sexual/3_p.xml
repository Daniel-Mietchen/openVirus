<p>The presence of other genital infections has been shown in repeated studies to predispose to transmission of HIV-1 by the HIV-1-infected partner and acquisition of HIV-1 by the susceptible partner. Most epidemiologic data indicate that the ulcerative lesions of syphilis, chancroid, and HSV-2 infection mechanically facilitate penetration of the epithelial barriers of the genital tract by HIV [

However, suggestions of predisposition by non-ulcerative infections like gonorrhea, chlamydiasis, trichomoniasis, and bacterial vaginosis are consistent with an alternative to enhanced epithelial penetration, namely, recruitment and activation of macrophages and other inflammatory cells responsive to the mucosal breach (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_43).
