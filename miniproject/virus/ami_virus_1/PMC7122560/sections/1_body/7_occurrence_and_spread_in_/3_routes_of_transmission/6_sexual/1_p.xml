<p>The genital tract serves as a portal of both entry and exit for viruses that infect the genital tissues themselves and more remote target organs. It is also the source of intrapartum infection as the fetus passes through the birth canal. Herpes simplex types 1 and 2 cause ulcerative lesions of the anal and genital mucosa and the surrounding skin. Sexual transmission of these viruses can produce oropharyngeal lesions as well. These and other viruses (most frequently, CMV, HIV, HBV, and HPV) can also be transmitted to their target cells in the anogenital epithelial layer (HPV), in nearby subepithelial lymphoid system (HIV and CMV), or in remote hepatic tissues (HBV). Receptive anal intercourse is a particularly important method of spread of these infections. Three of these four viruses (CMV, HIV, and HBV) along with rubella virus are present in cervicovaginal secretions and can infect infants perinatally (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">8.1.5</xref>). Finally certain types of HPV, principally 16 and 18, cause a substantial proportion of cervical infection leading to a spectrum of mucosal abnormalities including cervical cancer.
