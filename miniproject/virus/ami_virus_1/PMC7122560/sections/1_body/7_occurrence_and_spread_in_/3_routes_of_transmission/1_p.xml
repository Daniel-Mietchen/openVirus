<p>The major routes of transmission of selected viral infections are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">1.6</xref>. Viruses that have several alternate routes have an increased chance of infection. The sequence of events in transmission involves release of the virus from the cell, exit from the body, transport through the environment in a viable form, and appropriate entry into a susceptible host.
