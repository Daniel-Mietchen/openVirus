<p>The skin serves as a portal of exit for those few viruses that produce skin vesicles or pox lesions that release infectious particles on rupture. These include herpes simplex, smallpox, varicella zoster, and vaccinia viruses. The viruses of certain maculopapular exanthems may also be present in the skin, as in rubella, but this does not seem to be an important avenue of escape, since vesicles are not formed and skin involvement occurs late in the disease, when the virus may be bound by antibody; indeed, the antigenâ€“antibody complex may be responsible for the rash itself.</p>
