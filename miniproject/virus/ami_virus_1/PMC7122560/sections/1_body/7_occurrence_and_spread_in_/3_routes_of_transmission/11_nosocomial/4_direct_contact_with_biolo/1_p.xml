<p>Transmission of cutaneous and mucosal viral infections in health-care settings by direct contact is not especially common (VZV, HPV, HSV). Although viruses naturally transmitted through the skin following bites (rabies, in particular) rarely propagate that way in hospital settings, contact by personnel with tissue, saliva, and other secretions from transplant patients infected with rabies virus has led to serious consequences [

These incidents have prompted the transplantation community to adopt exacting protocols for excluding organs and tissue that may be infected with potentially harmful viruses. Lassa fever, Ebola, and Marburg viruses have often been transmitted as nosocomial infections [
