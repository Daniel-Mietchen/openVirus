<p>For viruses spread by enteric routes, environmental control is much more effective than for those transmitted by the respiratory route. Thus, good personal hygiene, especially washing of hands after defecation, proper cleanliness and cooking of food, pasteurization of milk, good waste disposal, and purification of drinking water supplies have all proved to be effective preventive measures. On the other hand, some enteroviruses may also multiply in the respiratory tract and be transmitted by the respiratory route; therefore, this alternate pathway is of epidemiologic importance even in the face of good personal and environmental hygiene.</p>
