<p>Agents excreted via the gastrointestinal tract must successfully infect other susceptible persons via fecally contaminated hands, food, water, milk, thermometers, insects, or other vehicles. Both HAV and HEV are stable viruses in water and, when present in sufficient dosage, may not be inactivated by ordinary levels of chlorine. Outbreaks of viral hepatitis have occurred from sewage-contaminated water, as in the huge outbreaks in New Delhi, India, in 1955 [

Furthermore, HAV, at least, can persist over long periods in oysters and clams obtained from fecally contaminated waters. Milk and water have also served as vehicles of transmission of other viral agents: caliciviruses and poliomyelitis viruses. This is especially hazardous because these foods are so often eaten without having been cooked. Hepatitis viruses and the enteroviruses also flourish in certain institutional settings (mental hospitals, institutions for retarded children, some prisons) and in countries where personal hygiene is lacking or difficult to practice or where poor environmental control is present.
