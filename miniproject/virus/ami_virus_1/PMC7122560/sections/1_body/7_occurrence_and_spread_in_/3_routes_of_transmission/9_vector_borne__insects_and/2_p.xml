<p>A range of mammals (dogs, bats, raccoons, skunks, foxes, and others) carry rabies virus in their tissues and bodily fluids including saliva. They can transmit to a human during a bite, with the likelihood of transmission varying according to several factors: the mammalian species, the level of viremia, the duration of its infection, the nature and location of the bite, and others. Bats may also transmit henipaviruses and coronaviruses. Rodent species can also carry and transmit viruses in their urine or feces. Examples of rodent transmission include hantaviruses and Lassa fever virus. The viruses transmitted by vectors can vary greatly in their host range from a fairly high degree of species specificity (as with dengue in 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> or Lassa fever virus in one or possibly more closely related rat species) to a much broader range (as with rabies in a number of different mammalian families).
