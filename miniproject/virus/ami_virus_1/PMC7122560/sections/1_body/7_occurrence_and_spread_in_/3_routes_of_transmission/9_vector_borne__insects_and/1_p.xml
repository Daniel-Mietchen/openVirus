<p>Humans may be primary or incidental hosts for numerous vector-borne viral infections. They may be transmitted through direct injection by mosquitos, ticks, flies, and other arthropods; they may also be spread directly through saliva during the bite of larger mammal; or they may be spread more indirectly through aerosolization of urine from a rodent. For some viruses, their life cycle involves multiplication in their vector. In many arboviral infections, virus acquired from the human or animal host during viremia requires a period of multiplication in the vector before it is infectious. Examples of this include the transmission of yellow fever virus by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitos and of the seasonally epidemic St. Louis, California, and equine encephalitis viruses. The vector life cycles can be complex, including overwinter survival with transovarian or sexual transmission within mosquito populations.
