<p>For some of these illnesses, the explanation is obviousâ€”rising incidence in summer parallels the resurgence of the vector population (e.g., for mosquito-borne encephalitis viruses, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1.3</xref>, Panel a) or the return of favorable conditions for replication (e.g., for enteric viruses) during warmer weather. For others (many respiratory infections), the conventional explanation is that increases in the winter reflect a combination of environmental factors (temperature and humidity) that both directly enhance the viral replication and transmissibility and indirectly lead to more conducive host behavior (more time spent indoors under artificial conditions of heat and ventilation). For a number of the diseases where vaccines have been effective at radically decreasing the incidence, the seasonality is barely or no longer discernible.
