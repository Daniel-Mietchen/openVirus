<p>Of recent, an increasing concern is a possible deliberate introduction of an agent capable of spreading mass illness and death. The leading viral candidates for use in an attack of bioterrorism (i.e., those causing smallpox, hemorrhagic fevers, arboviral encephalitis, or a severe pulmonary syndrome) are those for which the target population has little or no immunity. To be effective as an agent of bioterrorism, the proportion of susceptibles to infection with the candidate would need to be high, and the pattern and magnitude of the ensuing epidemic would therefore be particularly difficult to predict.</p>
