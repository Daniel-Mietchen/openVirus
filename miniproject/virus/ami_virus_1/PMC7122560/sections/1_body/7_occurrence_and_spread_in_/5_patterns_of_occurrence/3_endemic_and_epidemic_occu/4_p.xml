<p>A critical characteristic of populations that strongly influences its experience with infectious diseases in general and the occurrence of an epidemic in particular is 
 <italic>herd immunity</italic>. The herd immunity level is the cumulative proportion of persons immune to a given disease within a community. This proportion is, in turn, highly dependent on such variables as the probability of contact between a source of infection and the susceptible person, the portal of entry accessible, the contagiousness of the agent, and the degree of individual host immunity (all of which are often quantitatively summarized as the 
 <italic>basic reproduction number</italic> (
 <italic>or ratio</italic>)). The term refers to the average number of new cases of infection transmitted by an index case during its interval of infectivity (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_5) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">135</xref>]. High prevalence of protective antibody to a virus among persons in a given community makes an outbreak with that virus most unlikely. Herd immunity to highly communicable infections such as measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza appear to require levels of antibody at least 75 % and even as high as 94 % to be effective (Table
