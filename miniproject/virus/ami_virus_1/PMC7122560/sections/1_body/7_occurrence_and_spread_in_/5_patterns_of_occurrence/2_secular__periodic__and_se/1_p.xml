<p>Secular trends in occurrence with no obvious periodicity have been observed over longer intervals than a single year. Numbers may rise or fall depending on natural factors. Short- or long-lived climate changes can alter the balance of vector and host populations, leading to significant increases or decreases in incident arboviral infections. Local populations experience gradually declining rates of a particular strain of respiratory virus as population-level immunity develops following repeated exposures.</p>
