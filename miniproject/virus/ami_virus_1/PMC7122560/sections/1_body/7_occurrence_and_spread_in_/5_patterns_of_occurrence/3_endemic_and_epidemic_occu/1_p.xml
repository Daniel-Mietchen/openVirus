<p>Infection and infectious diseases occur in populations in different patterns. Incidence rates may be constant or may show seasonal or secular trends. When the pattern of a given condition is stable or constant over a period of years, it is usually considered 
 <italic>endemic</italic>. A number of chronic viral infections have affected certain populations in more or less the same pattern for decades; although their patterns may be distinctive in different subgroups, infections with herpesviruses, like cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and HHV-6, have largely remained endemic. Some could even be considered 
 <italic>holoendemic</italic>—affecting entire populations, nearly universally and more severely in childhood and less so in older individuals. In contrast, an 
 <italic>epidemic</italic> or outbreak of disease is recognized as the occurrence of cases in excess of the number expected for a population based on its past experience. The definition of “excess” is an arbitrary one and depends on the relative concentration of recent and previous cases in the place, time period, and population group of interest. In a country or region where a naturally occurring disease has not been seen for years, a few instances (e.g., encephalitis cases in summer) or even a single case (e.g., of poliomyelitis anywhere in the Western Hemisphere or Japanese B encephalitis in a country where none has been documented for years) could be deemed an epidemic. On the other hand, a large and rising number of cases of winter respiratory illness (e.g., due to the introduction of a new influenza strain) may signify normal seasonal fluctuation. For that pattern to be declared an epidemic usually requires application of more sophisticated criteria (i.e., deaths from influenza and pneumonia in 122 cities exceeding established threshold based on a 5-year average), for example, with the 2012–2013 season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1.3</xref> Panel b). When several continents are involved, as is the case with the global distribution of HIV/AIDS, the disease is said to be 
 <italic>pandemic</italic>.
