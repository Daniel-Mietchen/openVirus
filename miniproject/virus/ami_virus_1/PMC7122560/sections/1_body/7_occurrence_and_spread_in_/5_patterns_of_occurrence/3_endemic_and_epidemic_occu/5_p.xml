<p>In an open college community, a preexisting level of immunity to rubella of 75 % failed to prevent an outbreak of this disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">141</xref>]. In a rubella outbreak among military recruits with a 95 % level of immunity, 100 % of the susceptibles were infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">142</xref>]. Close and prolonged contact is apparently extraordinarily efficient at spreading infection. Other principles are also worth emphasizing: (1) the concept of herd immunity is even less valid where several strains of virus exist and cross protection is not complete; (2) even the identical strain of virus that does not naturally confer complete immunity (e.g., certain herpesviruses) may reinfect; (3) reactivation of latent infection may produce disease, especially in immunocompromised hosts; and (4) the presence of antibody in the forms usually measured for such persistent viruses as HIV or hepatitis C indicates that humoral immunity is incomplete at best.
