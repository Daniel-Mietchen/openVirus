<p>Other factors, natural or human in origin, may produce periodic fluctuations that are not strictly seasonal because they do not recur each year at the same time. In the absence of high levels of vaccination, herd immunity to a disease like measles may produce periodic but not strictly seasonal waves of new cases every 2â€“4 years depending on how fast new susceptibles are introduced into a population (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec38" ref-type="sec">8.3.2</xref>). Human migration may account for periodicity that is predictable but might not occur every year in the same season.
