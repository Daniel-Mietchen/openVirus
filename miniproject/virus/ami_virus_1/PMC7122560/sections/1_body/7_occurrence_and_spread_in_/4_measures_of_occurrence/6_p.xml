 <italic>Prevalence</italic> is the number of persons with infection or cases of disease existing at a designated time or in a time interval. The 
 <italic>prevalence rate</italic> is the number of such cases divided by the population at risk. The time period involved may be a given instant of time (point prevalence) or a fixed period such as a year (period prevalence). The term 
 <italic>period prevalence</italic> thereby incorporates both the number of new (incident) cases and the duration of illness (number of old cases persisting from the previous reporting period). It is used most commonly for chronic diseases.
