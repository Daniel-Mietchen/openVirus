 <italic>Incidence</italic> is the number of new events (e.g., instances of infection or cases of disease) occurring in some time interval. Generally, the 
 <italic>incidence rate</italic> is the number of new events divided by the number of people at risk. The incidence rate may be expressed more specifically as the number of events per unit of population per unit of time or as the number of events in a fixed total population during a fixed total time period. The latter is considered a cumulative incidence but is often called an “attack rate” in an epidemic setting, where the total time period under consideration is established by the circumstances.
