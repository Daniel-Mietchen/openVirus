<p>In public health practice, the populations at risk or infected can only be estimated with variable degrees of accuracy depending on the circumstances. Evidence of prior infection is often not available. Commonly, the best estimate possible is simply the total population present during a particular time interval within the geographic area or physical space (e.g., hospital) encompassed by the detection or reporting system. Public health agencies generally tabulate statistics for infection or disease in the form of annual rates.</p>
