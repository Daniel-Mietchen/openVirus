<p>It should be clear that the number of new (incident) cases and the number of existing (prevalent) cases are related to each other. More specifically, the prevalence of infection or disease is determined by the duration of incident cases: the longer the duration of an incident condition, the higher the number of prevalent cases of that condition. That proportionality can be represented as prevalence = incidence × duration. More strictly speaking, the term in the equation should be average duration, which may vary considerably for more chronic infections. Two corollaries of this relationship are that the prevalence of acute self-limiting illnesses of short duration would closely mirror the incidence, and the more variable the duration of the condition, the less reliable the relationship in a particular population may be.</p>
