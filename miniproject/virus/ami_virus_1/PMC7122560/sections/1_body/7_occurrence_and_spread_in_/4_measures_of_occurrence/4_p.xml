<p>Mortality can be thought of as the incidence of death. In calculating mortality, because the number with infection is seldom known, the total population is customarily used as the denominator, even though that rate generally underestimates the actual rate of death due to a specific viral infection. The case fatality ratio, another measure of the deadliness of an infection, is the proportion of all persons with cases who have died.</p>
