<p>Prevalence of infection is usually measured by a test for the presence of a substance (e.g., antibody, antigen, fragment of nucleic acid, or other component) in biological fluid or tissue samples from a given population at the time of their collection. In calculating a prevalence, the denominator consists of persons whose samples were tested. For viral infections, the prevalence of antibody (i.e., seroprevalence) represents the cumulative rate of infection with the agent over recent and some years past depending on the persistence of the antibody. For neutralizing or other long-lasting antibody, it reflects the cumulative or lifetime experience with that agent. If the antibody measured is present only transiently, as is often true of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody, then its prevalence indicates infection acquired within a recent period and may even approximate incidence. As with antibody, the detection of nucleic acid could signify either recent or more persistent infection, depending on the natural history of the infection. In calculating a viral disease prevalence, the denominator is usually all individuals in the total population.</p>
