<p>In the public health context, incidence may refer to new infections or new cases of disease. In the past, 
 <italic>incident infection</italic> was usually documented by isolation or pathologic visualization of newly acquired virus or by an assay for seroconversionâ€”the appearance of new specific antibody or a defined increase in the titer or concentration of preexisting antibody; occasionally, new infection would be recognized by a change in the concentration of a specific biomarker like an enzyme. In the current molecular era, a variety of techniques for detecting viral nucleic acid are being used to establish newly acquired infection (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_2). In calculating an infection incidence rate, the denominator would ideally consist of all individuals in a population considered to be both exposed to the agent and susceptible (i.e., lack antibody or other evidence of prior infection).
