<p>In addition to the viruses that produce acute infections, there are delayed effects of certain common viruses in which the “incubation period” represents a true or apparent interval of “latency” lasting several to many years, during which there is little if any viral replication. Examples include the relationship of measles virus to subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, in which infection in infancy may be associated with involvement of the CNS some 5–10 years later [

Rarely, reactivation occurs later in life in the form of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy. This phenomenon is seen in patients with Hodgkin’s disease in association with depression of cell-mediated immunity and more recently in AIDS patients [
