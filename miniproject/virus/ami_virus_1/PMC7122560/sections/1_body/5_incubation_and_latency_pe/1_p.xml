<p>The interval of time between the sufficient exposure and the appearance of the first symptoms in the human host is the intrinsic 
 <italic>incubation period</italic>. Viruses transmitted by arthropods or other animals have their own (extrinsic) incubation periods that vary with both the response within the animal and the external environmental factors that affect the animal populations. However, here the reference is only to the intrinsic incubation period. The variation in this interval in different diseases is considerable (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1.1</xref>). Viruses that do not require distant spread but are able to produce disease through multiplication at the site of implantation, such as the respiratory tract, tend to have short incubation periods on the order of 2–5 days. Arthropod-borne viral infections like dengue and yellow fever may have onsets as early as 2–3 days after a mosquito bite [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Viruses that require hematogenous spread and involve distant target organs such as the skin or CNS have incubation periods of 2–3 weeks. Rabies virus, dependent on spread along nerves, has a long and variable incubation period ranging from 8 days to a year or more. Of course, transmission of the prion-associated kuru is exceptional with onset documented as long 34–56 years after exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In some diseases (e.g., poliomyelitis, dengue, hepatitis, and infectious mononucleosis), early symptoms or even a rash may accompany the period of initial invasion or viremia. With these infections an early phase may not be clinically recognized or occurs before the patient seeks medical care.
