<p>Knowledge of incubation periods has many practical uses. Epidemiologically, the former helps define the period of infectiousness: a patient is not usually infectious until close to the time of the appearance of clinical symptoms. In epidemics, knowledge of the mean, minimum, and maximum intrinsic incubation periods can be used to identify the probable time of exposure to the index case or other source of infection. The duration of infectivity depends on the persistence of the virus and its exit into the environment. Clinically, the duration of the incubation period helps to identify the likelihood of viral exanthem after a known exposure or to differentiate hepatitis A from hepatitis B infections. For prophylaxis, it determines the feasibility of prevention of the clinical illness by immunoglobulin, as in hepatitis A and varicella zoster infections, rubella, and rabies, as well as the potential success of postexposure rabies vaccination.</p>
