<p>With HIV infection, a primary clinical response may occur within the first 2 months or so after infection in a substantial proportion of newly infected persons (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">7.1</xref> and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_43). During the subsequent clinically quiescent period, CD4 lymphocytes are destroyed at highly variable rates. Accordingly, clinical latency continues until immunosuppression is significant enough to permit new opportunistic pathogens to superinfect or long-latent agents to reactivate and produce clinical disease. The average time from initial HIV infection to that clinical event may be shorter or longer depending not only on the degree of viral control and immunosuppression under host genetic influence but also on the other cofactors required for any specific clinical AIDS outcome. For example, Kaposiâ€™s sarcoma tends to occur at a somewhat earlier stage of immunosuppression than cerebral atrophy with dementia or lymphoma for reasons presumably related to the unknown determinants of these conditions. Besides differences in the properties of the virus itself, such as the capacity to penetrate cells or induce syncytium formation in vitro, the route of transmission and host factors determine the rate of progression of HIV infection. The average AIDS-free interval is shorter for infants and children and for recipients of large volumes of blood products. The interval is longest among the youngest adults and then gradually shorter with increasing age [
