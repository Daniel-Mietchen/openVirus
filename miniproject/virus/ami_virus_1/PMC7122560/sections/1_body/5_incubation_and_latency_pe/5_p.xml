<p>As with HIV infection, the latency period for different outcomes of HTLV-I varies. The interval between presumed infection via breast milk and onset of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma differs from the interval between presumed sexual transmission and onset of tropical spastic paraparesis or myelopathy. The concept of a latency period is also applicable to long-delayed virus-induced cancer as seen with an EBV-induced nasopharyngeal carcinoma KSHV-induced Kaposi sarcoma, HBV- and HCV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma, and HPV-induced cervical carcinoma (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_34, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_39, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_40, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_41, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_44, and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_45). In kuru, the latency period from exposure by ingestion of infected brain or other tissues or by absorption via abraded skin at a cannibalistic feast to the onset of disease can actually be as long as several decades (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_47) [
