<p>Herpes simplex virus infections occur quite variably among pregnant women in different geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic subpopulations. Infection in infants is almost always complicated by mucocutaneous (skin, eye, and mouth) lesions (75 %), encephalitis (57 %), pneumonia (18 %), or disseminated infection with combinations of the three (30 %). Prompt recognition is important because antiviral therapy is often effective in reducing morbidity. Estimates of incidence come from multiple sources. An early study from a single location found a frequency of 1 per 1,500 live births [
