<p>Multiple viral agents are involved as causes of the syndromes of inflammation of the spinal cord (aseptic meningitis) and the brain (encephalitis) or a combination (meningoencephalitis). Comprehensive reviews of these infections can be found in Refs. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">57</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">59</xref>]. The clinical features of these syndromes are quite variable, from mild headache and/or stiff neck with or without fever and subtle changes in cortical function (i.e., orientation, wakefulness, concentration, etc.) to more profound manifestations of spinal cord or brain dysfunction (including cranial nerve abnormalities; compromise of critical brain stem function; confusion, irritability, and poor feeding in very young children; and seizures). In younger children, long-term complications may include hydrocephalus, vision and hearing loss, weakness or paralysis, cranial nerve deficits, and learning and behavior problems.
