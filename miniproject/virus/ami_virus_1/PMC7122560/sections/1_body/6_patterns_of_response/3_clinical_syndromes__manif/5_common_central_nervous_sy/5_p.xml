<p>As with meningitis, accurate international estimates of the incidence of encephalitis are unreliable, but epidemic disease patterns similar to those in the United States occur throughout the world. For example, in a 1995 outbreak of Venezuelan equine encephalitis in Colombia and Venezuela, of the 75,000 humans estimated to have developed infection, neuroinvasive disease occurred in about 3,000, and 300 people died. Recently, henipaviruses in the paramyxovirus family have accounted for clusters of encephalitis and related neurologic disease in Australia along with Malaysia and Singapore (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_22).</p>
