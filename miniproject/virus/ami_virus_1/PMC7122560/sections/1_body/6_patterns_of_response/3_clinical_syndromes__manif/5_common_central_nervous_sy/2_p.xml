<p>The annual incidence of aseptic meningitis in the United States from all causes is approximately 11 in 100,000 persons, leading to 25,000â€“50,000 hospitalizations, mostly in children. However, many more mild and unconfirmed cases must go unreported. Again, the distribution of etiologic agents varies strongly with age, geography, and availability of vaccines.</p>
