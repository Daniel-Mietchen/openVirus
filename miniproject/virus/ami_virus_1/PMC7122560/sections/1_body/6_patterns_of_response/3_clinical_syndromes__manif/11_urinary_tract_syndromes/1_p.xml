<p>Acute hemorrhagic cystitis is the most prominent abnormality of the urinary tract caused by viruses. When the bladder inflammation is caused by the principal etiologic agents in children (adenoviruses, particularly serotypes 11 and 21 of subgroup B), hematuria may be recognized along with pain or burning, but the condition is often less symptomatic. Another possible viral etiology of a urinary tract syndrome (manifested as renal tubular damage) is BK virus, which, like other polyomavirus-related infections, tends to be pathogenic primarily in immunosuppressed patients.</p>
