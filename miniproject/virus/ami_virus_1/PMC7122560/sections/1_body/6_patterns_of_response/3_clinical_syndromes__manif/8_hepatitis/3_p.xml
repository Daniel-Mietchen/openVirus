<p>The three others (HBV, HCV, and HDV) have strikingly different clinical patterns. Both HBV and HCV may produce a range of symptoms including an acute syndrome much like that of HAV and HEV. However, a small proportion of HBV and the majority of HCV infections become chronic and often lifelong. In their chronic forms both infections may remain essentially quiescent for a lifetime or progress at quite variable rates to chronic inflammation and cirrhosis, with or without symptoms along the way, and both are responsible in some proportion for virus-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_32, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_33, and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_34). Of the approximately two billion persons with HBV infection worldwide, 240 million have some degree of persistent infection of the liver, and 600,000 succumb to the sequelae [

Highly effective transmission by the parenteral, sexual, and perinatal routes accounts for the ubiquitous distribution of hepatitis B with particularly high prevalence in Asia. Until the introduction of vaccine, high prevalence in childbearing adults who transmitted the infection perinatally translated to high rates of chronic childhood infection and perpetuated the cycle. Throughout the world and in proportion to their representation in each population, hepatitis B has affected injection drug users (IDUs), recipients of contaminated blood products, those exposed to contaminated medical equipment, and men who have sex with men.
