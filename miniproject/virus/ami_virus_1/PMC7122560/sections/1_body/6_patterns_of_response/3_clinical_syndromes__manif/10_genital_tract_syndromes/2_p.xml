<p>The two major manifestations of HPV infection are genital warts and squamous cell neoplasia. HPV types 6 and 11 and less frequently other types are responsible for genital warts (condyloma acuminata) on epithelial surfaces in the genital and anal area. The annual incidence of new cases of genital warts in the United States is about 360,000 persons [

HPV types 16 and 18 and less frequently other types cause a spectrum of cervical and vaginal cytological abnormalities that are largely benign but in diminishing proportions may progress to higher-grade neoplasia and culminate in invasive cervical carcinoma in a minority of women carrying those specific types. Annually worldwide, HPV causes about 500,000 cases of cervical cancer and ten million additional cases of premalignant neoplasia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">87</xref>]. About 80 % of the cases and deaths occur in the developing world. The invasive cancer has a 50 % case fatality ratio. Analogous pathologic processes lead to anal and penile carcinoma, largely in men who have sex with men. The incidence rates of these cancers appear to be considerably lower than rates of cervical cancer in the same population [
