<p>Prior to the introduction of an effective vaccine, rotavirus infections were the leading cause of diarrheal illness in children under 2 years of age in the United States and many well-developed countries. The toll is still great in children under 5 years old in a number of places throughout the world, where it may account for as much as 30 % of mortality due to diarrheal disease [

Caliciviruses and particularly the most notorious member of that family, norovirus, are now the leading cause of gastroenteritis among adults in the United States; these infections often occur in epidemic form as “winter vomiting disease” and are responsible for more than 90 % of outbreaks [
