<p>The risk of perinatal HBV infection is primarily that of transmission of the virus from mothers who are chronically infected (i.e., HBsAg carriers). Although infection is not teratogenic and the reported impact on gestational age or birth weight must be quite infrequent [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">76</xref>], there are adverse consequences for the infected neonate who receives no immunoprophylaxis. About 5â€“8 % become hepatitis B surface antigen carriers during the first 6 months of life. Moreover, young adults infected in infancy are far more likely than those not infected until later to manifest not only persistent antigenemia but cirrhosis and, after an even longer latency period, hepatocellular carcinoma. Rates of infection in pregnant women show great geographic variation. Congenital and intrapartum HBV infection transmitted by maternal carriers has long been considerably more common in Asia and Africa than in Europe and the Western Hemisphere and has remained so. The pattern is changing in some places and will continue to do so wherever infant vaccination has been used routinely for more than two decades, and the earliest universally vaccinated birth cohorts are well into their childbearing years.
