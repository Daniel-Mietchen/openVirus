<p>It is important to note that in recent years newer sample collection approaches, rapid immunologic assays, and highly sensitive molecular techniques have gradually supplemented and, in certain cases, supplanted the more traditional virologic and serologic tests, but they have come into use unevenly in different places (10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_2).
