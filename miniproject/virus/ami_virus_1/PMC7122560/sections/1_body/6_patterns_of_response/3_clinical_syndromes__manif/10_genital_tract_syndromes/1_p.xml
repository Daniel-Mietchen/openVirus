<p>Two families of viruses, HSV-1 and HSV-2, and several subtypes of HPV are common causes of conditions of the genital tract. Both HSV types can produce a spectrum of features ranging from no or minimal symptoms to an episode of fever; headache; myalgia; regional adenopathy; painful, tender blisters and ulceration on the epithelial surfaces of the genital organs and adjacent areas, including the anus and rectum; and dysuria. Small proportions of infected persons develop complications such as aseptic meningitis and proctitis (in men). Symptoms are more frequent and prominent with primary than with recurrent infection. Genital HSV infections are acquired through sexual contact, beginning with sexual debut and increasing through the earlier years of highest sexual activity in most areas of the world, where they are often the leading cause of genital ulcer disease. In recent years type 1 has matched or surpassed type 2 as a frequent cause of primary genital infection, particularly in younger persons. Infection with one of the two HSV types is extremely common; tens of millions of people in the United States have genital HSV infection [
