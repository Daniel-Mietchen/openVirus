<p>Two of the agents (HAV and HEV) produce more acute, usually mild to moderate self-limited illness, with milder illness in younger individuals. As enteric pathogens, they occur in geographic distributions that reflect socioeconomic conditions in those regions. Hepatitis A tends to occur sporadically in older individuals where immunity is high, often because poor sanitation permitted the virus to saturate the population at younger age. Conversely, epidemic HAV disease is more often seen in populations left susceptible as a result of better hygiene. In the United States and other countries where the vaccine against HAV is widely used, the decline in cases of hepatitis A has been striking. About 1.5 million cases occur annually worldwide. Hepatitis E is found worldwide, with different viral genotypes determining the disease distribution. Globally, genotypes 1 and 2 account for 70,000 deaths and 3.4 million cases often in outbreaks particularly in South and East Asia but in other developing countries as well, whereas genotype 3 occurs more sporadically in countries with better sanitation [
