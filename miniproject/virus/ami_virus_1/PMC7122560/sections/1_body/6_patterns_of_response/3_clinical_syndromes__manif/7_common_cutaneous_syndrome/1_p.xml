<p>Many viruses can produce one or more forms of eruption of the skin (exanthem). The most common acute viral infections involving the skin are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">1.3</xref>; many are classic exanthems of childhood including measles, rubella, varicella, erythema infectiosum or fifth disease caused by parvovirus B19, and roseola infantum (exanthem subitum) caused primarily by human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">61</xref>]. Rashes also occur in children or adults with coxsackieviruses and echoviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">62</xref>], with certain adenoviruses (such as type 7), occasionally with EBV mononucleosis (often brought on by a reaction to ampicillin), and with other herpesviruses. HIV also causes a rash in a small proportion of newly infected patients. The distribution of these agents as causes of cutaneous conditions clearly varies by age, geography, vaccination status, and other host factors. The circumstances in which these many combinations of types of rash and agents are observed are not easily generalizable; the chapters on the individual agents should be consulted.
