<p>Viral hemorrhagic fever may begin with a nonspecific prodrome of fever and chills, malaise, myalgia, headache, rash, flushing, and in some cases vomiting and diarrhea. These may rapidly progress to a multiorgan syndrome with petechial and more extensive bleeding but which is often less life threatening than vascular collapse with varying degrees of pulmonary edema, hypotension, shock, and renal failure. Variations of this syndrome are caused by a numerous and growing list of mostly vector-borne viruses in four families: arenaviruses, filoviruses, bunyaviruses, and flaviviruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab5" ref-type="table">1.5</xref>). Collectively, the viruses that produce this syndrome are found throughout the world although each individual agent is confined to the region where the principal arthropod vector or other animal reservoir lives. Certain of the diseases occur sporadically, for example, when a single individual has incidental contact with an infected animal. The occurrence of a cluster of cases is more ominous; because of the often fulminant illness and the unpredictable human-to-human propagation of cases, including nosocomial transmission, publicity about the event can have disproportional community impact. These phenomena have typified the ominously large outbreak of Ebola virus infection in West Africa. From time to time, one of these illnesses may present an immediate, major public health problem with hundreds of cases; there is, for example, concern about the potential for hemorrhagic dengue on a large scale in Southeast Asia. Overall, the patterns of occurrence of these diseases are too variable to allow generalizations about their geographic distribution or the magnitude of the problem; they are addressed more individually in 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_8, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_9, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_14, and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_15.
