<p>Parvovirus B19 has been repeatedly linked to anemia, neurological anomalies, hydrops fetalis, and fetal death (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_27). In an earlier prospective study of 156 mothers infected with this virus, 12 % delivered babies with some abnormality [

The investigators estimated the overall fetal risk to be 9 %, although higher in the second trimester, and the transplacental transmission rate to be 33 %. Adverse outcomes, particularly fetal loss and hydrops (a syndrome associated with destruction of red blood cells in utero), follow a proportion of the infections with this virus [
