<p>The incidence of viral meningitis in infants may be as much as ten times that in older children. Worldwide, overall incidence is less easily estimated. Enteroviruses (echoviruses, coxsackieviruses, and others) are among the major causes in infants, and they may account for at least 80 % of cases in countries where vaccines against mumps, polio, and measles have significantly lowered the incidence of meningitis accompanying those conditions. On the other hand, in Asia, Japanese B encephalitis virus accounts for many thousands of meningitis cases each year and probably hundreds of thousands more that remain clinically inapparent. Additional, less common causes include other flaviviruses (West Nile virus; see below), herpesviruses (VZV and others), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, other arboviruses (Eastern and Western equine encephalitis), and HIV-1. Because both enteroviral and arboviral infections show strong peaks in occurrence during the spring, summer, and early fall, the overall incidence in aseptic meningitis exhibits clear seasonality.</p>
