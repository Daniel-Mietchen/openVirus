<p>Encephalitis is less common than meningitis due to viral infection in the United States, with an annual incidence of about 20,000 cases or 3–8 in 100,000 persons. However, because many cases are not seen as part of an outbreak, an etiologic diagnosis requires a brain biopsy; therefore, only more severe and hospitalized cases are likely to receive such a specific diagnosis. HSV-1, the most frequent cause, is responsible for about 10 % of those cases. Arboviruses account for another 150 to several thousand cases, with variability according to the intensity of seasonal occurrence and striking peaks during sporadic epidemics. These have included Venezuelan equine encephalitis (1969–1971, several hundred cases), St. Louis encephalitis virus infection (1975, 3,000 cases), West Nile virus (encephalitis or meningitis, 2,800 cases in 2003 and 2,700 cases in 2012), and smaller numbers of La Crosse encephalitis and Western equine encephalitis cases [
