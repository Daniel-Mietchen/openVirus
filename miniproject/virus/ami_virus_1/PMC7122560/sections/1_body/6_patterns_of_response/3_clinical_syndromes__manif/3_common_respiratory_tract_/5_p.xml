<p>Several viruses causing respiratory tract infection are relatively recent discoveries if not new to humans, and they are responsible for an appreciable proportion of viral respiratory tract infection (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_10, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_26, and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_27). Human metapneumovirus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections (i.e., a cold, cough, bronchitis, pneumonia, and exacerbation of asthma) in people of all ages but more severe forms at the extremes of age and complicating immunosuppression. Coronaviruses, although known for years in animals and as the cause of more benign URI, came to attention dramatically during the large epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, and resurfaced again in the variant form producing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). Since then a succession of new human coronavirus strains has been associated with outbreaks of both upper and lower infections in different parts of the world. An even newer member of the parvovirus family, a bocavirus, has been at least presumptively linked with respiratory symptoms and otitis media [
