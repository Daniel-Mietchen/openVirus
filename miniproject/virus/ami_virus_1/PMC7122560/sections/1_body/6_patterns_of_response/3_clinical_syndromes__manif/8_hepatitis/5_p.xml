<p>The delta virus (HDV) is an unusual partially defective RNA virus, closely dependent on the presence of HBV for its pathogenic expression if not for its multiplication. When HDV coinfects simultaneously with HBV, it may trigger an acute hepatitis syndrome but generally does not appreciably alter the course of disease. However, when HDV superinfects in a preexisting case of HBV infection, progression to cirrhosis is considerably more likely and often more rapid. The defective virus was first described in Europe, but it has been found at high prevalence in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, South America, and Asia where HBV is highly endemic, more often in parenterally infected blood product recipients or injection drug users and occasionally in men who have sex with men.</p>
