<p>The adverse outcomes of rubella during pregnancy, once numerically and clinically very important, have thankfully been virtually eliminated in the United States and other countries with effective vaccination programs. The fetal complications of the other vaccine-preventable diseases have also been drastically reduced. That has left CMV as the most common serious congenital disease due to viral infection in the United States [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">73</xref>]. Although these infections are usually benign, the virus can produce anomalies such as microencephalopathy, chorioretinitis, deafness, and mental retardation in a small proportion of those infected. Irreversible anomalies due to CMV infection occur in more than 5,000 children (0.1â€“0.2 %) each year.
