<p>Because HCV is transmitted more by the parenteral and less by the sexual route, in the developed world, hepatitis C has been more confined to IDUs and others who have been exposed to contaminated blood and needles. Central Asia and East Asia along with North Africa and the Middle East have the highest prevalences of the HCV infection (&gt;3.5 %) [

Because of the highly variable absolute and relative prevalences of HBV and HCV infection and the other risk factors for those complications, it is difficult to estimate the incidence of HCV-induced cirrhosis or cancer or the risk attributable to HCV.
