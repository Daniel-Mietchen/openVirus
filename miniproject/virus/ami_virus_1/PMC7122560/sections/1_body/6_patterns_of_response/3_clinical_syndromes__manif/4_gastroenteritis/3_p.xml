<p>Viral gastroenteritis caused by adenoviruses and astroviruses has been studied more selectively, mostly in the United States. Specific serotypes of adenoviruses tend to cause disease in a year-round, endemic form, primarily in very young children. Up to 15 % of gastroenteritis in some settings may be due to astrovirus infection. Older children and adults are less affected. The infection is probably transmitted person to person, and it has caused infection in hospitalized and immunodeficient patients [
