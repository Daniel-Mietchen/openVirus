<p>The tissue and organs targeted by human viruses can respond to infection in a limited number of ways; any of several viruses (or other causative agents) may trigger the same general response pattern. The clinician must often rely on epidemiologic and clinical features and simple laboratory tests in making a tentative etiologic diagnosis. This diagnostic reasoning may be based heavily on the known frequency of potential causative agents in the age group of the patient, the specific geographic or physical setting, the season, and their epidemic behavior. This section summarizes the major clinical syndromes produced by some of the more common human viruses. It includes (1) a very brief description of the clinical manifestations; (2) identification of major etiologic agents; (3) general frequency distributions by factors such as age and geography, not necessarily applicable at special times such as an epidemic or off-season or in settings like hospitals, nursing homes, and day-care facilities; and (4) selected other features relevant to the understanding of their occurrence in populations.
