<p>Response to a virus by an individual may range from completely asymptomatic to severe or fatal. The ratio of inapparent (or subclinical) to apparent (or clinical) responses varies from one virus to another; representative examples are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">1.2</xref>. The clinical response may be abrupt or more gradual, sometimes appearing long after the initial infection. It may be self-limited or arise from viral persistence or reactivation or both.
