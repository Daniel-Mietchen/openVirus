<p>The subclinical/clinical ratio for HIV-1 infection defies the more straightforward categorization possible for many other viral infections. A syndrome resembling mononucleosis with fever, fatigue, headache, lymph node swelling, joint and muscle aching, rash, sore throat, and other features occurs frequently in newly infected individuals. However, the proportion reported to have experienced this syndrome is higher or lower depending on the method of ascertainment (e.g., presentation at a sexually transmitted disease clinic, follow-up of cohort of initially uninfected homosexual men) and the clinical definition [

Likewise, the vast majority of HIV-1 infections follow a highly variable course—for a median of about 9 years in most studies of untreated individuals—free of the serious (AIDS-defining) illness; and on the average, HIV-2 infection progresses even more slowly. However, laboratory evidence usually indicates that immunologic deterioration is continuing at some rate even when the infection is clinically silent. The natural history of HIV infection and the factors that modulate it are addressed in detail in 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_43.
