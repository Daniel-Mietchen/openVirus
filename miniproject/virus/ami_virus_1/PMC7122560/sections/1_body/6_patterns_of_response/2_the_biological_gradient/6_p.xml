<p>The biological gradient of many viral infections can be viewed as analogous to an iceberg in which clinically apparent illness represents only a small proportion of the response pattern and the usually larger amount represents unrecognized and inapparent infection. A similar analogy may exist at the cellular level. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">1.2</xref> portrays these concepts, but Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">1.2</xref> demonstrates that the precise shape of the iceberg for any given infection can vary considerably at the clinical level.
