<p>GBV-C infection increases with age but produces no known clinical illness [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], is not known to affect them clinically. However, in immunocompromised patients (e.g., with AIDS, Hodgkinâ€™s disease, or renal transplantation), previously asymptomatic JC virus infection may evolve into progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy[
