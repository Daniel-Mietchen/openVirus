<p>Strategies for designing antiviral agents focus on the numerous vulnerable points in the replicative cycle of a virus that are, ideally, distinct from any point along the synthetic pathways of the human host. There is a growing list of candidate drugs with established clinical antiviral efficacy, and new compounds can now be designed in silico with computer programs that can produce exquisitely precise models of proteinâ€“protein interactions that help predict their likely biologic effects. Of course, as promising as these advances are, the ideal is rarely achieved. Limitations still include the poor correlation of effects predicted by in silico, in vitro, or animal studies with those observed in humans, strain differences in response, easy emergence of resistance, and unforeseen acute toxicity. Delayed adverse consequences like oncogenicity and teratogenicity are also a concern.</p>
