<p>In addition to the antiviral agents covered here, several new candidates in familiar classes as well as new classes of drugs are under experimental and in some cases human investigation. They include numerous new drugs of several classes for HCV; cyclopropavir for CMV infection; a methanocarbathymidine compound active against several herpesviruses; a drug similar to cidofovir with activity against polyoma-, adeno-, pox-, and herpesviruses; favipiravir, which inhibits replication of influenza and probably arena-, bunya-, and hantaviruses; pleconaril and other drugs that inhibit picornaviruses; drugs targeting kinase pathways; and other agents with a broader antiviral spectrum, such as those that bind to the uniquely viral intermediary double-stranded RNA while initiating apoptosis [
