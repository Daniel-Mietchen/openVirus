<p>Smallpox was the first and only disease to have been officially declared eradicated from the earth. From the moment of that historic accomplishment in 1977, this consummate success of the WHO eradication program has inspired initiatives to replicate it with other diseases. The definition of 
 <italic>eradication</italic>, telegraphed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">1.13</xref>, can be more fully understood in the context of viral infection as “…disappear[ance] from all countries of the world because transmission of the causative organism has ceased in an irreversible manner” [

 <italic>elimination</italic>, denotes disappearance of the causal agent within a large geographic area; this goal has often been viewed as an intermediate step toward eradication. The critical distinction made in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab13" ref-type="table">1.13</xref> is that once a disease is eradicated, it is no longer necessary to maintain the elaborate public health apparatus required for ongoing surveillance and control. The implications for achieving either result in practice are that (1) every real or potential occurrence in every location within the target area must be taken seriously, (2) the infection and the interventions to control it must be carefully monitored, (3) program structure and function must be nimble and thorough in response to any suggestion of difficulty or failure, and (4) the rising cost of preventing each successive case cannot be allowed to justify diverting resources away from the goal [
