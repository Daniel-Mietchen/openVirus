<p>Active vaccines are administered with the goal of stimulating antibody production by the host to provide a high degree and long duration of protection but with no or minimal accompanying illness. The full set of objectives for creating a good vaccine for active immunization is listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab11" ref-type="table">1.11</xref>. Both live and killed vaccines are used, and Table 
 <xref rid="Tab12" ref-type="table">1.12</xref> compares the two types. Active viral vaccines containing live attenuated virus (measles, mumps, rubella, and smallpox viruses, poliovirus, adenovirus, and VZV) have generally been more immediately, broadly, and durably protective than killed vaccines or other constructs, especially when they are administered by the natural portal of entry to produce local immunity. However, there are a growing number of exceptions to that ruleâ€”live virus preparations that are less fully successful (e.g., VZV vaccine against herpes zoster, nasally administered influenza vaccine) while certain non-replicating types formulated as recombinants that appear to provide unexpectedly high protection (e.g., HBV and HPV vaccines). In the case of hepatitis A, both inactivated and live attenuated formulations are highly effective, although immunity generated by the latter may be somewhat longer lasting [
