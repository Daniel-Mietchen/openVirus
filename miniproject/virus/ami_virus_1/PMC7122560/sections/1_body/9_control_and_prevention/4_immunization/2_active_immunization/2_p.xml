<p>Limitations to the wide applicability of live vaccines include the difficulty of successfully attenuating the candidate strain without reversion to virulence, the avoidance of viral persistence and the risk of reactivation, and the elimination of possible oncogenicity. These have been major hurdles for vaccines against herpesviruses, and it is difficult to measure some of these attributes in the laboratory. Efforts to produce live vaccines with temperature-sensitive mutants that replicate in the upper respiratory but not in the lung have culminated in the licensure of a cold-adapted nasal influenza vaccine recommended for use in healthy 2â€“49-year-olds. </p>
