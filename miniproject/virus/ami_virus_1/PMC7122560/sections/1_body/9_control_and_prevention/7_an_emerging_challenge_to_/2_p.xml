<p>Religious beliefs have often been cited reasons for requesting exemption, but other anti-vaccine forces are at work too [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">200</xref>]. Mass migration to the Internet as a primary source of health information has led to a proliferation of online websites highlighting anecdotal attributions by parents of various other adverse events to vaccines. While unsupported allegations are unfortunate, their appeal to parents of ill children as easy explanations or as sources of comfort or even justifications for tangible compensation is also understandable. However, more disturbing are print- and web-based testimonies by supposed experts in field of vaccines including radical, unfounded assertions about research that links vaccination to various deleterious biological and clinical consequences. Some of these arguments appear to have arisen from distrust of government [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">201</xref>]. Other claims are likely motivated by anecdotal experiences, favorable publicity, and/or financial benefits that may accrue from sales of books and other materials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">202</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">205</xref>]. Regardless of the origins or current forces driving this anti-vaccine sentiment, the recent experience with deliberate discontinuation or refusal of routine immunization has provided ample forewarning of how this growing multifaceted anti-vaccine movement could reverse decades of progress.
