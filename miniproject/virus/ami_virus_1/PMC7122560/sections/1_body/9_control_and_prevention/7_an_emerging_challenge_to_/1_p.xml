<p>Government and nongovernment organizations alike are engaged in an enormous multipronged worldwide immunization enterprise. There are many natural and legitimate concerns about the prospects for continuing success with each vaccine-preventable disease. The obstacles in every domain—scientific, political, economic, cultural, and others— are formidable. It was especially distressing to learn that one of those obstacles, opposition on religious/ethnic grounds, had motivated the murder of innocent Pakistani and Nigerian health workers in 2012–2013 [

However, on a more ominous note, beginning in the 1990s, the United States and other developed countries have witnessed a gradual increase in the numbers of parents who are refusing to permit their children to receive required routine immunizations. Because the refusals have tended to concentrate among certain subsets of the population who may be clustered geographically [

The resulting increased risk of such diseases as measles engenders particular concern because children unvaccinated against them not only are vulnerable in their own right but also pose significant risk to their contacts who may remain unprotected—because of exemption from vaccine requirements, a medical precaution or contraindication for live vaccine, vaccination exclusion for young age, or inadequate response to vaccine [
