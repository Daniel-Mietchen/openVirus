<p>The basic strategy for controlling a disease is to break one or more links in the chain of causation or pathogenetic continuum. Any such a strategy must rest on the fundamental knowledge of the agent, host, and environment for the particular infection; the control may be physical, chemical, or biological in nature. In the simplest terms, control at the level of the agent usually means incapacitating or destroying it with a physical force as with ultraviolet or light or freezing. A variety of chemicals can also be used externally, particularly on inanimate surfaces (i.e., virucidal disinfectants such as detergents, methylene blue, and chlorine or other compounds that depend on the activity of hypochlorite). At the level of the environment, the strategy might involve an engineering solution such as improving water supplies or sewage disposal or installing negative-pressure ventilation systems, or it might involve avoiding, suppressing, or eradicating the vector population using a widely sprayed insecticide or some other intervention that alters the vector habitat. Effective prevention can also be achieved at the personal level with behavioral intervention to prevent contact (e.g., isolating or cohorting infected individuals in separate rooms, wearing protective clothing such as masks or gowns, applying a topical insect repellant, or washing hands with any of a variety of antiseptic agents). Because of space limitation, for more information on the principles and practices of isolation and barrier, sanitation, disinfection and antisepsis, environmental engineering, and vector control, the reader is referred to more general texts and references on selected topics here; many others on these numerous topics are available [
