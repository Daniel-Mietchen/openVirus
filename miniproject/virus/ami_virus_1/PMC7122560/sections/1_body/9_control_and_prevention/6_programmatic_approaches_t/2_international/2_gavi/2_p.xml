<p>Early GAVI efforts in the realm of viral diseases concentrated on vaccines against hepatitis B and yellow fever. Lately, attention has turned to delivery of rotavirus, the second dose of measles, human papillomavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and rubella vaccines. Two examples of current initiatives include the intention to immunize 700 million children against measles and rubella by 2020 and plans for administering HPV vaccine to 180,000 preadolescent girls in the first phase of a campaign to protect girls in many developing countries against cervical cancer. The alliance has depended heavily on grants and donor government pledges along with private philanthropic contributions, but it has substantially capitalized on more innovative financing for purchases of existing vaccines and for mutual assurances about the future availability of vaccines and the funds needed to purchase and deliver them.
