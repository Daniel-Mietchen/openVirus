<p>More recently (2006), WHO and UNICEF produced the Global Immunization Vision and Strategy (GIVS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">185</xref>] aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality from vaccine-preventable diseases during the decade ahead, not just in children but in all segments of the population. The strategy includes immunizing more broadly, introducing a range of new vaccines and technologies, integrating vaccination and other preventive health care, and coordinating programs on a global level. The overall strategy contains numerous goals from which countries can select to tailor their own specific programs. Within only a few years after its adoption, GIVS has been successful in stimulating the establishment of a number of national immunization plans.
