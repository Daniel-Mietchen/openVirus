<p>This committee is chartered by Federal law [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">181</xref>] to advise CDC and, in effect, all government agencies and the public at large about the appropriate use of vaccines to control those diseases for which immunizing agents are available. The committee meets regularly to review statistics on vaccine-preventable diseases; new experimental and other research findings relevant to vaccine safety and efficacy; information about current vaccines, including labeling and package inserts; newly licensed products; policies and guidelines of other organizations; cost considerations; and other aspects of immunization policies and programs. Recommendations may be forthcoming on any of those topics; in addition, recommendations may also cover for modification of schedules, for administration of vaccines in the Vaccines for Children Program, or for introduction of new vaccines into the program. This advice carries heavy weight throughout the public health, health-care provider, public and private health insurance, and legal communities. The primary legal authority for matters of public health and disease control is vested in the states, and most of them follow ACIP guidelines closely.
