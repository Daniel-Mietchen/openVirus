<p>As a culmination of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at the beginning of the new millennium, major stakeholders in the global immunization (UN agencies, donor governments, vaccine industry leaders, aid organizations, and others) formed a consortium called the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI). The mission of this entity is to bring new vaccines to all children of the developing world. The specific goals include intense focus on the more than 20 million children worldwide in poor areas who would otherwise remain unvaccinated against vaccine-preventable diseases, acceleration of delivery of new vaccines to the poorer countries as soon as possible after they are available in the wealthier ones, and channeling support for academic and industrial research on new vaccines targeted to the developing world.</p>
