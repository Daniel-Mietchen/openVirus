<p>Several intrinsic properties of all pathogens, including viruses, are of importance in the production of infection and disease; these properties can be quantified and permit comparisons among viruses. One property, 
 <italic>infectivity</italic>, is ability to infect the preferred target cell in a standard assay, usually measured as the minimum number of infectious units or particles required. It may involve the capacity for attachment to, entry into, and multiplication within a variety of host cells. A second property, 
 <italic>pathogenicity</italic>, is defined as the ability of an infectious agent to produce clinically significant disease. A third property, 
 <italic>virulence</italic>, has been used synonymously with the previous two terms but more formally refers to the proportion of infections that produce serious disease, classically measured as a ratio of fatal cases to the total number of infections. A fourth property is what might be described as adaptability, a reflection of genetic responsiveness to external perturbations often determined by the type and organization of its nucleic acid. Over their long evolutionary history, most viruses have either gradually accumulated key mutations or even integrated entire host genes that alter their capacity to cause disease or permit them to evade or circumvent specific host mechanisms of resistance. The proper series of mutations may have enabled a virus to utilize an alternative biochemical pathway or conferred variable degrees of resistance to antiviral agents. Rapidly replicating RNA viruses like influenza, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus are more error (mutation) prone than many DNA viruses. More sophisticated mechanisms of evasive adaptation have been adopted by larger DNA viruses like the herpesviruses. One such mechanism utilized by human herpesvirus 8 is exemplified by the incorporation of several viral homologues of human genes (e.g., 
 <italic>IL6</italic>, 
 <italic>IRF3</italic>), which may mimic their human counterparts and/or usurp their function [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. All of these properties are factors that may influence not only the capacity to initiate infection and produce disease but also the transmissibility of the agent.
