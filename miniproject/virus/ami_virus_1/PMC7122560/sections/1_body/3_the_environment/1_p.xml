<p>The external environment can exert its influences on the virus itself or its mode of spread or on the biological or behavioral aspects of the host response. Although viruses survive or die within defined ranges of such physical factors as temperature, humidity, and air currents, variability between viral groups is high. Chemicals may be used as antiseptics or microbicides to kill viruses prophylactically, and the list of pharmaceuticals now available for antiviral therapy has been growing rapidly (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec45" ref-type="sec">10</xref>). These environmental factors may enhance or diminish survival of viruses, but they probably have a greater impact on routes of transmission and on patterns of host behavior.
