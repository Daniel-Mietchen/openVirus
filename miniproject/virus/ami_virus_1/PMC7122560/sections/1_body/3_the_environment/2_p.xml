<p>In addition to physical and chemical factors, biological variables play a role as well. For insect-borne agents like the equine encephalitis viruses, whose survival may depend on migration patterns of an avian host or on overwintering in a mammalian reservoir, the environment exerts an obvious role in restricting transmission of infection and occurrence of disease to those areas that have the proper temperature, humidity, vegetation, and other features necessary for the insects. For viruses potentially transmitted by water, such as hepatitis A virus and noroviruses, a warm environment with poor sanitation and fecal contamination clearly increases exposure and transmission efficiency.</p>
