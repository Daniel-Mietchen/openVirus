<p>Climate also alters the social behavior of the host. In settings where high temperatures promote not only contact of hosts with water through swimming or drinking but also viral replication, transmission of waterborne gastrointestinal diseases is increased in polluted areas. Warm weather also brings closer contact with insect vectors of arboviruses and with dogs and other animal sources of rabies. Conversely, in the cooler seasons, people collect indoors, where crowding promotes transmission of airborne and droplet-borne infections. Spread in indoor environments is amplified by relative concentration of military personnel in barracks, residents of assisted living facilities, and assembly and dispersal of students coinciding with the periodic openings and closings of educational institutions. Furthermore, the relatively hot and dry environment in many homes and commercial buildings may impair the protective mechanisms on mucous surfaces and promote entry and attachment of certain respiratory viruses.</p>
