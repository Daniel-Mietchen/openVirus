<p>It is biologically based immunity that is the fundamental host characteristic governing not only acquisition but also, probably more profoundly than the other factors, the pathogenesis and evolution of infection. Indeed, the influences of age, sex, race, and some of those others reflect in part the accompanying biologic functions that vary with those characteristics. There are many examples in which these host factors are almost certainly operating as surrogates for immune status. Age is prime example. Childhood respiratory and enteric viruses produce life-threatening disease in infants but little or no illness in adults who have developed natural immunity. Conversely, infections with hepatitis A and polio viruses are often asymptomatic in young children but may produce significant clinical hepatitis and paralytic poliomyelitis in older individuals. Aging adults develop increasingly severe infections as their immunity in general and specifically to previously encountered viruses wanes. Sex differences in disease expression are generally less obvious. Disease due to influenza virus is more or less equally common and severe in men and women in general, but pregnant women experience more serious illness [
