<p>Apparent racial disparities exist in rates of infection, disease frequency, or expression. Various sources of surveillance data suggest that persons of African ancestry in the United States have higher rates of influenza, HCV, HPV, and other viral infections, while those of Asian ancestry have higher rates of HBV infection. However, in each case these differences are readily attributable to geographic, socioeconomic, or behavioral influences on acquisition, as noted earlier, and race is simply a marker of some combination of those factors rather than signifying an underlying immunologic or other biologic basis for the difference. On the other hand, some racial or ethnic differences in the disease manifestations (severity or natural history) will undoubtedly prove to be due to underlying immunogenetic heterogeneity.</p>
