<p>Differences in infection rate by race or ethnicity can be divided into those known or likely to have genetic or other biologic origins versus those most likely due to other factors that correlate closely with race. Genetic factors are discussed below. For the nongenetic explanations, race is usually a surrogate marker for some other often readily apparent factor. Geographic distribution is the most obvious reason for large racial differences. Viruses that have reservoirs or life cycles that involve nonhumans would be expected to occur only in regions of the world where the animal populations may coincide with humans of one particular racial group. Exposure may differ by race because of behavioral differences. New HIV-1 infections in young gay men in the United States have surged more in blacks because of their relatively exclusive exposure network (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_43). HIV-2 is heavily concentrated in individuals of West African and Portuguese ancestry because the virus probably originated and mainly spread in the former Portuguese colonies on the west coast of sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
