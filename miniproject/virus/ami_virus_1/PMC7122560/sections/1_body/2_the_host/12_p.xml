<p>Humoral immunity is generated by a cascade of interactions among dendritic cells, T and B lymphocytes, and plasma cells culminating in the production of immunoglobulins that serve as antibodies to the virus that initiated the response. Once activated by a virus, the humoral immune system engages in sequential production of immunoglobulins of the IgM, IgG, and IgA classes in different proportions that bind to surface or intracellular antigenic components of the virus. This binding improves with avidity (tightness) and affinity (antigen specificity) that increase during the days or weeks following onset of infection. The antibodies, often in conjunction with complement or other proteins, may neutralize or kill the virus directly or recruit cells with cytotoxic capabilities into the vicinity to accomplish that task.</p>
