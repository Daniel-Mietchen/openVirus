<p>All of these processes depend primarily on differential expression of hundreds to thousands of genetic loci relatively directly involved in the immune response. Many of the simplest, often monogenic immunodeficiencies with Mendelian patterns of inheritance and the infectious diseases that complicate them have been well catalogued, although new examples continue to surface [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. On the other hand, very little of the overall genetic contribution to more complex multigenic infectious traits have yet been elucidated, but research in this field is charging ahead. An example of very direct genetic mediation of resistance to viral infection is the remarkable protection against HIV-1 infection afforded by the deletion of a portion of the gene for the viral co-receptor (
 <italic>CCR5</italic>) in individuals of European ancestry, described further in 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_43. Other clear instances of genetic mediation are the increased susceptibility to norovirus infection among carriers of the O blood group antigen compared with carriers of A or B antigen [

 <italic>TLR3</italic>) to herpes simplex viral encephalitis [

In the past two decades, the explosion of knowledge in immunology and genetics has paralleled the rapid advances in molecular and computational technology. A more detailed summary of the rapidly expanding knowledge of immune system function is beyond the scope of this overview. The reader is referred to textbooks and the most current reviews of specific subjects for more complete coverage [
