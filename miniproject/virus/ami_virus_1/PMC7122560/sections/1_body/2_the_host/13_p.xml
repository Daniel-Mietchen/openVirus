<p>Both cellular and humoral systems demonstrate what are known as innate and adaptive responses. Certain effector cells and molecules preexist in the host before any pathogen is encountered. These relatively unvarying elements have been recognized as the “first responders” because they mediate intrinsic or innate functions that are automatically and uniformly invoked in the first hours and days after a viral infection or other foreign intrusion. Soon after the innate response is underway, the adaptive parts of the systems are activated. Dendritic and other cells use molecules on their surface to present antigenic fragments to effector T lymphocytes individually in a process exquisitely specific to the offending virus. This specificity is generated by the huge variation in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes that encode those surface proteins used for microbial antigen presentation. These molecules not only activate helper and cytotoxic T lymphocytes but also interact with another set of cognate receptors on the surface of natural killer (NK) cells; these NK cell receptors are also encoded by highly complex multigenic systems such as the leukocyte receptor complex (LCR), the natural cytotoxicity receptor (NCR) family, and the killer lectin-like receptor (KLR) family. The antibody-mediated humoral response is likewise largely adaptive. As with cell-mediated antigen presentation and the cytotoxic systems, the organization of the genes encoding immunoglobulins are likewise programmed for genetically governed rearrangements to provide for maximum adaptability and specificity. Moreover, not only do most antibodies bind with specificity for a particular class of viruses or a single member of the class, they also undergo structural maturation over time to conform even more closely to the specific target antigen.</p>
