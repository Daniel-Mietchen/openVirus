<p>Mediators of natural resistance include components of primary defense systems such as cilia, mucus, the integument, and other physical and chemical inhibitors. However, resistance is even more dependent on the principal organs involved in generating the immune response—spleen, bone marrow, lymph nodes, and other lymphoid tissue—the structures on which the highly complex cellular and humoral immune systems are founded. Multiple cellular arms of the immune system dedicated to defending against viral infection. They operate through dozens of known and as-yet-unknown interlocking pathways in which monocytes; macrophages; dendritic cells; a wide array of T-helper, suppressor, and regulatory cells along with B lymphocytes and plasma cells are all orchestrated to stimulate or respond to each other in a coherent and effective manner. They may do so by a variety of mechanisms. Communication and function may occur through direct cell–cell contact or binding between receptor–ligand pairs on cell surfaces. Alternatively or additionally, these and other specialized cells may secrete cytokines, chemokines, complement, peptides, or other immunoactive substances, for which their target cells carry surface or intracellular receptors. Thus, countless different cell types in elaborate interlocking pathways execute any of a variety of assigned functions—signaling, activating, inhibiting, attracting, killing, etc.</p>
