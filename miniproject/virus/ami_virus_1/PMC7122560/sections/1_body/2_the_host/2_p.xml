<p>Most of the effect of age on resistance to infection either is attributable to the development of immunity over time or reflects the mode of transmission. Infants and young children are susceptible to a whole range of infections that confer lifelong immunity once acquired. Many viral infections that are now largely prevented wherever vaccines are available (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, varicella, and rotavirus) and others like respiratory syncytial virus have historically caused major childhood morbidity and mortality. Acquisition of certain herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, and Epsteinâ€“Barr virus) begins in the perinatal period via congenital transmission followed by slow and steady increases until adolescence, most likely through relatively casual direct contact. Then occurrence accelerates somewhat for the next several decades during the period of more intimate oral or sexual contact before leveling off after middle age.</p>
