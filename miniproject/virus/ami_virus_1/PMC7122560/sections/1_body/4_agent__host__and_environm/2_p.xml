<p>To initiate infection a virus must be in the appropriate structural and functional state, reflected in the intrinsic properties described above. It must also be present in a quantity sufficient to penetrate the target host. That quantity, the 
 <italic>inoculum</italic>, is the amount of virus available to be transmitted; and the minimum size of a viral inoculum needed to initiate infection varies with infectivity, a property discussed earlier, as well as with other features of those three cardinal elements. Upon introduction of the minimum inoculum and successful attachment to and penetration of its target cells, the infection is established. Then, again depending on various features of the agent, host, and environment, the virus elicits a response that may or may not manifest clinically.
