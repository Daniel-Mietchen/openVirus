<p>In the context of immunization, immunogenicity represents the extent to which a vaccine can provide the same or similar degree of protection achieved in the course of natural infection. Many of the regimens for vaccination against those highly immunogenic infections have succeeded in mimicking very high levels of neutralizing antibody if not lifelong protection. The more basic biologic characteristics of the agent and the host that determine immunogenicity are addressed in texts on virology and immunology (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">1</xref>).
