<p>The degree of response an agent can evoke in the host immune system is known as its immunogenic potential or 
 <italic>immunogenicity</italic>. It commonly refers to the ability of the natural infection to confer protection against reinfection or significant disease upon reexposure. This protective ability has typically been measured as the quantity of antibody that neutralizes or incapacitates the virus, but viruses may generate antibodies that do not neutralize or protect. Many of the classic acute childhood infections (e.g., measles, mumps, rubella, chicken pox, and other exanthematous conditions) are not merely strongly immunogenic but also usually confer lifelong immunity. In contrast, other viruses can either readily alter their antigenic makeup like influenza and some flaviviruses or produce persistent chronic infection like herpesviruses; by a variety of mechanisms, they have ingeniously avoided generating highly neutralizing antibody. HIV-1 is the master of evasive and adaptive mechanisms that allow it both to evolve rapidly and to persist for years without stimulating antibodies that neutralize.
