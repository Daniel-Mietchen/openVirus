<p>The epidemiology of infectious diseases is concerned with the circumstances under which both infection and disease occur in a population and the factors that influence their frequency, spread, and distribution. It is critical to distinguish between infection and disease because the factors that govern their occurrence may be different and because infection without disease is common with many viruses. Infection indicates the introduction and multiplication of a biological agent within a host, leading to an interaction often manifest as an immune response. It is determined largely by environmental factors that govern exposure to the agent and by both intrinsic susceptibility and personal behavior of the host. Disease represents the host response to infection when it is severe enough to evoke a recognizable pattern of clinical manifestations. The factors that influence the occurrence and severity of this response vary with the characteristics of virus involved, its portal of entry, and the dose or inoculum size; but the most important determinants for many common infections lie within the host. Of these, the age and general health at the time of infection, genetic background, and immune status of the host are the most crucial.</p>
