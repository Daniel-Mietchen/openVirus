<p>Outbreaks may come to attention in a variety of ways. An insightful clinician may suddenly see one or more unexpected cases of a syndrome or atypical presentations of infection, just as happened at the onset of the HIV/AIDS epidemic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">147</xref>]; or a laboratory may identify an unusual viral strain in the course of routine testing (e.g., a novel influenza variant) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">148</xref>]; or a health department officer may recognize a cluster of cases of, say, norovirus gastroenteritis as multiple entries in computerized syndromic surveillance system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">149</xref>]. With any such initial event, it may not be possible to establish a diagnosis only at the level of a clinical syndrome and not with etiologic specificity. At this initial stage, a somewhat specific but simple working definition should include key epidemiologic and clinical features for the purposes of case finding. This definition can be altered in its sensitivity or specificity later, when the spectrum of clinical features has been clarified and laboratory studies have been completed. The definition is primarily for the purposes of beginning to enumerate cases. This enumeration is accompanied simultaneously with the organization and analyses of the clinical data and construction of a plot (epidemic curve) of cases according to onset or recognition and/or a plot of the location of cases. Categorization by occurrences by infection, case, or death may provide information about the seriousness of this outbreak relative to previous ones.
