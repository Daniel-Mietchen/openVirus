<p>Even at this early point, if the pattern of cases or other information reveals a likely mode of transmission, control measures should be instituted. Not surprisingly many epidemics of viral infection result from person-to-person spread, particularly by the respiratory route, in open communities or in relatively closed populations like health or extended care facilities. Vector-borne spread also accounts for a significant portion of epidemic viral infection throughout the world (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_7, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_8, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_9, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_14, 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_15, and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_16,). Common source outbreaks of viral infections from water, food, milk, or other environmental sources have not historically been as common as those due to bacterial infections. However, such outbreaks have been recognized increasingly in recent years. Some examples include spread of adenoviruses by tonometers in eye clinics or in swimming pools, hepatitis A by public water supplies or by seafood, or enteroviruses by fecally contaminated water, food, or milk (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_17).</p>
