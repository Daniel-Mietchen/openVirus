<p>The most informative measure of association in a cohort study is usually the 
 <italic>relative risk</italic>, used synonymously with risk ratio or rate ratio. Relative risk is estimated as the ratio of the rate of the event (infected or ill) among exposed or infected persons, respectively, to the rate of such an event in the unexposed or uninfected persons. In cohort studies in which all or representative samples of individuals exposed and unexposed to a virus are observed for a period of time until some proportion of each sample develops disease, a “true” relative risk is calculated as the ratio of the eventual cumulative incidences in the groups with and without exposure or [
 <italic>a</italic>/(
 <italic>a</italic> + 
 <italic>b</italic>)]/[
 <italic>c</italic>/(
 <italic>c</italic> + 
 <italic>d</italic>)] (Table
