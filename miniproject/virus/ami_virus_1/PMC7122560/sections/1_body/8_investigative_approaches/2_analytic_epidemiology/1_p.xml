<p>Beyond the collection of data for descriptive and surveillance purposes, insight into infectious disease at the population level also emerges from more sophisticated computational and pictorial representation of the salient events and relationships. Hypothesis testing and other formal evaluation of causal relationships, exploration of co-determinants of infection and illness, and recognition of patterns of occurrence all involve rigorous comparisons of data from exposed, infected, and/or diseased individuals with similar data from unexposed or unaffected individuals. That form of inquiry has come to be called analytic epidemiology, the basic methods of which are summarized below. Finally, in conjunction with these numerical and graphical methods, advances in the theory and methods of mathematical statistics have refined empirical and predictive models of virusâ€“host adaptation, transmission and vector dynamics, incidence, epidemic trajectories, and other phenomena of infectious disease. Chapter 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_5 is a concise view of current approaches to modeling of viral transmission dynamics.</p>
