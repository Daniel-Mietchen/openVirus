<p>When an investigation can only be done feasibly on infection or disease that has already occurred following presumed exposure to some etiologic agent in the past, properly designed comparison of those exposed and affected (cases of infection or disease) with those exposed and unaffected (controls) can provide a valid measure of association. When the available cases and, for efficiency, only a small subset of all the non-cases are compared, the putative causal relationship is measured as the 
 <italic>relative odds</italic>, a term synonymous and interchangeable with the 
 <italic>odds ratio</italic>. Based on mathematical principles, for diseases that are uncommon in the population, the relative odds, calculated as [
 <italic>a</italic> × 
 <italic>d</italic>/
 <italic>b</italic> × 
 <italic>c</italic>], represent a close approximation to the relative risk (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab9" ref-type="table">1.8</xref>). The case–control study design is especially productive in epidemic situations where the investigation needs to be structured around cases that are reported or sought in the absence of a clear causal exposure. The analysis of case–control studies is usually performed with the technique of logistic regression, which can accommodate independent variables other than the putative causal factor. The major limitation is the many forms of bias that can distort the estimate of the strength of the key relationship, due to difficulties in selecting and assessing study subjects with the tight comparability necessary for proper analysis.
