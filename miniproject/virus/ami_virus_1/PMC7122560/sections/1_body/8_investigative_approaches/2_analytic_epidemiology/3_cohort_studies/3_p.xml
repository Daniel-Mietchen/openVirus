<p>For conditions that develop over variable lengths of time, if the actual time between exposure/infection and disease is known, it is often preferable to incorporate that time element into the estimate relative risk. That can be done either graphically in survival (Kaplanâ€“Meier) plots (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">1.4</xref>) or numerically by application of statistical techniques of which a very useful and popular one is known as a (Cox) proportional hazards regression, yielding a 
 <italic>relative hazard</italic>. Several useful pieces of information about the timing of events can be extracted from the survival curves. As in other regression models, a proportional hazards model can include multiple factors to be assessed for their independent contribution to the outcome (disease).
