<p>The search for associations in epidemiologic data often consists of comparing rates of infection in cohorts of individuals exposed and unexposed to a specific risk factor or rates of disease in cohorts of infected and uninfected individuals. Cohort studies may be cross-sectional or longitudinal in design. In the former, the exposure and the outcome are measured in the population at a single time point. There are many relationships for which the timing of the exposure relative to the disease cannot be established through cross-sectional observation; however, there are many others for which the pathogenesis is understood or the exposure is unambiguously antecedent to the outcome (e.g., genetically mediated rapid progression of HIV infection or shingles in an individual with serologic evidence of VZV infection). In contrast, longitudinal cohort studies are often more powerful because the temporal relationship between the exposure and the outcome can be explicitly established. Although ulcerative inflammation due to HSV-2 is a risk factor for acquisition of HIV infection, it could also be a more prominent consequence of HIV-induced immunosuppression. Only longitudinal observation of precise temporal relationships between the onset of these two infections and the timing of their clinical manifestations would allow definitive inferences about causality.</p>
