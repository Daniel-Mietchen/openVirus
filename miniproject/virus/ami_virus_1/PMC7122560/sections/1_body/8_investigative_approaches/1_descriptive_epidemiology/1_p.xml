<p>The first steps in understanding infection and disease in populations constitute so-called descriptive epidemiology. It generally involves integrating the data that best characterize the phenomenon under investigation in the terms discussed in the preceding sections: the agent, environment, and host; the distinctive pathogenetic features; the patterns of occurrence in time and place; and the mode(s) of transmission. The technologies for detecting and defining the agent, quantifying environmental conditions, and profiling the immune status of the host have all been advancing at an exceedingly rapid pace. So have the noninvasive and imaging procedures for characterizing the clinical and pathophysiologic features of the disease. They have facilitated the pinpointing in time and location of cases of infection or illness, often revealing early key information about the origins and the mode of transmission of infection.</p>
