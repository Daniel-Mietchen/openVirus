<p id="Par205">A variety of viruses from different families, together with viral tropism, successively manifest in an extended spectrum of complex clinical syndromes influenced by the individual immune response of the host and the constantly changing environment, which is affected by globalization, natural disasters, war, availability and influence of health care services and increased population density. Although the outcome of viral encephalitis varies, the morbidity and mortality are significant. Prompt treatment with antiviral treatment may alter the outcome and is usually started empirically when viral encephalitis is suspected, but it is effective for HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. Aggressive treatment with immune modulating drugs has been successful in autoimmune-mediated encephalitides. The value of routine use of steroids in viral encephalitis is not clear. Prevention is an important aspect of virus management and the drive to develop new vaccines is ongoing and important. A viral etiology should always be considered in a severely ill child with CNS manifestations.</p>
