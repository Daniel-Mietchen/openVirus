<p id="Par65">The second step, for viruses on their way to reach the CNS, is to spread via one of two main routes, blood or peripheral nerves [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Viruses either just float to the brain in the bloodstream, or are transported in white blood cells. The “Trojan horses” for Epstein Barr virus are monocytes. HSV-1 and VZV migrate from the keratinocytes to the peripheral sensory neurons to reach the trigeminal ganglion, where they can be latent for years before being reactivated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The dendrites of the olfactory nerve are in direct contact with mucosa in the nose and offer a unique port of entry for HSV-1, Nipah virus, influenza virus and rabies virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the case of a dog bite, rabies virus first infects the myocytes, and migration via the peripheral somatic nerves follows [
