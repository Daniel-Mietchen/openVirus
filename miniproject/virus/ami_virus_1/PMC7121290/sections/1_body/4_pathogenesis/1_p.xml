<p id="Par64">For neurotropic viruses to be able to cause disease in the brain, a chain of events must happen. Swanson and McGavern outline the current understanding of this process clearly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. First of all the virus has to enter the host. This can happen through inhalation or ingestion, or through the skin. Viruses such as mumps and measles are spread via droplets, and are inhaled to reach the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The fecal-oral route of ingestion is a way for other viruses, such as enteroviruses, to enter through the alimentary tract. Once at the mucosal membrane, the viruses pass the epithelial barrier and cause infection in the lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx and gut. Insect bites, abrasions and wounds all create a back door through which viruses can enter the body via the skin. Langerhans cells carry arboviruses delivered by insect bites to the adjacent lymph nodes [
