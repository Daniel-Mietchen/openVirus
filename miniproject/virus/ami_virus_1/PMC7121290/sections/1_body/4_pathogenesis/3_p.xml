<p id="Par66">The third step, once in closer proximity to the brain parenchyma, is for the virus to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) protecting the brain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] by creating physical, metabolic and transport barriers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The BBB is between the lumen of the blood vessels and the brain parenchyma while the BCSFB is between the CSF and apical choroid plexus blood vessels [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The permeability of these barriers is regulated by tight junctions and adherence junctions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The tight junctions are complexes of different proteins and adhesion molecules, whereas adherence junctions are transmembrane cadherins (named for calcium dependent adhesion) linked to the cytoskeleton [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most viruses enter through the BBB, whilst coxsackie virus-B3, chikungunya virus, mumps virus and echovirus-30 may also use the BCSFB as their port of entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].
