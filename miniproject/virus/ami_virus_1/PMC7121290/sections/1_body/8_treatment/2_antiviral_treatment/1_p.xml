<p id="Par146">Empirical treatment with intravenous acyclovir should be started sooner rather than later, and within 6 hours of hospital admission, if viral encephalitis is strongly suspected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This is usually combined with a third-generation cephalosporin for possible bacterial meningitis. There are two treatment categories. In neonates a higher dosage of acyclovir, 20 mg/kg per dose 8 hourly, is administered and if HSE is confirmed it is continued for a period of 21 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. In children of 28 days to 16 years, acyclovir should be started at 10 mg/kg 8 hourly IVI and continued for 14â€“21 days if HSE is confirmed, and then the LP should be repeated to confirm that the CSF PCR is negative for HSV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. If the PCR is positive in the repeat LP, acyclovir should be continued and PCR should be performed weekly until it becomes negative [
