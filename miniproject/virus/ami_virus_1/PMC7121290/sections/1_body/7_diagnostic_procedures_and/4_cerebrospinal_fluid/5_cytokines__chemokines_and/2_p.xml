The first group (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-8) is involved in innate immunity, the second group (IL-1, IL-4 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-ÃŸ) orchestrates inflammatory processes, the third group (IL-2 and IL-4) is responsible for the activation and proliferation of lymphocytes and the fourth group (IL-1, IL-3, IL-5, IL-6) is involved in leukocyte growth [
