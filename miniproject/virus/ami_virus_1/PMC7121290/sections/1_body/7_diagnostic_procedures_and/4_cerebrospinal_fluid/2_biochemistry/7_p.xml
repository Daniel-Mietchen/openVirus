For viral-related CNS infections the protein is normal or mildly elevated (&lt;0.95 g/L), the glucose ratio normal or decreased (normal = &gt;0.4â€“0.5), and the lactate normal. Albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein and normal CSF cell count) is a strong marker for acute and chronic demyelinating polyneuropathies, but may be detected only after at least 1 week of illness [
