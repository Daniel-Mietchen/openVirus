<p id="Par127">There are immune cells in the CSF of healthy persons, but in limited numbers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The majority of the cells are CD3
 <sup>+</sup> memory T cells, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells. The group of B-cells, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, mast cells, monocytes and polymorphonuclear granulocytes is in the minority and makes up not more than 20â€“30% of the immune cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. CSF leukocytosis is an indicator of an inflammatory process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], but the composition of cells changes constantly during the disease progress and is also influenced by the primary site of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. An increased number of leukocytes is more likely in viral meningitis than in encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If the primary site is the meninges the number of leukocytes in the CSF is increased, with polymorphonuclear granulocytes the dominant cell type early in the disease, followed later on by monocytes and lymphocytes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In encephalitis the CSF may be normal in up to two thirds of cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Sejvar et al. define CSF pleocytosis as &gt;15 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> in babies less than 2 months of age and &gt;5 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> in older infants and children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However the CSF may also be completely acellular, and this has been associated with VZV, Epstein-Barr virus and CMV infections. It is also often observed in immunocompromised patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
