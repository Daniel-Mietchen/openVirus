<p id="Par125">Local IgG synthesis calculation is valuable because the diagnostic sensitivity is high and the false positive rate is low. It is used to determine the minimum amount of local synthesis in the CNS. Any value above the upper limit of normal (0.0 mg/dL) in conjunction with an elevated Q
 <sub>IgG</sub> is strongly suggestive of increased intrathecal IgG synthesis [
