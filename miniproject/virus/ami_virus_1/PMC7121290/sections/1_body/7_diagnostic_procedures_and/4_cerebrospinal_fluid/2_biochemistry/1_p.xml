<p id="Par120">The brain is protected by the BBB and therefore the CSF is merely an ultrafiltrate of plasma filtrates across the BBB, containing water, electrolytes, glucose and protein â€“ mostly albumin because of its low molecular weight. The protein concentration of the CSF is very low in comparison to that of the serum. Under normal conditions albumin is 50% of the total protein in the serum, but the major protein in CSF. Immunoglobulins may be present in the CSF of normal individuals with an intact BBB, in which case the immunoglobulin G (IgG):total CSF protein is in the order of two thirds of the serum IgG:total protein. The CSF protein concentration increases either when the BBB is damaged or when intrathecal IgG production occurs. Various indices help in determining whether the BBB is intact and in ascertaining the contribution of intrathecal IgG synthesis. It is important that serum and CSF are sent to be analyzed simultaneously [
