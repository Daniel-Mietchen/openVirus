<p id="Par121">High resolution electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing are techniques to determine protein bands in specimens. Normal individuals will have no bands in the CSF that do not correspond to bands present in the serum. If there is intrathecal IgG production then additional bands will be detected in the CSF, and if two or more different bands are present these are known as oligoclonal bands. If the BBB is damaged it may help create additional bands. To distinguish between intrathecal IgG production and the contribution from IgG in serum that might have leaked across the BBB, four indices are helpful provided that the tap is not traumatic: the albumin index (Q
 <sub>Alb</sub>), IgG index, IgG synthesis rate and local IgG synthesis [
