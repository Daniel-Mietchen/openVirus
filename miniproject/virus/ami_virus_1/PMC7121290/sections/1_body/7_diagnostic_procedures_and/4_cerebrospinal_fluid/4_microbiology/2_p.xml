<p id="Par130">Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has changed diagnostic virology because it can detect low copy numbers and has a high sensitivity in the detection of viruses, but the diagnostic window has not been clearly described for viruses other than HSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Despite this a CSF specimen for HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV and enteroviruses should be sent for PCR for patients with suspected viral CNS infection, as it will identify 90% of known viral causes. A HSV PCR is often negative for the first 3 days after the onset of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], and then remains positive for the next 7â€“10 days even if acyclovir treatment has been started [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The probability of getting a positive PCR is thus reduced if the sample is taken early (that is, within 3 days) or late (after 14 days) in the course of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. It may be worthwhile to defer the initial LP for two reasons: if there is a contraindication for the LP due to severe cerebral edema, and to give time for the edema to subside and the PCR to have a better diagnostic yield. There is a correlation between viral replication, degree of clinical severity and the possibility of a positive PCR.
