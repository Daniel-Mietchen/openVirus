<p id="Par136">There are certain specific scenarios where serology is beneficial. The presence of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) in CSF is an indication of an intrathecal antiviral immune response and is more useful in RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, which are usually primary infections and not merely reactivations of DNA virus-associated disease [
