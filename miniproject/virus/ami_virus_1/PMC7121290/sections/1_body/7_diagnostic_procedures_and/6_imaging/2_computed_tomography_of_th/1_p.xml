<p id="Par138">It is common practice to perform a CT brain scan before an LP is performed if there is any doubt about relative contraindications. An LP should not be performed if there is overwhelming brain edema with swelling, or any midline shifts or space-occupying lesions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In the case of HSE, a first CT scan may also be normal, with abnormalities detected only in a follow-up scan [
