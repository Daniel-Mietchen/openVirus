<p id="Par137">Acutely ill patients with the possibility of a CNS infection are usually imaged to exclude other possible causes or complications, but the limitations of imaging should always be kept in mind. A recent study by Granerod et al. shows that there is a “subjective component to scan interpretation”. The matter is further complicated by the fact that imaging data are also influenced by the timing of the scan and the specific imaging techniques. These factors directly influence the value of imaging among diagnostic criteria for encephalitis, other than HSE, based on radiological abnormalities. Further research in this area is required [
