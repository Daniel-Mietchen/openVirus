 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The first group of contraindications, which necessitates imaging before an LP, includes the following:

   <p id="Par106">A change in the level of consciousness, or coma. There is no consensus on the depth of the coma, but the British Guidelines recommend that prior imaging is indicated if the Glasgow coma scale is less than 13 or fluctuates more than 2 [
