<p id="Par63">There are many viruses associated with CNS infection. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">4.1</xref> summarizes the global distribution of viruses associated with CNS manifestations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. At least eight virus families have been associated with CNS infection, and these include different species from the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus families 
 <italic>Herpesviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Polyomaviridae</italic>, as well as from the ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus families 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Retroviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae</italic> and

 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">4.2</xref> summarizes the classification of these most common viruses. In general it is accepted that HSV, VZV and enteroviruses, as a group, are responsible for most of the CNS infections in children [
