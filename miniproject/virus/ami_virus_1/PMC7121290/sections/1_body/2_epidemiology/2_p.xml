<p id="Par62">It is difficult to compare incidences and prevalences, because the case definitions used in different studies vary, and most studies reflect the endemic disease in industrialized countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Another contributing factor complicating agreement on incidence and prevalence is that encephalitis is, in most countries, not a notifiable disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Britton et al. (2016) mention incidence ranges of between 2.8 and 10.5 per 100,000 that have been reported in England, Sweden and the USA [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The highest rates have been documented in infants less than 1 year of age. Hospital admissions of children due to encephalitis decreased over a period of 11 years in Australia, but the average hospitalization rate was 5/100,000 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There has been a significant decrease in varicella encephalitis, explained by good varicella vaccine coverage [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. By contrast, an increase in ADEM-related encephalitis has been documented, and ADEM-related encephalitis now accounts for 15â€“17% of encephalitis-related admissions [
