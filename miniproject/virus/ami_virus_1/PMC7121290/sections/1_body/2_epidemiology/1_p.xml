<p id="Par61">The epidemiology of CNS viral infections is a constantly changing scene as new viruses emerge and old ones re-emerge. It is complex, and influenced by the interplay between the three constituents of the “epidemiologic triad”, namely the host, the agent and the environment [

Within dense urban communities, with social behaviour that involves increased promiscuity, with easier methods of travel, and with exposure to exotic pets, viruses can spread with great ease. With advances in health care such as the use of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs in transplant patients, opportunistic infections emerge. The food industry has become mass-production orientated, and this favors more food-borne outbreaks. The natural evolution of viruses may increase the virulence of the organisms. Natural disasters and war responsible for the breakdown of infrastructure, as well as deliberate biological warfare, all contribute to the emergence, re-emergence and spread of viruses [
