<p id="Par80">Focal neurological signs depend on the specific areas of the CNS that may be affected. Focal cortical signs may include, for example, aphasia, alexia or cortical blindness. If the motor area is affected motor weakness may be present, and abnormal sensation is experienced in the case of an affected sensory cortex. Cranial nerve fallout and visual defects are common. Deep tendon reflexes may be either absent or brisk, and primitive reflexes may appear. Cerebellar involvement will manifest as nystagmus, dysmetria, ataxia and dysdiadochokinesia [
