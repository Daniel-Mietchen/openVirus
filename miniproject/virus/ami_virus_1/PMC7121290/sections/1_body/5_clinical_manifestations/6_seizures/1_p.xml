<p id="Par82">Seizures are common in viral encephalitis and are often subtle, but intractable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Such cases may evolve into status epilepticus and even non-convulsive status epilepticus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. If a patient presents with a new-onset status epilepticus a viral cause should be considered [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients with viral encephalitis may have electroclinical dissociation, so that motor activity during the seizure is not visible, and can be detected only with an EEG [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other subtle clinical signs of seizures are a bitten tongue, injuries, and twitching of an eyelid or corner of the mouth [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Failure to control the seizures inevitably increases the metabolic activity, resulting in acidosis with vasodilation and increased ICP [
