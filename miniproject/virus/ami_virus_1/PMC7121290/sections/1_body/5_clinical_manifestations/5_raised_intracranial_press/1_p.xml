<p id="Par81">It is of utmost importance to diagnose raised intracranial pressure (ICP) clinically. The pressure may be normal in viral meningitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], but elevated in encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Infants may have a bulging fontanel, splayed sutures, sunsetting eyes, vomiting, severe irritability or lethargy that may progress into coma [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Older children may have headache, vomiting, cranial nerve IV or VI palsies, a Cushing triad (elevated blood pressure with a slow pulse and respiratory slowing, coma and papilledema) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Papilledema can take days to develop and may be absent in the initial stages. For less experienced clinicians it may be difficult to identify papilledema as a sign of raised ICP. When this is the case it may be helpful to assess the posturing (decorticate or decerebrate), respiratory patterns and pupillary responses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].
