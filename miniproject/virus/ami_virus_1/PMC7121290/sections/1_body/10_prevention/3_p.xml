<p id="Par160">The majority of vaccines are against communicable diseases and very few exist for use against arboviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. In response to this problem scientists are investigating different innovative strategies. Most of these are aimed at preventing the virus from completing its life-cycle in the vector, ultimately preventing transmission to humans. These vaccines are called transmission blocking vaccines [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. One example is dengue virus vaccine. The proteins required in the mosquito for the attachment of the virion to target cells in its midgut, are used in the vaccine as antigens. When a mosquito feeds on a vaccinated human, the antibodies are ingested and subsequently impair the virion attachment in the mosquito, interrupting the completion of its life cycle. This blocks any further transmission by preventing infection of the vector. This type of vaccine is referred to as an “altruistic” vaccine because, while it may not protect the person who has been vaccinated from infection, it prevents the disease from spreading to other members of the community [
