<p id="Par156">A number of studies identify prognostic factors in the acute phase. Cerebral edema, status epilepticus and thrombocytopenia were associated with in-hospital mortality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. The presence of glial and neuroaxonal protein in CSF are indicative of inflammation and neuronal damage and are potential biomarkers to determine prognosis [
