<p id="Par35">Children are often admitted with a differential diagnosis of a possible viral-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection. Viruses affect the CNS in many different ways and clinical manifestations may overlap, resulting in a spectrum of syndromes. Sejvar (2014) eloquently summarizes the different alternatives of the viral-mediated disease in the CNS responsible for these syndromes [

The CNS may also be affected secondarily by a viral-induced immune-mediated attack on the CNS, or indirectly, as seen in liver failure-associated encephalopathy due to viral hepatitis or Reye’s syndrome, which is precipitated by salicylate treatment in children with influenza or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [
