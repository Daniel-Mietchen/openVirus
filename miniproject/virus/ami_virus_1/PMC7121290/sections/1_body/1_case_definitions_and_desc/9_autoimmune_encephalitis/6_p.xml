Furthermore, the CSF and serum antibodies can differ, but the clinical presentation usually correlates with the CSF antibodies. In addition, the concentrations of the antibodies in CSF and serum may vary. There are fewer false positive or negative results with the determination of antibodies in CSF, than in serum [
