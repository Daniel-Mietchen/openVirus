 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MRI is useful, and specific findings have been related to various antibodies [

The MRI in anti-NMDAR encephalitis can be normal in 60% of cases, and the rest may have non-specific findings, best seen on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images demonstrating cortical and subcortical changes in the brain and posterior fossa. Transient meningeal enhancement or demyelination have also been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The MRI in rabies, by contrast, may show changes in the basal ganglia, thalamus, gray matter of the dorsal brain stem and central regions of the spinal cord [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In limbic encephalitis (usually in elderly patients rather than children), uni- or bilateral involvement in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes has been demonstrated on T2/FLAIR images but the diffusion weighted images are normal and there is no meningeal enhancement [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The frontal, occipital and parietal lobes of children, when affected, may have more extensive MRI abnormalities [
