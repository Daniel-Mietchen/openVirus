<p id="Par37">Although it is often difficult to apply specific case definitions for the various viral-related CNS syndromes pedantically in a clinical setting, such definitions are ultimately important in patient management and research. The definitions are based on the anatomic site or sites affected. Sejvar et al. (2007) publish case definitions for encephalitis, myelitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) on behalf of the Brighton Collaboration Encephalitis Working Group [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Britton et al. (2015) compare the different definitions for encephalitis, including the Brighton definition, used in five large epidemiological studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For the purpose of this chapter different definitions have been collated; in essence the key features overlap and represent the main clinical syndromes related to the anatomic site affected. The broader clinical terminology used in the definitions is explained in the section on clinical manifestations.
