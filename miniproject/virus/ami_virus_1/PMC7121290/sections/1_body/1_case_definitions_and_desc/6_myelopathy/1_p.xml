<p id="Par43">Myelopathy is the more diffuse and non-specific involvement of the spinal cord caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) I and II, HIV and in rare occasions by HSV, CMV or enteroviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. HTLV-I causes tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and although these usually present later in life, around the fourth and fifth decades, they have been observed in younger patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The onset of disease is slow but progressive, and associated with backache and typical sparing of the arms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The legs are affected and the clinical signs are stiffness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, dysesthesia and a positive Babinski sign [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The posterior columns are often involved with a loss of position and vibration sense [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A similar presentation has been observed by a number of South African clinicians (unpublished data), who have seen children with HIV-1 infection present with spastic diplegia and no bowel or bladder involvement. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings for the brain and spinal cord are normal. It is unclear whether this may perhaps overlap with HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy, as these patients also present with spastic paraparesis and weakness exceeding the degree of spasticity, with hyperreflexia, positive Babinski signs, ataxic gait and dysmetria, and both bowel and bladder incontinence are present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The position and vibration senses are also affected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The macroscopic examination of the spinal cord and dura mater is normal but there is loss of myelin in the lateral and posterior columns, with spongy degeneration or microvacuolization of the white matter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].
