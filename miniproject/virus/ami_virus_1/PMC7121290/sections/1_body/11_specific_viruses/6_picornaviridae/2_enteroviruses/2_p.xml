 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most of the experimental work done to determine the pathogenesis of nonpolio enterovirus CNS infection is done with coxsackie virus-B3. A key element in the cell migration across the BCSFB into the CSF is CCL12, a monocyte attractant. B-cells are also involved in the “Trojan horse” mechanism. In addition, the coxsackie virus-B3 infects neural stem cells and thus a viral presence persists [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is a very low yield of positive enterovirus PCR in the CSF, but there is often a higher yield in throat swabs and stool specimens. The virus can often persist in the stools for weeks after a gastro-intestinal infection, therefore it is recommended that not only CSF but also peripheral sites are tested [
