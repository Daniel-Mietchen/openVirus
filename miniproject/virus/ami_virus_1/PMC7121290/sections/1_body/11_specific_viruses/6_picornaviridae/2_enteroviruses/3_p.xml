Since 1974, enormous emphasis, initiated by the World Health Organization, has been placed on the eradication of vaccine-preventable diseases, including poliomyelitis.

In polio-endemic countries the WHO recommends a birth OPV dose, followed by a primary series of 3 OPV doses and at least one IPV dose. The primary series is administered from the age of 6 week, at 4 week intervals. The clinical presentation is fairly easy to identify, as patients present with typical lower motor neuron symptoms comprising asymmetrical flaccid paralysis, areflexia, fasciculations and wasting, while sensation remains intact and sphincter functions are not usually affected [
