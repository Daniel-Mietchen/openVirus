<p id="Par184">Outbreaks of WNV are increasing in Europe and North America, and a range of animal models have been studied to explain the pathogenesis. Although a range of cytokines and chemokines that are involved have been identified many questions remain unanswered, but the specific role played by IL-1ÃŸ in the attraction of immune cells and regulation of WNV-induced inflammation is unique, and deserves mention [
