<p id="Par186">CNS infection due to tick-borne encephalitis virus is common in Asia and Europe. Tick-borne encephalitis virus can be contracted not only through tick bites, but also through the ingestion of unpasteurized cow’s or goat’s milk from infected livestock [

The majority of infections are asymptomatic or, at most, associated with flu-like symptoms, and the disease course can be mono- or biphasic. Meningitis, meningoencephalitis or meningoencephalomyelitis, as well as cardiac arrhythmia and autonomic instability, may occur. The Siberian subtype is associated with chronic manifestations that affect cognitive function, hearing, vision and balance, and that may also cause psychiatric disturbances or flaccid paralysis [
