<p id="Par202">The chikungunya virus is a single-stranded RNA virus from the genus 
 <italic>Alphavirus,</italic> with three different genotypes. The genotypes are associated with the region of origin: West Africa, East/Central/South Africa and Asia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several epidemics of this virus have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The CNS is not always affected, and its involvement has been documented in only 16.3% of patients, of which 55.1% presented with encephalitis. The chikungunya virus gains access to the CNS through the olfactory nerve. Although data form a mouse model indicated the upregulation of CCL2, IL-6 and TNF-Î±, the anti-inflammatory response of IL-4 and the immunosuppressive effect of IL-10, the understanding of the neuropathogenesis in chikungunya virus is still unclear [
