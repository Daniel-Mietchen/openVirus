<p id="Par201">Rabies is transmitted not only by infected dog or bat bites, but also through inhalation of droplets, infected donor organs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>] and open wounds if they are licked by a dog infected with rabies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Rabies should always be considered in any child with a rapid progressive encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. As the incubation period can vary from weeks up to 1 year, with an average of 2 months, it may be difficult to link the disease to a specific contact with either bats or infected animals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The prodromal stage is non-specific, with fever, malaise, headache, nausea with vomiting and the more characteristic feature of paresthesia or pain at the point of entry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The disease course is rapid: more specific symptoms, including hypersalivation, agitation, hydrophobia and significant neck stiffness, develop to be followed by coma and subsequently death within 1â€“2 weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The diagnosis relies on serum and CSF serology, but immunohistochemistry on skin may be helpful [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Post-exposure management is important and includes wound treatment, vaccination and immunoglobulin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] as well as prophylaxis of contacts to minimize the risk of secondary transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Death is almost 100% preventable if adequate post-exposure prophylaxis is applied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].
