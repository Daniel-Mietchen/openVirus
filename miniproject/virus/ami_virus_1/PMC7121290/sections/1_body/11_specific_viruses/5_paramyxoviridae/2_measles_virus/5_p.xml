<p id="Par192">It is unclear why the measles virus persists in patients developing SSPE years after an initial uneventful measles rash. Children who develop SSPE are usually between 5 and 15 years old, with males more affected than females [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The onset is unannounced, and hallmarked by behavioral changes, neurocognitive decline and movement disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is often associated with myoclonus, and the EEG pattern is fairly typical. The disease rapidly progresses to a vegetative state, and affected patients may die within months, and up to 3 years after the onset of the disease [
