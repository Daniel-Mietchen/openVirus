<p id="Par182">John Cunningham virus is a double-stranded DNA virus from the family Polyomaviridae [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Infection during childhood is very common and usually asymptomatic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is postulated that the virus may persist as a latent infection in the kidneys or mononuclear cells, and then reactivate if the patient becomes immune suppressed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The cerebral white matter is seriously affected, with patchy and confluent demyelination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Other clinical manifestations include rapid neurocognitive deterioration, focal neurological signs, visual field defects and ataxia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Patients may die within 6 months after the onset of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The diagnosis can be confirmed with CSF PCR or a brain biopsy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].
