<p id="Par165">The central chemokine receptors (CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR3) and related ligands (CCL2 and CCL5) are the main role players in the pathogenesis of HSV-1 infection in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The ligand CCL5 is presented by T-cells and macrophages which are important in leukocyte migration. In an experimental model for HSV-1 and autoimmune encephalitis, the interaction between CCL5 and CCR5 has played an important role in the recruitment of T-cells into the CNS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. The chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CCL9 and CCL10 were elevated in the trigeminal ganglia and brain stems of CCR5
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice infected with HSV-1. The consequence was an increased viral load, followed by an increased CD4
 <sup>+</sup>and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> infiltration in the respected areas [
