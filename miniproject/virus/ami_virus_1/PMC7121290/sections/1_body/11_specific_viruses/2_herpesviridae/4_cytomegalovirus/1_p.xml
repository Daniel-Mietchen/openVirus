<p id="Par176">CMV is the HHV with the largest genome and affects mainly immunocompromised patients, with an expanded range of clinical manifestations including encephalitis, meningitis, extensive transverse myelitis and polyradiculomyelitis. The outcome is highly variable. The major sites of the brain that are affected are the basal ganglia, brain stem and diencephalon. Although astrocytes are commonly infected, almost all the other cell types in the CNS can be involved. Congenital CMV infection causes severe cerebral palsy, cognitive impairment and sensorineural deafness [
