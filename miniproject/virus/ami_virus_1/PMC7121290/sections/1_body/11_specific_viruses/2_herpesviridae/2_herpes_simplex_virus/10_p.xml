<p id="Par172">Imaging, including CT and MRI scans, is helpful in the diagnosis. MRI is more sensitive, and 95% of patients in the California Encephalitis Project had abnormal MRI findings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Although temporal lobe involvement was present in 86% of patients, 59% had extra temporal lobe abnormalities either in association with temporal lobe abnormalities or in isolation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Contrast enhancement in MRI becomes positive over a period of 4â€“90 days after the onset of symptoms. T1-weighted changes develop during the course of the illness and can be normal, high or low. Necrotic lesions develop later, at 2 weeks, after the onset of symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Neonatal MRI images differ from those of older children. The parietal lobes, occipital lobes and insula may be affected more frequently than the temporal lobes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Diffuse white matter lesions occur in patients with relapse HSE [
