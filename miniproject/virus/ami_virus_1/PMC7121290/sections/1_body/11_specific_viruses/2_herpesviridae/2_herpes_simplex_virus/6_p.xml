<p id="Par168">The CSF may be normal in up to 5% of patients, but protein may be elevated and continue to rise even after treatment has been started [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. It may even stay elevated after the treatment is stopped [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In the California Encephalitis Project, only 47% of children with HSE had elevated protein in the CSF, while 95% of them had pleocytosis with a median of 47 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, and the median RBC count was only three cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. De Ti√®ge et al. note also that polymorphonuclear cells may predominate early in the disease process, and the disease may then be mistaken for bacterial infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The RBC may be elevated, reflecting underlying necrosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Glucose in the CSF may be normal or slightly decreased; 13% of patients in the Schleede et al. study had values &lt;2.8 mmol/L [
