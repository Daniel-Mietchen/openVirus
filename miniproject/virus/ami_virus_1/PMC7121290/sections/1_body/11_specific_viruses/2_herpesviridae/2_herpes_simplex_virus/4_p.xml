<p id="Par166">The clinical presentation of children with HSE varies; de Tiège et al. summarize eloquently the spectrum of disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. It can present with acute onset of fever, encephalopathy, seizures and focal signs, but sub-acute and milder forms have also been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. The fever may be absent initially [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Opercular syndrome, hallmarked by dysarthria, dysphagia and oro-facial palsy, may also manifest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In the California Encephalitis Project, two age groups in which HSE peaks were identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. The first group includes younger children, from 6 months to 4 years, and the second peaked in the age group 10–18 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Lethargy, fever, confusion and seizures are the most common manifestations, but seizures are observed more commonly in the younger age group, and the difference is statistically significant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In contrast to adults, children who develop encephalitis with primary HSV infection may be affected by herpes labialis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Deaths observed in this project were all in children older than 13 years, but this point was not statistically significant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].
