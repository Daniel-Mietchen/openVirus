<p id="Par175">A highly contagious virus, VZV presents with fever and a vesicular exanthema [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Two different disease patterns are recognized, namely chickenpox during the primary infection and shingles or herpes zoster during reactivation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. The rash may precede the CNS infection, but it may be completely absent or even appear later [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The CNS is involved in one to three in 10,000 clinical cases, and it manifests as encephalitis, vasculopathy or post-infectious immune-mediated cerebellar ataxia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The latter is often benign and self-limiting, but hydrocephalus may develop if the cerebellum is extensively swollen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Around one third of arterial strokes in children can be associated with VZV; from 1 week up to 48 months after the rash, patients present with acute-onset, but permanent, hemiparesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Other clinical features include transient facial weakness, chorea, seizures, and visual and speech disturbances [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The VZV PCR may be positive in only 30% of cases, but VZV IgG antibodies are positive in as many as 90% of cases. It is recommended that both assays are done [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The CSF IgG levels must be compared to serum VZV IgG to confirm intrathecal synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].
