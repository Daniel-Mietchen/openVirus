<p id="Par180">HHV-6 poses some difficulties to diagnose, because the viral DNA integrates into the host DNA and consequently high levels of HHV-6 DNA are detected in CSF, blood and plasma [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. Another consideration to bear in mind is the fact that the unnecessary use of antibiotics and cortisone in a small child with fever and a skin rash may aggravate viral replication. 
 <italic>In-vitro</italic> experiments have shown that amoxicillin, carbamazepine and valproate activate HHV-6 and cortisone my increase the viral load in CSF [
