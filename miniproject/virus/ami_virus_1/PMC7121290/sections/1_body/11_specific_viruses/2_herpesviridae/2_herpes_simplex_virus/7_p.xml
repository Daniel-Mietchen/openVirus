<p id="Par169">The gold standard for diagnosis remains an HSV PCR [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The PCR may be negative initially, but become positive if the LP is repeated 2â€“4 days later, with a median of 6 days after the onset of symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Multiple hypotheses have been suggested to explain the false negative PCR. One of the reasons may be a very low viral load in the CSF at the onset of the disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. A link between a negative PCR and low CSF protein and white cell count has also been described [
