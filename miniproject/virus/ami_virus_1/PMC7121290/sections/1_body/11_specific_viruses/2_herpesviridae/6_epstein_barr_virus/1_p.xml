<p id="Par181">CNS infection due to Epstein-Barr virus accounts for less than 5% of primary Epstein-Barr virus infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Epstein-Barr virus causes encephalitis and encephalomyelitis in teenagers in the absence of the typical infective mononucleosis features, but it may also occur shortly before, or after, infective mononucleosis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Visual hallucinations may be a specific characteristic in association with other signs of encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The outcome varies, and patients with isolated gray or white matter lesions recover well, but almost half of patients in whom the thalami are affected will have residual effects, and the highest mortality is among patients with brain stem involvement [
