<p id="Par200">Both HTLV-1 and HIV are able to affect the CNS in numerous ways [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The CNS manifestations associated with HIV are often collectively referred to as HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. During the primary infection a dual attack takes place; both the BBB is disrupted and the CNS is invaded via the “Trojan horse” mechanism for the viruses to migrate within the leukocytes to areas out of the reach of antiretroviral drugs. The virus can persist and replicate, causing long-term chronic disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] with a continuous process of monocyte migration, enhanced CCR2 expression on the HIV monocytes, increased levels of CCL2 in CSF, and subsequent migration of CD14
 <sup>+</sup> and CD16
 <sup>+</sup> monocytes into the CNS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is mandatory to test every patient presenting with suspected viral encephalitis for HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A detailed discussion of HIV falls beyond the scope of this chapter.
