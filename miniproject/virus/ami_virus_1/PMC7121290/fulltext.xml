The epidemiology of the pathogens is constantly influenced by the availability, or non-availability, of health care services; preventative strategies; and the process of globalization, with rapid movement of people, animals and products. It is further complicated by natural disasters, wars and changes in lifestyle.</p><p id="Par2">The effects of the neurotropic viruses are discussed against the background of the epidemiology. The pathogenesis is a chain of events with the point of departure when the virus enters the body to spread and reach the different sites of the CNS. The blood-brain barrier and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier are then overcome by captivating mechanisms. Once the different viruses have settled at the preferred site or sites, and have sidestepped the initial immune surveillance, the phases of injury commence. The cytopathic effect of the viruses elicits a para- and post-infectious inflammatory response and a vicious circle of continued damage, viral entry and inflammation results in a process not merely of inflammation, but of intense inflammation.</p><p id="Par3">The different clinical syndromes are then identifiable and should be interpreted against their own specific and appropriate epidemiological backgrounds. Clinicians face the challenge of problematic management decisions while awaiting results on gravely ill patients and differential diagnostic considerations have to be taken into account. Establishing a diagnosis is a two-tier process: first it requires the integration of cerebrospinal fluid findings, imaging results, electrophysiological studies, serology and ancillary blood tests, for example full blood count, liver function tests and other appropriate microbiological investigations, and then these should be correlated with the clinical condition of the patient. Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible.</p><p id="Par4">General treatment principles for stabilizing and maintaining vital functions are crucial and empiric treatment should be initiated as soon as possible. This usually includes a broad-spectrum antibiotic, such as third-generation cephalosporin and acyclovir. As soon as specific etiologies have been excluded antibiotics can be stopped. The use of acyclovir is discussed. In the last section of the chapter specific characteristics of the neurotropic viral families are summarized.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</kwd><kwd>Herpes Simplex Virus</kwd><kwd>West Nile Virus</kwd><kwd>Lumbar Puncture</kwd><kwd>Central Nervous System Infection</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer International Publishing AG 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par35">Children are often admitted with a differential diagnosis of a possible viral-associated central nervous system (CNS) infection. Viruses affect the CNS in many different ways and clinical manifestations may overlap, resulting in a spectrum of syndromes. Sejvar (2014) eloquently summarizes the different alternatives of the viral-mediated disease in the CNS responsible for these syndromes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the more acute phase patients may present with meningitis, encephalitis, myelitis or combinations if multiple regions are affected e.g. meningoencpehalitis or encephalomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. If vasculitis is a prominent component in a specific disease process, patients may present with more focal signs due to areas of infarcts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the long term, reactivation of a dormant infection with episodic recurrence will be observed, or a relentless chronic neurodegenerative process may occur and cause subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) or &#x0201c;slow viruses&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Congenital infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or rubella, may result in neurodevelopmental disorders with a more chronic nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The CNS may also be affected secondarily by a viral-induced immune-mediated attack on the CNS, or indirectly, as seen in liver failure-associated encephalopathy due to viral hepatitis or Reye&#x02019;s syndrome, which is precipitated by salicylate treatment in children with influenza or varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">However, to confirm a specific diagnosis is challenging, because the clinical presentation as well as the special investigations are often non-specific. The aim of this chapter is to outline the facts which are known and the many conundrums still faced, and to aid clinicians in making informed decisions on the management of their patients. General principles applicable to virus-associated CNS infections are discussed in the first part of the chapter, and specific viruses of interest at the end.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Case Definitions and Descriptions of Common Syndromes Associated with Viral Infections of the CNS</title><p id="Par37">Although it is often difficult to apply specific case definitions for the various viral-related CNS syndromes pedantically in a clinical setting, such definitions are ultimately important in patient management and research. The definitions are based on the anatomic site or sites affected. Sejvar et al. (2007) publish case definitions for encephalitis, myelitis and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) on behalf of the Brighton Collaboration Encephalitis Working Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Britton et al. (2015) compare the different definitions for encephalitis, including the Brighton definition, used in five large epidemiological studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. For the purpose of this chapter different definitions have been collated; in essence the key features overlap and represent the main clinical syndromes related to the anatomic site affected. The broader clinical terminology used in the definitions is explained in the section on clinical manifestations.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Encephalitis</title><p id="Par38">Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain tissue with infiltration of inflammatory cell and perivascular cuffing, therefore in essence a histopathological diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], but brain biopsies are impractical and not readily available. A clinical approach has thus been followed, and case definitions have been formulated in a number of excellent epidemiological studies, but these definitions vary slightly, for example in the age of the patients and inclusion criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">In practice the definition of encephalitis depends on the presence of clinical signs due to the involvement of the brain tissue itself manifesting as encephalopathy for a period of at least 24 hours and/or specific neurological features with evidence of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The indicators of inflammation are fever, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis, and electroencephalogram (EEG) and neuroimaging findings consistent with encephalitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. One of the most useful ways to think of infection is &#x0201c;fever for infection&#x0201d;. The clinical signs of encephalitis are usually non specific but not subtle. However, in immune suppressed patients they may be subtle and often also chronic. The encephalopathy is not due to other metabolic causes, toxins, other neurological disorders or systemic infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It can be caused by a wide variety of etiological factors including viruses, bacteria, parasites, atypical bacteria or immune-mediated processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], but the specific etiology is only confirmed in 60% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The disease course can be acute, sub-acute or chronic, and it is determined by the immune status of the patient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Viruses responsible for sub-acute or chronic presentations in immunocompromised patients are measles virus causing inclusion body encephalitis, VZV causing multifocal leukoencephalopathy, CMV, herpes simplex virus (HSV) type 2, human herpes virus (HHV) type 6, enteroviruses, John Cunningham virus and BK virus causing progressive multi-focal leukoencephalopathy and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In immune competent patients John Cunningham virus and BK virus can also cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, whereas measles virus causes SSPE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Meningitis</title><p id="Par40">In contrast to viral encephalitis, the brain tissue is not involved in viral meningitis and the patients do not have an associated encephalopathy or myelitis, but they present with the triad of fever, headache and signs of meningeal irritation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Viral meningitis is also referred to as aseptic meningitis if the bacterial cultures are negative where meningitis has been suspected and no antibiotics were administered before the lumbar puncture (LP) was done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is often a mild disease, which has a favorable outcome with complete recovery within 7&#x02013;10 days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Enteroviruses are identified in up to 95% of aseptic meningitis cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Meningoencephalitis</title><p id="Par41">If both the brain parenchyma and the meninges are affected it is referred to as meningoencephalitis. It is often difficult to assess signs of meningeal irritation in an encephalopathic patient and confirm meningeal involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Myelitis</title><p id="Par42">Myelitis implies that inflammation of the spinal cord parenchyma is present, usually in the anterior horn cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The viruses implicated are enteroviruses, arboviruses, HSV-1, VZV, poliovirus and coxsackie virus-A and B. If both the brain parenchyma and the spinal cord are affected it is called encephalomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Patients present with acute flaccid paralysis. Transverse myelitis is a post-infectious demyelination, with 20&#x02013;40% of patients showing evidence of a viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Myelopathy</title><p id="Par43">Myelopathy is the more diffuse and non-specific involvement of the spinal cord caused by human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) I and II, HIV and in rare occasions by HSV, CMV or enteroviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. HTLV-I causes tropical spastic paraparesis and HTLV-I-associated myelopathy, and although these usually present later in life, around the fourth and fifth decades, they have been observed in younger patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The onset of disease is slow but progressive, and associated with backache and typical sparing of the arms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The legs are affected and the clinical signs are stiffness, spasticity, hyperreflexia, dysesthesia and a positive Babinski sign [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The posterior columns are often involved with a loss of position and vibration sense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A similar presentation has been observed by a number of South African clinicians (unpublished data), who have seen children with HIV-1 infection present with spastic diplegia and no bowel or bladder involvement. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings for the brain and spinal cord are normal. It is unclear whether this may perhaps overlap with HIV-associated vacuolar myelopathy, as these patients also present with spastic paraparesis and weakness exceeding the degree of spasticity, with hyperreflexia, positive Babinski signs, ataxic gait and dysmetria, and both bowel and bladder incontinence are present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The position and vibration senses are also affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The macroscopic examination of the spinal cord and dura mater is normal but there is loss of myelin in the lateral and posterior columns, with spongy degeneration or microvacuolization of the white matter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis</title><p id="Par44">Although ADEM is one of the immune-mediated encephalitides, it is referred to regularly in pediatrics and therefore merits being singled out and set into the context of encephalitis. It is a monophasic syndrome with focal or disseminated demyelination and inflammation of the brain parenchyma. It is also regarded as one of the CNS demyelinating conditions, which include transverse myelitis, optic neuritis, acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis and multiple sclerosis. It has an immunological basis and is usually preceded by an infection or vaccination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The Encephalitis/ADEM Working Group emphasizes the fact that encephalomyelitis or ADEM that occurs after the administration of an inactivated component or live vaccine is not inevitably the result of the vaccine, but may be just temporarily associated with it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par45">The clinical features overlap significantly with encephalitis, but in essence encephalitis is predominantly a grey matter problem as a result of the cytopathic effect on the cell bodies in the cortex, basal ganglia and thalami, presenting with a change in the sensorium and with seizures, as opposed to ADEM, which is primarily a white matter disease. Features of white matter disease or demyelination are spasticity, optic neuritis and/or atrophy, ataxia, neuropathy, myelopathy and occasionally seizures; the sensorium is affected to a lesser extent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">A mild pleocytosis may be present, but oligoclonal bands are less common (less than 7%). MRI is helpful to identify the demyelination of ADEM. In the absence of specific biomarkers of ADEM, diagnostic criteria have been formulated. A diagnosis of ADEM can be confirmed if all five of the following criteria are met [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par47">It is the first episode of a presumed inflammatory demyelinating disorder resulting in multifocal CNS manifestations</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par48">There is encephalopathy without fever</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par49">An MRI is abnormal, with lesions predominantly in the cerebral white matter.

The first line of treatment includes steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and/or plasma exchange. Second line therapy is azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab or other treatments. In some centers, rituximab is used as a first-line treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Brain Stem Encephalitis</title><p id="Par53">Brain stem encephalitis, or rhombencephalitis, is the result of para-neoplastic syndromes or bacterial and viral infections. The viruses implicated are enteroviruses (specifically enterovirus-71), flaviviruses, alphaviruses and rabies. Patients present with typical brain stem symptoms including lower cranial nerve palsies, myoclonus, respiratory drive disturbances, autonomic dysfunction and locked-in syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. There are MRI changes in the brain stem and basal enhancement with gadolinium contrast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par54">Bickerstaff&#x02019;s encephalitis has a classic triad of symptoms of abnormal mental status, bilateral external ophthalmoplegia and ataxia, and relates to Miller-Fisher syndrome. Collectively, this has been referred to by some clinicians as GQ1b antibody syndrome, because the IgG anti-GQ1b is highly specific for these conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Autoimmune Encephalitis</title><p id="Par55">Immune-mediated encephalitides form a broad group of disorders including ADEM, but the recently described group of encephalitides associated with antibodies against the proteins in the synapses and cell surfaces of neurons or with antibodies against intracellular antigens, is specifically referred to as autoimmune encephalitis and is potentially treatable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Demyelinating disorders can present as autoimmune encephalitis, but the two entities can co-occur and must rather be investigated separately than seen as an expansion of the spectrum of a single disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p id="Par56">The constant discoveries of new antibodies over the past decade have revealed novel mechanisms in the pathogenesis of altered memory, cognition, behavior, psychosis, seizures and movement disorders. A detailed discussion of the different antibodies falls beyond the scope of this chapter because many are more frequently associated with disease manifestations in adults. Leypoldt et al. (2015) have reviewed them in great detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p id="Par57">In a multicenter study in England in which the etiology of encephalitis was studied, an immune-mediated etiology was identified in 21% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In the California Encephalitis Project, the frequency of anti-<italic>N</italic>-methyl-<italic>D-</italic>aspartate receptor (anti-NMDAR) encephalitis was four times higher than that of viral-mediated encephalitis and 65% of the patients were younger than 18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although anti-NMDAR encephalitis has been associated with tumors, mostly ovarian teratomas, it is seldom present in children younger than 12 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. To complicate matters even further, it has also been found that herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is able to trigger autoimmune encephalitis through synaptic autoimmunity or choreo-athetosis post-HSE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par58">Autoimmune encephalitis, rather than a primary viral encephalitis, should be considered in a patient presenting with a movement disorder and psychiatric disturbances (psychosis, catatonia and abnormal behavior) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Other associated clinical features may be diverse but may include seizures, language disturbances, a change in the level of consciousness, and autonomic disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Fever may be present during the course of the disease in 50% of cases and there may be a history of prodromal flu-like symptoms with headache [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In the reactivation of VZV, skin lesions may or may not be present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In anti-NMDAR encephalitis, rabies might be considered in the differential diagnosis, because the patient may also have severe agitation, hypersalivation and dyskinesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par59">Standard diagnostic tests are used in correlation with the clinical facts to make a preliminary diagnosis in order to initiate treatment while awaiting more specific confirmatory test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The CSF reveals a mild pleocytosis, normal glucose and mildly elevated protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. MRI is useful, and specific findings have been related to various antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The MRI in anti-NMDAR encephalitis can be normal in 60% of cases, and the rest may have non-specific findings, best seen on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI images demonstrating cortical and subcortical changes in the brain and posterior fossa. Transient meningeal enhancement or demyelination have also been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The MRI in rabies, by contrast, may show changes in the basal ganglia, thalamus, gray matter of the dorsal brain stem and central regions of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. In limbic encephalitis (usually in elderly patients rather than children), uni- or bilateral involvement in the medial aspects of the temporal lobes has been demonstrated on T2/FLAIR images but the diffusion weighted images are normal and there is no meningeal enhancement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The frontal, occipital and parietal lobes of children, when affected, may have more extensive MRI abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p id="Par60">The gold standard for the confirmation of a diagnosis is to prove the presence of the specific antibodies, but the absence of autoantibodies does not exclude the diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. It is important to test for antibodies in the serum as well as in the CSF, because some of the antibodies may be detected only in the CSF. Furthermore, the CSF and serum antibodies can differ, but the clinical presentation usually correlates with the CSF antibodies. In addition, the concentrations of the antibodies in CSF and serum may vary. There are fewer false positive or negative results with the determination of antibodies in CSF, than in serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Epidemiology</title><p id="Par61">The epidemiology of CNS viral infections is a constantly changing scene as new viruses emerge and old ones re-emerge. It is complex, and influenced by the interplay between the three constituents of the &#x0201c;epidemiologic triad&#x0201d;, namely the host, the agent and the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. With modernization and constant population growth and increase in population density, not only is the transmission of infectious agents between humans easier, but zoonotic transmission is also favored [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Within dense urban communities, with social behaviour that involves increased promiscuity, with easier methods of travel, and with exposure to exotic pets, viruses can spread with great ease. With advances in health care such as the use of chemotherapy and immunosuppressive drugs in transplant patients, opportunistic infections emerge. The food industry has become mass-production orientated, and this favors more food-borne outbreaks. The natural evolution of viruses may increase the virulence of the organisms. Natural disasters and war responsible for the breakdown of infrastructure, as well as deliberate biological warfare, all contribute to the emergence, re-emergence and spread of viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par62">It is difficult to compare incidences and prevalences, because the case definitions used in different studies vary, and most studies reflect the endemic disease in industrialized countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Another contributing factor complicating agreement on incidence and prevalence is that encephalitis is, in most countries, not a notifiable disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Britton et al. (2016) mention incidence ranges of between 2.8 and 10.5 per 100,000 that have been reported in England, Sweden and the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The highest rates have been documented in infants less than 1 year of age. Hospital admissions of children due to encephalitis decreased over a period of 11 years in Australia, but the average hospitalization rate was 5/100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. There has been a significant decrease in varicella encephalitis, explained by good varicella vaccine coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Pathogenesis</title><p id="Par64">For neurotropic viruses to be able to cause disease in the brain, a chain of events must happen. Swanson and McGavern outline the current understanding of this process clearly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. First of all the virus has to enter the host. This can happen through inhalation or ingestion, or through the skin. Viruses such as mumps and measles are spread via droplets, and are inhaled to reach the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract. The fecal-oral route of ingestion is a way for other viruses, such as enteroviruses, to enter through the alimentary tract. Once at the mucosal membrane, the viruses pass the epithelial barrier and cause infection in the lymphoid tissue of the oropharynx and gut. Insect bites, abrasions and wounds all create a back door through which viruses can enter the body via the skin. Langerhans cells carry arboviruses delivered by insect bites to the adjacent lymph nodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par65">The second step, for viruses on their way to reach the CNS, is to spread via one of two main routes, blood or peripheral nerves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Viruses either just float to the brain in the bloodstream, or are transported in white blood cells. The &#x0201c;Trojan horses&#x0201d; for Epstein Barr virus are monocytes. HSV-1 and VZV migrate from the keratinocytes to the peripheral sensory neurons to reach the trigeminal ganglion, where they can be latent for years before being reactivated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The dendrites of the olfactory nerve are in direct contact with mucosa in the nose and offer a unique port of entry for HSV-1, Nipah virus, influenza virus and rabies virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the case of a dog bite, rabies virus first infects the myocytes, and migration via the peripheral somatic nerves follows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">The third step, once in closer proximity to the brain parenchyma, is for the virus to overcome the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) protecting the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] by creating physical, metabolic and transport barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The BBB is between the lumen of the blood vessels and the brain parenchyma while the BCSFB is between the CSF and apical choroid plexus blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The permeability of these barriers is regulated by tight junctions and adherence junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The tight junctions are complexes of different proteins and adhesion molecules, whereas adherence junctions are transmembrane cadherins (named for calcium dependent adhesion) linked to the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Most viruses enter through the BBB, whilst coxsackie virus-B3, chikungunya virus, mumps virus and echovirus-30 may also use the BCSFB as their port of entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">There are six different possible mechanisms for viruses to cross the barriers:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par68">Virus-carrying white blood cells squeeze through between the endothelial cells and deposit the viruses in the brain parenchyma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par69">Some viruses enter the vascular endothelial cells directly and then cross over into the CSF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par70">The open pores in the choroid plexus provide for direct entry of viruses into the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par71">The BBB is not intact in the circumventricular organs, for example the area postrema and lamina terminalis.

The BBB acts as a strong immunological barrier and hampers the migration of leukocytes into the parenchyma, while the BCSF is regarded as a selective gate primarily responsible for immune surveillance in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par75">Step five is the phase of injury, hallmarked by a cascade of events.

This blocks any further transmission by preventing infection of the vector.

Although the outcome of viral encephalitis varies, the morbidity and mortality are significant. Prompt treatment with antiviral treatment may alter the outcome and is usually started empirically when viral encephalitis is suspected, but it is effective for HSV and, to a lesser extent, VZV. Aggressive treatment with immune modulating drugs has been successful in autoimmune-mediated encephalitides. The value of routine use of steroids in viral encephalitis is not clear. Prevention is an important aspect of virus management and the drive to develop new vaccines is ongoing and important.
