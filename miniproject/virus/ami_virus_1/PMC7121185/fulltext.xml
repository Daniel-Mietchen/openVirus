Viral infections (SARS, MERS-CoV, Zika, Chikungunya, West Nile, Ebola virus infection, etc.) emerged or re-emerged with threatening outbreaks. However, viral emerging infections in some instances represented marginally a concern for developed countries that were just lapped by them. Currently, the new emergency is represented by antimicrobial resistance in bacterial infections, that is, a matter of extreme importance in developed and developing countries, where this issue has become a top priority for global policy makers and public health authorities. New mechanisms of resistance continue to emerge and spread globally, threatening our ability to treat common infections. The overuse and misuse of antimicrobials both in the human and animal field, and their dispersion in the environment pose a risk for selection of mechanisms of resistance of germs. Some settings, like the healthcare facilities, where the use of antimicrobials is obviously intense and infection prevention and control can be poor, represent the reservoir for multidrug-resistant organisms and, sometimes, the melting pot for pan-resistant strains.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Infections</kwd><kwd>Healthcare-associated infections</kwd><kwd>Antimicrobial resistance</kwd><kwd>One Health</kwd><kwd>Emerging infectious diseases</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">At the beginning of 2015, the British Economist Jim O&#x02019;Neill chaired a review of antimicrobial resistance, commissioned by the UK Government and the Wellcome Trust; on May 2016, he published a report titled &#x0201c;Tackling drug-resistant infections globally: final report and recommendations.&#x0201d; In this report, the estimate of the burden of antimicrobial resistance in the next decades was shocking. He estimated that &#x0201c;by 2050, 10 million lives a year and a cumulative 100 trillion USD of economic output are at risk due to the rise of drug-resistant infections if we do not find proactive solutions now to slow down the rise of drug resistance.

Many illnesses &#x02026; had been completely exterminated; others had &#x02026; largely under control&#x02026;.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Up to 1960, antibiotics were extensively developed by pharmaceutical industries and immunization added to this optimism. All this contributed to the sentence, today ironically mentioned almost in every conference dealing with antimicrobial resistance and emerging infection, by the Surgeon General William H. Stewart to the US Congress that it was time to &#x0201c;close the book on infectious diseases&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">All this determined a drastical reduction of funding for the research against infectious diseases. Pharmaceutical companies shut down the development of new antibiotics and only few drops come out of the pipeline. In much of the developed world, the public had forgotten the impact of infectious diseases on previous generations and shared in the confidence that modern medicine and technology would prevail.</p><p id="Par10">In the late 1970s&#x02013;early 1980s, this atmosphere of optimism was clouded by some dramatic epidemics that changed the feeling and opinion on the future of infectious diseases. Since 1976, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease was spreading in Zaire with a mortality rate up to 88%; however, the emergence of a new disease in United States, namely the Legionnaire disease outbreak at Philadelphia in 1976, was the first sign of something changing between humans and organisms, and of the susceptibility of people with comorbidities to emerging infectious agents. Finally, what completely changed the history of infectious diseases was the emergence of the first cases of pneumocistosis at S. Francisco in 1981, and the subsequent discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that caused opportunistic infections (AIDS) in infected individuals. Other emerging infections occurred worldwide later on, including Hantavirus epidemic in United States in 1993, H5N1 influenza in China in 1993, Diphtheria in Eastern Europe in 1997 after the fall of the barriers from West and East Europe, SARS in Asia in 2003, etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>What Are Emerging Infectious Diseases (EIDs)?</title><p id="Par11">EIDs are not only those infections that create social alarm when the media discover them, they include [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par12">events caused by newly evolved organisms, such as multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, plasmid-mediated colistin resistance in Gram negatives, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, etc.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par13">infections caused by germs entering human population for the first time recently, such as HIV-1 infection in 1981, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, Middle East respiratory syndrome caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV) that was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par14">infections caused by pathogens that are historically present, but with a recent dramatic increase, such as Ebola virus disease in Democratic Republic of Congo in 2018</p></list-item></list></p><p id="Par15">The main concern for EIDs is represented by their capability of spreading causing epidemic/pandemic and social alarm.

The big economical expansion of Asian countries and their international trade seemed to be hampered by the fear of contagion. Luckily, the outbreak was limited and the alert quickly returned. However, this outbreak raised attention to the fact that emerging infections originate largely from animals (zoonosis).</p><p id="Par23">Indeed, SARS was introduced into humans from civet cats sold for consumption at markets, which had acquired infection from the original reservoir, horseshoe bats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This was the first signal that new infections were under the corner. As a matter of concern, the source of EIDs is often from animals (zoonosis), that more commonly have a wildlife, as is the case of Nipah virus in Perak, Malaysia, and SARS in Guangdong Province, China. Indeed, zoonotic viral EIDs represent a major and increasing threat to global health.</p><p id="Par24">If viral emerging infections represent a concern mainly in the underdeveloped area of the world, the emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a growing problem worldwide but especially in developing and high income countries, where misuse and overuse of antibiotics among humans and in the veterinary setting, including animal feeding, artificially created the selection of resistant strains.</p><p id="Par25">Resistance to antimicrobials is a natural process that occurred before the discovery of antibiotics. In 1931, a sulfa drug, prontosil rubrum, was the first clinically useful antibacterial agent to be discovered. However, prontosil was not the first antibacterial agent to be invented, and humans were not the initial inventors. According to sophisticated genetic analysis, it is clear that bacteria invented antibiotics and consequently induced antibiotic resistance mechanisms somewhere between 2 and 2.5 billion years ago. Bacteria have been killing each other with these weapons, and using resistance mechanisms to protect themselves against these weapons, for 20 million times longer than we have even known that antibiotics exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This was surprisingly discovered in a deep cave explored in New Mexico in 2011, isolated from the surface of the planet for 4 million years, in which scientists cultured many different types of bacteria from the walls of the caves. Resistance to at least one modern antibiotic was found in many isolated organisms, and some of them were multidrug resistant, even to modern antibiotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">However, nowadays the process for creating resistant organisms has been accelerated because overuse of antimicrobials has increased the rate at which resistance is developing and spreading. Indeed, currently the major drivers behind the occurrence and spread of antimicrobial resistance are represented by the use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary field, and by the transmission of resistant organisms between humans, animals, and environment. On the other side, we lack new drugs to challenge these new superbugs. This results in facing a growing enemy with a largely depleted armory. While antimicrobial overuse/misuse determines ecological pressure on bacteria and contributes to the emergence and selection of AMR, poor infection prevention, and control practices is the main cause for the further spread of these bacteria.</p><p id="Par27">From a microbiological point of view, over the past decades, bacteria with specific clones expressing resistant to several antimicrobials spread worldwide. This is the case of Enterobacteriaceae, mainly <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> resistant to carbapenems with different resistance enzymes including KPC (<italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> carbapenemase), NDM-1 (New Delhi Metalloprotease), and other metallo-betalactamases. More recent pan-resistant strains, expressing also resistance to polymixins, have been identified as cause of severe diseases; some colistin-resistant strains had a chromosomal resistance, likely induced by antibiotic pressure, but in other cases colistin resistance was linked to mobile elements, plasmids, like MCR-1 and others. This emerging resistance represents an important concern due to its potential for spreading among bacteria of different species; as evidenced recently in China, environment is one of the main sources of these mobile elements, likely due to the wide use of colistin in agriculture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">Antimicrobial resistance is commonly found in organisms that cause healthcare-associated infections, but it is not only a matter of hospitals and other healthcare facilities because it is widespread also in the community.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>The Healthcare-Associated Infections and Their Burden of Antimicrobial Resistance in the&#x000a0;New Millennium</title><p id="Par29">Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) can be acquired during home, outpatient, long term or hospital care; they represent one of the greatest challenges of modern medicine. In United States, according to the Institute of Medicine, nosocomial infections now concern 5&#x02013;15 per 100 hospitalized patients and can lead to complications in 25&#x02013;50% of those admitted to intensive care units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. From 2016 to 2017, a large point prevalence survey of HAI and antimicrobial use was conducted in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) including 310,755 patients from 1209 acute care hospitals in 28 countries and 117,138 residents from 2221 long-term care facilities in 23 countries. The authors estimated that 6.5% (cumulative 95% confidence interval (cCI): 5.4&#x02013;7.8%) patients in acute care hospitals and 3.9% (95% cCI: 2.4&#x02013;6.0%) residents in long-term care facilities had at least one HAI. It means that in Europe, on any given day, more than 98,000 patients in acute care hospitals and around 130,000 residents in long-term care facilities had an HAI. The burden of HAI is therefore alarming, with around 9 million infections yearly in acute care hospitals and 4.4 million in long-term care facilities. More than a quarter of HAIs were respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia, followed by urinary tract infections (18.9%), surgical site infections (18.4%), bloodstream infection (8.9%), and gastrointestinal infections (8.9%).
