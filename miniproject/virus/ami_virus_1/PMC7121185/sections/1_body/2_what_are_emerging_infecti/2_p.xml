Moreover, war events often stop or deteriorate ongoing infection prevention and control programs, both in the community and healthcare setting, including vaccination, medication supply, access to surgical and medical care, etc. [

   <p id="Par17">Crowding: micro-organisms often require close contact for their direct or indirect transmission; this is valid both for community (SARS, MERS-CoV) and healthcare-associated infection. Crowding is a condition that can facilitate the transmission of potentially life-threatening infections because of the likelihood of reaching susceptible hosts and, as it is the case of patients in crowded healthcare facilities, for the easier probability to have limited/poor infection control measures and understaffing.</p>

Travel can model infectious disease dynamics by introducing potential pathogens into susceptible populations or by modifying the rate of contacts and exposures between infected and susceptible individuals.</p>
