<p id="Par10">In the late 1970sâ€“early 1980s, this atmosphere of optimism was clouded by some dramatic epidemics that changed the feeling and opinion on the future of infectious diseases. Since 1976, an outbreak of Ebola virus disease was spreading in Zaire with a mortality rate up to 88%; however, the emergence of a new disease in United States, namely the Legionnaire disease outbreak at Philadelphia in 1976, was the first sign of something changing between humans and organisms, and of the susceptibility of people with comorbidities to emerging infectious agents. Finally, what completely changed the history of infectious diseases was the emergence of the first cases of pneumocistosis at S. Francisco in 1981, and the subsequent discovery of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that caused opportunistic infections (AIDS) in infected individuals. Other emerging infections occurred worldwide later on, including Hantavirus epidemic in United States in 1993, H5N1 influenza in China in 1993, Diphtheria in Eastern Europe in 1997 after the fall of the barriers from West and East Europe, SARS in Asia in 2003, etc. [
