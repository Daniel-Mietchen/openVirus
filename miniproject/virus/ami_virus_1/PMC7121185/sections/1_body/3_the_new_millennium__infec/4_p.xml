<p id="Par25">Resistance to antimicrobials is a natural process that occurred before the discovery of antibiotics. In 1931, a sulfa drug, prontosil rubrum, was the first clinically useful antibacterial agent to be discovered. However, prontosil was not the first antibacterial agent to be invented, and humans were not the initial inventors. According to sophisticated genetic analysis, it is clear that bacteria invented antibiotics and consequently induced antibiotic resistance mechanisms somewhere between 2 and 2.5 billion years ago. Bacteria have been killing each other with these weapons, and using resistance mechanisms to protect themselves against these weapons, for 20 million times longer than we have even known that antibiotics exist [

This was surprisingly discovered in a deep cave explored in New Mexico in 2011, isolated from the surface of the planet for 4 million years, in which scientists cultured many different types of bacteria from the walls of the caves. Resistance to at least one modern antibiotic was found in many isolated organisms, and some of them were multidrug resistant, even to modern antibiotics [
