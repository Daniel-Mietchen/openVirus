<p id="Par26">However, nowadays the process for creating resistant organisms has been accelerated because overuse of antimicrobials has increased the rate at which resistance is developing and spreading. Indeed, currently the major drivers behind the occurrence and spread of antimicrobial resistance are represented by the use of antimicrobials in human and veterinary field, and by the transmission of resistant organisms between humans, animals, and environment. On the other side, we lack new drugs to challenge these new superbugs. This results in facing a growing enemy with a largely depleted armory. While antimicrobial overuse/misuse determines ecological pressure on bacteria and contributes to the emergence and selection of AMR, poor infection prevention, and control practices is the main cause for the further spread of these bacteria.</p>
