<p id="Par27">From a microbiological point of view, over the past decades, bacteria with specific clones expressing resistant to several antimicrobials spread worldwide. This is the case of Enterobacteriaceae, mainly 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> resistant to carbapenems with different resistance enzymes including KPC (
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> carbapenemase), NDM-1 (New Delhi Metalloprotease), and other metallo-betalactamases. More recent pan-resistant strains, expressing also resistance to polymixins, have been identified as cause of severe diseases; some colistin-resistant strains had a chromosomal resistance, likely induced by antibiotic pressure, but in other cases colistin resistance was linked to mobile elements, plasmids, like MCR-1 and others. This emerging resistance represents an important concern due to its potential for spreading among bacteria of different species; as evidenced recently in China, environment is one of the main sources of these mobile elements, likely due to the wide use of colistin in agriculture [
