<p id="Par2">At the beginning of 2015, the British Economist Jim O’Neill chaired a review of antimicrobial resistance, commissioned by the UK Government and the Wellcome Trust; on May 2016, he published a report titled “Tackling drug-resistant infections globally: final report and recommendations.” In this report, the estimate of the burden of antimicrobial resistance in the next decades was shocking. He estimated that “by 2050, 10 million lives a year and a cumulative 100 trillion USD of economic output are at risk due to the rise of drug-resistant infections if we do not find proactive solutions now to slow down the rise of drug resistance. Even today, 700,000 people die of resistant infections every year” [
