<p id="Par32">Rates of antimicrobial resistance in Europe are annually assessed by the European Centers for Disease Control (ECDC). In their last report [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], ECDC well describes the situation of antimicrobial resistance in Europe. For 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>, more than half (58.2%) of the isolates reported to EARS-Net for 2017 were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial groups under regular surveillance, i.e., aminopenicillins, fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems. Resistance was the highest for aminopenicillins (58.7%) and lowest, fortunately, for carbapenems (less than 1%).
