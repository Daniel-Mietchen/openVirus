 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> is one of the biggest issues in Europe and worldwide. At the EU/EEA level, more than a third (34.1%) of the isolates reported to EARS-Net for 2017 were resistant to at least one of the antimicrobial groups under regular surveillance, i.e., fluoroquinolones, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and carbapenems. Carbapenem resistance was on average 7.2%, but the range was extremely variable with highest rates, up to 65%, in Southern/Eastern Europe.
