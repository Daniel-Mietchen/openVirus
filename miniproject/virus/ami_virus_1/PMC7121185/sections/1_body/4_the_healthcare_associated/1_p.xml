<p id="Par29">Healthcare-associated infections (HAI) can be acquired during home, outpatient, long term or hospital care; they represent one of the greatest challenges of modern medicine. In United States, according to the Institute of Medicine, nosocomial infections now concern 5–15 per 100 hospitalized patients and can lead to complications in 25–50% of those admitted to intensive care units [

From 2016 to 2017, a large point prevalence survey of HAI and antimicrobial use was conducted in the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) including 310,755 patients from 1209 acute care hospitals in 28 countries and 117,138 residents from 2221 long-term care facilities in 23 countries. The authors estimated that 6.5% (cumulative 95% confidence interval (cCI): 5.4–7.8%) patients in acute care hospitals and 3.9% (95% cCI: 2.4–6.0%) residents in long-term care facilities had at least one HAI. It means that in Europe, on any given day, more than 98,000 patients in acute care hospitals and around 130,000 residents in long-term care facilities had an HAI. The burden of HAI is therefore alarming, with around 9 million infections yearly in acute care hospitals and 4.4 million in long-term care facilities. More than a quarter of HAIs were respiratory tract infections, mainly pneumonia, followed by urinary tract infections (18.9%), surgical site infections (18.4%), bloodstream infection (8.9%), and gastrointestinal infections (8.9%). Among the latter around half of them were
