<p id="Par43">We designed a slide microscope kit named “Virus Goes Viral” that explores giant virus particles and some aspects of animal virus interactions with cells, with the aim to provide an innovative approach in virology teaching. Slides were produced by staining, with crystal violet, purified giant viruses and BSC-40 and Vero cells infected with viruses of the genera 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Alphavirus</italic>. The kit contains a slide for viral factory visualization in amoebas stained with the hemacolor kit as well as associated teaching materials on a CD-ROM, including high-resolution model images of each slide and CPE images of several giant viruses in 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> and 
 <italic>V. vermiformis</italic>. This kit has been used in practical virology classes for the Biological Sciences course (UFMG, Brazil), and it will soon be made available at a low cost to elementary school teachers in institutions that have microscopes. We hope this tool will foster an inspiring learning environment about virology.
