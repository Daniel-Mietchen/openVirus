<p id="Par35">The slides produced with the purified viral particles stained with crystal violet allowed a simple evaluation of the distinct morphology and particle sizes for each isolate (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). CVG, OBRV, and PDV particles were ovoid and measured ~ 1 μm in size and ~ 0.5 μm in diameter (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). NYMV particles were ~ 0.6 μm and appeared spherical when viewed with optical microscopy. TPV particles were large and strongly stained with crystal violet. They appeared to have a spherical head and a cylindrical tail under optical microscopy (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).
