<p id="Par37">Two cell lines were infected with different viruses to produce CPE slides (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). BSC-40 cells assays provided visibly distinct lysis plaques after infection with different viruses. CPXV generated large circular plaques of clear destruction with very stained round cell remains (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The presence of A-type eosinophilic inclusion bodies was also observed in CPXV-infected BSC-40 cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). These inclusion bodies appeared as large pink circles in the host cell cytoplasm (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>, black arrow). Both VACV groups presented a distinct plaque phenotype; group I showed small lysis plaques, while group II showed large plaques with very stained and stretched cells that formed a web (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). There were lysis plaques generated by arbovirus infection in the Vero cell monolayers. YFV generated largely undefined edge lysis plaques that included numerous stretched cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). CHIKV presented large circular plaques, while MAYV showed small undefined edge lysis plaques (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>).
