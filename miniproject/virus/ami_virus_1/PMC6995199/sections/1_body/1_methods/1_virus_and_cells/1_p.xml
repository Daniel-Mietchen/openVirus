<p id="Par28">TPV, CVG, PDV, and Niemeyer virus (NYMV) were propagated individually using 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba castellanii</italic> (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] 30010) cultured at 32 °C in 175 cm
 <sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks with 50 mL peptone-yeast extract with glucose (PYG) medium supplemented with 25 mg/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone; Cristalia, São Paulo, Brazil) and 500 U/ml penicillin (Schering-Plough, Brazil). The amoebae were infected with at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01. Cells were incubated until the expected CPEs appeared in culture, and the media was collected by two centrifugation steps. 
 <italic>A. castellanii</italic> cells and cellular debris were first removed by centrifugation (400 x g for 10 min), and the particles were purified by centrifugation (36,000 x g for 1 h) through a sucrose cushion (40–50%), suspended in PAS, and stored at − 80 °C. KAUV, OBRV, and FTSV were propagated individually in 
 <italic>Vermamoeba vermiformis</italic> (ATCC50237) cultivated at 32 °C in PYG medium with a MOI of 0.01. After the appearance of CPEs, the cells and supernatants were collected, with sterile serological pipettes, stored in sterile conical tubes, and the viruses were purified through ultracentrifugation with a sucrose cushion.
