<p id="Par31">Aliquots of purified virus were diluted 1:10 (CVG, OBRV, PdV, and TPV) or 1:20 (NYMV), and 10 μL of the appropriate dilution was placed on the center of glass slide. The liquid was spread using circular movements to obtain an approximately 1-cm diameter drop. The slide was kept at room temperature until the liquid dried on the surface. Subsequently, the virus was fixed by adding 200 μL methanol over the center of the slide and stained with crystal violet for 15 min. After staining, the slides were washed in running water and dried at room temperature. Once dried, the stained region was covered by a 13 mm glass coverslip and affixed to the slide with Canada balsam (Synth, Brazil).</p>
