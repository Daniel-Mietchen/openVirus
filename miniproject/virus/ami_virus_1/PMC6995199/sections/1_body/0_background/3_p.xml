<p id="Par26">Another key point in virology is the observation of cytopathic effects (CPEs) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. CPEs refer to structural changes in host cells that are caused by the viral invasion. Some viruses cause characteristic CPEs, and observation of these effects is an important tool for virologists concerned with isolating and identifying viruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. From an educational perspective, myriad CPEs are visible by students under the optical microscope, such as changes in cell morphology, inclusion bodies, and lysis plaques [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Many medically important animal viruses show these effects over the course of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In this study, we present the CPEs of poxviruses (vaccinia virus [VACV] and cowpox virus [CPXV] and arboviruses (yellow fever virus [YFV], chikungunya virus [CHIKV], and mayaro virus [MAYV]) on materials that are safe for classroom application. Besides, we used a wide range of giant virus preparations where particles and other viral structures as well as CPEs can be visualized.
