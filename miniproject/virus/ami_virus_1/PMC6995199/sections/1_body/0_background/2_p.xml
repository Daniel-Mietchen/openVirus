<p id="Par25">The small size of viruses is a major obstacle that limits the study of virology. Therefore, learning viral morphology is often limited to electron microscopy figures and schematic illustrations of viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. This obstacle, however, became obsolete after the discovery of the 
 <italic>Acanthamoeba polyphaga</italic> mimivirus (APMV), the first described amoeba giant virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. APMV is the prototype species of the genus 
 <italic>Mimivirus</italic> (4); it belongs to the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Following the discovery of APMV, other giant viruses were described and characterized, including cedratvirus (CVG), pandoravirus (PDV), kaumoebavirus (KAUV), Orpheovirusbrasiliensis (OBRV), faustovirus (FSTV), and tupanvirus (TPV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Additionally, with the discovery of giant viruses, one of the paradigms of virology was broken, namely that viruses are considered to be “filterable organisms”. This shift led researchers to think that a portion of the virosphere is trapped in filters and begin research on prospection and characterization of giant viruses [
