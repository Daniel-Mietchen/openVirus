<p>The constant need for more food in the world requires each agriculture commodity to be more efficiently produced which includes a perpetual battle against disease in crops and livestock. In the case of swine, the continual evolution of viruses requires sustained research into the basic immunology against these pathogens to provide new mechanistic insights into how pigs, and perhaps other species, respond to pathogens and enable the production of safer and more efficacious vaccines and anti-viral approaches. This knowledge may enable the application of novel technologies that could modulate the pig's immune response in the fight against disease, and ensure the availability of safe and wholesome pork around the globe. In response to the title, it is VERY important to study viral immunity in swine as well as livestock and poultry because more efficient production of meat protein is essential to the quest for more food.</p>
