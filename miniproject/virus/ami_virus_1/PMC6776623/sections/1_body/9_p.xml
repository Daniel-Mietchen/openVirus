<p>In 2013, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), one of the swine enteric coronaviruses that causes severe diarrhea in neonatal pigs, was discovered in the Western Hemisphere for the first time. Within 6 months of entry into the US, the virus had spread through all swine dense regions killing about 10% of the pig crop that year. Although, swine can mount a rapid protective immune response to PEDV, young pigs are unable to survive the disease long enough to develop a protective response which makes protecting young pigs the most important step to controlling this disease. The only option to protect the pigs is to provide passive maternal immunity to the suckling pig via colostrum/milk, a strategy that can work but is dependent on the sow having adequate exposure to PEDV to induce mucosal immunity. Although, wild-type PEDV might induce the best lactogenic and colostral immunity for the piglet, immunizing the sow herd with wild-type PEDV has serious safety concerns demonstrating the need for improved PEDV vaccines.</p>
