<p>Detecting anti-SBV antibodies in serum represents an indirect method for the diagnosis of SBV infections. Both, the virus neutralization test (VNT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been developed as techniques for serological diagnosis. The former method is time-consuming; hence its use is restricted as a confirmatory test. On the other hand, the ELISA is a rapid, less expensive and high-throughput test. However, interpretation of test results in areas where other Simbu serogroup viruses are circulating could give false-positive results due to potential antibody cross-reactivity and, therefore, caution should be exercised in interpreting these results [
