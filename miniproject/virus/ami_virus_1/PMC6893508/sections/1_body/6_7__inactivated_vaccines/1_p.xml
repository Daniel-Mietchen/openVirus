<p>Inactivated SBV vaccines have been developed shortly after the initial isolation and characterization of the virus in Europe by various companies [

 <xref rid="B66-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. These vaccines effectively prevent viremia and clinical disease, including the prevention of fetal malformation and premature birth or stillbirth [
