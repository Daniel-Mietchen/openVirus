<p>Like other viruses in the Simbu serogroup such as Akabane and Aino, SBV re-emerges when herd immunity declines and favorable conditions for the vector population occur [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Aino and Akabane virus-based epidemics occur every 3–6 years in Japan, as more naïve animals become available [

 <xref rid="B76-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Similarly, in Australia, Akabane virus outbreaks occur every 10–15 years, due to the temporary change in the vector populations and the availability of naïve susceptible animals [

 <xref rid="B78-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The fact that only 20% of newborn animals carried anti-SBV antibodies in 188 herds examined during a cross-sectional study in Belgium in 2012, demonstrates a significant loss of herd immunity compared to 2011 [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The mean herd seroprevalence in calves declined from 65.7% and to 20.6% [
 <xref rid="B79-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>], which represents a recipe for another SBV outbreak in this country. Between 2014 and 2015, no anti-SBV antibodies were detected in ruminants in the UK and Ireland, suggesting an absence of SBV circulation in the ruminant and vector population in these countries [

 <xref rid="B81-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. In contrast, from 2016 to 2018, virus circulation at low levels was detected in many countries in Europe, such as Belgium [
 <xref rid="B15-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], UK [
 <xref rid="B17-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and France [
 <xref rid="B16-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These epidemiological data re-enforce the idea of a possible resurgence of SBV infections when favorable conditions for its occurrence such as high proportion of naïve susceptible animals and increased vector populations exist [
