<p>Vertical transmission of SBV from infected dam to fetus occurs during the first and early-second trimester of gestation and results in abortion, stillbirth and birth of malformed newborns [

 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], direct transmission of SBV from infected ruminants to na√Øve animals by contact or oro-nasal/feco-oral routes has not been reported [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Both, oral inoculation of cattle and nasal inoculation of sheep failed to produce viremia in the animals [

 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]; however, transmission of SBV from infected bulls to dams either through natural mating or artificial insemination has not been extensively studied yet [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In one study, viral RNA was isolated from blood samples of cattle experimentally injected with SBV-RNA-positive semen [
