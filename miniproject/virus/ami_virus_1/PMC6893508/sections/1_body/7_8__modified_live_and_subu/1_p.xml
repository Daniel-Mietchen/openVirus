<p>Recombinant modified-live vaccines with NSm and/or NSs deletions in the M and S segments of SBV have been developed and conferred a high level of protection from infection [
 <xref rid="B69-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Although these vaccines are DIVA (differentiate infected from vaccinated animals) compatible, safety concerns related to reversion to virulence may prevent their wider use. It was reported that serial passages of a NSs-deleted, attenuated virus in cell culture was able to restore its virulence when a single mutation was acquired in the Gc protein [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Using baculovirus produced Gc or Gc and Gn as a subunit vaccine generated a low level of neutralizing antibody response but did not protect against SBV challenge [

Another subunit vaccine based on the SBV Gc amino terminal domain (aa. 468â€“702), expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells; however, provided partial protection in cattle (three out of four animals were protected after challenge) [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Meanwhile, another subunit vaccine construct, which contained the entire ectodomains of Gc and Gn in a covalently linked fashion, conferred only low protective efficacy in cattle (one out of four animals protected after challenge) [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. In contrast, full protection was obtained when an antigen containing the covalently linked Gc amino-terminal domains of both SBV and Akabane viruses was used [
 <xref rid="B72-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Meanwhile, a DNA vaccine encoding the SBV Gc amino-terminal domain and the SBV nucleoprotein reduced viremia and protected animals against weight loss [
 <xref rid="B73-viruses-11-01065" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. Vaccination with recombinant Equine Herpes Virus 1 or Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara expressing the SBV Gc amino-terminal domain resulted in partial (two out of four animals) or full protection in cattle, respectively [

 <xref rid="viruses-11-01065-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). In general, in order to prevent fetal infection with SBV, vaccination should be targeted to breeding animals.
