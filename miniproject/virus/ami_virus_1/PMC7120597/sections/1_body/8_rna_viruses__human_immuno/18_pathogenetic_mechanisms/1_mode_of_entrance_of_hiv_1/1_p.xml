   <p id="Par393">The point in time when the migration of HIV-1-infected lymphocytes into the brain takes place is not known. It has been shown that, at the time of seroconversion, HIV-1 can be detected in the CSF; this is the time when, clinically, a subacute meningitis develops, thus, suggesting that HIV-1 enters the CNS at a very early stage of the disease.</p>
