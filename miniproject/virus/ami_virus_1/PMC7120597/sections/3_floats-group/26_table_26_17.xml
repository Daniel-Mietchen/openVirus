     <p>• Lesions mostly reside in cerebral hemispheres but periventricular lesions are rare.</p>
     <p>• Lesions predominantly affect the deep and subcortical white matter and can expand into the cortical gray matter.</p>
     <p>• Intracortical lesions are present.</p>
     <p>• Spinal cord and optic nerves are spared.</p>
    </td>

    <td>
     <p>• Lesions can be found in white and gray matter, but are often found in a periventricular position.</p>

     <p>• Demyelinating lesions reveal oligodendrocytes with enlarged nucleus and cytoplasm. The nucleus may show inclusion bodies.</p>
     <p>• Oligodendrocytes are mostly found on the border of the lesion.</p>
     <p>• Subpial lesions are absent.</p>
     <p>• Remyelination is absent.</p>
     <p>• Within the demyelinated lesions, large (the so-called bizarre) astrocytes are found.</p>
     <p>• Lesions contain low to moderate numbers of T-cells.</p>
     <p>• few B-cells</p>
     <p>• few plasma cells</p>
     <p>• Activated microglial cells and macrophages are present in high numbers.</p>

     <p>• Like PML, lesions contain infected cells, especially on the border.</p>
     <p>• In small samples (biopsies) however, infected cells may be low in numbers or may be absent.</p>
     <p>• Subpial lesions are absent.</p>
     <p>• Remyelination is absent.</p>
     <p>• Like in PML, lesions contain bizarre astrocytes.</p>
     <p>• Lesions contain extremely high numbers of T-cells and B-cells.</p>
     <p>• Numbers of microglia and macrophages do not differ with PML.</p>
    </td>
    <td>
     <p>• Unlike in PML, lesions are perivenous and show finger-like extensions (i.e., Dawson fingers).</p>
     <p>• Subpial lesions are present and are specific for MS.</p>
     <p>• Lesions can show variable remyelination.</p>
     <p>• Lesions can show activated astrocytes and/or astrogliosis.</p>
     <p>• Extremely large bizarre astrocytes are absent.</p>
     <p>• Lesions contain moderate to high numbers of T-cells.</p>
     <p>• Low numbers of B-cell</p>

     <p>• Usually larger than 3 cm</p>
     <p>• Lesions always start in subcortical regions, probably related to a high blood flow.</p>
     <p>• Borders are sharp towards the GM and ill-defined towards the WM.</p>
     <p>• In first scans of 28% of patients, lesions extend in deep GM.</p>
     <p>• 23–57% of (HIV-associated) cases have contrast-enhancing lesions.</p>
     <p>• T1 lesions are mostly hypointense.</p>
     <p>• Diffusion-weighted images are always hyperintense.</p>
