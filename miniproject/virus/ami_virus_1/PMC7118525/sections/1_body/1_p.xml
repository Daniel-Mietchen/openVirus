<p id="p0030">Although bats are beneficial to our ecosystem, excessive deforestation, urbanization, and expanding the human population have altered the ecological niche of bats (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2017</xref>). With the increasing demands of the growing population, deforestation and using land for agriculture have increased. For example, only the Southeast Asia (SEA) lost 30% of forest cover over the last 40 years. Furthermore, the population in SEA is expected to rise to 250 million by 2030 compared to 130 million between 2001 and 2011 (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Afelt et al., 2018</xref>). In response to deforestation and urbanization, biodiversity, especially bats populations are adapting and setting up in the anthropized rural and urbanized environments, closer to human dwellings (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Threlfall, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2019</xref>). The anthropization near the vicinity of human populations generates a highly diverse environment that allows and accepts a wide range of bat species not encountered together before (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Walsh et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Threlfall, 2018</xref>). As a result, both bat diversity and bat-borne viruses increase close to human dwelling. The house light attracts insectivorous bats for insects, fields and orchards attract frugivorous bats, and barns and houses attract cave-dwelling bats. The interaction of higher bat diversity can lead to a higher concentration of bat-borne viruses which can be transmitted to human through direct contact, contamination by feces or urine, or domestic animal infection (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Jung and Threlfall, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, the traits including gathering/grouping during roosting and feeding and unique adaptive immune systems are responsible for the persistent mixing of different viruses that can lead to generate recombinant, novel mutant, and/or reassortant RNA viruses (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, bat-borne viruses could emerge in future with significant potential for causing epidemics and pandemics. Therefore, surveillance and monitoring are required in areas where humans and bats are closely interacting with each other. Our suggestions could help to prevent bat-borne viral outbreaks in future if seriously implemented.

    <bold>Forestation:</bold> Deforestations are linked with the bat-borne viral outbreaks (
    <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Olivero et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, there is an urgent need to stop deforestation and invest in afforestation and reforestation globally. In response to the viral outbreaks, billions of dollars are spent on eradicating the infection, providing services to humans, and developing diagnostic, treatment, and vaccination strategies. However, no or less attention is given to the primary level of prevention such as forestation and respecting wildlife habitats. The world should realize the importance of forests and the biodiversity carrying deadly viruses.

    <bold>Controlling human population growth:</bold> China is the most populous country in the world and has experienced three large-scale bat origin COVs epidemics (
    <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2019</xref>; 
    <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Khan et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, other bats related epidemics have been reported in areas with higher human population growth (
    <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Plowright et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to control human population growth. The unstoppable increase in human population growth will lead to deforestation for resources and land for agriculture and will expose those bat populations having novel deadly viruses.

    <bold>Bat hunting and consumption:</bold> In Asia, about 56 bat species are hunted and consumed (
    <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Mildenstein et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, live slaughtering, handling, and consumption of undercooked bat meat may enhance viral transmission (
    <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2013</xref>; 
    <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Fan et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, there is a need to stop bat hunting and consumption and raise public awareness about the risks associated with bats handling.
