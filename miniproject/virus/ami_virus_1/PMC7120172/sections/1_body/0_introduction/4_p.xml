<p>Our tentative explanations for these highly satisfactory results are (1) the virtual absence of co-morbidity in a relatively young group of patients whose only adverse factors were excess weight and pregnancy (according to most series) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00145">5</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00148">8</xref>]; (2) a low organ-failure score on the Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scale—on which hypoxemic respiratory failure was the most salient problem—compared with the scores in other series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00145">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00147">7</xref>]; (3) the heightened awareness of health personnel, who had received health-authority guidelines to the effect that patients with pulmonary infiltrates and significant hypoxemia were to be admitted to the ICU straightaway to receive assisted ventilation. That is why our intervals to ICU admission are similar or lower than those in previously published studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00144">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00147">7</xref>] given that, with one exception, the patients were not placed in wards first. Similar to our results, the Argentina series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00148">8</xref>] showed that 64 patients were treated with NIV to good effect. In that case, NIV boosted patient survival (24 % vs. 13 %, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.02). These data support the idea that greater use of NIV might have reduced the need for IMV and quite possibly the mortality rate, but this is of course no more than a supposition.
