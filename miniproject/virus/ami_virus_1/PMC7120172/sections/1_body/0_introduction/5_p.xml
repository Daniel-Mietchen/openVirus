<p>There are considerable disparities in the way NIV is used, but the published series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00147">7</xref>] show a high failure rate. By contrast, our results [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001410">10</xref>] showed successful NIV-based treatment. We therefore recommend early NIV/CPAP treatment for at least a few hours in young patients with pneumonia-induced hypoxemia caused by type A influenza and where no organ failure is apparent on the SOFA scale. This does not mean that NIV is an alternative to IMV but, rather, that clinically well-placed patients may benefit from NIV for treating ARF. If there is no improvement or the patient suffers from organ dysfunction, it is best to proceed with orotracheal intubation to prevent death—a course of action recommended in one series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00145">5</xref>], where there was a higher mortality rate among patients in which NIV failed than among those who had been intubated from the outset.
