<p>Our experience [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR001410">10</xref>] produced results that differed from those in previously published studies on the use of NIV. Ten patients (2009â€“2010) were entered in the national register of virus influenza A(H1N1) of the Infectious Diseases Work Group of the Spanish Society of Intensive and Critical Care Medicine and Coronary Units. Seven of these patients displayed primary viral pneumonia (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00142" ref-type="table">14.2</xref>). Most of the patients were young and otherwise healthy, but excess weight (40 %) and pregnancy (two patients) were notable factors. Seven patients (7/10, 70 %) underwent NIV. Two patients were intubated on admission, and one did not require mechanical ventilation. Overall mortality was 10 % (one patient). This patient had been transferred from another hospital with multi-organ failure and died 24 h after admission. A group of five patients with hypoxemia were analyzed (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00142" ref-type="table">14.2</xref>) especially in connection with radiological signs of hypoxemia and liver failure. All patients were treated with NIV and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). Orotracheal intubation was not required in any cases, and no patients died in the ICU or during the hospital stay (Tables 
 <xref rid="Tab00141" ref-type="table">14.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Tab00142" ref-type="table">14.2</xref>). The mean interval from the onset of symptoms to ICU or hospital admission was 5 days.
