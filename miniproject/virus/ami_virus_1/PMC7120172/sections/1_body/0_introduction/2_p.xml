<p>A published series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00147">7</xref>] showed that patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) developed multi-organ failure, especially hypoxemia-induced acute respiratory failure (ARF). Mortality in this series ranged from 17 to 40 %. Ventilation was required in 64–100 % of the patients admitted to the ICU [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00148">8</xref>], whether due to hypoxemia symptoms such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or to exacerbation of chronic pathologies such as cardiac failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which are often accompanied by hypercapnia. The need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) was considered to be one of the factors linked to hospital mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00146">6</xref>]. With regard to the kind of ventilation used, this varied depending on the series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00145">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00147">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00148">8</xref>], although IMV was more commonly used than noninvasive ventilation (NIV). Also, there was a high failure rate (&gt;70 %) in the case of NIV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00141" ref-type="table">14.1</xref>). Given the low success rate of NIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00143">3</xref>], the controversial indications for using it in hypoxemic patients, and the risk of facilitating aerosol-borne spread of the virus and thus the danger to health care personnel, in 2009 scientific societies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00149">9</xref>] made various recommendations concerning its use. One was that NIV was best applied: (1) in patients with hypercapnia-exacerbated COPD; (2) in patients whose heart diseases were accompanied by acute pulmonary edema; (3) to prevent postextubation failure. In the case of patients with acute hypoxemia and the associated risk of organ failure, prolonged NIV treatment may lead to risky intubation. Accordingly, NIV should not be used as a matter of course.
