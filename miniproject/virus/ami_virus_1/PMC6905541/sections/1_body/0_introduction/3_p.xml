<p>In 1986 the serotype DENV-1 was identified in the state of Rio de Janeiro, and since then, dengue fever became a public health burden for Brazil [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. By early 1990, the Asian/American (As/Am) genotype of serotype DENV-2 was isolated from patients from the metropolitan region of the state [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. From then on, its spreading gave rise to the epidemic of the years 1990–1991, leading to the advent of the first severe forms of the disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These two serotypes were also responsible for the epidemic waves of 1995–1996 and 1998, from which the virus spread rapidly to other districts [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Already in 2000, the serotype DENV-3 was firstly isolated from a patient in the state of Rio de Janeiro as well. The introduction of this new serotype was associated with an increase in the number of cases during the summer of 2001–2002, causing the largest epidemic so far in the state [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This serotype circulated predominantly in the state until 2007, when serotype DENV-2 reemerged, causing a massive and severe epidemic during 2008 that affected the entire country. The state of Rio de Janeiro, however, was the most affected, with more than 235,000 reported cases, over 13,000 hospital admissions and 263 deaths [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], which represented increased disease severity and a higher rate of mortality, compared to previous outbreaks [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This epidemic caused staggering human and economic costs, with more than US$1 billion being spent at the national level on dengue prevention and control [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Drumond et al. demonstrated that the virus causing the 2008 epidemic belonged indeed, to the same genotype that was introduced around 1990, but to a different lineage [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In fact, this new lineage presented genetic differences potentially associated with a more pathogenic clinical outcome of the disease [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Henceforth, in 2011, the serotype DENV-4 was identified in the municipality of Niterói, state of Rio de Janeiro, and spread the following year to other districts in the state, accounting for most cases of dengue in 2012 and 2013 [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>–
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The circulation of this serotype decreased after that, giving way again to serotype DENV-1 [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. During the following years, these two serotypes kept on circulating in the state, however, since late 2014, different arboviruses such as chikungunya virus (CHIKV), Zika virus (ZIKV), and yellow fever virus (YFV), joined alternating their circulation [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. DENV-2 cases remained undetectable in the state since 2010, until 2017, when one new case was reported in the capital of the state [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Consequently, the statal health department claimed to intensify surveillance, even though DENV detection during 2017 was low, and the focus was mostly on surveillance of yellow fever cases and epizootics, and immunization actions as well [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. However, it was only in 2018, when the Information System for Notifiable Diseases (SINAN) and the Laboratory Sample Management System (GAL) registered three new different DENV-2 cases in the state of Rio de Janeiro [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
