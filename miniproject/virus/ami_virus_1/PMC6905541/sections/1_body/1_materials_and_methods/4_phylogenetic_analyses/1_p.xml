<p>The obtained sequences (GenBank accession numbers MK972823 and MK972824) were manually edited and aligned with BioEdit v7.2.5.0 software using different DENV-2 reference sequences representative for the different genotypes and available at GenBank (accession numbers can be consulted in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225879.s001">S1 Table</xref>). Alignment of the final 378 sequences is available from the authors upon request. Evolutionary model was obtained with JModeltest v2.1.10 software (GTR+I+G) [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], chosen according the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Maximum Likelihood value (lnL), and phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Maximum likelihood method with RAxML v7.0 software. The robustness of the phylogenetic grouping was evaluated by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Phylogenetic tree was finally visualized in Figtree v1.4.3 software (available at
