<p>The presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of potential clinical and epidemiological relevance at ENV/NS1 regions was manually determined by comparing the nucleotide and amino acid changes in the generated sequences with the remaining sequences from As/Am genotype, employing as references Brazilian sequences obtained from the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, during 2007–2011 (GenBank accession numbers: JX286516-JX286521, JX286550/51, and MN589858-MN589884). The translation of the nucleotide sequences to amino acids was performed employing the BioEdit v7.2.5.0 software.</p>
