<p>According to our estimations, the evolutionary rate of lineage IV was 9.5x10
 <sup>-4</sup> substitutions/site/year (95% HPD = 7.7x10
 <sup>-4</sup>â€“1.2x10
 <sup>-3</sup> substitutions/site/year), exactly the same reported by Mir et al [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. To notice, the strain giving rise to the virus isolates detected this year in the state of Rio de Janeiro, presented a nucleotide substitution rate at the lower limit of the 95% HPD interval, which would be consistent with slower evolution dynamics and a delayed detection.
