<p>Based on phylogenetic results, we proceeded to identify the genetic positions on viral sequences involved in genetic distance between the viral isolates under study and the remaining Brazilian ones from lineage IV. Twenty-four different SNPs were detected, being 14 on the partial sequenced ENV region (genetic positions 1482–2421) and 10 on the partial NS1 (genetic positions 2422–3107) (

Only five of them were non-synonymous, provoking an amino acid change on the viral proteins: A2023G+G2024C-S643A and C2276T-A727V on ENV; A2434G-I780V and C2878A-L928M on NS1. To notice, simultaneous nucleotide substitutions on positions 2023 and 2024 were detected exclusively in the cluster conformed by sequences generated in this work and from Puerto Rico. Furthermore, substitution C2878A-L928M was encountered only in our sequences and C2276T-A727V only in one sequence within lineage III from As/Am genotype, while A2434G-I780V was widely detected among sequences within lineage IV, and other As/Am lineages and genotypes as well. However, it was absent in the ones representing Brazilian epidemic strain from 2008. No known effect has been found in literature for any of these substitutions. On the other hand, among the 19 synonymous substitutions, three of them were unique for our sequences: G1710T, A1995G and C2307T, located within the ENV. Conversely, from the remaining 16, only half was detected in sequences from lineage IV. However, none of them among the ones from the 2008 strain. The other half was detected in sequences of other As/Am lineages and/or genotypes (

In short, all these observations lead us to suspect that the viral strain circulating currently in the state of Rio de Janeiro may have indeed, a different origin than the one that caused the outbreak in 2008 and spread to other regions of the country, mainly through the Southeast.
