<p>Considering the phylogenetic results, and to have a more detailed picture of where this new DENV-2 strain comes from, we conducted temporal and geographical analysis with a reduced dataset of 137 sequences conforming lineage IV group of As/Am genotype. Sequences within this cluster are indicated in the 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0225879.s001">S1 Table</xref>. They exhibited a positive correlation between genetic divergence and sampling time (R
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.6824) and appeared to be suitable for phylogenetic molecular clock analysis, which was after that, implemented in BEAST package [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as described in the above section. These results suggest that the viral strain detected in our study originated in Puerto Rico (Posterior state probability [PSP] = 0.81) in 2002 (95% HPD: 2000–2004) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0225879.g002">Fig 2</xref>), and was then introduced in our state, where it started to spread in late 2018 (95% HPD: 2018–2019). To notice, no DENV-2 case has been diagnosed during the course of 2019 in the Caribbean islands [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which clearly suggests that Rio de Janeiro´s 2019 strain could have been circulating elsewhere, up to its arrival into the state, or could have been replicating silently for some time up to rise to a detectable level. It would be likely that actually, the viral strain that entered into the state of Rio de Janeiro might well be introduced first into a different Brazilian state and spread then to Rio de Janeiro, based on the increasing DENV-2 reported cases of other states. As previously mentioned, since 2017, DENV-2 cases have been increasing and spreading through the central-west region, reaching the southeast region in 2018 and early 2019. The latter was responsible for 65.7% of the cases reported until March 2019 and is witnessing local epidemics in several municipalities of three of the four states that integrate it: São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and Espírito Santo; coincidentally, the three states that surround geographically the fourth integrant of the group, the state of Rio de Janeiro [
 <xref rid="pone.0225879.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Nevertheless, no molecular epidemiology analyses have been carried on to study genetic viral characteristics on those cases, and to confirm this statement we will need further sequencing yet unavailable. In fact, important caveats should be taken into account for the posed hypothesis: the limited number of available sequences of Latin America covering the region under study, and the lack of Brazilian sequences from this last 5 years period. These two aspects, if different, could be responsible for dissimilar estimations. The lack of DENV-2 Brazilian sequences over recent times goes hand-in-hand with the low circulation of this serotype across the country. Nevertheless, filling this information gap would be determinant to define when this new strain has actually entered into our territory.
