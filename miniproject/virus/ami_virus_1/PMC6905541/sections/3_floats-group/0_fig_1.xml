  <title>Maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of DENV-2 partial envelope and NS1 coding sequences.</title>
  <p>DENV-2 dataset includes partial sequences (positions 1482–3107) principally from the As/Am (n  = 361), American (n = 5, from Colombia, Peru, El Salvador and Caribbean Islands), Asian I (n = 5, from Southeast Asia [Thailand and Cambodia]), Asian II (n = 5, from the United States of America [USA] and Southeast Asia [Papua New Guinea]) and Cosmopolitan (n = 2, from Southeast Asia [India and Singapore]) genotypes. As/Am genotype includes sequences from USA (n = 19), Central America [Mexico (n = 5), Nicaragua (n = 13), Guatemala (n = 1), Belize (n = 1), El Salvador (n = 1)], Guyana (n  =  1), Suriname (n  =  11), Ecuador (n = 2), Venezuela (n = 35), Colombia (n = 15), Peru (n = 48), Bolivia (n  = 12), Paraguay (n = 5), Brazil [BR] (n = 137, which includes 77 from the southeast region and 32 from the northeast) and from the Caribbean Islands which includes Jamaica (n = 1), Puerto Rico (n = 13), Cuba (n = 2), Dominican Republic (n = 4) and the Lesser Antilles islands (n = 36) conformed by Trinidad and Tobago, the Virgin Islands, Aruba, Dominica, Barbados, Grenada, Martinique, among others. Four main lineages (I to IV) are identified within As/Am genotype. Taxa are represented with circles and colored according to the geographic origin of each sequence as indicated at the legend (up left). The small cluster containing isolates from the state of Rio de Janeiro in 2019 is zoomed-in, and the two sequences generated in this study are indicated with names 80/Brazil_RJ/2019 and 230/Brazil_RJ/2019. The asterisk in the nodes corresponds to bootstrap values higher than 70, obtained with 1000 replicates. The scale bar indicates the genetic distances. The branch lengths are drawn to scale with the bar at the bottom indicating nucleotide substitutions per site.</p>
