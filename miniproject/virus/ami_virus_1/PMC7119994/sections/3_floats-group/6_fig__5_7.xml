  <p>Numerical solutions of seasonally forced SEIR models (see Fig. 
   <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">5.3b</xref>), showing changes in the dynamics of infection caused by increasing the infectious period (see 
   <italic>color key</italic>) while maintaining the basic reproduction number of infection at a constant level. To simulate crudely the initial dynamics of a “novel” infection, the system starts by introducing 6 % infectives into a 20 % susceptible population (a real novel epidemic might be much more violent if everyone is susceptible). 
   <italic>Inset</italic>: Comparing the “slow” dynamics generated by a 10-year infectious period with a (sketched) solution of an SIS model with much faster dynamics (Taken from Figure in Box 2, Grenfell and Harwood [
