<p>The application of mathematics to explore the dynamics and control of viral infections has a long history, which predates its application in many other fields of biology, as well as the germ theory itself [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. A particularly fruitful area for development has been the dynamics of acute immunizing infections, with their relatively simple natural history and rich notification time series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The last three decades have seen a considerable upsurge in the use of mathematical and computational models to explore the dynamics and control of a wide range of viral infections. This phase arose initially from developments in ecological population dynamics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; it was then greatly accelerated, both by the explosion in computational power and by the emergence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other potential pandemic threats [
