<p>In this chapter, we review basic concepts in infection dynamics and control, via a synthesis of epidemic models and data. We begin with acute immunizing infections, focusing on measles as a case study of the impact of herd immunity and other determinants of epidemic dynamics. We then extend the discussion to dynamical modeling applications to a range of other acute and chronic viruses, with a variety of more complex life histories. After a brief discussion of models for the within-host dynamics of viruses, we conclude with suggestions for gaps in knowledge and future research needs.</p>
