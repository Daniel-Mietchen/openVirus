<p>So far, we have assumed that deterministic, spatially homogeneous dynamics govern infectious disease outbreaks. In fact, epidemics often spread across a heterogeneous landscape of human cities, towns, or rural communities, and this spread depends partly on the links between those locations. This leads us to move from the 
 <italic>deterministic</italic> SIR model described above to 
 <italic>stochastic</italic> models, which account for the random nature of individual infection dynamics and demography â€“ for instance, individuals may or may not become infected with a given average probability, so that by chance, particularly in small populations, no new infections may occur, and the chain of transmission may be broken. During the troughs between epidemic outbreaks in smaller communities, incidence may fall to such low numbers that local extinction is likely.
