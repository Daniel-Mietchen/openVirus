<p>Based on this observation, Bartlett [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] used analyses of epidemiological data and stochastic models to develop the notion of critical community size (CCS), or population size below which stochastic extinction is expected, which was further developed by Black [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] in studies of measles persistence in insular populations. Bartlett demonstrated the existence of a CCS of around 300,000â€“500,000 for measles in England and Wales. For measles to persist in locations with a population size smaller than this CCS, immigration of infected immigrants from elsewhere in the metapopulation is necessary. The result is that the spread of measles across England and Wales in the pre-vaccine era resembled traveling waves spreading out from London [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with a substantial epidemic lag in locations further away. The duration of the lag was also shaped by the size of the local populations. The duration of fade-outs following local extinction contains information on the degree to which a particular location is connected to the metapopulation as a whole [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Generally, this points to larger places being more connected. More detailed parametric analyses tend to confirm this (e.g., the gravity model [
