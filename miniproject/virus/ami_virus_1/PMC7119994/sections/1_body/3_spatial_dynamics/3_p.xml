<p>Similar processes may operate for immunizing or lethal infections in animal populations, with, for example, the spread of rabies through raccoon populations acting as an invasion wave structured by large landscape features such as rivers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. For more complex human infections, features such as imperfect immunity (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">5.2</xref> below) will tend to shift the age class of hosts who disperse the infection. That shift may impact on the main mechanism of dispersal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] and move the scenario away from invasion into a locally coupled landscape to a more demographically driven dynamic [
