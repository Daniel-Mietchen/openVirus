<p>The degree to which viruses harm hosts varies considerably. Both within and between virus species, some variants may barely affect hosts at all, while others have significant health impacts, up to and including host mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. An evolutionary perspective indicates that variation in virulence across clones should be shaped by the costs and benefits of virulence for parasite transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. The spread and persistence of virulence mutations may be favored if they covary with transmission. However, since host mortality can interrupt transmission, a range of values of virulence may lead to equivalent levels of overall fitness for the parasite [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. While it is broadly agreed that the theoretical framework and empirical evidence on the existence of virulence-transmission trade-offs need to be further developed and extended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], there are some systems where the general predictions appear to be borne out (e.g., [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]). Perhaps most famously, the introduction of the myxoma virus into Australia was at first devastating to rabbit populations, causing near 100 % mortality. However, over subsequent years, the virulence of the infection decreased. Various lines of evidence suggest that this occurred in response to selection for increased transmission via decreased virulence â€“ swift rabbit mortality was not an efficient mode of transmission for the virus.
