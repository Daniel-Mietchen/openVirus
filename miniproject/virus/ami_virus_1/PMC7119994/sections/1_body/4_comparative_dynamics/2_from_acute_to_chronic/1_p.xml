<p>A dramatically different life history from the transient infection paradigm represented by measles is observed with infections that are much more persistent (even lifelong). This difference may be expressed in terms of infectious period in individual hosts [

To illustrate how increasing infectious period alone modifies the violent epidemics of childhood infections, we retain the assumption of lifelong immunity of the SEIR model and vary the infectious period, from the roughly 1 week of measles to 10 years, corresponding to the approximate average pre-HAART treatment infectious period of HIV [
