<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5.7</xref> also illustrates a second major dynamical impact arising from the trade-off of increased infectious period against lowered infection rate. “Fast” infections are much more prey to local stochastic extinction in the deep troughs between epidemics (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">2.4</xref>) than the much more endemic incidence promoted by longer infectious period. On the other hand, acute immunizing infections can invade populations much more quickly than chronic infections for the same
