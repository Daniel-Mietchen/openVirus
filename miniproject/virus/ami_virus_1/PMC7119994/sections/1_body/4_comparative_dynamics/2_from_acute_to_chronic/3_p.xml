<p>This assumption imposes a simple evolutionary constraint on our set of model pathogens in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5.7</xref>, in that fitness (roughly equating to 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>) is kept constant as we increase the infectious period. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5.7</xref> indicates, first, that increasing the infectious period reduces, and eventually eliminates, the tendency for cyclical epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]; essentially, a longer infectious period “fills in the troughs” following major epidemics. As infectious period increases, we therefore see a transition from seasonally driven biennial epidemics (at the measles extreme of a 1-week infectious period) to low-amplitude annual epidemics (at 1 month). For longer infectious periods (1 year), we see slowly evolving epidemics with little seasonal activity and a modest post-epidemic overshoot. Finally, for a 10-year infectious period, we see a smooth slow epidemic, with an essentially “logistic” rise to a stable endemic plateau of incidence. Though crude, this exercise captures the essential dynamical transmission from the violent epidemics of acute infections to the much smoother and slower epidemic invasion of HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Note that the seasonal variation in infection rate is assumed similar for the “measles” and “HIV” cases; however, the latter completely eliminates associated seasonal fluctuations in incidence due to the smoothing effect of prolonged infectious carriage.
