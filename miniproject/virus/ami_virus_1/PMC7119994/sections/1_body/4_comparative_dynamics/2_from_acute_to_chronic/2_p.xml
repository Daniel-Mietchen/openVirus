 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5.7</xref> explores this comparison, simulating an infection which invades a partly susceptible population (full details are given in Ref. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; note that for clarity, the epidemic curves for 1- and 10-year infectious periods are raised above the curves for the more acute infections). Each simulation refers to a virus with a different infectious period. We assume that 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is identical for each of these infections. 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is roughly given by the product of mean 
 <italic>per capita</italic> infection rate and infectious period; thus, to keep 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> constant:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>A short infectious period implies a relatively high infection rate.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>A longer infectious period requires a lower infection rate.</p>
