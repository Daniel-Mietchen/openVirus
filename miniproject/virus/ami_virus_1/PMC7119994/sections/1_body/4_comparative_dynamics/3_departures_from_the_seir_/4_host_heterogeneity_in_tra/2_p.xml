<p>Such factors can have implications for the dynamics and persistence of infections in a population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. In particular, where a disease shows epidemic cycles, facing the possibility of local extinction in the epidemic troughs, the presence of a small number of carrier hosts can facilitate viral persistence in the population, through these troughs. For example, in some cases infection with varicella zoster virus can be followed decades later by infectious shingles, an occurrence which could maintain the virus in small populations [
