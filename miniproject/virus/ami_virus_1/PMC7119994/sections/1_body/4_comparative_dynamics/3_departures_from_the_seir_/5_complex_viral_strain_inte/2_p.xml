<p>Dengue dynamics are notable for the global circulation of four distinct serotypes (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5.9a</xref>). Notably, prior immunity to a given serotype can elevate the risk of severe disease from subsequent infection by a different serotype [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. It has been proposed that this arises from antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) between different serotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], and modeling studies suggest that ADE could play an important role in shaping the epidemiological and strain dynamics of dengue, on the host population level [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
