<p>Many viruses are capable of reinfecting a host. This may be due to the waning of host immunity over time, as with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], or due to viral evolution for immune escape (e.g., with norovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] and influenza) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]: see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">6</xref> for a more in-depth treatment of the latter. In either case, the overall dynamical effect is for recovered, immune individuals to eventually reenter the susceptible pool, as illustrated by Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">5.8a</xref>.
