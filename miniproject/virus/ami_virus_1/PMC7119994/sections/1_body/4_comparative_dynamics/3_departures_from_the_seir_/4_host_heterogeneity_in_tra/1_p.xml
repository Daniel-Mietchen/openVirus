<p>Recalling the qualitative differences between the dynamics of acute and chronic infections (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5.7</xref>), some viruses show a “mixed” character on the host population level: while some individuals clear infection relatively quickly, others may continue to harbor the virus as “carriers,” either in a latent phase or in a chronic infectious state, for a longer period. An example is hepatitis B, in which 5–10 % of adult patients show chronic infection. As illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">5.8c</xref>, this can be represented mathematically by identifying two infectious classes: one acute and the other chronic.
