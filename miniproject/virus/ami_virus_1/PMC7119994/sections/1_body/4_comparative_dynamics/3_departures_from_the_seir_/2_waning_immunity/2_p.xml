<p>Where such waning of immunity is appreciable, the implications for vaccination can be profound. As the susceptible pool is replenished not only by births but also by previously immune individuals, the critical vaccination threshold (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref>) is raised, making it more difficult to control the spread of infection. For this reason, vaccination against many imperfectly immunizing infections is aimed at direct protection of those receiving vaccine, rather than at raising indirect protection.
