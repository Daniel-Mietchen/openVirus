<p>We have seen that the SEIR framework (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1b</xref>) can be a powerful tool for capturing the dynamics of perfectly immunizing infections such as measles. With its various refinements to incorporate structure in the host population (such as age and spatial distribution), it yields a rich variety of dynamical behavior (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">5.7</xref>). Given the range of immunological complexities and different viral life histories, however, it is clear that SEIR dynamics are only part of the story. In such cases, it is often possible to adapt Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1b</xref> to more faithfully reflect such important biological complexities.
