<p>While we have so far largely discussed virus dynamics on the level of the host population, there are equally important processes to be considered on the within-host level. The “kinetics” of viral infection arise from a complex array of factors including viral replication and variability, the dynamics of the immune response, and pathogenicity to the host [
