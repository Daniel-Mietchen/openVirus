<p>Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents another major public health challenge and, like HIV, is a rapidly mutating virus capable of continually evading immunity to establish chronic infection [

HCV infection is currently treated with broad-spectrum combination antiviral therapy including interferon-alpha, ribavirin, and protease inhibitors, with upwards of 50 % of treated patients being responders; however, there is a need for a more rationally optimized approach. Models capturing viral dynamics in treated and untreated patients have contributed to an understanding of the action of these therapies [
