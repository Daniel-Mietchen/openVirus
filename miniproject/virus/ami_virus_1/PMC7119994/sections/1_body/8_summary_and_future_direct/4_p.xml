<p>New and emerging ways of tracking disease may also help to shed new light on the global spread of viruses and on how they may be better controlled. To name three examples, while disease surveillance continues to operate largely through public health channels, there is increasing interest in the use of alternative sources, including automated tracking of Internet and social media trends [
