<p>Especially in the context of viral evolution, whether in relation to immune escape or virulence, a complete biological framework calls for a linkage of processes across disparate scales, from the macroscopic structure of the host population to the molecular basis of viral replication and transmission. A key task at the heart of this challenge is arguably to quantify transmission potential in terms of immune escape, that is, to measure empirically how changes at the molecular level impact
