<p>The striking epidemic patterns of acute immunizing infections are particularly well documented for widely notifiable infections such as measles. The process of explaining these cycles, as well as that of addressing associated public health issues, has spawned an extensive analytical literature, spanning public health epidemiology, theoretical biology, and population dynamics [
