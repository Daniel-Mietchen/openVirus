<p>It was realized early that seasonality could also result in more complex dynamics, including chaotic fluctuations, that is, very irregular dynamics with little long-term predictability. Contexts with both high and low birth rates (and both high and low transmission since birth rates and transmission act dynamically in very similar ways for immunizing infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]) can promote complex dynamics via coexisting attractors. Until recently, it was thought that chaotic measles dynamics were not likely to be observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], since observed seasonality in transmission was not strong enough to drive the associated violent epidemics. However, recent analyses of measles in Niger revealed very strong seasonality (driven by movement in and out of cities linked to rainfall); this, combined with high transmission rates and the highest birth rate in the world, results in irregular outbreaks consistent with expectations of chaos (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5.5</xref>). Erratic boom and bust outbreaks are expected to continue even as routine vaccination improves; and this suggests that high investment in reactive vaccination and surveillance is important, and pulsed vaccination approaches such as supplementary immunization activities could also play a helpful role in synchronizing dynamics [
