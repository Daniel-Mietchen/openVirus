<p>In the simplest analysis of an immunizing infection (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec4" ref-type="sec">2.2</xref>), sustained cycles of infection will disappear, and the infected proportion in the population will settle to a constant level (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">5.3a</xref>). The question of what maintains the recurrent epidemics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] generally observed for immunizing childhood infections (e.g., Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1</xref>) drove researchers to seek the key aspect of biological realism missing from the simplest SEIR model. For measles in England and Wales, seasonal variation in transmission driven by increased contact rates of children when schools were in session rapidly emerged as a possible candidate [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and has since received considerable empirical support [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Stochastic fluctuations in incidence could in principle also contribute to the maintenance of cycles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]; however, for measles, the predominant driver is seasonality in transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Birth rate may modulate the periodicity of recurrent cycles driven by seasonality through its role in determining the rate of susceptible replenishment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. For example, for most of the postwar pre-vaccination era in London, seasonality generated sustained cycles by resonating with the biennial epidemic tendency of measles dynamics. However, during the postwar baby boom, births achieved sufficient levels to shift measles dynamics into annual cycles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">5.4</xref>).
