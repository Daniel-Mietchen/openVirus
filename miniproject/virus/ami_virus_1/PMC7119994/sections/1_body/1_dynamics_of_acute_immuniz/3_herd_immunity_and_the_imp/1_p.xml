<p>We can lay bare much of the dynamical behavior of immunizing epidemics by considering the case of the “simple” epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1c</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">d</xref>), in which the outbreak occurs sufficiently rapidly to ignore processes of host birth and death. The talismanic quantity here is the basic reproduction number (or ratio) of infection, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. At its simplest, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is defined as the total number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual when introduced into a well-mixed fully susceptible population. To illustrate the ensuing dynamics, consider an epidemic of infection with 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 0. Since each case initially causes 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> secondary infections, the epidemic increases more or less exponentially over the first few infectious generations (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1c</xref>). However, these dynamics rapidly deplete the susceptible pool. This brings us to the other key parameter of epidemic spread: the 
 <italic>effective</italic> reproduction number, defined as 
 <italic>R</italic> = [
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic>]
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>. Here, 
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic> is the proportion of susceptibles in the population and 
 <italic>R</italic> is the realized value of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> as the epidemic develops [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Since S declines over the course of the epidemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1c</xref>), so does 
 <italic>R</italic> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1d</xref>).
