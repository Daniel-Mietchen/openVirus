<p>This progressive decline in secondary infection rates through the epidemic is a manifestation of the key epidemiological process of 
 <italic>herd immunity</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] – increasing natural immunity of the population that indirectly protects the remaining susceptibles from infection. Eventually, the effective reproduction ratio declines through unity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1c</xref>) as population immunity increases; this corresponds to the herd immunity threshold, above which the epidemic will always decline, even if reintroduced to a closed population. This threshold is thus also a key aim of vaccination campaigns [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Remembering that 
 <italic>R</italic> = [
 <italic>S</italic>/
 <italic>N</italic>]
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub>, the associated susceptible proportion at the herd immunity threshold (
 <italic>R</italic> = 1) becomes 
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 1/
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1c</xref>); thus, immunizing at a level above 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 1 − 
 <italic>s</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> = 1 − 1/
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> will eliminate local transmission. As described below, these calculations have been refined considerably to allow for heterogeneities in transmission with age, space, and other characteristics (Sects. 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">4</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">5</xref>). Nonetheless, our simple expression for 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> is an extremely useful metaphor for epidemic control: (1) because of indirect protection, not everyone needs to be vaccinated to eliminate transmission (corresponding to 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> &lt; 1) and (2) the effort required to increase this level of immunization increases with transmission rates. The latter point is made clear by a simple plot of 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>c</sub> against 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">5.2</xref>); more transmissible immunizing infections such as measles are harder to control than less transmissible agents such as smallpox. However, this refers to “random” mass vaccination; more targeted strategies such as ring vaccination coupled to active surveillance can promote elimination even below 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>c</sub>, given (as with smallpox elimination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]) the right biological characteristics and logistics. Partial immunity and other characteristics of the population can complicate the picture still further (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">5.2</xref> below). Nonetheless, the metaphor that more transmissibility necessitates a stronger vaccination effort remains.
