<p>For directly transmitted infections, like measles, mumps, rubella, and influenza, the age profile of the force of infection is determined by the rate at which individuals of different ages interact. There are two approaches to estimating this variation. The first is to use age profiles of seropositivity to infer the pattern of the force of infection and, from this, extrapolate to the pattern of contacts over age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The link between these age profiles and the force of infection over age can be made since once an individual has been infected, she/he can never be infected again. Therefore, to be immune at any age, the individual must have contracted the infection prior to that age. On a population level, cross-sectional seropositivity thus provides an indication of the total risk of infection for individuals up to a given age. (Longitudinal age-serological profiles can be even more powerful in quantifying epidemic risk [
