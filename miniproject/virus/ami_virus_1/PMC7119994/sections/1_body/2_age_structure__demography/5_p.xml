<p>Understanding the processes underlying the average age of infection has a practical importance for any infection where the burden of disease shows an age profile. Rubella is a classic example. Infection during early childhood tends to be mild, but infection during pregnancy may result in birth of a child with congenital rubella syndrome, consisting of a range of birth defects (see Ref. [
