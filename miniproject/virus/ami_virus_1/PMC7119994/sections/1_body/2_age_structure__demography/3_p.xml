<p>The age profile of infection can be framed mathematically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], and parameters describing contacts between individuals of different ages inferred [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The resulting estimated matrix of contacts over age is known as the Who-Acquires-Infection-from-Whom or WAIFW matrix. Alternatively, patterns of contacts between individuals can be directly measured [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>], for example, using diary studies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">5.6</xref>); and by combining this with the age profile of infection within the population, the force of infection over age can be inferred [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].
