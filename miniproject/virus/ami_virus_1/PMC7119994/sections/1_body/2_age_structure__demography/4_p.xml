<p>The infection dynamics themselves may also influence the relationship between age and force of infection. If outbreaks are separated by long intervals during which little exposure occurs, individuals may remain susceptible for many years and thus contract the infection at a later age than might be predicted from the age profile of contacts alone [

More subtly, detailed network analyses show that even within a single influenza outbreak, the burden of disease can cascade from children (where contacts are highest) to the less connected adults as immunity accumulates within the children, with implications for optimal vaccination distribution [
