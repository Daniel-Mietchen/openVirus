<p>The mean age at which individuals become infected by immunizing viral infection is generally lower for infections with higher rates of transmission or

 <sub>0</sub> (defined above). Intuitively, this occurs because the faster an immunizing virus is spreading through a population, the younger the age at which individuals are likely to be exposed to it. Host demography modulates this relationship, and higher birth rate countries with an

 <sub>0</sub> equivalent to that in lower birth rate countries will tend to have a lower average age of infection [

Maternal immunity, or protection of children after birth by transfer of maternal antibodies, will also have an impact, increasing the average age of infection for children whose mothers have been exposed to infection. Since maternal antibodies rarely persist for much more than a year, this effect will be greatest for infections with very low average ages of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Beyond these broad descriptors, however, there is the added complication of possible relationships between age and probability of exposure to infection. Such relationships may arise for a variety of reasons. For example, only individuals beyond a certain age may work in areas where the disease is transmitted, or the disease may be only sexually transmitted. As a result, the force of infection, or probability that a susceptible individual will be infected, will show a distinct relationship with age.
