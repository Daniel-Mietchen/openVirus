<p>On a genetic level, the evolutionary pattern for influenza HA (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5.9a</xref>), showing serial replacement of strains through time, is often characterized as “drift.” The limited standing diversity, or “trunk-like” phylogeny, is especially paradoxical in light of the relatively high mutation rate of influenza A, where instead several lineages might have been expected to emerge and coexist in the population.
