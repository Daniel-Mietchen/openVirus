<p>Alongside these two prevailing paradigms of influenza evolution, yet another model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] proposes that observed strains are drawn from a limited set of antigenic types, with their selection dependent on niches in host population immunity. While each of these models succeeds in capturing important features of influenza dynamics, they also highlight important gaps in our understanding of viral evolution and how to manage it.
