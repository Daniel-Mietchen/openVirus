<p>The epochal evolution model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>] provides an alternative view. It builds on the proposal by Kimura in 1968 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] that many amino acid substitutions in nature do not alter evolutionary fitness and are thus 
 <italic>phenotypically neutral</italic>. If influenza HA evolution can be thought of as tracing a series of paths through a space of genotypes, the epochal evolution model proposes that, in phenotypic terms, such a space has a modular structure (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5.9b</xref>) in which each “module” is a group of genotypes sharing the same antigenic phenotype and a transition between modules corresponds to the observed antigenic “jumps.” In particular, HA evolution diffuses through the local genotype space, accumulating neutral substitutions and thus genotypic diversity, over several years. Ultimately, a single strain accumulates the substitutions required to transition to a new antigenic phenotype. At this point, the emergent strain – owing to its antigenic novelty – causes a peak in infection and undergoes a selective sweep in the host population, to the exclusion of other strains. Such an event thus acts to periodically control antigenic diversity, maintaining the “trunk-like” shape of the influenza phylogeny.
