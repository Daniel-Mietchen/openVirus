<p>The picture of “strain-transcending immunity” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>] invokes a temporary mode of immunity, which immediately follows recovery from infection and protects the individual against infection by all influenza strains. Such broad immunity is postulated to arise, for example, either from T cells or from innate immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Over the course of months, this broad immunity gives way to more long-lived, more narrowly acting immunity that is specific to the immunizing strain. On the population level, a key dynamical effect of such immunity structure is to impose population-level constraints on viral diversity, sufficiently strong to maintain a single dominant lineage through time.
