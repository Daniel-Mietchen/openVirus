<p>Had viruses been discovered by the time that Darwin proposed “descent with modification” in the mid-nineteenth century, they may quickly have been recognized as fine examples of evolution in action. Indeed, today there is wide acknowledgment of the inextricable role that evolution plays in viral dynamics [
