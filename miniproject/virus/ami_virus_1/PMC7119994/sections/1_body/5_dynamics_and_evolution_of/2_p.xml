<p>As a result of these high mutation rates, population-level evolutionary patterns that can arise are quite diverse. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">5.9a</xref> illustrates how some infections, such as HIV, show significant population-level diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>], while others, notably seasonal influenza A, exhibit a markedly different pattern, with a “trunk-like” phylogeny on the population level [
