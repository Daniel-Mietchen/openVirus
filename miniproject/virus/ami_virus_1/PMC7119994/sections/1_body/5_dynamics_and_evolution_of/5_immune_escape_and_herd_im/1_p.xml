<p>Classic theoretical principles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] provide a useful framework in which to think about viral evolution, where “evolutionary fitness” is determined ultimately by the capacity for transmission in a given host population. Recall from Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec5" ref-type="sec">2.3</xref> that in the presence of prior immunity in the population, the effective reproduction number, 
 <italic>R</italic>, serves as a compact measure of transmission potential. Vaccination aims to lower 
 <italic>R</italic> through reducing the number susceptible in the population; however, evolving pathogens introduce the complexity of countering this effect, by evading immunity and thus acting to restore 
 <italic>R</italic>. Note the combination of immune escape and transmissibility encapsulated in 
 <italic>R</italic>. In particular, on the scale of the host population and with a given level of existing immunity, the escape mutant with the greatest evolutionary fitness is that which maximizes 
 <italic>R</italic> [
