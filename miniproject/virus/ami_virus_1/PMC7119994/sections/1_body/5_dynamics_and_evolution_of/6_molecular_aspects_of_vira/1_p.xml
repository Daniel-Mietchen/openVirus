<p>As discussed in 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_21, the influenza surface protein hemagglutinin (HA) is a key immune target, with anti-HA antibodies capable of offering sterilizing immunity, that is, the potential to block host infection altogether. Indeed, raising such immunity is a central function of current influenza vaccines. However, HA is also the most variable viral component, continually under selective pressure to escape antibody binding [
