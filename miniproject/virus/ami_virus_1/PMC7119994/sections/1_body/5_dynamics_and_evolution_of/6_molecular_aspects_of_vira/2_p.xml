<p>An important mechanism of immune escape is through conformational changes of HA epitopes to abrogate antibody binding, without compromising the ability of the virus to attach to host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. More recently, however, results from mouse experiments suggest that escape mutants can also acquire increased viral avidity for host cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. Another potential immune escape strategy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>] is glycosylation, or the attachment of oligosaccharides to the HA molecule, to occlude epitopes from antibody binding. Such strategies are not without potential functional costs for replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], and yet there are indications that human influenza A/H3N2 has been accumulating glycosylation since its introduction into the human population in 1968 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>].
