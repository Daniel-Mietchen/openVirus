<p>Coinfection of dengue virus with other infections has been documented in the past [
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. DF per se is associated with hepatic involvement which ranges from minor alterations in the aminotransferase levels to acute hepatitis [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DHF is associated with a greater incidence of hepatitis and fulminant hepatitis than simple dengue fever [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The pathogenesis of liver involvement in DF is still poorly understood. Direct viral invasion of the liver cells or products of host immune response acting on liver cells is thought to contribute to the liver cell injury [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The elevation of transaminases is mild to moderate in most cases of DF, and the level of AST is greater than that of ALT [
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The levels decrease to normal levels usually within six weeks of resolution of infection [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, jaundice is an uncommon finding in DF [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].
