It bears great morphological resemblance with known human coronaviruses. Under the electric microscopes, SARS coronavirus presents with pleomorphic spherical particles with envelopes in Vero E6 cell in vitro and with a diameter of about 80&#x02013;140 mm. It has distinct coronavirus morphological characteristics that rodlike surface projections about 20&#x02013;40 nm long protrude outside viral envelope to form a corona. For separation and culture of viruses in Vero E6 cells, viral particles are mostly found in vacuoles inside cells under electric microscope, mainly hollow particle, and viruses outside cells observed with spikes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Physicochemical Characteristics</title><p id="Par12">The Coronavirus is mainly composed of nucleic acid, protein, carbonate, and lipid. SARS-CoV are relatively stable in human specimens and environment but relatively sensitive to chemical and physical factors. The viruses could be killed by exposure to ultraviolet rays for 60 min. As the envelope of SARS-CoV contains lipoids, they are sensitive to lipid solvents and could be inactivated by ether, chloroform, tween, 70 % ethyl alcohol, methanol, pancreatic enzymes, and ultraviolet rays. Ether could sterilize the virus completely under 4&#x000b0;Cafter 24 h, 75 % ethyl alcohol could deactivate virus after 5 min, and disinfectants containing chlorine may kill the virus aft.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Epidemiology</title><sec id="Sec14"><title>Overview of Epidemics</title><p id="Par13">SARS is the first newly emerging infectious disease in the twenty-first century. Since the first case was detected in Guangdong on January 2, 2003, SARS spread to 29 countries at five states at an unprecedented speed with several months. According to the report of WHO, SARS epidemics was found in total 29 countries at five states (including Hong Kong and Taiwan of China) from January 2, 2003, to September 26, 2003. Since January 2, 2003, which infected 8,098 patients and caused 774 casualties. Besides, there were 5,327 patients in China mainland (including 1,002 medical workers) with 349 deaths; 1,755 patients in Hong Kong with 299 deaths; 346 patients in Taiwan with 37 deaths; 251 patients in Canada with 43 deaths; 238 patients in Singapore with 33 deaths; 63 patients in Vietnam with 5 deaths and 29 patients in America but without casualty. Meanwhile, SARS cases were reported in 24 provinces, municipalities under direct governance of central government and autonomous regions in China mainland, with 2,521 infection cases and 183 deaths in Beijing and 512 infection cases and 57 deaths in Guangdong.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Source of Infection</title><p id="Par14">The main source of infection is SARS patients, and other infectious sources such as animals need to be further consolidated.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Symptomatic Patients</title><p id="Par15">It is regarded that only symptomatic patients can effectively spread SARS-CoV.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Asymptomatic Patients</title><p id="Par16">At present there still lacks clinical proof that asymptomatic SARS patients could spread SARS coronavirus.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Super-Spreader</title><p id="Par17">Few cases are highly contagious and able to directly infect over 10 patients, who are called super-spreader. The five super-spreaders in Singapore have been found infecting 103 people. Such powerful infectiousness is attributable to the high viral load inside patients who could discharge abundant viruses via respiratory tract in a short time.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Animal Source of Infection</title><p id="Par18">Specialists from the department of microbiology of Hong Kong University and Guangdong Provincial Disease Control and Prevention Center tested abundant SARS coronaviruses from the samples collected from civet cats sold in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, suggesting that the human SARS coronavirus might originate from civet cats.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Route of Spread</title><p id="Par19">SARS virus is spread mainly through the respiratory tract and also spread by aerosol and droplet.</p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Droplet Spread</title><p id="Par20">High level of SARS coronavirus could be detected in the throat swabs and sputum specimens of the patients in acute phase. Viruses discharged by patients via cough would exist in the air within certain radius, thus forming short-distance respiratory tract droplet spread. It is a main route of SARS dissemination.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Contact Spread</title><p id="Par21">Indirect or direct contact spread could also spread SARS coronavirus.

The homological analysis of SARS-CoV structural protein amino-acid sequences shows that the main structural protein S (spike protein), M (membrane protein), N (nucleocapsid protein), and E (envelope protein) bear very low homology with other known coronaviruses, between 20 and 30 %. Besides, bioinformation analysis infers that SARS-CoV may also encode 5&#x02013;9 nonstructural proteins of unknown functions. All these SARS-CoV specific proteins may play key roles in determining the viral virulence.</p><p id="Par30">S-protein, existent on the viral surface in form of trimer, is the main component in constructing the coronal structure and major structural protein for the integration of virus and host cell receptors and fusion of viral envelope and cell membrane to enable invasion of viruses. After infection with sensitive cells, SARS-Cov could replicate enormously and release virions, which may disturb cell metabolism and directly result in injury of body tissues and cells.</p><p id="Par31">In the early phase of the disease and in the continual progression phase, the active immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, NK cells, and DC cells are decreased prominently, to an extent positively correlated with severity of conditions and speed of progression. Besides, all dead patients are detected with irreversible significant decline. However, along with remission of conditions and entry into recovery phase, the number of aforementioned immune cells could be recovered to some extent, whose change presents distinct parallel correlation with disease evolution. Dynamic observations suggest that serum pre-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, and INF-&#x003b1; level of SARS patients could reach the peak at about second week of disease course, which relatively corresponds to the acute aggravation phase. All these consolidate the immune damage of SARS-CoV infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Pathological Changes</title><p id="Par32">Autopsies of the over 20 patients who died after infected with SARS revealed that SARS is a disease detrimental to organs of the whole body, particularly lung tissue and immunity system. Primary pathologic changes can be classified into severe lung lesions, immune organ impairment, toxic changes of other organs, and secondary infections. The causes of death were as follows: (1) diffusive lung alveolar damages lead to progressive respiratory failure; (2) impairment of liver, kidney, heart, and several other organs may induce multiple organ failures and exacerbate conditions; (3) due to injury of immune organs particularly lymph nodes and spleen, the lymphocytes are decreased and immunity compromised, therefore resulting in secondary mycotic infections.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Lungs</title><sec id="Sec34"><title>Naked-Eye Observation</title><p id="Par33">Lung tissues become swollen and heavier. According to domestic report, the left lung may reach 500&#x02013;1480 g (average 811.4 g) and right lung 700&#x02013;1125 g (average 869.3 g), with the total lung up to 1170&#x02013;2605 g (average 1460.7 g). The lung tissues appear in dark red. Texture is hard, indicative of consolidation. The surface is relatively smooth and free of pleural adhesions. Lung tissues are observed with blood vessel dilation and congestion, spotted and patchy necrosis, and hemorrhagic infarct foci and focal compensatory emphysema. Sections of various lung lobes are visualized with outflows of light red or/and a few foamy blood-stained fluids. The trachea and bronchi are found with exudations of slight mucoid or blood-stained secretions. Pulmonary hilar lymph nodes are revealed with slight enlargement and pleural cavity without or with a few effusions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec35"><title>Observation Under the Light Microscope</title><p id="Par34">Microscopy reveals bilateral diffusive severe injuries of alveoli, characterized by acute exudative, hemorrhagic, and fibrinous inflammation. However, the injury may be inhomogeneous and diverse at different lung lobes and different parts of the same lobe. The characteristic change in early phase is pulmonary edema, with homogeneous pink serous or fibrinous effusions filling alveolar cavities as well as erythrocytes leakages in some cavities. The effusions from some alveolar cavities may condense to form thin-layer membranelike substance which adheres to alveolar walls, namely, formation of hyaline membrane (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>). Alveolar epithelia present with such diffusive injuries as degeneration and necrosis, with exfoliated or/and apoptotic type II alveolar epithelial cells observable in alveolar cavities, which are similar to changes of desquamative pneumonia (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>). Among them, some appear like apoptotic bodies. Partial regional type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages proliferate actively, with obvious increase of cell volume and distinct nucleolus. In some case, cells are detected fusing with each other to form syncytial monocytes and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref>). The alveolar epithelia of some cases are examined with structures similar to viral inclusion bodies, mostly spherical and with eosinophilic staining, around which a transparent halo is visible (Fig. <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">2.4</xref>). Pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces are detected with high dilation and congestion of capillaries, swelling and exfoliation of epithelial cells, as well as widening of the latter, which present slight lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, small vessel proliferation, and enlargement characteristic of vasculitis changes. Some regions are observed with pulmonary vascular embolism or fibrinous microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, while some alveolar capillary cavities manifest dilation but free of blood components. In addition, some patients are detected with lung tissue focal hemorrhage, compensatory emphysema, and small airway necrotizing inflammation and alveolar collapse or shrinkage. Patients with a disease course of over three weeks manifest fibroblast proliferation in alveolar septa, and individual cases demonstrate organization of fibrinous exudates from alveoli and fibroblast proliferation, which gives rise to glomeruloid structures, named &#x0201c;glomeruloid organizing pneumonia&#x0201d; (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">2.5</xref>). The bronchial epithelial cells are revealed with exfoliation, scarce and exfoliated cilia, as well as structures similar to viral inclusions and squamous cell metaplasia at the inside.

Besides edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and other nonspecific inflammatory changes, the more prominent pulmonary pathological feature of SARS is abundant exfoliation of epithelial cells, inducing obvious thickening and damage of alveolar septum, as well as significant organization of effusions inside alveolar cavities. All the three changes of inflammation in early phase (degeneration, exudation, hyperplasia) are observable. The mechanism of acute lung injury induced by SARS may be ascribed to SARS coronavirus direct attack of alveolar epithelia and alveolar capillary epithelia or (and) indirect damage via lymphocyte, macrophage and effector cells, and lymphokine, cytokine, and inflammatory mediator released by them. This suggests that besides viral direct infection, immune reactions are also involved in lung injury.</p><p id="Par112">In severe lung injury, pulmonary interstitial and pulmonary parenchymal air cavity changes detected by autopsy pathology, especially pulmonary air cavity not completely filled by lesion or filled but coexistent with unfilled alveoli, are visualized as ground-glass-density shadows on X-ray and CT. Varying degrees of residual lung cavity present with different densities of ground-glass shadows on thin-layer CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT). Complete filling of the alveolar space leads to pulmonary consolidation shadows.</p><p id="Par113">Once pulmonary edema and alveolar hyaline membrane are formed, patients clinically manifest decreased lung compliance, progressive dyspnea, and intractable hypoxemia. It is such rapid pathological changes of SARS that give rise to characteristic presentations by chest X-ray examination, including rapid progression of lesions, diverse morphological states, and wide range, often spanning several segments and lobes. Therefore, dynamic observation of chest image holds great significance for diagnosis of SARS.</p></sec><sec id="Sec96"><title>Basic Imaging Manifestations of SARS</title><sec id="Sec97"><title>Ground-Glass-Density Shadows</title><p id="Par114">Ground-glass-density shadows are pathologically the result of lesions mainly at pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, with pulmonary interstitial lesions frequently complicated by alveolitis. Ground-glass-density shadows incurred by alveolar consolidation are attributable to partial filling of alveoli or coexistence of filling and unfilled alveoli. Such shadows on X-ray and CT can be determined if the density of lesions is lower than that of blood vessels, and blood vessel presentations are observable inside. The density of lesions lower than that of pulmonary hila on X-ray could also help identify ground-glass-density shadows.</p></sec><sec id="Sec98"><title>Pulmonary Consolidation Shadows</title><p id="Par115">Pulmonary consolidation shadows are pathologically due to filling of alveoli by pathological tissues, which is frequently complicated with lung interstitial lesions. Pulmonary consolidation could be confirmed if the lesions are found with higher density than vascular shadows and without vascular shadows inside but with air bronchogram on X-ray and CT. It could also be determined if the lesions present higher density than pulmonary hila or similar density to mediastinum. The lesions are solitary or multiple in small patches, and some lesions are distributed along lung lobes and segments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec99"><title>Chest X-Ray Manifestations of SARS</title><sec id="Sec100"><title>Early Phase of Onset</title><p id="Par116">96 % of SARS patients may develop subsequently solitary and multiple small patchy shadows within seven days of onset, with relatively low density, blurry borders, and irregular shapes, predominantly solitary. Occasionally, the pulmonary textures around lesions are revealed increased and thickened and mainly distributed at peripheral area, more commonly at bilateral inferior lungs. Since chest X-ray can poorly visualize relatively small lesions and at sometimes posteroanterior X-ray can hardly display lesions overlapping with heart shadows, orthotopic chest imaging should be conducted at the same time (Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">2.9</xref>).<fig id="Fig9"><label>Fig. 2.9</label><caption><p>The 18-year-old male patient diagnosed with SARS.

The intrapulmonary patchy shadows present with shrinkage and increase of density to gradually form high-density cord-like and honeycomb-shaped shadows in lungs. Severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could dwindle the lung volume and make the mediastinum shift to the affected side. The imaging may reveal local irregular high-density plaque and cord-shaped shadows.

Therefore, observation of the disease dynamic change is critical to SARS chest X-ray, which is a major difference from X-ray examinations of other pneumonia. In the early phase and progression phase of SARS, lung foci may undergo remarkable changes within a short time (24 h at the shortest), such as expansion and dissemination, which are characterized by changes in shape, extent, and site of the foci. This suggests that clinical physicians shall conduct chest orthotopic imaging once every 24&#x02013;48 h after the SARS patients are hospitalized so as to ascertain the disease changes.</p><p id="Par123">Imaging dynamic changes are associated with multiple factors, such as age, original underlying disease, treatment method, and efficacy. The lesions are generally absorbed 14 days after onset but possibly on day 7 in some mild patients. The focal shadows may become smaller with the density gradually decreased. One characteristic dynamic change of SARS is migrating change of lesions in some patients, suggesting that the foci firstly occur at the unilateral inferior lung field and then spread to contralateral and/or superior and middle lung field. Patients with worse lesions may manifest wider imaging extent and new foci, and severe patients may develop &#x0201c;white lung.&#x0201d; ARDS is a key cause leading to death of patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">2.12</xref>).<fig id="Fig12"><label>Fig. 2.12</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold>) The male patient aged 34 years old was confirmed with SARS.

In initial phase, focal shadows are frequently seen, which might be unilateral but dominantly bilateral. CT reveals small patchy ground-glass-density shadows, some of which are quasi-circular. Lesions present as solitary small patchy lung consolidation and multiple small patchy or relatively large patchy shadows. Large foci may appear as ground-glass-density shadows and concurrent lung consolidation shadows, with relatively higher-density vascular shadows observable in the former. Besides, some foci are found with increased vascular shadows at the periphery. In addition, lesions are unveiled frequently at the bilateral lung inferior fields and lung margins (Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">2.13</xref>).<fig id="Fig13"><label>Fig. 2.13</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold>) The male patient aged 25 years old was diagnosed with SARS (right inferior lung segment pneumonia).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec107"><title>Progression Phase</title><p id="Par126">Lesions in majority patients may progress and worsen within 14 days after onset. The small patchy shadows in early phase could expand into large patchy, multiple, or diffusive lesions within 3&#x02013;7 days. Besides, lesions extend from unilateral lung to bilateral lungs, from one lung field to multiple lung fields. Most patients could develop the severest infiltration of lungs on day 8&#x02013;14, namely, peak phase or &#x0201c;critical&#x0201d; phase. CT presentations are still predominated by ground-glass-density shadows, which may be complicated by pulmonary consolidation. Lesions are commonly multiple and in diffusive distribution at both lungs, and lesions of varying shapes may coexist, with quasi-circular foci relatively common. Some cases appear with ground-glass-density shadows all the time from onset to absorption of lesions.</p><p id="Par127">When ground-glass-density shadows are complicated by pulmonary consolidation, the large patchy, small patchy, or quasi-circular ground-glass-density shadows could be observed with pulmonary consolidation shadows of relatively high density. Ground-glass density and pulmonary consolidation may also occur at different parts of the lung and could be visualized on the same layer or different layers of CT. For lesions typical of pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary consolidation appears as plaque-shaped high-density shadows or consolidation signs at lung lobes and segments. In addition, lesions are frequently recorded at lung lobe segment of the inferior lobe and outer band of lung field (Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">2.14</xref>).<fig id="Fig14"><label>Fig. 2.14</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold>) The male patient aged 52 years old was tested positive for the specific segment RT-PCR of SARS virus RNA.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec108"><title>Recovery Phase</title><p id="Par128">Lesions usually begin to be absorbed 2&#x02013;3 weeks after onset, with the shadow shrunk and density gradually reduced and absorbed. Although the clinical symptoms of some patients improve and disappear, light ground-glass-density shadows could still be seen in lungs on CT. It may prolong a relatively long time. During the absorption of intrapulmonary lesions, there is also concurrent pulmonary interstitial proliferation, which begins to be absorbed under dynamic observation. Some lesions may develop into pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, characterized by lobular septum, intralobular septum, interstitial thickening, and subpleural curvature imaging signs as well as regional irregular high-density plaque and cord-like presentations. Occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb manifestations and tractional bronchiectasis signifies pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (Fig. <xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">2.15</xref>).<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig. 2.15</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>e</bold>) The male patient aged 44 years old was confirmed with SARS.

Right lung middle and inferior lobe was detected with lobular septum thickening and subpleural curvature shadows</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="322239_1_En_2_Fig15_HTML" id="MO15"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec109"><title>Imaging Diagnosis of Complications</title><p id="Par129">SARS complication is an important factor affecting prognosis, which should be given enormous attentions. During SARS treatment, antiviral drugs are administered as well as glucocorticoids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Some patients may still need airway positive pressure ventilation, tracheotomy, and tracheal intubation. Reasonable use of such measures is of great significance for improving the treatment rate and lowering mortality of SARS patients. However, to be noted, such treatment drugs and methods may incur adverse reactions and cause complications. SARS complications already detected encompass pulmonary secondary infection, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, bone aseptic necrosis, empyema, brain secondary infection, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Such complications or sequela changes are also mainly identified by imaging examinations. Familiarity about SARS imaging manifestations and knowledge about complication imaging presentations could elevate SARS diagnostic level, therefore increasing cure rate and decreasing mortality.</p><sec id="Sec110"><title>Imaging Diagnosis of Pulmonary Interstitial Fibrosis</title><sec id="Sec111"><title>Pathogenesis and Clinical Data</title><p id="Par130">In the early phase, SARS manifests bronchiolar and peripheral interstitial pneumonia, which could further progress into alveolar consolidation, with interstitial lesions present persistently and mostly reversible. In the recovery phase, only some cases develop into pulmonary interstitial proliferation and then cause fibrotic changes. Pulmonary interstitial proliferation and fibrosis degree and outcome are associated with the extent of pulmonary involvement in peak phase, occurrence of complications, and treatment. Generally, if lesions on chest image are light in peak phase, there will be fewer pulmonary changes left in recovery phase. Contrarily, patients with diffusive lung interstitial thickening in recovery phase are often those suffering from relatively severe pulmonary injury in peak phase and involvement of the great mass of lungs, particularly patients with recurrent conditions, protracted course, and concurrent infections. Researches demonstrate that 7&#x02013;8 % of SARS patients have pulmonary fibrosis of varying degrees and male patients display relatively more obvious pulmonary impairment than female patients. Primary manifestations are lung dysfunction, such as decrease of pulmonary diffusion capacity, lung capacity impairment, and change of total lung capacity particularly residual volume.</p></sec><sec id="Sec112"><title>Imaging Manifestations</title><p id="Par131">Generally obvious pulmonary interstitial proliferation occurs at about 30&#x02013;50 days after onset, which presents firstly lobular septum and intralobular thickening and subpleural curvature shadows. Then there is the shrinkage of intrapulmonary patchy shadows with increase of density and gradual formation of high-density cord and honeycomb shadows inside lungs. Severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could diminish lung volume and compel the mediastinum to affected side. Besides, pulmonary interstitial proliferation could occur extensively inside lungs, predominated by lobular septum, intralobular interstitial thickening, and subpleural curvature shadows, as well as irregular high-density plaque and cord-like shadows at some regions. Honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis are signs of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. CT reveals cord, reticulate, and honeycomb-shaped shadows, and HRCT could better visualize the subtle abnormal changes of pulmonary interstitium, such as lobular septum thickening, intralobular interstitial thickening, subpleural curvature shadows, and honeycomb-shaped shadows. Whether the cord-like and reticulate changes visualized by CT are completely absorbed or induce persistent fibrosis still entails long-term follow-up observation (Fig. <xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">2.16</xref>).<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig. 2.16</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>c</bold>) The female patient aged 54 years old was detected with SARS complicated by pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.

The patient was hospitalized on March 4, 2003, and cured and discharged on May 15, 2003. On July 21, 2003, CT revealed scattered plaque shadows of increased density, subpleural curvature shadows, and other pulmonary interstitial fibrosis presentations at both lung fields</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="322239_1_En_2_Fig16_HTML" id="MO16"/></fig>
</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec113"><title>Aseptic Necrosis of Femoral Head</title><sec id="Sec114"><title>Pathogenesis and Clinical Data</title><p id="Par132">Numerous SARS patients develop osteonecrosis after recovery, which mostly appears as femoral head necrosis and also possibly necrosis of the ankle joint, knee joint, and shoulder joint. Scans of bilateral hips and knees of 82 SARS patients in rehabilitation phase disclosed that 51 patients (62 %) suffered from osseous abnormality, of which bone ischemia accounts for 17 % and implication of three sites for 20 %. Its pathogenesis still remains not completely ascertained, and it may be ascribed to improper use of hormones and injury of sclerotin from SARS viruses, bacterial embolism, lipid embolism, or multiple mixed factors. The primary pathological change of aseptic necrosis of femoral head is degenerative alteration due to femoral head blood circulation disturbance, mainly characterized by limping and pain. The lower limb of the affected side is relatively shorter and presents with light flexion and adduction, as well as with slightly limited abduction and intorsion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec115"><title>Imaging Manifestations of Aseptic Necrosis of Femoral Head</title><p id="Par133">Initial X-ray examinations suggest that the involved femoral head has normal appearance but inhomogeneous density, with spotted osteoporosis. Gradually ensue the increase of density as a result of osteonecrosis, which meanwhile is interspersed with some transparent shadows. Femoral head may become flat, fragmented, and irregular in contour from pressures. Typical femoral head necrosis appears in the shape of wedge, with the base toward articular surface and the top toward metaphysis. Since lesions are dominantly confined at the anterosuperior area of femoral head, lateral imaging of hip joints could clearly reproduce the extent of lesions. The necrotic area is encircled by a ring of transparent band. Hip articular cavity may become wider and irregular due to flattening of the femur. Sometimes, there may be complication of dislocation. The fragments of femoral head may be shed off into the joint, giving rise to joint mouse.</p><p id="Par134">Normal femoral head is located at the acetabular center in the transverse CT image and may appear in the shape of sphere or hook on different layers, with delicate high-density bone cortex at the periphery. The high-density trabeculae inside femoral head are arranged in stelliform formation from the center continually to bone cortex, named as &#x0201c;stelliform sign.&#x0201d; CT manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head can be divided into early and advanced phase. In the early phase, the stelliform sign formed by the trabeculae of femoral head is deformed or absent, presenting spotted and patchy shadows of increased density inside femoral head and fasciculate changes or mutual fusion at its periphery. In the advanced phase, femoral head become ruptured and out of shape, and absorption of sclerotin between bone fragments appears as irregular low-density area, with stelliform sign disappeared.</p><p id="Par135">MRI manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head include: necrotic areas of femoral head of early cases have no repair reactions or mechanic collapse and still maintain normal lipid signals of medullary bones. However, low-signal margins incurred by sclerosis reactions could be seen at the periphery of foci. The T1 high signals of normal femoral head on T1-weighted image are detected with black linear low signals (representing demarcation between normal and ischemic bone tissues). On T2-weighted image, a high-signal line is visible at the medial low-signal sclerotic reaction line, thus forming the typical double-line sign. The double-line sign could reflect congestion and inflammation of granulation tissues and proves specific to aseptic necrosis of femoral head. Severe inflammation, congestion, fibrosis, and sclerosis could greatly deplete the amount of lipids of femoral head, which presents liquid-like signals on MRI, low signals on T1-weighted image, and high signals on T2-weighted images. Advanced cases are typical of fibrosis and sclerosis, and the affected area present with fibrotic MRI features, that is, low signals on T1- and T2-weighted and proton density-weighted imaging. Complication with effusions in hip joints appears as T1 low signals and T2 high signals.</p><p id="Par136">Based on MRI presentations, aseptic necrosis of femoral head could be classified into four phases: phase I is characterized by homogenous or inhomogeneous low-signal areas adjacent to the joint above the femoral head on T1-weighted imaging; phase II is visualized with wedge-shaped low-signal bands; phase III presents with sequestrum crescent sign and cortex collapse; phase IV manifests joint degeneration and joint space narrowing besides presentations of phase III. In light of the aforementioned MR staging criteria, SARS cases complicated by aseptic necrosis of femoral head already reported are mostly in phase II.</p><p id="Par137">Additionally, aseptic necrosis after use of hormones, besides most frequently involvement of the femoral head, could also implicate other joints, such as the knee joint, elbow joint, ankle joint, and acetabulum. Therefore, if necessary, MR examinations of other joints shall be conducted to ascertain the extent and degree of lesions. If SARS patients complain of pain at both hip joints and limited movement, CT scan or MRI examination of both hip joints is recommended to conclude definite diagnosis. X-ray plain scan is not sensitive to early bone ischemic necrosis, which therefore is not preferred (Fig. <xref rid="Fig17" ref-type="fig">2.17</xref> and <xref rid="Fig18" ref-type="fig">2.18</xref>).<fig id="Fig17"><label>Fig. 2.17</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>&#x02013;<bold>f</bold>) The male patient aged 28 years old was examined with SARS and concurrent ischemic necrosis of right femoral head.
