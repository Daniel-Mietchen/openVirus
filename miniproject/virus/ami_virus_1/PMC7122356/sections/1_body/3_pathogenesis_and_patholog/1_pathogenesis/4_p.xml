<p id="Par31">In the early phase of the disease and in the continual progression phase, the active immune cells such as CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, NK cells, and DC cells are decreased prominently, to an extent positively correlated with severity of conditions and speed of progression. Besides, all dead patients are detected with irreversible significant decline. However, along with remission of conditions and entry into recovery phase, the number of aforementioned immune cells could be recovered to some extent, whose change presents distinct parallel correlation with disease evolution. Dynamic observations suggest that serum pre-inflammatory cytokine IL-6, IL-8, IL-16, and INF-Î± level of SARS patients could reach the peak at about second week of disease course, which relatively corresponds to the acute aggravation phase. All these consolidate the immune damage of SARS-CoV infections.</p>
