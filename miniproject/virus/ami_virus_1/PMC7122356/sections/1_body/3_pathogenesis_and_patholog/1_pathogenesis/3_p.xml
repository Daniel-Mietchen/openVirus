<p id="Par30">S-protein, existent on the viral surface in form of trimer, is the main component in constructing the coronal structure and major structural protein for the integration of virus and host cell receptors and fusion of viral envelope and cell membrane to enable invasion of viruses. After infection with sensitive cells, SARS-Cov could replicate enormously and release virions, which may disturb cell metabolism and directly result in injury of body tissues and cells.</p>
