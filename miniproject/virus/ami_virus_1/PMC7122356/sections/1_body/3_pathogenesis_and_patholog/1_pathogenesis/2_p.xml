<p id="Par29">The member of Coronaviridae is a single-chain positive RNA virus, which taxonomically belongs to Nidovirales with Arteriviridae. The homological analysis of SARS-CoV structural protein amino-acid sequences shows that the main structural protein S (spike protein), M (membrane protein), N (nucleocapsid protein), and E (envelope protein) bear very low homology with other known coronaviruses, between 20 and 30 %. Besides, bioinformation analysis infers that SARS-CoV may also encode 5â€“9 nonstructural proteins of unknown functions. All these SARS-CoV specific proteins may play key roles in determining the viral virulence.</p>
