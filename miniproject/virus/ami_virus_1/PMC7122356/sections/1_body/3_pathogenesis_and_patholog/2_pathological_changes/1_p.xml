<p id="Par32">Autopsies of the over 20 patients who died after infected with SARS revealed that SARS is a disease detrimental to organs of the whole body, particularly lung tissue and immunity system. Primary pathologic changes can be classified into severe lung lesions, immune organ impairment, toxic changes of other organs, and secondary infections. The causes of death were as follows: (1) diffusive lung alveolar damages lead to progressive respiratory failure; (2) impairment of liver, kidney, heart, and several other organs may induce multiple organ failures and exacerbate conditions; (3) due to injury of immune organs particularly lymph nodes and spleen, the lymphocytes are decreased and immunity compromised, therefore resulting in secondary mycotic infections.</p>
