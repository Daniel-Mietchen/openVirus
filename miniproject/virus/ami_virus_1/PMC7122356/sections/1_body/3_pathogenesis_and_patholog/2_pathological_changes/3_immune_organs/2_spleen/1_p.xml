<p id="Par36">The spleen mostly shrinks with soft texture, and has patchy and focal hemorrhage at the surface and sections. Splenic white pulp is detected obviously atrophic or absent, with central arterial wall thickened, endothelial cells swollen and partially shed, peripheral lymphatic sheath lymphocyte depleted greatly, and germinal center disappeared. Splenic corpuscle is observed with plasma protein sedimentation in central arterial walls, white pulp and marginal sinus lymph tissues with large patchy necrosis, and partial remaining lymphocytes with apoptosis. The splenic sinus inside red pulp is revealed with obvious congestion and focal hemorrhagic necrosis as well as proliferation of histiocytes (Fig.
