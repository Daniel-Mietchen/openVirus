<p id="Par34">Microscopy reveals bilateral diffusive severe injuries of alveoli, characterized by acute exudative, hemorrhagic, and fibrinous inflammation. However, the injury may be inhomogeneous and diverse at different lung lobes and different parts of the same lobe. The characteristic change in early phase is pulmonary edema, with homogeneous pink serous or fibrinous effusions filling alveolar cavities as well as erythrocytes leakages in some cavities. The effusions from some alveolar cavities may condense to form thin-layer membranelike substance which adheres to alveolar walls, namely, formation of hyaline membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>). Alveolar epithelia present with such diffusive injuries as degeneration and necrosis, with exfoliated or/and apoptotic type II alveolar epithelial cells observable in alveolar cavities, which are similar to changes of desquamative pneumonia (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>). Among them, some appear like apoptotic bodies. Partial regional type II alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages proliferate actively, with obvious increase of cell volume and distinct nucleolus. In some case, cells are detected fusing with each other to form syncytial monocytes and multinucleated giant cells (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">2.3</xref>). The alveolar epithelia of some cases are examined with structures similar to viral inclusion bodies, mostly spherical and with eosinophilic staining, around which a transparent halo is visible (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">2.4</xref>). Pulmonary interstitium and alveolar spaces are detected with high dilation and congestion of capillaries, swelling and exfoliation of epithelial cells, as well as widening of the latter, which present slight lymphocyte and monocyte infiltration, small vessel proliferation, and enlargement characteristic of vasculitis changes. Some regions are observed with pulmonary vascular embolism or fibrinous microthrombi in alveolar capillaries, while some alveolar capillary cavities manifest dilation but free of blood components. In addition, some patients are detected with lung tissue focal hemorrhage, compensatory emphysema, and small airway necrotizing inflammation and alveolar collapse or shrinkage. Patients with a disease course of over three weeks manifest fibroblast proliferation in alveolar septa, and individual cases demonstrate organization of fibrinous exudates from alveoli and fibroblast proliferation, which gives rise to glomeruloid structures, named “glomeruloid organizing pneumonia” (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">2.5</xref>). The bronchial epithelial cells are revealed with exfoliation, scarce and exfoliated cilia, as well as structures similar to viral inclusions and squamous cell metaplasia at the inside. The bronchioli are detected with submucosal edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and serous grandular hyperplasia with hyperactive secretion.
