<p id="Par33">Lung tissues become swollen and heavier. According to domestic report, the left lung may reach 500–1480 g (average 811.4 g) and right lung 700–1125 g (average 869.3 g), with the total lung up to 1170–2605 g (average 1460.7 g). The lung tissues appear in dark red. Texture is hard, indicative of consolidation. The surface is relatively smooth and free of pleural adhesions. Lung tissues are observed with blood vessel dilation and congestion, spotted and patchy necrosis, and hemorrhagic infarct foci and focal compensatory emphysema. Sections of various lung lobes are visualized with outflows of light red or/and a few foamy blood-stained fluids. The trachea and bronchi are found with exudations of slight mucoid or blood-stained secretions. Pulmonary hilar lymph nodes are revealed with slight enlargement and pleural cavity without or with a few effusions.</p>
