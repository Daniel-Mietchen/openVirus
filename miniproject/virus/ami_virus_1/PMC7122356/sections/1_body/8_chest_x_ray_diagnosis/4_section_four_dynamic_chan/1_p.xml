<p id="Par122">As rapid change is an important feature of SARS chest X-ray manifestations, dynamic X-ray studies and observations could provide evidences for SARS definite diagnosis. Therefore, observation of the disease dynamic change is critical to SARS chest X-ray, which is a major difference from X-ray examinations of other pneumonia. In the early phase and progression phase of SARS, lung foci may undergo remarkable changes within a short time (24 h at the shortest), such as expansion and dissemination, which are characterized by changes in shape, extent, and site of the foci. This suggests that clinical physicians shall conduct chest orthotopic imaging once every 24â€“48 h after the SARS patients are hospitalized so as to ascertain the disease changes.</p>
