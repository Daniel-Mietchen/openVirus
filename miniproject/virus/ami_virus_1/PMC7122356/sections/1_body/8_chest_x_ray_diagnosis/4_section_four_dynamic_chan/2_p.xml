<p id="Par123">Imaging dynamic changes are associated with multiple factors, such as age, original underlying disease, treatment method, and efficacy. The lesions are generally absorbed 14 days after onset but possibly on day 7 in some mild patients. The focal shadows may become smaller with the density gradually decreased. One characteristic dynamic change of SARS is migrating change of lesions in some patients, suggesting that the foci firstly occur at the unilateral inferior lung field and then spread to contralateral and/or superior and middle lung field. Patients with worse lesions may manifest wider imaging extent and new foci, and severe patients may develop “white lung.” ARDS is a key cause leading to death of patients (Fig.
