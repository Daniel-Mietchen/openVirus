<p id="Par115">Pulmonary consolidation shadows are pathologically due to filling of alveoli by pathological tissues, which is frequently complicated with lung interstitial lesions. Pulmonary consolidation could be confirmed if the lesions are found with higher density than vascular shadows and without vascular shadows inside but with air bronchogram on X-ray and CT. It could also be determined if the lesions present higher density than pulmonary hila or similar density to mediastinum. The lesions are solitary or multiple in small patches, and some lesions are distributed along lung lobes and segments.</p>
