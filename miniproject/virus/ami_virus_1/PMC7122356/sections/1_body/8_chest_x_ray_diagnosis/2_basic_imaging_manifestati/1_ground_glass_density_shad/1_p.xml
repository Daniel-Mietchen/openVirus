<p id="Par114">Ground-glass-density shadows are pathologically the result of lesions mainly at pulmonary interstitium and alveoli, with pulmonary interstitial lesions frequently complicated by alveolitis. Ground-glass-density shadows incurred by alveolar consolidation are attributable to partial filling of alveoli or coexistence of filling and unfilled alveoli. Such shadows on X-ray and CT can be determined if the density of lesions is lower than that of blood vessels, and blood vessel presentations are observable inside. The density of lesions lower than that of pulmonary hila on X-ray could also help identify ground-glass-density shadows.</p>
