<p id="Par116">96 % of SARS patients may develop subsequently solitary and multiple small patchy shadows within seven days of onset, with relatively low density, blurry borders, and irregular shapes, predominantly solitary. Occasionally, the pulmonary textures around lesions are revealed increased and thickened and mainly distributed at peripheral area, more commonly at bilateral inferior lungs. Since chest X-ray can poorly visualize relatively small lesions and at sometimes posteroanterior X-ray can hardly display lesions overlapping with heart shadows, orthotopic chest imaging should be conducted at the same time (Fig.
