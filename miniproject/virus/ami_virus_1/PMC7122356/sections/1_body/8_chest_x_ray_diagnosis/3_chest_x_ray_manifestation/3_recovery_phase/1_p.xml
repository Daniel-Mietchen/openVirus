<p id="Par121">The lesions of SARS patients begin to be absorbed in 15–30 days, which can be completely absorbed for majority patients. A few patients may show pulmonary fibrosis or pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia, with apparent pulmonary interstitial hyperplasia occurring 30–40 days after the onset. The intrapulmonary patchy shadows present with shrinkage and increase of density to gradually form high-density cord-like and honeycomb-shaped shadows in lungs. Severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could dwindle the lung volume and make the mediastinum shift to the affected side. The imaging may reveal local irregular high-density plaque and cord-shaped shadows. Occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis is the characteristic of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (Fig.
