<p id="Par111">The imaging manifestations of SARS are closely related to its pathological changes. Besides edema, inflammatory cell infiltration and other nonspecific inflammatory changes, the more prominent pulmonary pathological feature of SARS is abundant exfoliation of epithelial cells, inducing obvious thickening and damage of alveolar septum, as well as significant organization of effusions inside alveolar cavities. All the three changes of inflammation in early phase (degeneration, exudation, hyperplasia) are observable. The mechanism of acute lung injury induced by SARS may be ascribed to SARS coronavirus direct attack of alveolar epithelia and alveolar capillary epithelia or (and) indirect damage via lymphocyte, macrophage and effector cells, and lymphokine, cytokine, and inflammatory mediator released by them. This suggests that besides viral direct infection, immune reactions are also involved in lung injury.</p>
