<p id="Par112">In severe lung injury, pulmonary interstitial and pulmonary parenchymal air cavity changes detected by autopsy pathology, especially pulmonary air cavity not completely filled by lesion or filled but coexistent with unfilled alveoli, are visualized as ground-glass-density shadows on X-ray and CT. Varying degrees of residual lung cavity present with different densities of ground-glass shadows on thin-layer CT or high-resolution CT (HRCT). Complete filling of the alveolar space leads to pulmonary consolidation shadows.</p>
