<p id="Par44">Most SARS patients have cough, which is dry with scanty sputum. Generally SARS does not incur upper respiratory tract catarrhal symptoms. Severe cases may suffer from accelerated respiration, shortness of breath, or even acute respiratory distress syndrome, characterized by progressive dyspnea or even distress with respiratory frequency up to &gt;20 times.</p>
