<p id="Par11">SARS-CoV is a single-stranded and positive RNA virus belonging to the genus Coronavirus of Coronaviridae family of Nidovirales order. It bears great morphological resemblance with known human coronaviruses. Under the electric microscopes, SARS coronavirus presents with pleomorphic spherical particles with envelopes in Vero E6 cell in vitro and with a diameter of about 80–140 mm. It has distinct coronavirus morphological characteristics that rodlike surface projections about 20–40 nm long protrude outside viral envelope to form a corona. For separation and culture of viruses in Vero E6 cells, viral particles are mostly found in vacuoles inside cells under electric microscope, mainly hollow particle, and viruses outside cells observed with spikes.</p>
