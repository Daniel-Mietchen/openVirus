<p id="Par12">The Coronavirus is mainly composed of nucleic acid, protein, carbonate, and lipid. SARS-CoV are relatively stable in human specimens and environment but relatively sensitive to chemical and physical factors. The viruses could be killed by exposure to ultraviolet rays for 60 min. As the envelope of SARS-CoV contains lipoids, they are sensitive to lipid solvents and could be inactivated by ether, chloroform, tween, 70 % ethyl alcohol, methanol, pancreatic enzymes, and ultraviolet rays. Ether could sterilize the virus completely under 4Â°Cafter 24 h, 75 % ethyl alcohol could deactivate virus after 5 min, and disinfectants containing chlorine may kill the virus aft.</p>
