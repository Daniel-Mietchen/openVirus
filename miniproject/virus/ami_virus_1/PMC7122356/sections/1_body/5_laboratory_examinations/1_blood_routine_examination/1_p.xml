<p id="Par54">The white blood cell count remains within normal range in majority patients and may decrease in some patients (24.2 %). 95 % of severe patients without secondary infections are revealed with decreased total white blood cell, and normal neutrocyte and monocyte differential white blood cell count. However, 80 % initially diagnosed patients manifest a decrease of absolute lymphocyte count, suggestive of a tendency of gradual decline, and morphocytology change, with abnormal lymphocytes observable. 13.2â€“41 % patients are examined with thrombocytopenia. Many evidences prove that SARS-CoV could directly invade the immune system and act mainly on lymphocytic system, especially the T lymphocytes, which could lower peripheral blood lymphocytes. The peripheral blood white cell count is normal or decreased in most SARS patients, but CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T lymphocyte counts are distinctly lower compared with those of healthy population. The more severe the condition, the more drastically declined the T lymphocyte count.</p>
