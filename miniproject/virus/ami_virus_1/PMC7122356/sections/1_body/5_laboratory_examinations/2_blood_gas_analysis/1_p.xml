<p id="Par55">Blood gas analysis reveals hypoxemia of different degrees and commonly no carbon dioxide retention. Generally under 3â€“5 L/min oxygen uptake, patients with severe hypoxemia are measured of arterial partial pressure from oxygen (PaO
 <sub>2</sub>) &lt;70 mmHg or blood oxygen saturation (SpO
 <sub>2</sub>) &lt;93 %, or develop acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
