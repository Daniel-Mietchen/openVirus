<p id="Par69">Lungs present different degrees of patchy and plaque-shaped infiltration shadows or reticulate changes, which may progress rapidly into large patchy shadows. These commonly occur at multiple lobes or both sides, and absorption and dissipation of shadows are relatively slow. Pulmonary shadows and symptoms and signs may be inconsistent.
