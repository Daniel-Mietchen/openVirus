<p id="Par132">Numerous SARS patients develop osteonecrosis after recovery, which mostly appears as femoral head necrosis and also possibly necrosis of the ankle joint, knee joint, and shoulder joint. Scans of bilateral hips and knees of 82 SARS patients in rehabilitation phase disclosed that 51 patients (62 %) suffered from osseous abnormality, of which bone ischemia accounts for 17 % and implication of three sites for 20 %. Its pathogenesis still remains not completely ascertained, and it may be ascribed to improper use of hormones and injury of sclerotin from SARS viruses, bacterial embolism, lipid embolism, or multiple mixed factors. The primary pathological change of aseptic necrosis of femoral head is degenerative alteration due to femoral head blood circulation disturbance, mainly characterized by limping and pain. The lower limb of the affected side is relatively shorter and presents with light flexion and adduction, as well as with slightly limited abduction and intorsion.</p>
