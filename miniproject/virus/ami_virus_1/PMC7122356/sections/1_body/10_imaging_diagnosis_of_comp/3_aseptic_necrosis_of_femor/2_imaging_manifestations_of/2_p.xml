<p id="Par134">Normal femoral head is located at the acetabular center in the transverse CT image and may appear in the shape of sphere or hook on different layers, with delicate high-density bone cortex at the periphery. The high-density trabeculae inside femoral head are arranged in stelliform formation from the center continually to bone cortex, named as “stelliform sign.” CT manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head can be divided into early and advanced phase. In the early phase, the stelliform sign formed by the trabeculae of femoral head is deformed or absent, presenting spotted and patchy shadows of increased density inside femoral head and fasciculate changes or mutual fusion at its periphery. In the advanced phase, femoral head become ruptured and out of shape, and absorption of sclerotin between bone fragments appears as irregular low-density area, with stelliform sign disappeared.</p>
