<p id="Par136">Based on MRI presentations, aseptic necrosis of femoral head could be classified into four phases: phase I is characterized by homogenous or inhomogeneous low-signal areas adjacent to the joint above the femoral head on T1-weighted imaging; phase II is visualized with wedge-shaped low-signal bands; phase III presents with sequestrum crescent sign and cortex collapse; phase IV manifests joint degeneration and joint space narrowing besides presentations of phase III. In light of the aforementioned MR staging criteria, SARS cases complicated by aseptic necrosis of femoral head already reported are mostly in phase II.</p>
