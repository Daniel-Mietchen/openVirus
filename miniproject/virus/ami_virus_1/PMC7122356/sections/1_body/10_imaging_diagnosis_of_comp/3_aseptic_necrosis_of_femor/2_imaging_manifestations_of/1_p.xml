<p id="Par133">Initial X-ray examinations suggest that the involved femoral head has normal appearance but inhomogeneous density, with spotted osteoporosis. Gradually ensue the increase of density as a result of osteonecrosis, which meanwhile is interspersed with some transparent shadows. Femoral head may become flat, fragmented, and irregular in contour from pressures. Typical femoral head necrosis appears in the shape of wedge, with the base toward articular surface and the top toward metaphysis. Since lesions are dominantly confined at the anterosuperior area of femoral head, lateral imaging of hip joints could clearly reproduce the extent of lesions. The necrotic area is encircled by a ring of transparent band. Hip articular cavity may become wider and irregular due to flattening of the femur. Sometimes, there may be complication of dislocation. The fragments of femoral head may be shed off into the joint, giving rise to joint mouse.</p>
