<p id="Par135">MRI manifestations of aseptic necrosis of femoral head include: necrotic areas of femoral head of early cases have no repair reactions or mechanic collapse and still maintain normal lipid signals of medullary bones. However, low-signal margins incurred by sclerosis reactions could be seen at the periphery of foci. The T1 high signals of normal femoral head on T1-weighted image are detected with black linear low signals (representing demarcation between normal and ischemic bone tissues). On T2-weighted image, a high-signal line is visible at the medial low-signal sclerotic reaction line, thus forming the typical double-line sign. The double-line sign could reflect congestion and inflammation of granulation tissues and proves specific to aseptic necrosis of femoral head. Severe inflammation, congestion, fibrosis, and sclerosis could greatly deplete the amount of lipids of femoral head, which presents liquid-like signals on MRI, low signals on T1-weighted image, and high signals on T2-weighted images. Advanced cases are typical of fibrosis and sclerosis, and the affected area present with fibrotic MRI features, that is, low signals on T1- and T2-weighted and proton density-weighted imaging. Complication with effusions in hip joints appears as T1 low signals and T2 high signals.</p>
