<p id="Par129">SARS complication is an important factor affecting prognosis, which should be given enormous attentions. During SARS treatment, antiviral drugs are administered as well as glucocorticoids and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Some patients may still need airway positive pressure ventilation, tracheotomy, and tracheal intubation. Reasonable use of such measures is of great significance for improving the treatment rate and lowering mortality of SARS patients. However, to be noted, such treatment drugs and methods may incur adverse reactions and cause complications. SARS complications already detected encompass pulmonary secondary infection, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, bone aseptic necrosis, empyema, brain secondary infection, and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Such complications or sequela changes are also mainly identified by imaging examinations. Familiarity about SARS imaging manifestations and knowledge about complication imaging presentations could elevate SARS diagnostic level, therefore increasing cure rate and decreasing mortality.</p>
