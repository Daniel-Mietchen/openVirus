<p id="Par130">In the early phase, SARS manifests bronchiolar and peripheral interstitial pneumonia, which could further progress into alveolar consolidation, with interstitial lesions present persistently and mostly reversible. In the recovery phase, only some cases develop into pulmonary interstitial proliferation and then cause fibrotic changes. Pulmonary interstitial proliferation and fibrosis degree and outcome are associated with the extent of pulmonary involvement in peak phase, occurrence of complications, and treatment. Generally, if lesions on chest image are light in peak phase, there will be fewer pulmonary changes left in recovery phase. Contrarily, patients with diffusive lung interstitial thickening in recovery phase are often those suffering from relatively severe pulmonary injury in peak phase and involvement of the great mass of lungs, particularly patients with recurrent conditions, protracted course, and concurrent infections. Researches demonstrate that 7â€“8 % of SARS patients have pulmonary fibrosis of varying degrees and male patients display relatively more obvious pulmonary impairment than female patients. Primary manifestations are lung dysfunction, such as decrease of pulmonary diffusion capacity, lung capacity impairment, and change of total lung capacity particularly residual volume.</p>
