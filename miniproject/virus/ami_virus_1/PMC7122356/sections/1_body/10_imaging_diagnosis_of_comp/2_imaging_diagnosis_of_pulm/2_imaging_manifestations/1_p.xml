<p id="Par131">Generally obvious pulmonary interstitial proliferation occurs at about 30â€“50 days after onset, which presents firstly lobular septum and intralobular thickening and subpleural curvature shadows. Then there is the shrinkage of intrapulmonary patchy shadows with increase of density and gradual formation of high-density cord and honeycomb shadows inside lungs. Severe pulmonary interstitial proliferation could diminish lung volume and compel the mediastinum to affected side. Besides, pulmonary interstitial proliferation could occur extensively inside lungs, predominated by lobular septum, intralobular interstitial thickening, and subpleural curvature shadows, as well as irregular high-density plaque and cord-like shadows at some regions. Honeycomb-shaped shadows and tractional bronchiectasis are signs of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. CT reveals cord, reticulate, and honeycomb-shaped shadows, and HRCT could better visualize the subtle abnormal changes of pulmonary interstitium, such as lobular septum thickening, intralobular interstitial thickening, subpleural curvature shadows, and honeycomb-shaped shadows. Whether the cord-like and reticulate changes visualized by CT are completely absorbed or induce persistent fibrosis still entails long-term follow-up observation (Fig.
