<p id="Par126">Lesions in majority patients may progress and worsen within 14 days after onset. The small patchy shadows in early phase could expand into large patchy, multiple, or diffusive lesions within 3–7 days. Besides, lesions extend from unilateral lung to bilateral lungs, from one lung field to multiple lung fields. Most patients could develop the severest infiltration of lungs on day 8–14, namely, peak phase or “critical” phase. CT presentations are still predominated by ground-glass-density shadows, which may be complicated by pulmonary consolidation. Lesions are commonly multiple and in diffusive distribution at both lungs, and lesions of varying shapes may coexist, with quasi-circular foci relatively common. Some cases appear with ground-glass-density shadows all the time from onset to absorption of lesions.</p>
