<p id="Par127">When ground-glass-density shadows are complicated by pulmonary consolidation, the large patchy, small patchy, or quasi-circular ground-glass-density shadows could be observed with pulmonary consolidation shadows of relatively high density. Ground-glass density and pulmonary consolidation may also occur at different parts of the lung and could be visualized on the same layer or different layers of CT. For lesions typical of pulmonary consolidation, pulmonary consolidation appears as plaque-shaped high-density shadows or consolidation signs at lung lobes and segments. In addition, lesions are frequently recorded at lung lobe segment of the inferior lobe and outer band of lung field (Fig.
