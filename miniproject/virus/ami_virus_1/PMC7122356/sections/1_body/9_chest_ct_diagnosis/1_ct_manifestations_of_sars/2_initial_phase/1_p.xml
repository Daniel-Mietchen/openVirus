<p id="Par125">After SARS infection, chest abnormal changes frequently occur on day 1â€“7. In initial phase, focal shadows are frequently seen, which might be unilateral but dominantly bilateral. CT reveals small patchy ground-glass-density shadows, some of which are quasi-circular. Lesions present as solitary small patchy lung consolidation and multiple small patchy or relatively large patchy shadows. Large foci may appear as ground-glass-density shadows and concurrent lung consolidation shadows, with relatively higher-density vascular shadows observable in the former. Besides, some foci are found with increased vascular shadows at the periphery. In addition, lesions are unveiled frequently at the bilateral lung inferior fields and lung margins (Fig.
