<p id="Par128">Lesions usually begin to be absorbed 2â€“3 weeks after onset, with the shadow shrunk and density gradually reduced and absorbed. Although the clinical symptoms of some patients improve and disappear, light ground-glass-density shadows could still be seen in lungs on CT. It may prolong a relatively long time. During the absorption of intrapulmonary lesions, there is also concurrent pulmonary interstitial proliferation, which begins to be absorbed under dynamic observation. Some lesions may develop into pulmonary interstitial fibrosis, characterized by lobular septum, intralobular septum, interstitial thickening, and subpleural curvature imaging signs as well as regional irregular high-density plaque and cord-like presentations. Occurrence of intrapulmonary honeycomb manifestations and tractional bronchiectasis signifies pulmonary interstitial fibrosis (Fig.
