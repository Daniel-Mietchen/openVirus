<p id="Par94">For SARS patients, CT scan generally is not a preferred method and, if necessary, could be conducted under strict disinfected quarantine. If the foci could not be absorbed for a long term in SARS recovery phase or patients still have symptoms but normal chest presentations, CT scan need to be carried out for further observation as it can better visualize the subtle pulmonary interstitial changes, such as lung interlobular septum thickening, intralobular septum thickening, subpleural linear shadow, and small ground-glass-density lesion and regional and segmental bronchiectasis, and therefore is helpful for clinical diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Thin-layer CT scan or HRCT scan can better visualize intrapulmonary low-density small lesions, thus contributory to early diagnosis of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. CT examination could also aid identification of other concurrent lung lesions.</p>
