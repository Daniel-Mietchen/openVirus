<p>The SAS score for anxiety for the study participants was positively associated with the SASR score for stress (r=0.553, P&lt;0.01), and the PSQI score for sleep quality (r=0.523, P&lt;0.01). The SASR score for stress was positively associated with the PSQI score for sleep quality (r=0.628, P&lt;0.01). These findings showed that the social capital of the study participants who self-isolated during the COVID-19 epidemic improved sleep quality, which was reduced by anxiety and stress. Anxiety levels correlated with stress levels, which reduced sleep quality. The results are summarized in
