<p>Path analysis and mediation analysis using structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to investigate the relationships between the four variables in this study. The effect of PSCI-16 score for social capital on the PSQI score for sleep quality did not reach statistical significance, and this path was deleted from the model, as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-medscimonit-26-e923921">Figure 1</xref>. The indices for the degree of fit of the SEM were ideal, as shown by the goodness of fit index (GFI) of 0.995, the comparative fitness index (CFI) of 0.997, the Tucker Lewis index (TLI) of 0.981, the incremental fit index (IFI) of 0.997, the normed fit index (NFI) of 0.993, the adjusted goodness of fit index (AGFI) of 0.948, the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) of 0.068, and the chi-squared (χ
 <sup>2</sup>) to degree of freedom (df) ratio (χ
 <sup>2</sup>/df ) of 1.781.
