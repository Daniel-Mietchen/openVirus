<p>The indices for the degree of fit of the SEM were calculated. SPSS Amos version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to measure the mediation effects of the study variables, with a bootstrap number set as 5000 to test the significance of specific mediation effects, followed by the nonparametric percentile bootstrap method with standard deviation (SD) correction. The following path was identified: PSCI-16 score for social capital → the SAS score for anxiety → the PSQI score for sleep quality. The SAS score for anxiety had a significant mediating effect between the PSCI-16 score for social capital and the PSQI score for sleep quality (β=0.157, P=0.002) when the confidence interval did not include 0. In the path of the PSCI-16 score for social capital → the SASR score for stress → the PSQI score for sleep quality, the SAS score for anxiety had a significant mediating effect between the PSCI-16 score for social capital and the PSQI score for sleep quality (β=0.159, P&lt;0.0001), when 0 was not included in the confidence interval. The results are shown in
