<p>This study aimed to investigate the effects of social capital on sleep quality and the mechanisms involved in people who self-isolated at home for 14 days in January 2020, during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic in central China. In this study, path analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables (anxiety, stress, and sleep), using Pearsonâ€™s correlation analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM). During a period of individual self-isolation during the COVID-19 virus epidemic, increased social capital improved sleep quality by reducing anxiety and stress. These findings may have implications for public health provision during epidemics of infectious disease, including improvements in social capital.</p>
