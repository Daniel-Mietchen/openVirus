<p>Data were presented as the mean Â± standard deviation (SD). Path analysis, or multiple regression analysis, was performed to evaluate the relationships between a dependent variable (social capital) and two or more independent variables, using Pearson correlation analysis (r) and structural equation modeling (SEM). The indices for the degree of fit of the SEM were calculated. SPSS Amos version 21.0 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used to measure the mediation effects of the study variables, with a bootstrap number set as 5000 to test the significance of specific mediation effects, followed by the nonparametric percentile bootstrap method with SD correction. EpiData Entry version 3.1 and SAS version 9.4 were used for data entry and analysis, respectively. A P-value &lt;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p>
