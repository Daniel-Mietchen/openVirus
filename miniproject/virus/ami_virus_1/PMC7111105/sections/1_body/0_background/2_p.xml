<p>Infectious disease epidemics not only affect the physical health of patients but also affect the psychological health and wellbeing of the non-infected population. Previous studies have shown that the prevalence of novel infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), can increase anxiety, depression, and stress levels in the general population [

At the time of the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, some individuals with mild illness, suspected cases of infection, and people who had been in close contact with patients or a potentially high-risk environment were isolated at home. Even if the self-isolated individuals do not develop an infection and remain physically well, they often suffer from negative psychological effects. Importantly, the effects of mental health and sleep on immunity have been shown by previous studies [
