<p>The findings from the present study, and the findings from previous studies, provide support for improving physical and mental health from the perspective of social capital and may be applied to individuals who self-isolate during epidemics, such as the recent COVID-19 epidemic in central China. Individuals who self-isolate at home will suffer from physical stress due to lack of space for physical activity, stress due to limited social interactions, and anxiety associated with fear of the consequences of infection. Most individuals who self-isolate live alone or live with their families and may be more likely to feel lonely. Also, because they are isolated at home rather than in the hospital, they may feel more insecure than the patients who have been hospitalized, with increased uncertainty about their own risk of developing severe disease, or of not being diagnosed or treated in time. Therefore, the mental health of these individuals requires more attention. Social capital may require attention to reduce negative emotions and to cope with the risks from an infection epidemic with a more positive attitude.</p>
