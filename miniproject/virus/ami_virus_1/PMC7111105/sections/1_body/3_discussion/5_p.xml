<p>In the second path identified in this study, social capital affected stress, and then stress affected sleep. The stress response refers to the individual nonspecific response caused by various stressors [

Social support helps to reduce the perception and evaluation of the threat of stress events, the physiological response and inappropriate behavior caused by stress, and the level of fear and anxiety induced by stress [

 <xref rid="b35-medscimonit-26-e923921" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. When individuals experience stress, they often feel physical tension and mental pressure, they are more sensitive to the sleeping environment, or they focus on sleep too much, which will reduce their sleep quality [
 <xref rid="b36-medscimonit-26-e923921" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Also, some variables may interact with each other. For example, anxiety may increase stress, and stress may increase anxiety [
 <xref rid="b37-medscimonit-26-e923921" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Also, increased anxiety may lead to poor sleep, and poor sleep may increase anxiety [
 <xref rid="b38-medscimonit-26-e923921" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Therefore, all the variables included in the present study, social capital, stress, anxiety, and sleep require attention to prevent a negative cycle of psychological and physical harm.
