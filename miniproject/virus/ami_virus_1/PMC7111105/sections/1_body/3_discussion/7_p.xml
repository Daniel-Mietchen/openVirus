<p>This study investigated social capital, anxiety, stress, and sleep quality in a population who self-isolated for 14 days during the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020 and analyzed the relationships between the variables. Social capital affected sleep quality through the mediation effects on anxiety and stress, as people who had high levels of social capital had better sleep quality. However, this study had several limitations. The study sample size was small, and a cross-sectional study design was used, which may have prevented the identification of other associations between social capital and sleep. Also, social capital was measured using the PSCI-16 questionnaire, and the data relied on the ability of the individual to interpret the questions and provide accurate responses, but these responses were not verified objectively. Therefore, some causal relationships may have been missed. Further cohort studies with more samples should be performed, and non-subjective methods should be used. For example, sleep can be measured objectively by polysomnography, and stress levels can be detected using objective measurements of serum cortisol levels.</p>
