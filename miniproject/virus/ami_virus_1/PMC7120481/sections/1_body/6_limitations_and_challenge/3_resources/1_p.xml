<p id="Par73">Case-based hepatitis C surveillance is a resource-intensive process. Because of many low-resource settings and competing priorities to dedicate the majority of resources to surveillance for acute and effectively preventable conditions, hepatitis C surveillance is often not well developed. As a result, many health departments do not have the capacity to fully investigate every newly reported hepatitis C case. The inability to depend solely on serologic testing to identify acute hepatitis C cases combined with the inability to fully investigate all newly reported cases often leads to the inability to determine if hepatitis C cases are confirmed; these cases instead have a case status label of “probable,” “suspect,” or “unknown.” Unconfirmed cases may never be tested or investigated to determine if they are currently infected [
