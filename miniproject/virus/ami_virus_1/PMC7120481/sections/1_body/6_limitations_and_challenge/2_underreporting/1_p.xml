<p id="Par72">Even with the technological advances made in the areas of health information in the USA, the surveillance of hepatitis C continues to be hampered by underreporting, misclassification of cases, and need for more complete data since hepatitis C reporting to the national surveillance network is voluntary. In the USA, CDC estimates that for every reported case of acute hepatitis C, another 12 infections go unreported [

First, HCV infections can only be considered acute if symptoms are present or there is a documented seroconversion. However, 70â€“85 % of HCV-infected individuals are asymptomatic; about one-half are unaware of their infection [

In addition, many states lack the funding needed to conduct enhanced surveillance and do not have the capacity to develop a surveillance system capable of receiving and processing the large number of positive HCV antibody laboratory reports. The number of hepatitis C cases annually reported to health departments often outpaces the amount of resources on hand to fully conduct follow-up investigations to determine if the newly reported case is acute. For these reasons, identifying hepatitis C cases is challenging.
