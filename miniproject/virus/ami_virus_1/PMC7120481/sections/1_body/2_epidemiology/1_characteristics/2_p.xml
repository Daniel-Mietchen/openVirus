<p id="Par20">HCV infection may be difficult to measure because 70–85 % of HCV-infected persons are asymptomatic. When symptoms are present, they can include jaundice, fever, abdominal pain or discomfort, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, fatigue, joint pain, loss of appetite, and clay-colored stools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. For symptomatic HCV-infected individuals, the onset of symptoms usually occurs 6–7 weeks after exposure [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. For asymptomatic HCV-infected individuals, diagnosis usually occurs incidentally during blood donation screenings and other medical screenings. In the USA, federally supported surveillance captures only a fraction of all acute HCV infections because the identification of acute HCV infection requires the presence of symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the proportion of those with symptoms is relatively small (20–30 %) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, procedures have been developed that account for asymptomatic HCV infections in estimating the total number of reported acute cases (
