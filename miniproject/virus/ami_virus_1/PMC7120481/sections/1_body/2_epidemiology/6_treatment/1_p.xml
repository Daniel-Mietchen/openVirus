<p id="Par34">The goal of treatment for chronic HCV infection is to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR), or cure, currently defined as having an undetectable viral load 24 weeks after the end of treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Achieving SVR, in turn, is associated with long-term clearance of the virus and reduced long-term health complications such as cirrhosis, HCC, liver failure, and all-cause mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Novel therapies with direct-acting antivirals have demonstrated high virus eradication rates. Persons diagnosed as HCV positive should be medically evaluated and entered into routine care, as appropriate. The evaluation should include confirmation of chronic infection by viral testing including genotype and viral load, an assessment of liver function, stage of liver fibrosis, evidence of liver cancer, and eligibility for treatment [
