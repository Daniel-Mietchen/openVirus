<p id="Par36">Pegylated interferon and ribavirin is associated with many side effects, requires frequent injections, and has shown low success rates with hepatitis C genotype 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. In 2011, the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the use of two new protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, for the treatment of hepatitis C genotype 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]—the most common genotype reported in the USA. When used in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin, boceprevir and telaprevir demonstrated SVR rates of 63–66 % and 69–75 %, respectively [
