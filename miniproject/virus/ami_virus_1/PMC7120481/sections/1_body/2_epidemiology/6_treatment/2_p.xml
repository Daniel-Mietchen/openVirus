<p id="Par35">The traditional treatment is pegylated interferon with ribavirin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The duration of treatment is determined by the virologic response, which in turn is associated with the person’s genotype. With pegylated interferon and ribavirin therapy, a 24-week treatment course is recommended for genotypes 2 and 3 and a 48-week treatment course for other genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Persons with genotypes 2 and 3 who followed this regimen have ≥80 % SVR rate compared with a 40–50 % SVR rate for persons with genotype 1 [
