<p id="Par21">Although the overall estimated global prevalence of past/present HCV infection is high (3 %; 170 million persons) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], there is wide variability in prevalence between geographic regions [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Typically, developing countries, such as parts of Africa and Asia, have the highest reported prevalence of &gt;3.5 % (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">6.1</xref>). In Egypt, for example, 15 % of persons aged 15–59 years had evidence of past/present HCV infection [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">6.1</xref>). In the USA, for example, the estimated prevalence of HCV infection is approximately 1.0 %, or 2.7 million persons [
