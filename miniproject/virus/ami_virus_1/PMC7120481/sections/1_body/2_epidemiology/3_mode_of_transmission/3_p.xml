<p id="Par24">HCV also can be transmitted from HIV-coinfected mothers to their infants, and HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) have an increased likelihood of acquiring HCV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The risk of HCV transmission among HIV-infected MSM is also increased in the presence of genital ulcerative disease and sexual practices that lead to mucosal trauma [
