<p id="Par23">In healthcare settings where standard precautions and infection control measures are less strictly implemented, needle stick injuries and unsafe medical practices are common causes of HCV transmission. In developed countries like the USA, the risk of HCV transmission in healthcare settings has dramatically declined due to the implementation of safe injection and universal infection control practices [

Healthcare-associated hepatitis C outbreaks are indicators of failure to implement and strictly adhere to standard precautions and infection control measures. Since the development of the hepatitis C antibody screening test in 1990 and screening of the blood supply for hepatitis C in 1992, HCV transmission from blood transfusions has been greatly reduced in developed countries [
