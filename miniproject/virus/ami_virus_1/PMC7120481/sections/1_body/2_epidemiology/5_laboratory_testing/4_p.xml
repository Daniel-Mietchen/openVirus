<p id="Par31">Other tests available for hepatitis C detection and diagnosis include the HCV core antigen test [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and core antigen/antibody tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These tests are available only in some countries. While the HCV core antigen test is sensitive, will yield results early in the course of infection, and detects active infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>], the HCV core antigen/antibody test is positive in the presence of either one or both antigen and antibody [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] making it difficult to differentiate between active and resolved infection. Blood donations are screened by testing for HCV RNA and core antigen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>].
