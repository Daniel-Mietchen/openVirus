<p id="Par30">In contrast to HCV antibodies, HCV RNA can detect current infection and is detectable in serum as early as 1â€“2 weeks after exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There are a number of qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, these tests are expensive and not widely available. Further, because these tests detect HCV RNA, they are important for differentiating current infection from past, resolved infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, both in the clinical practice and in epidemiologic studies, it is important to follow up on every HCV antibody-positive result with an RNA assay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In conditions where the HCV antibody test is likely a false negative, RNA testing may provide the correct diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For these reasons, quantitative HCV RNA assays and genotype studies are important in the clinical management of chronic HCV infection.
