<p id="Par29">Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">6.2</xref> describes the interpretation of hepatitis C test results and corresponding further actions. The initial test is for HCV antibodies, which are detectable approximately 4â€“10 weeks after exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In symptomatic cases, this time period usually occurs at or before the onset of clinical symptoms. The HCV antibody test is positive in acute, chronic, and resolved infections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">6.2</xref>). Consequently, HCV antibody tests do not have the capacity to distinguish current infection from past, resolved infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition to standard serologic assays, there are also rapid tests to detect HCV antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The availability of standard and rapid assays varies significantly and is dependent on availability of resources [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Over the past decade, new generations of standard tests with high sensitivity and specificity have been developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the proportion of false-positive HCV antibody results is inversely related to the HCV prevalence in that setting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. False-negative HCV antibody results also occur, particularly in individuals with severe immunodeficiency [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], but rarely among the general population.
