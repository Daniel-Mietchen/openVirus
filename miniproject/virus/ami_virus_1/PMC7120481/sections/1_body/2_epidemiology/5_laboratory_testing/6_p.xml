<p id="Par33">In many sub-Saharan African countries, a high rate of false-positive HCV antibody test results have been reported, even when the latest generation of serologic assays are used [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. In the majority of HCV antibody-positive samples, the recombinant immunoblot assay (RIBA) yields either a negative or indeterminate result [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. RIBA is a more specific blood test for detecting HCV antibodies and is sometimes used as a confirmatory test to less specific antibody tests [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the USA, RIBA was phased out in 2013 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Even among RIBA-confirmed HCV antibody-positive samples, the large majority are HCV RNA negative. Such findings have been a challenge for clinical diagnosis, epidemiological studies, and screening of blood products for transfusion. While the cause of the high false positivity is still unknown [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>], it raises questions about the best strategy to test for HCV infection in some countries.
