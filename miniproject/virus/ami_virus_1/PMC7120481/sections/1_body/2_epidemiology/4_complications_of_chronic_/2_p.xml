 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In one study, patients with chronic HCV infection had a non-liver-related mortality risk nearly two times higher than uninfected patients [

Additionally, persons with detectable HCV RNA levels had significantly higher mortality than persons with undetectable RNA levels [
