<p id="Par51">CDC uses message mapping guides to standardize the data transmitted for all notifiable diseases monitored by health departments transmitted to the national surveillance network. States report basic demographic, clinical, and risk information on cases of notifiable conditions to the national surveillance network. The CDC Division of Viral Hepatitis retrieves data from servers once a week. These data are used to detect outbreaks, flag cases requiring immediate public health follow-up, and perform data quality checks. Viral hepatitis data are summarized in annual surveillance reports and are made available to the public on the CDC Division of Viral Hepatitis website [
