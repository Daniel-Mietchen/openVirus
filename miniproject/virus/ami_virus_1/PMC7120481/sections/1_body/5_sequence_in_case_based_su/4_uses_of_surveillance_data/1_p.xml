<p id="Par55">The uses of surveillance data vary depending on the public health agencyâ€™s need for the data. In general, at the national level, surveillance data are used to understand the burden of disease, inform local partners of disease clusters or outbreaks within and across jurisdictions, identify high-risk populations, and inform, prioritize, and evaluate prevention activities. At the local level, surveillance data are used to identify the most likely mode of transmission in the community to limit further transmission, detect and control local outbreaks, improve outreach services, and provide appropriate case management including screening and linking infected persons into care and counseling. Additionally, hepatitis C surveillance data can be matched with other disease registries, such as HIV, in order to integrate medical services for each individual and further understand disease burden. Surveillance data can also be used to evaluate the quality of care, including implementation of hepatitis A and B vaccine recommendations, among HCV-infected patients. Hepatitis A and B vaccine history can be obtained through follow-up investigation of cases and can be used to improve vaccine coverage rates.</p>
