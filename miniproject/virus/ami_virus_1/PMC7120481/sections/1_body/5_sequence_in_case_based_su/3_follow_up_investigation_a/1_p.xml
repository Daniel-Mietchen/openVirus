<p id="Par54">A hepatitis C case report is usually initiated with a positive antibody test, which can indicate either acute or chronic infection. After checking the surveillance database to determine whether the potential case was previously reported and had other epidemiologic or laboratory information, health departments can either attempt follow-up investigation or wait for future laboratory information to be received. Follow-up might require contacting the case patientâ€™s provider to determine whether symptoms of hepatitis were present. Together with information that the case was not previously reported suggests a newly reported acute hepatitis C case. Follow-up with the case patient and/or the healthcare provider is required to obtain additional epidemiologic data. Cases might be divided into groups of interest, such as persons aged &lt;30 years that may indicate IDU [

Prioritizing groups of interest reduces the number of cases to be investigated, which makes the task more achievable. Basic demographic, clinical, and risk information are collected using a standard case report form (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">6.2</xref>). This information is needed to confirm the classification, determine the most likely source of infection, and limit further transmission [
