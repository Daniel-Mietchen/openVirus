<p id="Par53">In 2012, the European Union decided not to require clinical signs/symptoms for a confirmed case. Instead, at least one laboratory finding (RNA, core antigen, or antibody) in a person aged &gt;18 months represents a confirmed case. The definition classifies an acute hepatitis C case as one that has a seroconversion within 12 months or has detected either RNA or core antigen but is antibody negative. A chronic case is defined as two samples positive for RNA or core antigen detected at least 12 months apart [

A confirmed case in Australia requires laboratory evidence of either an antibody or nucleic acid test (either genotype or RNA) in a person aged at least 24 months, and who does not meet the criteria for a newly acquired case; that is, there is no evidence that the infection was acquired in the 24 months before diagnosis [
