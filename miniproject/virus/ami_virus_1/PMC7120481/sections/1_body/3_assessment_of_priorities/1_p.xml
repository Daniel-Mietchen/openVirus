<p id="Par38">The success of a surveillance system for hepatitis C is dependent on the dedicated resources and established priorities for the surveillance system. For example, if the priority is to measure the overall burden of disease, the design of the system might be to conduct a seroprevalence survey. However, if the objective is to obtain data for case management and evaluation of local area prevention programs, then individual cases should be monitored and records updated over time [

For example, in an enhanced surveillance pilot study in select neighborhoods in England, there were concerns about increases in HCV infection among MSM. Health officials quickly recruited and collected information from certain drug treatment facilities and implemented a surveillance project that provided results that were applied and published in less than a year [

They approached needle exchange programs and drug treatment facilities in all health districts and found that HCV strains among injection drug users were very different compared to HCV-infected persons who did not acquire their infections from injecting drugs [
