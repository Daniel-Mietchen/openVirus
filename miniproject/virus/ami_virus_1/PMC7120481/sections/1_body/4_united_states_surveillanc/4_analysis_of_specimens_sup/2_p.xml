<p id="Par47">Currently, CDC uses data from a variety of sources to further understand the burden of chronic HCV infection; characterize persons who receive treatment; describe treatments, results of treatment, and sequelae of disease; and characterize those who die with and as a consequence of hepatitis C:

    <italic>Vital Statistics</italic>: The oldest form of surveillance in the USA is mortality registration. Registration of death, using a death certificate, is legally required in the USA. As a result, virtually all deaths are included in the registries. Cause of death listed on the death certificate is dependent on the presence/absence of a physician or family member who is knowledgeable about the health of the deceased, severity of disease, complexity of the disease, associated illnesses, and whether or not an autopsy or diagnostic laboratory testing was performed.

   <p id="Par49">Death certificates are completed by funeral directors based on information from attending physicians, medical examiners, coroners, and family members. Death certificates are filed in vital statistics offices within each state and the District of Columbia. States share information from death certificates with CDC through the National Vital Statistics System, which then produces public-use mortality files containing death information with cause of death coded in accordance with the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. These data are used to determine the national burden of mortality associated with specific diseases, including viral hepatitis. A recent analyses of these mortality data from 1999 through 2007 indicated that the hepatitis C mortality rate exceeded the HIV mortality rate in 2007 [

    <italic>Surveys</italic>: Health surveys are used for a variety of reasons, including augmenting our understanding of viral hepatitis from surveillance. Currently, the CDC uses several national surveys, which may include seroprevalence data, to describe and understand hepatitis C-related prevalence, hospitalizations, treatments, and development of CLD. For example, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) has provided valuable seroprevalence data on hepatitis A [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], hepatitis B [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>], and hepatitis C [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] that are representative of the US noninstitutionalized civilian population [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey use a national sample of visits from nonfederal employed office-based physicians who provide direct patient care and from emergency departments and outpatient department of noninstitutional general and short-stay hospitals, respectively, to obtain information about the use and provision of ambulatory medical care services, including viral hepatitis-related visits [
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>], in these settings. The National Hospital Discharge Survey was a nationally representative survey conducted from 1965-2010 that provided information from patients of non-federal, short-stay hospitals in the USA about the characteristics of these patients, conditions for which they were treated, cost of treatment, and a number of other public health topics of interest. The National Hospital Care Survey is a new survey which links the inpatient data that was collected by the National Hospital Discharge Survey with the emergency department, outpatient department, and ambulatory surgery center data collected by the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. Together, these population-based surveys provide a wealth of readily available data that are already in electronic format. As a result, they can be relatively inexpensive sources of useful information in addition to that obtained from surveillance.
