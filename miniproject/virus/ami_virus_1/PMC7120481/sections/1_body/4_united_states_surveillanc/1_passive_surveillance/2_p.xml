<p id="Par40">In the USA, as of 2013, acute hepatitis C is reportable in all states and the District of Columbia, and past/present hepatitis C is reportable in 43 states and the District of Columbia. Due to resource constraints, it is oftentimes difficult for health departments to obtain the necessary confirmatory laboratory tests from laboratories or healthcare providers to distinguish current from resolved or past HCV infection. Therefore, these cases are labeled as “past/present hepatitis C.” Under the current national surveillance system, acute and past/present hepatitis C are passively and voluntarily reported on a weekly basis by health departments to a national surveillance network at CDC. The system relies on laboratories and healthcare providers to submit case reports to health departments, as mandated by states. Health departments process case reports to determine that they represent new, unique cases and store data with personal identifiers.</p>
