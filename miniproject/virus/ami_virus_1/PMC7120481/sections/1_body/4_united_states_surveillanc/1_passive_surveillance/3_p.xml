<p id="Par41">Most laboratory reports and some physician reports are submitted electronically to health departments. However, reporting can be accomplished by fax or telephone, even using toll-free numbers or automated recording devices available at all hours. Time and lack of resources greatly limit such a system to a small percentage of most reportable diseases, but as long as the reporting system and requirements remain unchanged, the changes in incidence may reflect meaningful patterns of disease.</p>
