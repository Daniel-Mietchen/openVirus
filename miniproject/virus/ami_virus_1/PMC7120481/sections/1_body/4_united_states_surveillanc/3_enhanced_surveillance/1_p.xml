<p id="Par45">CDC provides additional funding to support enhanced surveillance programs. These programs conduct follow-up investigation on cases to obtain additional information, including information about risk behaviors and/or exposures. As a result, data are more complete than passive surveillance. These additional data allow the surveillance infrastructure to answer discrete surveillance and research questions. From 1982 through 2006, the Sentinel Counties Study of Acute Viral Hepatitis enrolled all acute viral hepatitis patients in six county/city health departments in the USA [

From 2005 through 2011, CDC funded seven sites to conduct enhanced viral hepatitis surveillance throughout major US cities and states. Because of additional resources, completeness of reporting significantly improved in the enhanced surveillance sites [
