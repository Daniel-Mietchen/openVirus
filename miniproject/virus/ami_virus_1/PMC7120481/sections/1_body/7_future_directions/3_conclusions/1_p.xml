<p id="Par90">Hepatitis C surveillance can yield useful information for understanding burden of disease, preventing outbreaks, identifying high-risk populations, and planning and evaluating prevention activities. However, careful consideration of objectives should be balanced with available resources. The current US hepatitis C surveillance system forms the backbone of surveillance and provides incidence data. Enhanced surveillance activities provide additional risk and exposure information on cases. To describe the complete spectrum of HCV disease, HCV-related information from additional sources of data, including population-based surveys, is used. As healthcare services evolve in their application of informatics, surveillance of HCV infection can take advantage of the events generated from HCV-related medical encounters in electronic medical records. Testing data from laboratories could be used to monitor the implementation of screening recommendations, and results from nucleic acid tests could be useful to distinguish between current present and resolved or past HCV infection.</p>
