<p id="Par83">Although ELR shows promising hope for timely and accurate laboratory reporting, there are challenges. First, these systems report only data listed on laboratory reports and do not contain the clinical information required to confirm a hepatitis C case. Secondly, these systems do not report any enhanced epidemiologic data including risk behaviors/exposures, hepatitis A and B vaccination history, and pregnancy status. These additional components are obtained through enhanced follow-up investigation with the provider and patient. Because of the overwhelming burden of past/present hepatitis C laboratory reports that are submitted to health departments, follow-up investigations are often an enormous endeavor, and for highly populated areas such as New York State, only a sample of total past/present hepatitis C reports can be followed. Additionally, complex ELR algorithms that are either inept or inefficient often lead to incorrect detection of new viral hepatitis cases [
