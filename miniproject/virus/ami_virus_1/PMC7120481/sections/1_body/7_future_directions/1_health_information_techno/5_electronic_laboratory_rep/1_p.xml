<p id="Par81">In the USA, electronic laboratory reporting is conducted by the automated transmittal of laboratory test results of notifiable diseases from commercial, public health, and hospital laboratories to health departments through a laboratory information management system. The goal of ELR for reporting of hepatitis C is to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness by reducing the number of laboratory reports that are manually entered by health departments. When using ELR, laboratories export data from their information systems in a standard file format and electronically transmit it to their health departments through the laboratory information management system.</p>
