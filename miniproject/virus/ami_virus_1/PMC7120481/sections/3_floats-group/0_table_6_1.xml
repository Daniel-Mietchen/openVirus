   <tr>
    <td>Persons at risk</td>
    <td>Persons who have percutaneous exposure to HCV-infected blood, e.g., persons who share needles and persons who seek healthcare services in settings where standard precautions and infection control measures are not strictly implemented</td>

    <td>Treatment</td>
    <td>High rate of sustained virologic response among those treated with ribavirin and/or peginterferon</td>
    <td>There are multiple national and regional guidelines for treatment of hepatitis C. The following drugs are currently approved for treatment of hepatitis C: peginterferon and ribavirin, boceprevir, telaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir. Treatment depends on stage of disease and genotype</td>
