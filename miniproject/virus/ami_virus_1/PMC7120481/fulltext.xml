Globally, an estimated 170 million persons (3 % of the world&#x02019;s population) have been infected with the hepatitis C virus, and an estimated 350,000 persons die annually from complications of chronic hepatitis C. Furthermore, an increasing trend in hepatitis C mortality in the USA was observed over the last decade; in 2007, mortality associated with hepatitis C surpassed mortality associated with HIV. As the hepatitis C epidemic continues, it is increasingly important to accurately measure hepatitis C-related morbidity and mortality in order to inform public health programs and policies and prioritize and evaluate prevention efforts. This chapter provides an overview of hepatitis C surveillance and methods used in the USA with some examples from other countries.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Hepatitis C virus infection</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C surveillance</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C reporting</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C mortality</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C laboratory testing</kwd><kwd>Hepatitis C laboratory reporting</kwd><kwd>Health information technology</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="FPar1"><title>Core Message</title><p id="Par16">This chapter provides an overview of hepatitis C surveillance methods.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1"><title>Importance and Aims of Hepatitis C Surveillance</title><p id="Par17">Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a common type of chronic blood-borne infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].

In countries that conduct hepatitis C surveillance, hepatitis C may be required to be reported by laboratories and healthcare providers to health departments.</p><p id="Par18">Hepatitis C surveillance includes acute and chronic hepatitis C cases; however, some countries or local areas may not have the necessary confirmatory laboratory tests to distinguish current (or present) from resolved (or past) HCV infection. Additionally, because the chronic hepatitis C burden is large and conducting follow-up investigation can be labor intensive, some countries and local areas might lack the capacity to investigate and confirm cases. Despite the challenges of conducting hepatitis C surveillance, there is hope for hepatitis C eradication because primary prevention is effective, and secondary transmission and complications are preventable through case management, new effective treatments, and alcohol counseling. Surveillance data are essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health programs and policies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Epidemiology</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Characteristics</title><p id="Par19">Hepatitis C traces back to the mid-1970s, though at the time, the virus was broadly termed &#x0201c;non-A, non-B hepatitis&#x0201d; when serologic tests ruled out hepatitis A or B as the cause of acute hepatitis following a blood transfusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].

For asymptomatic HCV-infected individuals, diagnosis usually occurs incidentally during blood donation screenings and other medical screenings.

Typically, developing countries, such as parts of Africa and Asia, have the highest reported prevalence of &#x0003e;3.5 % (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">6.1</xref>). In Egypt, for example, 15 % of persons aged 15&#x02013;59 years had evidence of past/present HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In comparison, more developed countries, such as those in North America, northern and western Europe, and Australia, have a low to moderate reported prevalence (&#x0003c;3.5 %) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">6.1</xref>). In the USA, for example, the estimated prevalence of HCV infection is approximately 1.0 %, or 2.7 million persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]&#x02014;disproportionately affecting persons who are middle aged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].

</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Mode of Transmission</title><p id="Par22">HCV is primarily transmitted through percutaneous exposure to infected blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One of the most common ways by which HCV is transmitted is injection drug use (IDU) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In the USA, among persons with acute hepatitis C who responded to questions about IDU, approximately 60 % reported injection of street drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. From 2007 to 2011, US surveillance data detected a 44 % increase in the hepatitis C incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], which may be due to a rise in injection drug users among young persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">In healthcare settings where standard precautions and infection control measures are less strictly implemented, needle stick injuries and unsafe medical practices are common causes of HCV transmission. In developed countries like the USA, the risk of HCV transmission in healthcare settings has dramatically declined due to the implementation of safe injection and universal infection control practices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Despite the decline, from 2008 to 2012, 16 healthcare-associated hepatitis C outbreaks that resulted in 160 cases of HCV infection were reported to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Healthcare-associated hepatitis C outbreaks are indicators of failure to implement and strictly adhere to standard precautions and infection control measures. Since the development of the hepatitis C antibody screening test in 1990 and screening of the blood supply for hepatitis C in 1992, HCV transmission from blood transfusions has been greatly reduced in developed countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In developing countries, this mode of transmission remains significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par24">HCV also can be transmitted from HIV-coinfected mothers to their infants, and HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) have an increased likelihood of acquiring HCV infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The risk of HCV transmission among HIV-infected MSM is also increased in the presence of genital ulcerative disease and sexual practices that lead to mucosal trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Heterosexual contact among monogamous partners is an unlikely route of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">Other demographic groups also are disproportionately affected by hepatitis C, evident by a higher prevalence among those groups. For example, in the USA, the overall hepatitis C antibody prevalence is estimated to be 1.6 %; however, it is 3 % among persons born during 1945&#x02013;1965 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; 5 % among military veterans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]; 6 % among blacks aged 30&#x02013;49 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]; 14 % among HIV-infected persons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]; and 23&#x02013;39 % among the incarcerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Additionally, some hepatitis C epidemics are fueled by contaminated injection equipment used in mass treatment campaigns, such as schistosomiasis treatment in Egypt during 1960&#x02013;1980; HCV transmission is still ongoing today [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Complications of Chronic Infection</title><p id="Par26">The burden of hepatitis C, mostly among persons who are undiagnosed and not in care, is evidenced by increasing complications. One such complication is the development and progression of chronic liver disease (CLD). In addition, alcohol use is independently associated with liver disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Based on representative samples of published reports from at least 1990 and 11 World Health Organization regions, hepatitis C was identified as one of the most common etiologies of CLD throughout most of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] and was associated with 27 % of liver cirrhosis and 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. From the same study, death due to HCV infection was identified in approximately 211,000 persons with liver cirrhosis and 155,000 persons with liver cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Among US adult residents in two sentinel surveillance sites and one healthcare network site, 64 % of newly diagnosed CLD had underlying hepatitis C during 1999&#x02013;2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. In the USA, over 15,000 hepatitis C-related deaths occurred in 2007, of which 57 % had CLD, including HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Although hepatitis C is widely known to increase the risk of dying from liver-related diseases, recent studies have found that HCV infection also increased the risk of dying from non-liver-related diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In one study, patients with chronic HCV infection had a non-liver-related mortality risk nearly two times higher than uninfected patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Similarly, in another study, persons who were HCV antibody positive had significantly higher mortality than persons who were HCV antibody negative. Additionally, persons with detectable HCV RNA levels had significantly higher mortality than persons with undetectable RNA levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Laboratory Testing</title><p id="Par28">The traditional approach for detecting HCV infection is to screen persons for a history of risk factors and to test those with any identifiable risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. While IDU is the most common mode of transmission in developed countries, additional risk factors, including exposure to unsafe blood products and injection practices, are highly prevalent and contribute to significant HCV transmission in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. There are many international recommendations for hepatitis C testing and all have consistency in their recommendation for testing of persons who inject illicit drugs, prior recipients of transfusions or organ transplants, persons with persistently elevated liver enzymes, children born to HCV-infected mothers, and persons exposed to HCV-positive blood in healthcare [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">6.2</xref> describes the interpretation of hepatitis C test results and corresponding further actions. The initial test is for HCV antibodies, which are detectable approximately 4&#x02013;10 weeks after exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. In symptomatic cases, this time period usually occurs at or before the onset of clinical symptoms. The HCV antibody test is positive in acute, chronic, and resolved infections (Table <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">6.2</xref>). Consequently, HCV antibody tests do not have the capacity to distinguish current infection from past, resolved infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In addition to standard serologic assays, there are also rapid tests to detect HCV antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The availability of standard and rapid assays varies significantly and is dependent on availability of resources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Over the past decade, new generations of standard tests with high sensitivity and specificity have been developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. However, the proportion of false-positive HCV antibody results is inversely related to the HCV prevalence in that setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. False-negative HCV antibody results also occur, particularly in individuals with severe immunodeficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], but rarely among the general population.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table 6.2</label><caption><p>Interpretation of results of tests for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and further actions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Test outcome</th><th>Interpretation</th><th>Further actions</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HCV antibody nonreactive</td><td>No HCV antibody detected</td><td>Sample can be reported as nonreactive for HCV antibody.

</p><p id="Par30">In contrast to HCV antibodies, HCV RNA can detect current infection and is detectable in serum as early as 1&#x02013;2 weeks after exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. There are a number of qualitative and quantitative HCV RNA assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. However, these tests are expensive and not widely available. Further, because these tests detect HCV RNA, they are important for differentiating current infection from past, resolved infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Therefore, both in the clinical practice and in epidemiologic studies, it is important to follow up on every HCV antibody-positive result with an RNA assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In conditions where the HCV antibody test is likely a false negative, RNA testing may provide the correct diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For these reasons, quantitative HCV RNA assays and genotype studies are important in the clinical management of chronic HCV infection.</p><p id="Par31">Other tests available for hepatitis C detection and diagnosis include the HCV core antigen test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] and core antigen/antibody tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>].

The goal of ELR for reporting of hepatitis C is to improve the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness by reducing the number of laboratory reports that are manually entered by health departments. When using ELR, laboratories export data from their information systems in a standard file format and electronically transmit it to their health departments through the laboratory information management system.</p><p id="Par82">Prior to the advances in ELR technology in the USA, manual data entry of paper laboratory reports was the standard procedure for collecting data on viral hepatitis infections. However, manual data entry of paper laboratory reports is both labor intensive and costly. ELR has been shown to identify almost three times as many hepatitis C cases as the traditional paper-based method, and, on average, identified those cases nearly 5.5 days earlier than the conventional method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>].</p><p id="Par83">Although ELR shows promising hope for timely and accurate laboratory reporting, there are challenges. First, these systems report only data listed on laboratory reports and do not contain the clinical information required to confirm a hepatitis C case. Secondly, these systems do not report any enhanced epidemiologic data including risk behaviors/exposures, hepatitis A and B vaccination history, and pregnancy status. These additional components are obtained through enhanced follow-up investigation with the provider and patient. Because of the overwhelming burden of past/present hepatitis C laboratory reports that are submitted to health departments, follow-up investigations are often an enormous endeavor, and for highly populated areas such as New York State, only a sample of total past/present hepatitis C reports can be followed. Additionally, complex ELR algorithms that are either inept or inefficient often lead to incorrect detection of new viral hepatitis cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Lessons Learned from Enhanced Surveillance in the USA</title><p id="Par84">From 2005 through 2011, the CDC funded seven health departments to conduct enhanced hepatitis C surveillance throughout the USA. Experiences from this collaboration suggest that certain elements are critical to the success of conducting complete, useful surveillance:<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item><p id="Par85">
<italic>Electronic infrastructure to receive and process hepatitis C laboratory reports</italic>. Most clinical laboratories have the capacity to report tests associated with all notifiable diseases in an electronic format to the health departments. However, because laboratories lack a standardized system and health departments vary in their capacity to receive and process electronic information, the large number of hepatitis C reports easily overwhelmed their systems. The lesson learned was that health departments needed to invest in electronic data systems that allowed significant numbers of test results to be received, de-duplicated to result in patient-level information, and then processed to determine electronically whether the patient had been reported previously or was a new case [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par86">
<italic>Funding for staff at health departments to conduct follow</italic>-<italic>up investigation</italic>. Because of limited human resources, it became clear that attempting to follow-up on all de-duplicated cases was not feasible. The solution to this problem was to conduct follow-up investigation on a random sample of cases. In most sites, sampling was conducted prospectively on recently reported cases, allowing a 3-month waiting period to ensure that providers had notified patients of their test results. The goal in most sites was to sample &#x02265;10 % of reported cases and to obtain supplemental information from the healthcare provider associated with the positive test result.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par87">
<italic>Flexibility of data collection instruments and data entry and storage systems</italic>. Previously, information on mode of transmission was considered desirable, but more helpful to prevention was the identification of which individuals were linked to care. Several health departments had the flexibility to pilot new information items including whether the individual had seen a healthcare provider for hepatitis-related care, and whether they had ever been treated for hepatitis C.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par88">
<italic>Secure and standardized transmission of data to a central office</italic>. Difficulties with the larger electronic system for notifiable diseases resulted in the use of an independent, secure transfer protocol mechanism to receive electronic data from sites.</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par89">
<italic>Capacity to conduct analyses at the central office</italic>. The application of standardized case definitions was complicated at the local level by subjective interpretations and applications of the definition. Data collected on all positive HCV antibody tests allows surveillance programs to understand the population testing positive, and not only those who have the additional confirmatory testing requirements to meet the case definition (e.g., RIBA, RNA). Therefore, a best practice is to receive all data elements and observations health departments are able to collect and send them to a central office. Then, standardized selection criteria can be applied prior to data analyses. For example, the current US hepatitis C case definition requires a confirmatory antibody test; however, understanding the frequency with which persons test positive and are then not reported to have a follow-up test is useful for prevention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>].</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec33"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par90">Hepatitis C surveillance can yield useful information for understanding burden of disease, preventing outbreaks, identifying high-risk populations, and planning and evaluating prevention activities. However, careful consideration of objectives should be balanced with available resources. The current US hepatitis C surveillance system forms the backbone of surveillance and provides incidence data. Enhanced surveillance activities provide additional risk and exposure information on cases. To describe the complete spectrum of HCV disease, HCV-related information from additional sources of data, including population-based surveys, is used. As healthcare services evolve in their application of informatics, surveillance of HCV infection can take advantage of the events generated from HCV-related medical encounters in electronic medical records. Testing data from laboratories could be used to monitor the implementation of screening recommendations, and results from nucleic acid tests could be useful to distinguish between current present and resolved or past HCV infection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Armstrong</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Wasley</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Simard</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>McQuillan</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuhnert</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Alter</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in the United States, 1999 through 2002</article-title><source>Ann Intern Med</source><year>2006</year><volume>144</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>705</fpage><lpage>14</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7326/0003-4819-144-10-200605160-00004</pub-id><?supplied-pmid 16702586?><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16702586</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="CR2"><label>2.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>WHO</collab></person-group><article-title>Global surveillance and control of hepatitis C.
