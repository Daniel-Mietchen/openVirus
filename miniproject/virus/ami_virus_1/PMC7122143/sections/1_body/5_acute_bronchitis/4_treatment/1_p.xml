<p id="Par25"> Antibiotic treatment of acute uncomplicated bronchitis is not recommended [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Systematic reviews of the available evidence have demonstrated that, though there may be a modest reduction in duration of cough-related symptoms, this is unlikely to be clinically significant [
