<p id="Par12">The approach to treatment for the common cold focuses on symptomatic relief as well as prevention. Antibiotics are ineffective and inappropriate treatment for the common cold and should be avoided in adults and children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Over the counter cough and cold medications should be avoided in all children younger than 4 years due to the potential for harm and lack of benefit. Products shown to improve cold symptoms in children include vapor rub, zinc sulfate, extract, and buckwheat honey, although the quality of the evidence varies. Ineffective treatments for children include both inhaled and oral corticosteroids and

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. When taken within 24 h of symptom onset, zinc has been shown to reduce the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. plant preparations have not proven effective in treating common colds among adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In supplementation trials, regular use of vitamin C did not decrease the incidence of common colds, but did have a positive effect on symptom duration and severity. Therapeutic trials of vitamin C during a cold have not shown a significant effect on common cold symptom reduction, but it may be worth considering in individual cases given its favorable safety profile and low cost [
