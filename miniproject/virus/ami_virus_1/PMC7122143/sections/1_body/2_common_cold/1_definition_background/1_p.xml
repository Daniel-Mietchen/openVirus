<p id="Par8"> The common cold, an acute infection of the upper respiratory tract that is usually self-limited, is the most frequent human infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. There are over 
 <italic>one billion</italic> colds every year in the United States, and it is estimated that the common cold results in 20 million days of absence from work and 22 million days of absence from school each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Typical common cold symptoms consist of nasal congestion and discharge, sore throat, cough, sneezing, and sometimes headache, with symptoms usually lasting less than 10 days in duration. These symptoms are fairly nonspecific and can easily be confused with allergies or early symptoms of more serious diseases. However, taking a detailed history, particularly identifying sick contacts, is usually helpful in distinguishing the common cold from other illnesses.
