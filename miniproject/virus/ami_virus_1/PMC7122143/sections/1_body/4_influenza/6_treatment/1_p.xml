<p id="Par21">Four pharmacologic agents are available to treat influenza in the United States: the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and oseltamivir, and the adamantanes amantadine and rimantadine. Amantadine and rimantadine are only effective against influenza A, and due to high rates of resistance (&gt;99 % for influenza A H3N2 or H1N1) their use is not currently recommended [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Treatment with one of these agents is recommended as soon as possible for patients with known or suspected influenza who are hospitalized, manifest severe, complicated, or progressive illness, or are at high risk for complications, including adults &gt;64 years of age, children &lt;2 years of age, persons with severe underlying chronic illness or immunosuppression, or several other high risk groups (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. One recent meta-analysis demonstrated small, non-specific effects on reducing the total duration of influenza symptoms without a demonstrated reduction in complications for otherwise healthy adults with influenza treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The use of a neuraminidase inhibitor for treatment of proven or suspected influenza in an otherwise healthy adult without risk factors for severe disease should be determined by clinical judgment and shared decision making.
