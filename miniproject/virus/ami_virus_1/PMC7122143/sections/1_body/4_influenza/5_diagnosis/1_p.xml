<p id="Par20">If influenza is suspected clinically and the patient would benefit from antiviral treatment (see below), a presumptive clinical diagnosis of influenza should be sought. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive and specific method of influenza diagnosis according to the Infectious Disease Society of America, however the test is slow and can often take several days for a definitive result. Rapid influenza diagnostic tests (RIDTs) are antigen tests with results often available quickly enough to be clinically relevant. However, the results have poor sensitivity: in a meta-analysis of 159 studies of RIDT’s compared to RT-PCR or viral culture, the RIDT’s demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 62.3 % (95 % CI 57.9–66.6 %) and a pooled specificity of 98.2 % (95 % CI 97.5–98.7 %) [
