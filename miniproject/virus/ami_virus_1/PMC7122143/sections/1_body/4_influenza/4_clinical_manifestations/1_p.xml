<p id="Par19">Infection of the respiratory tract by influenza virus classically results in acute onset of systemic and respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, headache, myalgias, or malaise [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, infection by influenza virus can be asymptomatic or cause other syndromes such as the common cold, pharyngitis, or pneumonia. Other viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, or coronavirus can also cause an influenza-like illness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The majority of those who get influenza will recover within 3â€“7 days, but cough and fatigue may persist beyond 2 weeks. Some develop complications such as pneumonia (either viral or a secondary bacterial infection), which can be life threatening, particularly for those at high risk. Influenza infection can also exacerbate other underlying chronic diseases such as asthma, COPD, and congestive heart failure.
