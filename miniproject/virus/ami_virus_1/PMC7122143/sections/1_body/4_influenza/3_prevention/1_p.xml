<p id="Par17"> Vaccination is the preferred public health method for prevention of influenza. Both inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) are available each season and are created from the circulating influenza A and B virus isolates that are anticipated to circulate in the following season according to recommendations of the World Health Organization [

The LAIV is recommended over the IIV for children ages 2–8 when immediately available if the child has no contraindications to the live attenuated vaccine. When vaccine supply is limited, preference should be given to those at higher risk, including children age 6–59 months, adults &gt;50 years of age, those with immunosuppression or other severe chronic disease including morbid obesity, women who are or will become pregnant during the influenza season, residents of long-term care facilities, and Native Americans/Native Alaskans [
