<p id="Par4"> Respiratory infections caused by viruses are transmitted primarily by droplets. These viruses can attach to the upper or lower respiratory tract and induce an IgA-mediated immune response in the mucous secretions of the respiratory tract and an IgG-mediated response in serum. Respiratory viral infections generally induce adaptive immune responses that should be protective. However, repeated respiratory infections are due to the large numbers of serotypes of each virus, or antigenic variations in viruses such as the influenza virus, and their ability to induce similar, non-specific clinical signs.</p>
