<p id="Par31">Antibiotic resistance in the healthcare setting is a growing threat to public health, and, as of 2013, two million people become infected and 23,000 people die each year from antibiotic-resistant infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. In part, antibiotic-resistant infections stem from the prescribing of antibiotics when they are not needed, as in the case of viral respiratory tract infections. To avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics for viral infections, physicians should strive to adhere to clinical guidelines and decision-support tools combined with laboratory testing when indicated to determine risk for a bacterial infection.
