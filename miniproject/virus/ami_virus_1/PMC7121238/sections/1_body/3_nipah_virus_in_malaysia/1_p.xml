<p>It did not take long until the next spillover of a virus from bats to humans was observed. As in the case of the Hendra virus outbreak it needed an intermediate host for the cross-species transmission. This time it was not horses, but pigs which transmitted the virus. All began in September 1998 with a respiratory illness in pigs from farms in Malaysia. However, except for a loud cough, the disease symptoms were not very distinctive. Only a minority of pigs was noted to be ill and the death rate in pigs was only increased minimally by 5% (Chua et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>). By February 1999, similar cases in pigs were also seen in other states of Malaysia as a result of transport of infected pigs into the new outbreak areas (Lam 2002). By mid-June 1999 it became clear that Malaysia was struck by an epidemic: more than 265 cases of encephalitis cases were reported in humans and 105 patients died. The first case reports described patients with fever and confusion who developed a characteristic segmental myoclonus leading to a deepening coma and death from hypotension and bradycardia. The histopathology showed vasculitic blood vessels with thrombosis in the brain. Giant syncytia observed in the kidney and the cerebrospinal fluid cells guided the suspicion towards paramyxoviruses. Infected cells showed indeed a strong positive reaction with antibodies to Hendra virus. The first nucleotide sequences from this virus suggested a paramyxovirus related to, but distinct from Hendra virus (Chua et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1999</xref>). When a larger number of patients from Malaysia were investigated, a clearer clinical pattern emerged. Presenting clinical features were not very distinctive: fever, headache and dizziness. The patients were young (mean of 37 years) and male (4.5:1 female), mostly ethnic Chinese and quite conspicuously 93 % were pig farmers or had occupations which brought them into direct contact with pigs. Furthermore 41 % of the patients reported that they had contact to pigs that died from an unusual respiratory tract infection (Goh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). These observations dispelled the initial hypothesis of an infection with the Japanese encephalitis virus. JE virus is endemic in Malaysia, but as a mosquito-borne infection it has no association with particular occupations and is most common among children (Lam 2002). Furthermore most of the new encephalitis patients had been vaccinated against the Japanese encephalitis virus, some of them even quite recently making this hypothesis untenable. Furthermore, JE vaccination and mosquito control programs had no effect on the epidemic. Virus isolation was tried from 18 encephalitis patients of Malaysia, 5 yielded from the cerebrospinal fluid a virus resembling a paramyxovirus. Further viruses were isolated from tracheal and nasal secretions and the urine. The new virus was called Nipah virus from the name of an outbreak site. Seventy per cent of the patients showed serum antibodies against this new virus. Nipah virus infections have a short incubation period. The virus spreads systemically. The patients show some pulmonary involvement, but mainly a predilection for the central nervous system and prominent brain-stem dysfunction in comatose patients. The outbreak in Malaysia ceased when more than 1 million pigs from the outbreak areas were culled inflicting a major economical burden on the small family farms rearing pigs. The Nipah virus was characterized in some detail. It showed the typical pleomorphic membrane-enveloped paramyxoviruses with the “herringbone” nucleocpsid structure. The viral RNA was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and the N protein (the major nucleocapsid protein of the virus) showed that the Nipah virus forms with the Hendra virus a new genus within the paramyxovirus family tree. This genus was called Henipavirus and it was clearly distinct from the known Respirovirus, Morbillivirus and Rubulavirus genera in this virus family. The Nipah virus differed from the Hendra virus by 31 % at the nucleotide sequence level. In comparison, Hendra virus isolates taken 5 years apart differed by only 0.4 % (Chua et al.
