<p>Epidemiologists tried to understand why it came to the cross-species virus transmission (Plowright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). In view of the rare virus isolation rate the likely transmission mechanisms must remain conjectural, but the models are quite plausible. Flying foxes depend on nectar and fruit as food sources. In their native forests, the distribution of food trees is patchy which necessitates wide foraging flights over large habitats to assure a sufficient food supply. On the east coast of Australia nearly three quarters of the initial forest cover has been lost and flying foxes were obliged to seek alternative food sources. Urban gardens became a reliable replacement for the bats. The new food was quite convenient since it made long and energy-expensive foraging flights unnecessary. As a consequence bats became urbanized. Indeed, many major towns from eastern Australia have now daytime roost places for flying foxes. As a consequence of habitat fragmentation and behavioral changes, flying foxes came also in contact with horses held for sport purpose in urban settlements creating new opportunities for cross-species virus transmissions that did not exist in the past.
