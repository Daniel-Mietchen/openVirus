<p>In my PhD thesis at Max Planck, I looked for the potential involvement of a particular paramyxovirus in multiple sclerosis. From my work in Munich I kept a lively interest for neurological diseases caused by this group of viruses. Following the literature, I became witness of the great flexibility displayed by morbilliviruses (measles virus, rinderpest, canine distemper) with respect to suspected or proven cross-species infections between different mammalian species. Paramyxoviruses that are pathogenic in novel hosts were dolphin, porpoise, and phocine morbilliviruses. However, I had to wait until the mid-1990s to see the first cases where a morbillivirus from bats spilled over into the human population. In 1994 an outbreak of severe respiratory disease was observed in Brisbane (Queensland/ Australia). The animals developed high fever and died. A trainer of the horses became ill with a severe influenza-like disease and died subsequently from interstitial pneumonia. Organ homogenates from two horses yielded a virus that showed typical cytopathic effects in cell culture (syncytia) as well as paramyxovirus-specific nucleocapsids in the cytoplasm. The homogenate could also induce fever with respiratory distress in two healthy horses. The outstanding gross pathology was lung edema. At the histopathological level syncytial giant cells in blood vessel walls were observed (Murray et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">1995</xref>). Also material from the patient yielded a serologically identical virus to the horse virus isolate. Both horses and the trainer developed high-titered neutralizing antibodies in the serum to the virus isolates. Minimal cross-neutralization was seen with known paramyxoviruses and the sequencing of a viral gene confirmed this distant relationship defining a new paramyxovirus group which should get known under the name of Hendra virus from a suburb of Brisbane where the first cases were observed. The researchers investigated 1,600 horses for serological evidence of antibodies to Hendra virus; all were seronegative demonstrating that horses are a new host species that had not previously been exposed to this virus. A second smaller Hendra virus outbreak was observed at the same time point, but in Mackay 1,000 km apart in Queensland: only 2 horses were affected, but again a human contact died. The case report from this fatal encephalitis patient showed again the presence of this novel paramyxovirus in his brain, but the researchers failed to isolate this virus in cell culture. The long symptom-free period that followed the exposure to the equine morbillivirus before the fatal illness set in reminded the authors the behavior of defective measles viruses in SSPE patients (Oâ€™Sullivan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1997</xref>). Since then about a dozen of further outbreaks of Hendra virus infection was documented in Queensland (Marsh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>), the largest in 2008 with 5 horses which showed predominantly neurological rather than respiratory symptoms. The attack rate was 10% in contact persons from a veterinary office again with a human fatality. A veterinarian showed influenza-like symptoms followed by a progressive neurological disease (Playford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2010</xref>). A veterinary nurse showed also a neurological disease, but recovered. A 2-week incubation period was deduced. The horse-to-human transmission mode was probably from direct contact with respiratory secretions of the infected horses. Since early serosurveys had not provided evidence for Hendra virus infection in 2,100 horses from Queensland, a wildlife source was quickly suspected. A first serosurvey with 5,200 sera from 46 species gave no hit. A true detective story set in: the epidemiologists postulated that the viral source should be a species present both in Brisbane and Mackay, the species should be able to travel between both areas, and the species should have contacts with horses. Two species fulfilled this phantom image: migratory waders (a bird) and flying foxes (a fruit bat). Queensland has four species of bats belonging to the suborder Megachiroptera all belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic>. Within 224 serum samples from fruit bats, 20 showed neutralizing antibodies against the equine Hendra virus. Clearly, a virus closely related to Hendra virus was circulating in all four Queensland fruit bat species (Young et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1996</xref>). These authors extended their searches to virus isolations from fruit bats. They investigated 650 tissue samples from 460 individual fruit bats and obtained one isolate from the uterine fluid of a pregnant female grey-headed fruit bat (
 <italic>P. poliocephalus</italic>) and one from the lung of a fetal black fruit bat (
 <italic>P. alecto</italic>). A gene was amplified and revealed an identical nucleotide sequence with the Hendra virus (Halpin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2000</xref>). For an RNA virus this group of viruses showed a high degree of sequence conservation: All Hendra virus isolates from Queensland showed less than 1% nucleotide sequence diversity (Marsh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>).
