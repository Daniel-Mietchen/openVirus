<p>Hendra virus infections are not a curiosity: Menangle virus (Philbey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1998</xref>) and Tioman virus (Yaiw et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2007</xref>), both also novel paramyxoviruses, caused infections in pigs which acquired the virus from fruit bats and in both cases transmission of mild infection to human contacts were described. The ecological relevance of the link between viruses from fruit bats to pigs to humans was dramatically demonstrated in Malaysia.
