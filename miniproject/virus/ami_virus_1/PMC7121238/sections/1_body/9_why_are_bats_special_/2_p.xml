<p>With 925 recognized species bats represent about 20% of the species diversity of mammals. In addition, bats are an old branch of mammalian evolution, which can be traced back into the Tertiary Period 50 million years ago and the overall design of bats have essentially not changed over this time period testifying a successful evolutionary solution. This evolutionary success is also documented by other facts. Bats have colonized all continents with the exception of the Antartic. Except for humans, no other group of mammals has such a broad geographical range. Bats are also extremely numerous. Literally millions of individuals can be found in single caves and roost trees teem with bats. Like humans, bats are very social and this combination of sheer numbers with physical proximity creates enormous possibilities for viruses. Airborne rabies transmission is observed under these conditions. There are still further characteristics of bats that favour viral transmissions. Bats are the only mammal that learned to fly. Bats fly in their daily quest for food, but some bats also fly up to nearly 1,000 km between their summer caves and winter hibernation sites. These regular long distance migration paths open possibilities for wide range dispersal of viruses. In their caves, different species of bats frequently intermingle such that bat viruses have ample possibilities to “learn” how to cross species barriers. To conserve energy, two bat families including the Rhinolophidae developed hibernation reducing their body temperature down to 8 °C. Under these cold conditions, viral viremia can be maintained for 100 days. Persistent viral infections are also furthered by the long life span of bats. For the little brown bat weighing a minuscule 7 g, a life span of 35 years was documented. Once persistently infected, an individual has many years to pass its viral passengers. Bats are also the only land mammals that developed echolocation for their pursuit of food. At first glance, this physiological trait might not impact on virus transmission. However, when considering that the echolocation signals are produced by the larynx of these animals and emitted with high acoustical energy from mouth and nostril, this trait creates again substantial possibilities for aerosol virus transmission. It should therefore not come as a surprise that bats have repeatedly been linked to cross-species viral infections.</p>
