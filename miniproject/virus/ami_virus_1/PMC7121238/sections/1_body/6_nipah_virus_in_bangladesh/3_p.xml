<p>With Nipah infection in Bangladesh we saw the possibility for a bat virus to be transmitted directly to humans without the need of an intermediate host, but the potential of the bat virus to circulate in the human population was very limited since the infection chains broke after a few human-to-human transmissions. However, another bat virus demonstrated that this is not an intrinsic property of bat viruses. SARS showed the potential for extended human transmission and wide geographical spread of what was initially a food borne viral infection.</p>
