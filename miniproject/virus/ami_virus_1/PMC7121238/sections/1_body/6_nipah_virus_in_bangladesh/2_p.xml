<p>A survey was conducted in 100 health care workers who provided care to Nipah patients at a Dhaka hospital during the 2004 outbreak with minimal use of protective personal equipment. This study did not provide evidence for nosocomial transmission of Nipah virus even when using sensitive serum antibody tests (Gurley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">b</xref>). However, a case-control study from this 2004 outbreak in Bangladesh painted a different picture. Contact with an index patient carried the highest risk for infection in this survey followed by having contact to a family member harvesting palm sap. A diseased religious leader having many social contacts and sick visits became a “super-spreader” infecting more than 20 contacts. Two contacts infected four and two further contacts, respectively, but then the infection died out (Gurley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007a</xref>). Another case-control study conducted during the 2007 outbreak in Bangladesh also identified as risk factors the visit of a Nipah virus patient in a hospital, touching the index case or being in the same room with a diseased person (Homaira et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2010</xref>). The person-to-person transmission was likewise demonstrated by virologists who isolated Nipah viruses with practically identical genome sequence from an index case from West Bengal, India, who was an addict to liquor from palm juice, and three diseased family members (Arankalle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). There might be cultural and social reasons why person-to-person transmission was seen in Bangladesh and not in Malaysia. Social norms in Bangladesh require family members to maintain close physical contact to the diseased person (Luby et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">b</xref>). Poverty induces also the sharing of eating utensils and drinking glasses with the diseased person. Leftovers of food from the patient are commonly distributed to family members. Sleeping in the same bed as the patient even at local hospitals is not unusual in Bangladesh. However, the Bangladesh Nipah viruses differ also genetically from the Malaysian virus isolates, which might be responsible for the pronounced respiratory symptoms seen in Bangladeshi patients. Since Nipah virus is present in respiratory secretions of diseased patients, transmission of the Nipah virus in aerosol droplets might have induced a marked person-to-person transmission of Nipah infections in Bangladesh. In fact, when eight Nipah patients in an early infection stage were investigated, virus was isolated from the throat in six of them, but only from the urine of three patients (Chua et al.
