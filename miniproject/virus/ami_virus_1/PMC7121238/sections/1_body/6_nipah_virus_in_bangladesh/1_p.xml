<p>The next outbreak was observed in February 2001 in India close to the northern border of Bangladesh. Overall 66 cases were observed resulting in 45 deaths (Harit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). Retrospective investigations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) demonstrated Nipah virus infection by the detection of Nipah virus-specific antibodies in the serum and the isolation of Nipah virus from the urine of patients. No concomitant veterinary outbreak was detected, nor had the patients contacts to diseased animals. Shortly after this outbreak, 7 outbreaks with Nipah virus infection were documented in Bangladesh during the time period between 2001 and 2007. The infection was confirmed by all patients developing IgM antibodies to Nipah virus. The clinical presentation of the Bangladeshi patients differed substantially from that of the Nipah virus patients in Malaysia. When the first four outbreaks were analyzed, fever, an altered mental status, headache, cough and breathing difficulties determined the clinical picture (Hossain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2008</xref>). Some patients showed symptoms more compatible with acute respiratory distress syndrome than encephalitis. Case fatality rates were with 73% very high; death occurred within a week after the onset of the disease. The most striking and distinctive feature was that the predominantly male patients were with a median age of 12 years very young. Another important observation was the lack of exposure to pigs which served as intermediate host in Malaysia. In fact, Bangladesh is a traditional Muslim society where pork is not eaten and even the contact with pigs is avoided for religious reasons. These peculiar characteristics pointed to a different mode of Nipah virus introduction into the Bangladesh population than in Malaysia. Therefore, epidemiologists from the CDC together with collaborators from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Diseases Research Bangladesh (ICDDR,B) in Dhaka and the World Health Organization (WHO) conducted a risk factor analysis with a case-control study (Montgomery et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>). Contact with domesticated animals was excluded. The occurrence in young boys suggested an association with some childhood activity; one outdoor activity, namely climbing trees, was significantly associated with infection risk. Most notably, the only other significant risk factor was having contact with an infected person and visiting a hospital. Since under-nutrition is widespread in Bangladesh, the epidemiologists suspected that the boys gathered fruits from trees and also consumed partially eaten fruits contaminated with Nipah virus from saliva of infected fruit bats. Fruits are indeed a major food source in rural Bangladesh. Further epidemiological investigations shed more light on the Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh (Luby et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009a</xref>. Overall, ten infection clusters were identified with a median of 10 persons who were affected. Infections occurred with a clear-cut seasonality: nearly all cases were observed during the first 4 months of the year. Geneticists provided further hints about the outbreaks. When they sequenced Nipah virus genomes even from patients living in a limited geographical area and sampled over a few months time period, higher levels of sequence heterogeneity was observed than from Nipah viruses in pigs and humans of Malaysia (Lo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>). This observation was interpreted as repeated and independent introduction of Nipah virus into the human population in Bangladesh from different sources. However, there are also sequence data from an outbreak in Bengal /India in 2007 that shared 99% nt sequence identity with viral isolates from Bangladesh obtained in 2004 pointing to a common source (Arankalle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>). The investigation of a 2004 Nipah virus outbreak in Bangladesh by a joint CDC-ICDDR,B team of epidemiologists led to the likely source of the infection. Twelve case patients with a serologically confirmed Nipah virus infection leading to 11 deaths were compared with 33 neighbourhood controls in a case-control study. The only exposure significantly associated with disease was drinking raw date palm sap (Luby et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2006</xref>). This link can explain a lot of the observed epidemiology of Nipah virus infections in Bangladesh. Date palm sap collection is a seasonal occupation: it begins in mid-December with the cold season and ceases in mid-February overlapping the seasonality of Nipah virus infections in Bangladesh. Collectors climb the tall trees, the bark is shaved off near the top, a hollow bamboo tap is inserted and directs the palm sap that rises during the night through the tree into a clay pot. Up to 3 L of sap is harvested per night and sold as fresh sap in the next morning by street vendors. Fresh date palm sap is a national delicacy for millions of Bangladeshis in the winter. However, fruit bats also appreciate this palm sap and drink from the clay pots fixed to the trees. In fact, fruit bats of the species 
 <italic>Pteropus giganteus</italic> living in close association with the human population in northern India and Bangladesh are a nuisance to date palm sap collectors. They not only drink the collected sap, but bat excrements are occasionally found floating in the sap. About half of captured 
 <italic>P. giganteus</italic> bats from India indeed showed antibodies to Nipah virus making them likely sources for these infections (Epstein et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>). Veterinarians from the ICDDR,B then caught the fruit bats in action. They installed motion sensor-tripped infrared cameras on tapped palm trees and observed bats licking the sap running into the jug. Thus, the sap can be contaminated with the bat virus contained in saliva and urine of infected animals (Stone 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2011</xref>). The ICDDR,B is a remarkable research hospital in Bangladesh. It not only conducts internationally recognized research in clinical sciences, microbiology, epidemiology and nutrition, but its scientists are striving to find practical low cost solutions with means accessible to the poor local population which are as easy as effective. A recent proposal was to use the sari cloth of women in Bangladesh to filter the drinking water. In a controlled test, the researchers could demonstrate a nearly 50% reduction in cholera incidence with this practice. In 2007 the ICDDR,B scientists deployed bamboo skirts on palm trees and could demonstrate by their infrared cameras that this fences off the fruit bats.
