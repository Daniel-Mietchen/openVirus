<p>The virus isolation data confirm the serological data and point to fruit bats as source of the Malaysian Nipah virus outbreak. However, some points are noteworthy. The titer of Nipah virus in the urine from the Rahman et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>) study was with 10 TCID
 <sub>50</sub> (tissue culture infective doses) very low and probably only induced by stress (confinement in a cage), which might have lowered the immunity of the index animal. Two male bats from the same colony seroconverted during the observation period, but a virus could not be isolated from them. None of the three animals showed any disease symptoms. In its natural host, Nipah virus is not maintained by a boom and bust dynamic typical of acute viral infections, but by repeated, intermittent low virus shedding as a result of a chronic infection characterized by virus recrudescence (Sohayati et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2011</xref>). Such an infection mode is therefore very difficult to detect for viral ecologists working in the field. This observation is somewhat surprising since a number of non-host species could be infected with Henipa viruses. Natural infections were seen in horses, pigs, dog and cats. Experimental infections were seen in the guinea pig, hamster, ferret and nonhumane primates like the African green monkey (Wong and Ong 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>). In contrast, experimental infections of bats were not very successful. In one series, infected fruit bats developed a subclinical infection characterized by the transient presence of virus within selected viscera, episodic viral excretion and seroconversion (Middleton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2007</xref>). The intermittent, low-level excretion of Nipah virus in the urine of bats may be sufficient to sustain the reproduction of the virus in a species where there is regular urine contamination due to mutual grooming and licking and biting during mating. In another series, 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats from Malaysia were inoculated with Nipah virus by natural routes of infection. Despite an intensive sampling strategy, no virus was recovered from the Malaysian bats. Therefore, the probability of a spill-over event to another species is low (Halpin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2011</xref>). For spill-over to occur, a range of conditions and events must coincide. These peculiar conditions were apparently met in Malaysia (Pulliam et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2012</xref>). Two possible precipitating factors were discussed, which are not mutually exclusive, but might have acted synergistically. One factor is a “push” in form of progressive deforestation which put the fruit bats under ecological pressure. Another factor is a “pull” which attracted fruit bats to farms. Malaysia has seen a widespread dual use of agricultural land to produce both pigs and mangoes on the same farm. On the index farm where the Nipah virus outbreak started, 400 mango trees were planted directly adjacent to pig enclosures. Fruit bats were attracted to this “fast food”. In fact, bat roost places and the index farm were clearly within the bats’ nightly foraging range. Not all Megachiroptera are really fruit eaters, for example some species from the subfamily Nyctimeninae showed in their stomach exclusively remnants of beetles and flies. However the majority of the Megachiroptera are indeed fruit eaters and they show a highly adapted mouth part for their food choice. With their long canines and one foot they grasp the fruit. With their small incisive teeth they open up the fruit and with the flat molars they squash the fruits. The stomach and intestine of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> bats was full of a milky and slimy fruit juice while fruit fibres were not found in the gut. In fact, the squeezed fruit is normally discarded and falls on the ground. On the index farm, these discarded fruits contaminated by the saliva and urine of the bats fell into the pigsties and became a welcome supplementary food to the pigs. This unfortunate chain of events probably allowed the cross-species infection to occur. The dynamics of pig movements through the farm from the breeding to the growing to the finishing section mixed up the pig population and permitted to maintain infection chains. The movement of pigs from farm to farm led to a spread of the infection between geographically separated areas of Malaysia. Pig farmers had too close contact with the pigs resulting in a lethal bat-borne zoonosis of humans with pigs as an amplifying intermediate host. The export of Malaysian pigs to slaughterhouses in Singapore finally led to the spread of the disease to abattoir workers in Singapore. Consistent with this model identifying pigs as infection source was the observation that 92% of the infected patients reported close contact to pigs and that the outbreak stopped after pigs in the affected areas were slaughtered and buried. Human-to-human virus transmission was not observed. To assess the possibility of nosocomial transmission, 288 unexposed and 338 health care workers exposed to outbreak-related patients were surveyed, and their serum samples were tested for anti-Nipah virus antibody. Needle stick injuries were reported by 12, mucosal surface exposure to body fluids by 39 and skin exposure to body fluids by 89 workers. All serum samples were negative for Nipah virus-neutralizing antibodies (Mounts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2001</xref>).
