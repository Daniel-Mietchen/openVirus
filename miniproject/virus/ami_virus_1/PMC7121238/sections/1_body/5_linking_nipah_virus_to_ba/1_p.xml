<p>Serological studies demonstrated Nipah virus-specific antibodies in dogs, cats and ponies from the outbreak areas in Malaysia (Chua et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2000</xref>) while wild boar, hunting dogs and rodents were all negative for Nipah virus antibodies (Yob 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2001</xref>). The researchers then extended the survey to 14 species of bats from Malaysia. Two species of Megachiroptera (fruit bats), namely 
 <italic>Pteropus hypomelanus</italic> and 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> showed relatively high prevalence rates of 31 and 17 % Nipah antibody seropositivity, respectively. No virus reactive with anti-Nipah virus antibodies was isolated. All attempts to amplify Nipah virus RNA were also negative. Subsequently researchers collected urine from 
 <italic>Pteropus hypomelanus</italic> and swabs of their partially eaten fruits. Three viral isolates (two from urine and one from a partially eaten fruit), which caused syncytial cytopathic effect in Vero cells and stained strongly with Nipah- and Hendra-specific antibodies, were isolated. Molecular sequencing confirmed the isolate to be Nipah virus with a sequence deviation of five to six nucleotides from Nipah virus isolated of humans (Chua et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2002</xref>). More recently, Nipah virus was also isolated from 
 <italic>P. vampyrus</italic> (Rahman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). However, 272 throat and 272 urine samples had to be processed to yield a single isolate. This Nipah virus differed from the human, pig and 
 <italic>P. hypomelanus</italic> isolate at 98 nucleotide positions, about twice the difference between the human and 
 <italic>P. hypomelanus</italic> isolates.
