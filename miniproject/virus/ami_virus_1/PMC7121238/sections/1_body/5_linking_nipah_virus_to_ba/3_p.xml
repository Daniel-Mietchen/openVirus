<p>Thus far, one could conclude that the threat from bat viruses is rather low and that it needs very special conditions for an intermediate host to get in close contact with bats to serve as infection source for humans. The dimension of an outbreak with the tragedy of more than 100 human deaths and the enormous economic outfall from the culling of more than a million pigs should not be minimized. However, as long as no infection chains can be maintained in the human population, the outbreak cannot get out of control. One should, however, not take too much comfort from these reflections for two reasons. First, satellite telemetry studies have shown that bats are highly mobile and can move between Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Second, 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> has a wide geographical range covering the north-eastern coasts of Australia, Indonesia, South-East Asia, South Asia and Madagascar (but notably not Africa, which is an unexplained enigma of 
 <italic>Pteropus</italic> biology). One might fear Nipah outbreaks within this geographical range and wherever peculiar ecological conditions are met putting humans in close contact with Nipah virus from bats. Unfortunately, one had not to wait too long to get this concern confirmed.
