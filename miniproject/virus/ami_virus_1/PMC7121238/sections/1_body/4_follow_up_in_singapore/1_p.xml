<p>In March 1999 an abattoir worker died in Singapore with fever, headache and confusion. The next day a patient showing the same symptoms who also worked in an abattoir was admitted to the same hospital. Family members recalled a third and fourth abattoir worker hospitalized with a neurological disease. The Ministry of Health closed the abattoirs in Singapore and started a screening program. Eleven of thirty-five diseased abattoir workers showed IgM antibodies to Nipah virus. All worked in the same abattoir processing pigs imported from a farm in Malaysia. The index patient showed headache, fever, productive cough, pulmonary involvement and confusion. Necropsy showed widespread systemic vasculitis (Paton et al.

Exposure to live pigs was the only significant risk factor associated with the disease. However, only few abattoir workers noted coughing pigs or reported lethargic pigs with nasal discharge. Paradoxically, only one of two abattoirs processing Malaysian pigs was affected and just this abattoir had introduced face masks for the workers and blood products from the slaughter pigs were not collected (Chew et al.
