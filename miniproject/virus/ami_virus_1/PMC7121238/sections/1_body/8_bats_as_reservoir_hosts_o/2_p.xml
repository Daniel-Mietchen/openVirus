<p>To document the intensity of this viral hunt, just by opening the current issue of a scientific journal, I saw a report describing the isolation of a distinct lineage of an influenza A virus from a Phyllostomidae bat in Guatemala (Tong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2012</xref>). The bat virus displayed a novel hemagglutinin H17 antigen and a highly divergent neuraminidase extending the genetic range of known influenza A viruses. However, its genome replication complex was able to function in human cells suggesting that this bat virus could achieve genetic exchanges with human influenza viruses.
