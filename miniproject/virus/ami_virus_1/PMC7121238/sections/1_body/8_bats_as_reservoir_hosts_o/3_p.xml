<p>The story is not ending here. Thus far, virologists have demonstrated that bats harbour more than 60 viruses. Virus hunting is a time-consuming and dangerous business. Frequently it does not yield a live virus isolate by lack of suitable cell culture systems. Therefore, virologists are now increasingly using nucleic acid-based analytic methods for virus detection. RT-PCR methods can only reveal viruses for which the researchers have matching primer sets and will thus only reveal known viruses. Metagenome analyses of the virome has the potential to reveal the entire diversity of viral sequences present in a given host species. One study investigated the bat guano from caves in California and Texas. About half of the sequences were related to eukaryotic viruses. The largest sequence fraction corresponded to insect viruses, reflecting the diet of the investigated insectivorous bats. The second fraction represented sequences from viruses that infect plants and fungi, which probably reflects the diet of the herbivorous insect prey of the bats. The last fraction corresponded to viruses infecting mammals. This group comprised Parvo-, Circo-, Picorna-, Adeno-, Pox-, Astro- and Corona-Viridae (Li et al.

Another group investigated fecal, oral, urine and tissue samples from individual captured bats. They confirmed these observations and identified in addition three novel group 1 bat coronaviruses and bacterial viruses (Donaldson et al.
