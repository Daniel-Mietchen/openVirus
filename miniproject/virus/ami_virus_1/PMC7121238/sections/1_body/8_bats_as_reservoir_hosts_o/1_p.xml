<p>Equatorial Africa in 2001 and 2005 experienced human Ebola virus outbreaks that decimated gorilla and chimpanzee populations. Researchers captured more than 1000 small animals near the primate carcasses (Leroy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>). Serum antibodies specific for Ebola virus were found in three different bat species with the highest prevalence of 25 % in 
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>. Viral nucleotide sequences were found in liver and spleen samples from all three species, with 
 <italic>H. monstrosus</italic> again leading with a 20% prevalence rate. Animals were either seropositive or virus positive, the viral titers were generally low and no bat showed disease symptoms. The sequencing of the isolated genomes revealed a clustering with the Zaire clade of human Ebola virus isolates. Since the identified bat species are eaten by people in central Africa and the three bat species have a broad geographical range over equatorial Africa, opportunities for cross-species transmission are manifold. Another incident linked a further filovirus with bats. The CDC investigated an outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever which occurred in a gold-mining village in the Republic of the Congo in 1998. Sporadic cases that continued to occur until September 2000 and short chains of human-to-human transmission were observed in 154 patients of whom more than 80 % died. Only a quarter reported a contact with another patient. Nine distinct lineages of viruses were observed excluding a clonal outbreak. The researchers suspected a heterogeneous virus reservoir host that inhabited the mines (Bausch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2006</xref>). The scientists examined the fauna of the mine and found Marburg virus nucleic acid in 12 bats, comprising two species of insectivorous bat and one species of fruit bat. The link was further substantiated by finding antibody to the Marburg virus in the serum of 10 % of one insectivorous and in 20 % of the fruit bat species (Swanepoel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2007</xref>).
