<p>The evil force is thus perceived by the poet as a dynamic principle. Only from the dialectics of creation and annihilation, thesis and anti-thesis, anabolism and catabolism is a synthesis possible. In the end, evolution as understood by biologists is not too far from these old philosophical ideas. The destructive force gets thus a positive dimension. To avoid speculative thinking, let’s finish by asking what we know about the role of viruses in bats as biologists that possibly fits into this framework. Certain viruses are clear-cut evils (pathogens) for bats. Rabies virus is an example. Rabies virus is found in about 70 % of drowned, dead or dying bats. Despite that fact, rabies has not threatened bats with extinction. This does not mean that bats are immune against extinction. Currently, part of the bat population in the eastern USA collapses under the pressure of a fungal infection (“white nose syndrome”) (Frick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2010</xref>). Ecologists state that such devastating diseases are not the equilibrium situation; normally “old, adapted” viruses coexist with the host causing only minimal symptoms- just enough to be maintained in nature. As we have seen, asymptomatic infections with low level virus production seem to be the rule in virus-bat relationship. Large epidemics are evolutionary accidents where a virus enters in a susceptible host that has not yet learned to live with the virus. A host coexisting with an “adapted, domesticated” virus might also use the latter as a weapon to defend its turf. If an intruder enters the same ecological niche, it might get into the way of the “domesticated” virus coexisting with host 1, which might become a dangerous pathogen for host 2. Viruses can thus be used for defense, but also use for attack is imaginable. Host 1 might “use” its viral flora to compete with host 2 when intruding into the niche of the latter. Viruses might have an important role in reestablishing equilibria. Phage biologists have shown that viruses interfere with the transfer of organic matter in the food chain, assuring enough nutrients in the microbial loop. Bacteria profit thus from their bacterial viruses. Phage biologists have also introduced the concept of a virus killing the winning population (Wommack and Colwell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR002">2000</xref>). This concept means that phages cannot infect bacteria below a threshold density. However, bacteria that start to dominate a niche become excellent targets for phage infection. This way, phages are believed to maintain diversity of bacteria in any environment. Animal viruses might play a similar role in animal populations. Humans are a winning population in the ecosphere and occupy more and more niches. However, by doing so and changing the ecological framework, we are getting into a viral cross-fire. The evolutionary “sense” of this viral cross-fire could be to maintain biological diversity. In that ecological “logic,” humans are getting “too” numerous and we do not come alone- together with our domesticated animals and plants we are striving for agricultural surfaces and thereby geographical dominance on the globe. Viruses might be an in-built safety valve against this monopolization of the ecosphere by a dominant species. There are some speculations that climate change are behind all these emerging infectious diseases, which we have seen in recent decades. However, we might only “feel” the pressure of viruses that nature has “designed” to maintain organismal diversity. The sad prediction of such a hypothesis would be that we will see more and more viral accidents as described in this chapter, simply because we are getting in the way of too many species that compete with us for a place under the sun. If correct, we will need both a lot of science to defend our dominance against the viruses of our competitors and wisdom to refrain from our desire to subjugate the entire earth and to deny other organisms their ecological niche. In this sense, viruses might indeed be essential and constructive elements of life, even if we perceive them from our perspective as destructive demons. Viruses could have spoken the words of Mephistopheles quoted at the beginning of the chapter.
