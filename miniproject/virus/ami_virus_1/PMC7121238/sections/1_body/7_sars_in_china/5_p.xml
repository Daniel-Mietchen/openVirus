<p>Guided by the epidemiological data, a Chinese virologist went into live animal markets where he borrowed animals from vendors (Guan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2003</xref>). None of them was found to be ill, but PCR diagnosis tools showed that from the many sampled species four of the six palm civets scored positive, the two negative animals yielded a live virus from nasal secretions. They were sequenced and turned out to be 99.8% identical to the human isolates and differed from them mainly by a 29-nt insertion upstream of the structural N gene. Interestingly, the earliest human SARS virus isolates still contained this 29-nt segment, but later isolates lost this segment possibly as an adaptation to human-to-human virus transmission (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2004</xref>). The researchers cautioned that their isolation of the SARS virus from civets might not have identified the true animal reservoir of the virus. Civets might have contracted the infection in the markets and much larger investigations in feral animals were needed to settle the question of the virus reservoir. In fact, also a racoon dog from the investigated market yielded a closely related virus. Paradoxically, the very close similarity of the civet isolate with the human isolates was a major argument against civets as the SARS virus reservoir. In that case, virologists would have expected a much larger diversity of civet coronavirus sequences and only one out of the many would have made it into the human patients. Other arguments concurred with this reasoning. For example, experimental infection of civets with human SARS virus resulted in overt clinical disease, which is not expected for a viral reservoir where asymptomatic infection should be the rule. Finally, when the researchers looked more closely into civet coronavirus isolates recovered only one year apart, they found again very similar sequences, but within the few single-nucleotide variations a very high rate of non-synonymous over synonymous nucleotide substitutions was detected. These major genetic changes occurred in the spike gene which is essential for the transition between hosts suggesting an adaptation to a new host. This phenomenon was also seen in coronaviruses from the human host in the early 2002â€“2003 epidemic (Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2005</xref>). Such a process would not be expected in the natural host.
