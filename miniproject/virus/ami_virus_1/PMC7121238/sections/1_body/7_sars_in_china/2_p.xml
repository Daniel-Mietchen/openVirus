<p>The early phase of the epidemic passed largely unrecognized. The disease attracted attention in 2003 when a major outbreak occurred in a hospital of Guangzhou and a hotel in Hong Kong. Epidemiologists identified a super spreader, who infected 300 other individuals (Dye and Gay

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2003</xref>) leading to the decline of the case numbers in the third late phase. However, at that time the disease had already spread to 25 countries around the world with epicenters as far away as Canada, the virus had infected over 8,000 individuals and killed nearly 800 patients. The epidemic ended in July 2003- the nightmare of a pandemic running out of control did not become a reality. Despite all disruption of international travel and economical exchange, the international research community, assisted by the WHO, could thus prevent the worst. A contributing factor was certainly the early warning by avian influenza infections in Hong Kong, which led to fatalities in humans and heightened the alert of virologists for the possible emergence of devastating viral epidemics in China.
