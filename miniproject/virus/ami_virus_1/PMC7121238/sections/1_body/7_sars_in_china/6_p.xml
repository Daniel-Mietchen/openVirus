<p>Therefore the Chinese virus hunters went for other virus sources and targeted bats. This is not an odd choice. Also bat meat is eaten in delicacy restaurants of southern China and bat feces are used in traditional Chinese medicine to cure asthma and kidney ailments. Two groups found what they were searching for. One group sampled 408 bats representing nine species which they trapped in their natural environment. They investigated blood, fecal and throat swabs. Three species of communal, cave-dwelling horseshoe bats (genus 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic>) showed the high seroprevalence levels of SARS-neutralizing antibodies expected for a virus reservoir ranging from 28% in 
 <italic>R. pearsoni</italic> to 71% in 
 <italic>R. macrotis</italic> (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2005</xref>). Five stool samples from three species (
 <italic>R. pearsoni, macrotis and ferrumequinum</italic>) yielded coronavirus RNA and the complete genome sequences could be obtained for SL-CoV Rp3 (
 <underline>S</underline>ARS-
 <underline>l</underline>ike 
 <underline>Co</underline>rona
 <underline>v</underline>irus isolate 
 <underline>Rp3</underline>), while a live virus could not be recovered. The overall nucleotide sequence identity with human SARS isolates was 92%. However, the domain of the S protein involved in the receptor binding showed only 64% sequence identity explaining why bat sera failed to neutralize SARS virus. Another group of Chinese virologists screened nasopharyngeal and anal swabs of 120 bats, 60 rodents and 20 monkeys from rural areas. The conserved polymerase gene from coronaviruses gave a positive signal in the feces of 29 bats. They detected a coronavirus sequence related to the SARS virus in 23 anal swabs from the insectivorous Chinese horseshoe bats (
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic>) using PCR technology (Lau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005</xref>). The sequences showed 88 % nucleotide sequence identity with the SARS virus again with a sharp drop in similarity over the S gene. The phylogenetic distance from the SARS virus and the presence of the 29-bp insertion sequence missing in the human isolates made a transmission of the SARS virus from humans to bats unlikely. Instead, bat SL-CoV and civet SARS-like CoV are likely to have a common ancestor. None of the positive bats showed clinical symptoms, but many showed an antibody response and high serum titers correlated with low anal virus excretion. Both studies showed closely related sequences for this coronavirus, much closer related to SARS than to another recently isolated bat coronavirus. 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> roosts in caves and feeds on moths and beetles. However, also the cave-dwelling fruit bat 
 <italic>Rousettus leschenaulti</italic> showed serological evidence for coronavirus infection. These fruit bats were found by the virus detectives on markets in southern China. One hypothesis imagines that they were the asymptomatic source for virus spill-over to susceptible animals exposed on the markets like the civet. The spread of the virus to susceptible animals might have provided the necessary amplification to achieve intrusion into the human population.
