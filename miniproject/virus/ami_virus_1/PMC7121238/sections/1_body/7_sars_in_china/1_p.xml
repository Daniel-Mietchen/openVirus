<p>SARS (Severe acute respiratory syndrome) emerged 2002 as a new human disease in the Guangdong Province of China. After an incubation period of less than a week, patients showed fever, malaise, headache and myalgias followed by cough and dyspnea. The respiratory problems could progress to frank adult respiratory distress syndrome with multiorgan dysfunction. The virus infects the respiratory tract using the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor leading to a systemic illness with virus being present in the blood, urine and the feces. The patients are infectious for 2â€“3 weeks with peak titer excretion 10 days after symptom onset. The patients were treated with ribavirin antiviral and glucocorticoids, but beneficial effects could not be documented. Supportive care to maintain pulmonary functions was the only therapeutic option.</p>
