<p>According to current hypotheses, palm civets were simply conduits rather than the fundamental reservoirs of SARS virus in the wild. In fact, mutational analysis identified at least two separate transmission events that occurred between palm civets and humans: one in the main SARS epidemic in 2002–2003 and another during sporadic infections occurring during the next winter season. In view of the large coronavirus reservoir in bats, the ecological framework, the high mutation rate of RNA viruses and the recombination potential of coronaviruses, the emergence of another pathogenic human coronavirus from bats might be more a question of “when” rather than “if” (Graham and Baric 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2010</xref>). One needs to remain aware of this risk. The rapid deployment of classic tools of public health that brought the SARS epidemic to an end like air passenger control and strict quarantine measures will be as instrumental in containing future outbreaks as an increased research into the virology of bats as an early warning system. That this consideration is not a moot point can be illustrated with two recent virus isolates.
