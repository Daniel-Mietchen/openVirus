<p>The search for the direct ancestor phage for the SARS virus is still ongoing. Additional bat coronavirus isolates point to 
 <italic>R. sinicus</italic> as likely bat source species, which yielded an isolate closely related to Rp3 (Yuan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2010</xref>). These researchers proposed that the bat ancestor to the SARS virus might have resulted from a recombination event near the S gene which occurred in a bat viral lineage that experienced a transfer to civets 4 years before the SARS outbreak (Hon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2008</xref>). The link to 
 <italic>R. sinicus</italic> was confirmed by recent ecological surveys. Of 1,400 horseshoe bats trapped near Hong Kong, 9 % showed a SARS-related virus in the feces. Peak activity was in spring. All positive animals appeared healthy, but they showed lower weight and they cleared the virus within a few weeks. Tagging experiments showed that these animals had foraging ranges of up to 17 km. The mobility of the host allows for recombination events between coronaviruses from bats of different geographical locations provided that their foraging ranges overlap (Lau et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). The divergence time between human/civet and bat SARS-like strains was estimated to date 8 years ago.
