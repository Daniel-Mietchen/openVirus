<p>Is SARS a food borne infection like Nipah infections (Brüssow 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2007</xref>)? The connection became clear when laboratories in the United States, Canada, Germany, and Hong Kong isolated and then sequenced a coronavirus as the causative agent of this epidemic (Rota et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2003</xref>; Marra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2003</xref>). The agent turned out to be a known virus. It belonged to the coronavirus group, which comprises large, enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses, where the viral genome encodes the information for the viral proteins. Coronaviruses cause respiratory and enteric diseases in humans and animals. Human coronaviruses were up to that epidemic only associated with mild upper respira­tory tract infections, but some animal coronavirus like Transmissible Gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) cause deadly enteric infections in swine. Coronaviruses contain the largest genomes of any RNA virus: the SARS isolates showed genome lengths around 29,750 nucleotides. The genome organization resembled closely that of the known coronaviruses, but its sequences constitute a distinct group on the coronavirus tree.
