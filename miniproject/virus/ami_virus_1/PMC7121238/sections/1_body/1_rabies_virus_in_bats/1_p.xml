<p>When I learned virology in the early 1980s during my PhD at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, bats were not a big concern. In fact, as a student I knew only about a single virological problem with bats: rabies. In industrial countries, I have never seen a clinical case of rabies, the only victim of rabies whom I knew was the Swiss coordinator of rabies vaccination who had a fatal helicopter accident when dropping the vaccine for foxes. Rabies became even rarer in industrial countries after these vaccination campaigns, but in my consciousness I maintained a deep-seated distrust of bats despite all zoological interest for this fascinating form of mammalian life. I will illustrate this ambiguous attitude towards bats with a trivial personal experience. The author was called to a female neighbor who reported a strange animal in her house. Actually what I found was a rather drowsy bat crawling on the floor. Instead of removing the bat directly, I first went home, searched a big pair of gardening gloves and only then I went back to her to remove the bat. My cautious reaction might have appeared to her as an overreaction, but it probably corresponded to what virologists would have recommended to do. Healthy bats are able flyers and avoid collisions or contact with humans. Bats found on the ground during day time are suspect. Due to my professional education- other would say- deformation, I suspected a rabid bat. Some rabid bats may become aggressive, but others simply become disoriented and loose their flying ability. Insectivore bats have very fine teeth that may lead to so small puncture marks when biting your hands that they are overlooked. Contamination of such a trivial skin wound with bat saliva could lead to infection. Rabies is caused by a rhabdovirus. Worldwide about 55,000 cases of rabies death are reported annually, most are the consequence of bites from rabid dogs in regions where large scale vaccination programs were not conducted. Indigenous rabies was still observed in the USA and Canada with about ten cases per year in the 1950s, most of them were dog-associated. In the 1960s the cases came down to one case per year while a rise to four cases per year – practically all bat-associated– were seen since the 1990s (de Serres et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2008</xref>). In the USA rabies is still enzootic in foxes, skunks, raccoons and bats. Rabies is also enzootic among bats in Europe, but only 5 human cases of bat-associated rabies were reported from Europe. Rabies is a dreaded disease and the medical literature reports only a single case who has survived an infection without post-exposure prophylaxis. There is thus good reason to be circumspect of bats, but the odds for an infection with a bat-variant rabies virus were not high when I was helping my neighbor.
