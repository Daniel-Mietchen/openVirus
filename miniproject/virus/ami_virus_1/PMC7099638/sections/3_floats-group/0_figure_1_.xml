  <p>(a) Maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree estimated from complete or near-complete nCoV virus genomes available by enforcing a relaxed molecular clock. Triangular clades represent the nCoV 2019–2020 outbreak clade. (b) Expansion of the clade containing the novel genomes sequences from the nCoV 2019–2020 epidemic. Clade posterior probabilities are shown at well supported nodes. Internal branches were colored by ancestral state reconstruction with support shown when greater than 0.8.</p>
