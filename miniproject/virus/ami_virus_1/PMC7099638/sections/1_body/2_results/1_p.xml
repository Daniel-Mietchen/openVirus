<p>Despite the short time since the beginning of the epidemic, the isolates analyzed have already exhibited a substantial degree of heterogeneity with differences in 15% of the sites, 11% of which were parsimony informative, thus indicating the presence of sufficient phylogenetic signal for further analysis, in agreement with the low level of phylogenetic noise shown by likelihood mapping (&lt;7%). The root-to-tip 
 <italic>vs</italic>. divergence plot of the full dataset showed high correlation between sampling time and genetic distance to the root of the ML tree of the available sequences (R-squared 0.85), indicating substantial temporal signal and the possibility to calibrate a reliable molecular clock, despite the limited number of sequences and short sampling interval available.
