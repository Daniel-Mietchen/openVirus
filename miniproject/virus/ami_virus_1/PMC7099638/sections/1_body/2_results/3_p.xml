 <xref rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref> A,B shows the MCC tree with Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction of 2019-nCoV isolates. The probable origin of 2019-nCoV is, as expected, Wuhan with a state posterior probability (spp) of 0.93 dating back the time of the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of the human outbreak to November 25, 2019 (95%HPD: September 28, 2019; December 21, 2019), while the MRCA of Bat SARS-like Coronavirus and related 2019-nCoV lineages dates back to February 22, 2011 (95%HPD: September 20, 2008; August 15, 2014) (Figure S1), which may suggest a relatively extended period of sub-epidemic circulation before the most recent events. The first evidence of 2019-nCoV dissemination appears to be, according to our phylogeographic reconstruction, from Wuhan, China, to Nonthamburi, Thailand, with an spp. of 0.96, followed by the emergence of two distinct lineages, one with further spreading in Nonthamburi, and the second one following a more complex pattern: from Nonthamburi to Zhejiang, Huangzhou (spp = 0.47), as well as from Zhejiang to Kanagawa, Kanto (spp = 0.62) and from Nonthamburi to Guandong, Zhuhai (spp = 0.45). The first reported US cases, in Chicago, Illinois and Seattle, Washington, appeared to be linked to Guandong, Zhuhai isolates, in agreement with reports of patients traveling back from that region of China before being diagnosed. Finally, our analysis identified the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus as the most probable origin of the 2019-nCoV (spp = 0.99).
