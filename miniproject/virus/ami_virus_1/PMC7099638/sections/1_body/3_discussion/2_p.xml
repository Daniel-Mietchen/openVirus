<p>The results of our Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction seem to be in agreement with a recent report of Benvenuto et al. (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.biorxiv.org/</ext-link>) suggesting that a Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence is homologous and genetically more similar to the 2019-nCoV than other Bat SARS-like coronavirus sequences, but very distant from sequences isolated in SARS 202/2003 epidemic and MERS coronavirus. The finding may imply a most recent common ancestor between 2019-nCoV and the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> bat family. We also identify, in agreement with epidemiological reports, the city of Wuhan as the most likely origin of the human epidemic, dating back to the end of November 2019. In 2010, a previous article has suggested that the emergence of diverse virus strains within a few decades, in the different 
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic> species, may be the result of rapid evolution generating variants with the ability of easily crossing species barriers. The same study has shown that the epizootic transmission of the SARS from bat to human during the 2003 epidemic may have actually occurred up to 8 years earlier than the actual human outbreak [

Taken together, these results indicate a recurring pattern among the sub-genre of the 
 <italic>Betacoronavirus l</italic>eading to periodical epizootic epidemics.
