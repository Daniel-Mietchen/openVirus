<p>In the present 2019-nCoV epidemic, WHO estimates R0, the basic reproduction number, as 1.4 to 2.5 less than SARS (2 to 5); but, this number can grow if the epidemic is not controlled by applying quarantine and isolation strategies. Purely epidemiological data such as incidence reports and contact tracing can provide background information on individual cases and population level transmission. However, molecular epidemiological data analyses, when sampling strategies are appropriate and representative of the full genetic heterogeneity of the pathogen population, can circumvent human error and present quantitative information about an infectious agent.</p>
