<p>Combining epidemiology with molecular evolutionary data in a holistic approach is valuable for understanding the virus epidemic history and transmission in order to implement effective public health measures and prevent future epidemics like SARS-CoV and 2019-nCoV. Using phylodynamic analysis to investigate 2019-nCoV evolutionary history will add indispensable details to curb the current outbreak by identifying most closely related cases and providing crucial information of transmission and evolutionary patterns.</p>
