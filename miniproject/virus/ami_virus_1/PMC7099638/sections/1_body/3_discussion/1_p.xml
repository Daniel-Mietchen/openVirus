<p>Very little is known about 2019-nCoV virus, including basic biology, animal source or any specific treatment. The substantial degree of genetic heterogeneity (15%) accumulated among human isolates during the past few months of the ongoing epidemic outbreak is not necessarily surprising for an RNA virus that has been shown to be a measurably evolving population over short time spans [
 <xref rid="CIT0015">15</xref>]. However, our findings underscore the urgent need for further molecular surveillance and the development of appropriate and an in-depth monitoring system capable of investigating viral mutation and transmission capabilities as 2019-nCoV unfortunately keeps spreading at a regional and potential global level. In other words, given the virusâ€™s fast evolutionary rate and population dynamic, tracking the emergence of novel transmission routes and/or patterns should be considered a significant priority.
