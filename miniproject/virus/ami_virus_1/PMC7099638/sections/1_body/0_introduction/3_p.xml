<p>Based on epidemiological analysis, animal-to-human transmission seems to be the likely origin of the epidemic, as the first cases were detected in patients with recent history of visits to Wuhan fish and wild markets. Evidences for animal-to-human and subsequent human-to-human transmission of the virus were also reported, even if the transmission dynamics are not completely understood and significant knowledge gaps still need to be filled in [
 <xref rid="CIT0004">4</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. In this short report, initial phylodynamic and phylogeography analyses of the 2019-nCoV were performed on the full genome sequences currently available, in order to clarify virus transmission dynamics and trace its initial epidemic spread.
