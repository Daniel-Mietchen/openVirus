<p>Exo-epidemiology is confined to the investigation of the dissemination of the pathogen after its release from the organism. It includes their survival in the environment, their whereabouts in certain reservoirs and their retransmission to humans or animals. In contrast, endo-epidemiology deals with the way and manner in which pathogens spread within the organism and where they may persist and mutate. Epidemiology records not only the incidence of infections, diseases and deaths, but also attempts to obtain data on the disease pattern in which the aetiological relationship to a specific pathogen is not known (disease in search of virus), and this leads to the identification of diseases caused by a known virus (virus in search of disease). It extends the knowledge of the cause of infectious diseases by monitoring epidemics or pandemics and assessing the course of infectious diseases and their consequences for a population. If clusters of specific symptoms result, this can be an indication of the appearance of new viruses or particularly virulent strains. The survey of epidemiological data also includes the influence of living standards, social structure and human behaviour patterns, such as sexual promiscuity or drug abuse, but also veterinary relevant parameters such as stock densities, animal transport, animal markets, animal shows, seasonality, climate, vector density and mating season on the transmission frequency and infection time. The migrations of populations because of eviction or rural exodus and the associated negative social consequences, such as poor hygiene, and the declining effectiveness of public health authorities can facilitate the dissemination of infectious diseases. In antiquity, diseases such as plague, smallpox, influenza and measles spread along the caravan routes and trade routes. The worldwide growth of tourism resulted in increased contacts with previously unknown pathogens that were imported by infected people in a naive (for the pertinent pathogen) population of a country. Whereas these processes were long-lasting even a few decades ago, viruses are now spread worldwide within a few days or weeks. This was clearly demonstrated by the rapid spread of the infection with SARS coronavirus in 2003 from Southeast Asia to Europe and North America (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14). The change of production processes in industry and agriculture and trade in consumer goods and waste as well as human interferences with the natural environment cause new distribution patterns of infections. Until a few years ago, animal pathogenic viruses, such as avian influenza virus, spread worldwide by bird and animal migrations (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16). In addition, pathogens are today a worldwide problem through the international trade in farm animals, which often extends beyond continental borders.</p>
