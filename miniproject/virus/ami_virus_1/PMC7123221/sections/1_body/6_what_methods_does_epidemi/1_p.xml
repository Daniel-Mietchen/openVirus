<p>The epidemiological methods which are especially used for viral diseases include survey and collection of data on the occurrence of specific disease clusters. This anamnesis constitutes the basis of all studies. Detection of specific antibodies, viral genomes or viral proteins in blood or tissue samples makes possible the diagnosis of acute or previous viral diseases (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_13).</p>
