<p>Frequently, the aetiological role of a virus can no longer be evidenced by the fulfilment of the Henle–Koch postulates. These require the pathogen always be detectable in the patients, isolable from them, cultivable in pure culture and able to generate the disease after inoculation in a susceptible host (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_1). According to these criteria, many viruses cannot be characterized as pathogens of the infectious diseases caused by them, not least because many viruses cannot be propagated in cell culture. Therefore, it is reasonable to extend these definitions. Helpful in this context are the so-called Evans postulates. They assess the association of a pathogen with a disease, even using indirect criteria. Essential aspects of the Evans postulates are summarized in Table
