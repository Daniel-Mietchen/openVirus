<p>Nucleic acid sequencing and determination of restriction enzyme patterns of DNA sequences render it possible to compare the virus strains or variants that emerge during an epidemic or pandemic. They make possible molecular epidemiology, which allows one to identify certain people, animals or livestock as a source of infection. In this way, molecular pedigrees can be established, which allow conclusions to be drawn on the origin of the pathogen.</p>
