<p>Horizontal transmission refers to all types of infection of an organism by another organism, i.e. the transmission of a pathogen between hosts of a generation. This includes the homologous transmission of a virus from person to person, as well as the heterologous transmission from animals to humans (zoonosis) and vice versa. Pathogens spread by horizontal transmission in a population during epidemics, pandemics or endemics. This can be directly, for example, by virus-containing aerosols or droplets that are released when sneezing or coughing during infectious diseases of the upper respiratory tract (such as infections with influenza viruses, coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses and paramyxoviruses; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19), or indirectly. Indirect transmission is known, among others, for rhinoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14), which are transmitted by droplet infection, and also via contaminated hands, doorknobs or similar household items commonly used by infected and uninfected people such as towels. Dirt and smear infections contribute especially to the dissemination of virus-induced gastrointestinal or renal diseases. Here, the pathogen is excreted in the faeces or urine, and is transmitted by contamination with this material because of inadequate hygiene. Canine parvovirus has been spread very efficiently worldwide by the soles of shoes which were contaminated with viruses from dog excrements. In regions with a low hygienic standard, sewage is discharged untreated into rivers and seas. This practice and also fertilization of plants with human faeces, which is widespread in some countries, can lead to contamination of food with polioviruses, enteroviruses, hepatitis A viruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14) and caliciviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14) – an important cause of epidemics. Mussels thrive particularly well in such polluted waters and simultaneously enrich hepatitis A viruses. Hantaviruses and arenaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16) are excreted in the faeces of infected rodents, and thus are disseminated into the ground. In the case of contact with such contaminated earth, there is a risk of infection with the relevant pathogens. Similarly, organ transplants can lead to transmission of such viruses and also herpesviruses (Epstein–Barr virus or cytomegalovirus; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In the worst case, all viruses which have a more or less pronounced viraemic phase or are situated in the organ at the time of graft removal can be transmitted by transplants. In fact, lymphocytic choriomeningitis and rabies have been transmitted in this way (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16). Many viruses are present in the saliva and can be transmitted to babies by kissing or mouth-to-mouth feeding. In other cases, the virus is present in the semen or the cervical secretions and can be transmitted by sexual intercourse. This is particularly true for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), papillomaviruses and some herpesviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Viruses that are present in the blood during the disease (hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses, HIV, parvovirus, cytomegalovirus), are transmitted by smeared blood, for example, perinatally during the birth process from the infected mother to the neonate, but also through contaminated blood products or stored blood (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).</p>
