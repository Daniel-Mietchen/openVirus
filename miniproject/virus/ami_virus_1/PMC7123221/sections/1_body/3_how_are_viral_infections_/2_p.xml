<p>Some viral species are transmitted by arthropods (ticks, mosquitoes). The animals are infected with the pathogen when it is taken up with the blood when stinging or biting. After reproduction in ticks or insects, the virus can be transmitted to other organisms through biting or stinging. This form of heterologous transmission is found, for instance, in yellow fever virus, dengue virus, tick-borne encephalitis virus, togaviruses and orbiviruses, and in some bunyaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_17). On the other hand, rabies virus enters the wound and thus the organism through the bite of infected vertebrates (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). The geographic distributions of viruses that are transmitted by arthropods are mostly identical to those of the mosquitoes and ticks that they use as vectors. Shifts and changes in climate conditions, as are to be expected because of global warming, can lead to the occupation of new regions and niches by insects and the viruses that are associated with them.</p>
