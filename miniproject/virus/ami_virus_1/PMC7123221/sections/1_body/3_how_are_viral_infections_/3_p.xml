<p>Dissemination of viruses among people who live in close contact with each other is known as nosocomial infection. Such infections are commonly observed in nursing homes, kindergartens and hospitals. In these communities, many pathogens spread swiftly. The concept of iatrogenic infection refers particularly to the spread of pathogens by medical procedures such as organ transplants and blood transfusions, and by improperly performed medical interventions, such as the use of contaminated equipment, syringes or needles. Iatrogenic transmissions have frequently been observed in bovine leukaemia virus infections in which the virus was transmitted through the use of insufficiently disinfected needles from animal to animal and from flock to flock.</p>
