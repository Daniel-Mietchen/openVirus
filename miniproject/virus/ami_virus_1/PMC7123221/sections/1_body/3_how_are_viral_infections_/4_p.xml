<p>The transmission of an infection between generations (from mother to fetus) is referred to as vertical transmission. This happens when pregnant women are acutely infected with certain viruses (rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, parvovirus B19; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20), and the pathogen is transplacentally transmitted to the fetus. Similarly, this also applies when the viral genome is inherited by the next generation as an integrated part of the genetic information of the cell (e.g. of the egg or sperm cell). This vertical transmission from parents to offspring is known primarily for endogenous retroviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18) or for bovine and porcine pestiviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14).</p>
