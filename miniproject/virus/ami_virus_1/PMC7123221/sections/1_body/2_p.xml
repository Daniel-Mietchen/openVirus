<p>Some brief explanations of the basic concepts commonly used in epidemiology for specific parameters or infectious forms follow. An epidemic is a temporally and spatially limited occurrence of an infectious disease in a population. Examples are rubella, measles and chickenpox. By contrast, a pandemic is defined as a global, time-limited or unlimited accumulation of infections, as is found in influenza or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Endemic diseases are sporadic, spatially and temporally limited or unlimited appearing infectious diseases which can occur between epidemic phases. Morbidity describes the number of ill individuals in relation to the population size, and mortality is defined as the number of deaths that occur from a particular infection within a population; both are usually referred to 10
 <sup>4</sup> or 10
 <sup>5</sup> people or animals. By contrast, lethality is defined as the number of deaths in relation to the total number of people affected by a particular infectious disease. Excess mortality is the temporary accumulation of deaths as a result of an infection, such as flu or AIDS, which surpasses the long-term average mortality. Herd immunity is defined as the immunological protection that exists against a virus (measles, rubella and influenza viruses) in the population at a given time, regardless of whether it is caused by infection with the pertinent pathogen or by vaccination. The herd immunity of a population varies with the different viruses. It depends on transmission mechanisms, environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity and the population density, including vaccination discipline. To attain effective herd immunity, a vaccination rate of over 90Â % of the population is usually considered necessary (e.g. measles, mumps and rubella).
