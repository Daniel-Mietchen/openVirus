<p>In contrast, herpesviruses show a completely different behaviour. They remain latent in the body after infection, and the lifelong latency with recurrent excretion phases facilitates the dissemination of the virus even after long intervals (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). HIV infections also appear clinically unnoticed for a long time, although in this case infectious viruses are always present in the blood. The same applies to viruses that produce persistent infections and are present over long periods in the blood and are excreted or released from the skin, such as hepatitis B virus, adenoviruses and papillomaviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Therefore, they are considered as one of the phylogenetically old viruses, which are well adapted to humans and can survive even in small populations. However, the new highly sensitive methods for detection of viral nucleic acids show that, besides these forms of chronically persisting or latent infections with relapsing recurrence or reactivation, there is also latency of viral genomes in which neither reactivation of the viral genetic information nor the associated synthesis of virus products is observed. This DNA latency in the cells of different tissues has particularly been described for parvovirus B19 (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).</p>
