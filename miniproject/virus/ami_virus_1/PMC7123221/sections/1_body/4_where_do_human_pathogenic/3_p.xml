<p>Sometimes, viruses infect certain animal species, and these are used as reservoirs for these pathogens, whence they can be transmitted to humans on certain occasions, or accidentally. Influenza viruses infect various bird species, which excrete them in the faeces. They can be transmitted to swine, just as the human virus types. In the case of double infections in swine, genome segments of both virus types can be recombined. In this manner, new reassortants of influenza viruses arise, which are occasionally pathogenic for humans and can spread pandemically in the population (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16). Other viruses can bridge larger periods by having long incubation times. These include rabies viruses, which use foxes, badgers and bats as reservoirs. In this case, human infections represent the end of the infection chain, and a further dissemination is generally not possible (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). Even other viruses are able to leave their natural reservoir, and can be transmitted to humans: different animal poxviruses, hantaviruses, Ebola virus, the pathogen of Lassa fever and flaviviruses, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16 and 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). They reach the human organism by contact with animals as well as by tick or mosquito bites, thus leaving their natural hosts, rodents or monkeys.</p>
