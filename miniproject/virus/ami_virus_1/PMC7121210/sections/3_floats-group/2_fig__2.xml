  <p>Effect of elevated mutation rates on viral fitness and survival
   <bold>.</bold> A simplified view of quasispecies dynamics and fitness change is shown. Unrestricted replication (
   <italic>blue arrowhead on the right, with multiple passages indicated by several arrowheads</italic>) results in fitness gain, as depicted by the triangle at the bottom. Fitness gain can occur with or without variation of the consensus sequence. In contrast, replication in the presence of mutagen or repeated bottleneck transfers (
   <italic>red arrowhead on the left</italic>) results in accumulation of mutations that modify the consensus sequences, and decreased fitness. This figure is based on previously published data (Domingo et al.
