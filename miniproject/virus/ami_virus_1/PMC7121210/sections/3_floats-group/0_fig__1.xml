  <p>Schematic representation of a viral quasispecies. Viral genomes are represented as horizontal lines, and mutations as symbols in the lines. Upon infection with an RNA virus—even with a single particle, as depicted here—viral replication leads to a mutant spectrum of related genomes, termed quasispecies</p>
