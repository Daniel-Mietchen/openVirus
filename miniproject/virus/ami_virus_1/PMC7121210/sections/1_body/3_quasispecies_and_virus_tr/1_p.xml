<p>One of the most important practical consequences of the viral quasispecies concept is its impact on antiviral therapies. Diversification of RNA virus populations clearly drives antiviral therapy response. An important example of the high adaptability of RNA viruses is the high frequency of mutant viruses with one or a few amino acid substitutions that confer reduced sensitivity to antiviral inhibitors. This general phenomenon has been documented for many viruses over the past several decades, and has made it very difficult to treat several viral diseases (Briones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>). The best example of adaptive selection is the HIV-1 virus mutants that are resistant to antiretroviral inhibitors. All currently available classes of antiretroviral therapy (reverse transcriptase, fusion, co-receptor antagonists, and integrase inhibitors) exert selective pressure for target gene mutations that confer high-level drug resistance (Johnson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011</xref>). The capacity of novel compounds to exert selective pressure for a mutation is now used as evidence of anti-HIV-1 activity. Experimental studies of HIV-1 populations have demonstrated the existence of many resistant mutants in HIV-1 populations before they have been exposed to the inhibitors (Najera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">1995</xref>). These resistant mutants may exist at very low frequencies in the naive viral population, but then selectively multiply in the presence of the inhibitor. The relative fitness values of wild-type and resistant mutants in the absence and presence of the inhibitor determine the kinetics and degree of dominance of resistant mutants (Coffin
