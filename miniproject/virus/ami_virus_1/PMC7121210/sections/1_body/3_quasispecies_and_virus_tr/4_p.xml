<p>Mounting evidence shows that single-stranded DNA viruses (all with genomes smaller than ∼13 kb) evolve at rates approaching those observed in their RNA counterparts (Duffy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>), suggesting that combination therapy may also be considered for the treatment of some DNA viruses. Single-stranded viral DNA replication mechanisms are generally less prone to proofreading, and isolated single-stranded DNA seems to be resistant to mismatch repair. The first precise estimates for the rate of single-stranded DNA virus evolution came from a study on canine parvovirus (CPV-2), in which a substitution rate of approximately 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitution/site per year was estimated (Lopez-Bueno et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2006</xref>; Shackelton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2005</xref>). This value is within the range observed in RNA viruses (Domingo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>).
