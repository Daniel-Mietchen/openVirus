<p>The emergence of resistant virus variants poses a serious medical problem. Consequently, different strategies have been developed to counteract viral escape. Over a decade of experience with HIV antiretroviral therapy has taught us that it is unrealistic to try to target RNA viruses with only one antiviral agent because the virus will rapidly develop resistance. Large population sizes, high replication rates, and high error rates of RNA viruses provide the basis for mutation, and rapid growth of escape variants that are likely present before therapy begins. To counteract this situation, antiviral therapies now involve co-administration of multiple antivirals targeting different viral proteins or targeting only one viral protein but through different mechanisms of action. This strategy can reduce the emergence of single-resistant viruses, as exemplified with the multiple anti-HIV drug combination approach, known as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) (Ho
