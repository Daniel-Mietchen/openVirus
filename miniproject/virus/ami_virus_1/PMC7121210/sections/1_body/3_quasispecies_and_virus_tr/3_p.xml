<p>There are two licensed classes of anti-influenza drugs: M2 ion channel blockers (amino-adamantines: amantadine and rimantadine) and NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir); however, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses, including the earliest isolate, are already amino-adamantine-resistant (Dawood et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>). In contrast, most of the currently circulating pandemic viruses are susceptible to NA inhibitors (Itoh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2009</xref>); therefore, pandemic influenza patients are treated with NA inhibitors in many countries. Studies with seasonal H1N1, H3N2, and highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses revealed that single amino acid substitutions at several positions in or around the NA active site confer resistance to viruses against NA inhibitors. One study detected the NA H274Y substitution in sporadic cases of oseltamivir-treated and â€“ untreated patients infected with 2009 H1N1 pandemic viruses (Leung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2009</xref>). Importantly, viruses with the NA H274Y substitution were comparable to their oseltamivir-sensitive counterparts in their pathogenicity and transmissibility in animal models (Kiso et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2010</xref>). Again, it seems unrealistic that antiviral monotherapy could stop an RNA virus.
