<p>Whether RNA virus genomic diversity affects viral pathogenesis is one of the most intriguing topics within the field of RNA virus evolution. Characterization of virulence determinants of pathogenic agents is of utmost relevance for designing disease-control strategies. Typically, virulence determination has been attributed to nucleotide changes in specific genomic regions. For instance, in the type 3 vaccine strain, P3/Sabin, a uridine residue at nucleotide 472 in the 5′ noncoding region, and a phenylalanine at amino acid 91 of capsid protein VP3 have been identified as contributing to reduced poliovirus neurovirulence (Minor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">1989</xref>). All three Sabin vaccine strains contain strong attenuation determinants. However, more recent work has shown that other factors, such as quasispecies diversity, can determine the pathogenic potential of a viral population; in these cases, pathogenicity will be determined by the “quasispecies” and not by the “individual”. Poliovirus carrying a high-fidelity polymerase replicates at wild-type levels but generates less genomic diversity (Pfeiffer and Kirkegaard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2005</xref>; Vignuzzi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2006</xref>), which leads to a loss of neurotropism and an attenuated pathogenic phenotype. Importantly, expanding the quasispecies diversity of the high-fidelity virus population by chemical mutagenesis prior to infection restored neurotropism and pathogenesis (Vignuzzi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">2006</xref>). These results indicate that complementation between quasispecies members provides viral populations with a greater capacity to evolve and adapt to new environments and challenges during infection—indicating selection at the population (quasispecies) level rather than on individual mutants. Consequently, viral pathogenesis would be modulated by the proportion of attenuated and virulent genomes, and their interactions. This conclusion challenges the evolutionary biology dogma in which individuals are the ultimate target of selection.
