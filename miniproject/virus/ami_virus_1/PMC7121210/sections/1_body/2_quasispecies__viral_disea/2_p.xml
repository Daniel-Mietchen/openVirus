<p>Similar results have been obtained with chikungunya virus (CHIKV), a mosquito-borne virus that has caused outbreaks in humans since the eighteenth century and that, since 2004, has appeared in Africa, Indian Ocean islands, Southeast Asia, Italy, and France (Powers and Logue 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2007</xref>). Serial passage of CHIKV in ribavirin or fluorouracil resulted in the selection of a mutagen-resistant variant with a single amino acid change (C483Y) in the RNA polymerase gene that increases replication fidelity. This unique arbovirus fidelity variant increases replication fidelity and generates populations with reduced genetic diversity. In mosquitoes, high-fidelity CHIKV produces lower infection and dissemination titers than wild-type. In newborn mice, high-fidelity CHIKV produces truncated viremias and lower organ titers. These results indicate again that increased replication fidelity and reduced genetic diversity negatively impact arbovirus fitness in invertebrate and vertebrate hosts (Coffey et al.
