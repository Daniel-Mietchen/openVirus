<p>The quasispecies concept has provided a framework to understand RNA virus populations and to develop therapeutic strategies that successfully combat deadly virus pandemics (e.g., HIV-AIDS, HCV). The theoretical and experimental development of the quasispecies concept has challenged our view of Darwinian evolution. Dynamic distributions of genomes appear to be subject to genetic variation, competition, and selection, and may be able to serve as therapeutic targets rather than targeting individuals. The challenge remains to determine how the study of quasispecies will improve the development of new antiviral, antibacterial, anticancer, or antiprion strategies.</p>
