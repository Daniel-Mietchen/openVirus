<p>Cancer must be treated with therapies that can overcome mutator or suppressor genotypes, but even the most potent anticancer drugs may fail when administered individually (Luo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>). Highly active anticancer treatments or orthogonal therapy (the equivalent of HAART used in HIV-1 therapy) may be more adequate cancer therapy. Also in a homology to the treatment of HIV-1, sequential administration of anticancer compounds can lead to treatment failure. Concurrent administration of these therapies can increase the threshold of emergence for mutations conferring treatment resistance, i.e., such treatment can increase the number of mutations required to reduce drug activity (Luo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2009</xref>). Orthogonal cancer therapies act synergistically when they attack a cancer in at least two different ways, such that a suppressor mutation against the first therapy cannot suppress the second therapy and vice versa. Because cancer is a compilation of very different diseases, orthogonal therapy will vary depending on tumor genotype and possibly patient genotype; it is also necessary to pay close attention to the treatment effects because cancer therapies, with their DNA-damaging nature, could increase the mutation rate. As an additional parallelism with RNA viruses, lethal mutagenesis has been proposed as a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of solid tumors (Fox and Loeb
