<p>It is now recognized that bacteria very frequently do not exist as solitary cells, but instead as colonial organisms that exploit elaborate systems of intercellular communication to facilitate their adaptation to changing environmental conditions. The social behavior of bacteria resembles the heterogeneity described for RNA virus populations. Social behaviors related to antibiotic production, virulence, motility, or biofilm formation have been extensively described (Rumbaugh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2009</xref>). A good example of bacteria social behavior is the biofilm, which can be simply defined as communities of microorganisms living on surfaces and encased within an extracellular polymeric slime matrix (Costerton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1978</xref>). A more complex definition would incorporate terms such as structural heterogeneity, genetic diversity, and complex community interactions (Stoodley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2002</xref>). These organic super-structures have important clinical implications as infectious agents (Costerton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1987</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>), as well as in terms of antibiotic resistance. The form of antibiotic resistance exhibited by biofilms seems to differ from the innate resistance conferred to individual bacterial cells by plasmids, transposons, and mutations (Costerton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1999</xref>). It has been proposed that biofilm communities, rather than individuals, are the target of evolutionary selection (Caldwell and Costerton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1996</xref>), and that biofilm antibiotic resistance is due to an altered chemical microenvironment or a subpopulation of microorganisms within the biofilm that forms a unique and highly protected, phenotypic state, with cell differentiation similar to that seen in spore formation (Stewart and Costerton 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">2001</xref>). Multiple resistance mechanisms can act together; thus, to be clinically effective, anti-biofilm therapies may have to simultaneously target more than one mechanism, similar to orthogonal cancer therapies or multiple antiretroviral drug approaches.
