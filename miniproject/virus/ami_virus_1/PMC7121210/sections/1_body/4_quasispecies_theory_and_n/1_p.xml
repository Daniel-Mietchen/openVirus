<p>Cancer cells display uncontrolled growth, invasion of adjacent tissues, and sometimes metastasis. To achieve these properties, cells alter their genetic information through DNA point mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and/or epigenetic changes. Mutations in cellular DNA are more frequent in tumor cells, and microsatellite and chromosomal instability have also been associated with cancer. Furthermore, cancer cells may show a mutator phenotype that increases the probability of achieving the most advantageous mutation combination for tumor growth (Bielas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>; Loeb 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2001</xref>). Deamination cell machinery, like APOBEC, has been recently associated with this mutator phenotype (Vartanian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>); it has been hypothesized that recurrent low-level mutation by APOBEC3A could catalyze the transition from a healthy genome to a cancer genome (Suspene et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2011</xref>). Mutations in about 300 genes have been related to cancer (Futreal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>), which are located predominantly in protein kinase domains and in domains of proteins involved in DNA binding and transcriptional regulation (Futreal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>). Other mutations have been described in cancer cells (Futreal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2004</xref>; Greenman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2007</xref>), although a majority could be acting as accompanying mutations. Through the use of high-throughput sequencing technologies (ultra-deep sequencing), it has been discovered that every tumor harbors high-frequency mutations—usually mutations resulting in the gain of function of an oncogene or the loss of a tumor suppressor—accompanied by a complex combination of low-frequency mutations (Chin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>). Mutations are thought to drive the global cancer phenotype, and their characteristics resemble those of viral quasispecies, with the presence of a dominant clone accompanied by a “cloud” of minor forms. There is tremendous complexity and heterogeneity in the pattern of mutations in tumors of different origins.
