<p>Prions are non-genetic macromolecular systems that can also display heterogeneity regarding features that are important to their biological function. Prions are the infectious agents responsible for a variety of neurodegenerative disorders, including scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy in cattle, and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease and kuru in humans. The principal, if not only, component of the prion is PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup>, a β-sheet–rich conformer of the prion protein PrP. PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup> propagates by eliciting conversion of PrP
 <sup>C</sup> (the physiological form of PrP) into a likeness of itself. The seeding hypothesis posits that PrP
 <sup>C</sup> is in equilibrium with PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup> or a PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup> precursor, with the equilibrium largely in favor of PrP
 <sup>C</sup>; PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup> is only stabilized when it forms an aggregate (or seed) containing a critical number of monomers, after which, monomer addition ensues rapidly (Jarrett and Lansbury 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1993</xref>). Prions exist as distinct strains that can be characterized by their incubation time and the neuropathology they elicit in a particular host (Bruce et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1992</xref>). Many different strains can be propagated indefinitely in hosts that are homozygous for the PrP gene; the protein-only hypothesis assumes that each strain is associated with a different conformer of PrP
 <sup>Sc</sup> (Bessen and Marsh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1992</xref>; Peretz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">2001</xref>; Telling et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">1996</xref>). The recent discovery of fungal prions that are not associated with disease suggests that prions may constitute a new and widespread regulatory mechanism maintained through evolution (Jarosz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2010</xref>; Tuite and Serio 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2010</xref>; Tyedmers et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2008</xref>). Similar to viral quasispecies, prions cloned by end-point dilution in cell culture can gradually become heterogeneous by accumulating protein-folding mutants (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>). Importantly, selective pressures have been shown to result in the emergence of variants, including drug-resistant mutants (Ghaemmaghami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2009</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2010</xref>; Mahal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2010</xref>), indicating that not only nucleic acid-based systems can show high population heterogeneity and experience selective events. A protein is defined by a primary structure, but can be folded in different ways, each one associated with a different phenotype that can be selected and further propagated. Prion populations show high population size and conformation heterogeneity; recent results suggest that such heterogeneity may underlie selection and propagation capacity, which is typical Darwinian behavior. It is still largely unknown whether a population of this type evolves as a sum of its components or only as molecular individualities (Straub and Thirumalai 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2011</xref>). Protein conformation is the final result of multiple amino acid-amino acid interactions, which are themselves subjected to molecular fluctuations such as ionization and ionic interaction, or hydrophobic contacts dependent on torsion angles of bonds that are also subjected to thermal fluctuations. Thus, it is not unexpected that a collection of related but non-identical conformations exist in populations of proteins, or that environmental factors may favor some conformations over others. The environment may also dictate the presence of minority conformations at different frequencies. Transitions among related conformation states in prions became apparent because they have the capacity to produce disease. These observations open new prospects for research on the molecular mechanisms of protein aggregation, and whether a specific conformation variant can nucleate the conversion of additional representatives to form mutant aggregates (Bernacki and Murphy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>).
