<p>In 1976, it was proposed that cancer was a complex evolutionary system that showed high heterogeneity and clonal evolution (Nowell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">1976</xref>). This seminal description of cancer as an evolutionary process predicted clonal expansions, individual variations in response to interventions, and therapeutic resistance. Cancer is in fact a complex biological system that evolves through mutations and epigenetic changes, following Darwinian principles of competition and selection. This selection operates in the entire body, at the level of cellular clones that can survive and evade control signals. Some cancer studies have been based in an evolutionary and ecological context (Maley and Forrest 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2000</xref>; Merlo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2006</xref>). Clonal diversity in cancer cells is a factor for predicting progression in an esophageal adenocarcinoma cancer model (Maley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2006</xref>). Theoretical studies have correlated cancer with genetic instability (Gonzalez-Garcia et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2002</xref>; Maley and Forrest 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2000</xref>), with quasispecies models of minimal replicators (Brumer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>; Sole et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">2003</xref>; Tannenbaum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2006</xref>), and even with incursions into error catastrophe (Sole and Deisboeck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2004</xref>). These studies reveal the high genetic heterogeneity of tumor cells as the source of adaptation used by cancer to fight against the immune system, become resistant to different treatments, invade adjacent tissues, and sometimes metastasize and invade other organs. Using mathematical models, it has been proposed that tumors, in contrast to viral quasispecies, benefit from a highly stable component: cancer stem cells (Sole et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2008</xref>). Sole et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2008</xref>) argued that tumors manifest two components; the more variable component exploits phenotypes that allow the tumor to grow and survive, while cancer stem cells exist as a lesser but more robust component and act as a reservoir of stability. This strategy would work as life insurance for a tumor, allowing cancer cell progeny to mutate beyond the limits established for normal cell types.
