<p>RNA viruses are important pathogens of humans, animals, and plants. This group of viruses exhibits rapid evolution and high variability, which have important implications for the control and spread of viral diseases. The high mutation rates of RNA viruses allow them to escape host defenses and therapeutic interventions with antivirals or vaccines. These highly mutable entities can also quickly adapt to new environments and ecological changes, as evidenced by the emergence and reemergence of viral infections from animal reservoirs, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), SARS, influenza, West Nile fever, Ebola, and dengue fever, among others.</p>
