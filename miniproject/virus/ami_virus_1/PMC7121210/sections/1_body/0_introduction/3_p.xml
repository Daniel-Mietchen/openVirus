<p>Experimental work performed by virologists has shown that the classic genetic concepts of wild-type and mutant may not be applicable to molecular viral elements; in particular, the idea of individuality does not relate to single, replicative RNA molecules, but instead must be applied in terms of a “swarm,” “cloud,” or quasispecies (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Virologists currently use the term quasispecies to refer to distributions of non-identical but related genomes that are subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation, competition, and selection; in this concept, the “swarms” or “clouds” of genomes, rather than individual genomes, function as units of selection (Lauring and Andino

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2010</xref>). This means that the evolution of individual viral genomes is decisively influenced by the mutant spectrum surrounding them and that, unavoidably, a group of individuals must be selected. Experimental work has demonstrated that the evolvability of individual viral genomes is constrained by the distribution of its mutational neighbors (Burch and Chao

Due to their high mutation rates, rapid generation time, and short genomes, RNA viruses are an excellent and simple tool for using experimental virology to explore and challenge population genetics and system biology concepts, including fitness variations (Chao
