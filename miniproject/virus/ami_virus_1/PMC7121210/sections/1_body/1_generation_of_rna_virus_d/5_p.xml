<p>HIV recombines at exceedingly high rates (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2002</xref>), approximately one order of magnitude more frequently than in simple gamma retroviruses, such as murine leukemia virus and spleen necrosis virus. The HIV-1 recombination rate has been precisely calculated to be 1.38  ×  10
 <sup>−4</sup> per site and generation (Shriner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2004</xref>); therefore, the recombination rate for HIV-1 is approximately five-fold greater than the point substitution rate of 3.4  ×  10
 <sup>−5</sup> mutations per bp per cycle (Mansky and Temin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1995</xref>). Given the dynamics of HIV-1 turnover in vivo and a recombination rate of approximately three crossovers per cycle, some genome lineages from a 15-year-old infection may have experienced as many crossovers as base mutations in the genome. It has been proposed that recombination coupled with mutation profoundly influences HIV evolution, giving it a non-clonal and transient nature in vivo (Meyerhans et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2003</xref>). One example of the adaptive potential of HIV-1 recombination is the fact that multidrug-resistant HIV-1 variants can exist in cells as defective quasispecies, and can be rescued by superinfection with other defective HIV-1 variants (Quan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2009</xref>). This phenomenon is most likely attributable to recombination during second rounds of infection, and suggests that defective HIV-1 variants may constitute part of the HIV-1 reservoir (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">1991</xref>). Lower recombination rates have been estimated for HCV, with a recombinant frequency normalized to a crossover range of one nucleotide of around 4  ×  10
 <sup>−8</sup> per site per generation (Reiter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2011</xref>). However, due to the rapid virus turnover and the large number of HCV-infected liver cells in vivo, it is expected that recombination will be of biological importance when strong selection pressures are operative (Morel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>).
