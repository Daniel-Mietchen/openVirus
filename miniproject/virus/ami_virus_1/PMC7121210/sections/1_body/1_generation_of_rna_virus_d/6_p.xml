<p>Host cell ssDNA cytidine deaminases (APOBEC3) are another source of HIV diversity. These cytidine deaminases can extinguish HIV-1 infectivity by incorporating into the virus particles; the subsequent cytosine deaminase activity attacks the nascent viral cDNA during reverse transcription, causing lethal mutagenesis. It has been recently demonstrated that APOBEC3G can also induce sublethal mutagenesis, which maintains virus infectivity and contributes to HIV-1 variation (Sadler et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2005</xref>). Although the mutant spectrum resulting from APOBEC3 editing is highly deleterious, a small fraction of lightly APOBEC3G-edited genomes can impact HBV replication in vivo, and possibly contribute to immune escape (Vartanian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2010</xref>). APOBEC3 can also reduce viral infectivity and increase the mutation frequency of negative-strand RNA viruses, such as measles (MV), mumps, and respiratory syncytial virus (Fehrholz et al.
