<p>RNA recombination and reassortment occur at highly variable frequencies in RNA viruses. The frequency of recombination varies in positive single-stranded RNA viruses, occurring at high levels in some groups, but far less frequently in other families such as the Flaviviridae, most notably HCV (Morel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2011</xref>), in which only occasional instances have been reported. Recombination seems to consistently occur less frequently in negative single-stranded RNA viruses, although some of them can still undergo reassortment (e.g., influenza A virus). Recombination occurs frequently in some retroviruses, most notably HIV.
