<p>The restriction factor cellular adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1) catalyzes the conversion of adenosine (A) to inosine (I) on double-stranded RNA substrates (Samuel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2001</xref>), thereby introducing A-to-G mutations; this action inhibits replication of MV, as well as Newcastle disease virus, Sendai virus, and influenza virus (Ward et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2011</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that ADAR1 functions as a host restriction factor of RNA viruses, analogous to the role of APOBEC3. It is possible that the extensive hypermutations of the matrix (M) gene of MV seen in vivo are the result of the known dispensability of the M protein for viral replication (Young and Rall 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2009</xref>), with the M gene sequences representing viral decoy targets for hypermutation. However, hypermutations are also observed to a lesser extent in the fusion (F) and hemagglutinin (H) genes. One serious complication of MV infection is persistent central nervous system infection, known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), that occurs at a frequency of 4â€“11 per 100,000 cases of MV infection. SSPE is a progressive, fatal neurodegenerative disease with the characteristic feature of MV replication in neurons (Griffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). Interestingly, biased hypermutations play a direct role in the pathogenesis of SSPE by facilitating significantly prolonged MV persistence within the CNS, as opposed to mere accumulation. Significant A-to-G substitutions have also been seen in the viral M gene sequences of influenza A virus recovered from wild-type animals (Tenoever et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2007</xref>). This alternative source for generating mutant clouds has the potential to play a role in viral evolution, pathogenesis, immune escape, and drug resistance.
