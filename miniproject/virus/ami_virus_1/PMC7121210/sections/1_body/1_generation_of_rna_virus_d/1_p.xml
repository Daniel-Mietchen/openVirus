<p>Unlike eukaryotic DNA polymerases, RNA viruses lack proofreading activity; thus, the error rate during replication has been estimated at 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 10
 <sup>−5</sup> mutations per nucleotide during each cycle (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) (Domingo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2006</xref>). If one assumes that 10
 <sup>9</sup> to 10
 <sup>12</sup> viral particles are present at any given time in an acutely infected organism, these must be the product of at least 10
 <sup>7</sup> to 10
 <sup>8</sup> replication cycles. Given the length of the RNA virus genome (approximately 10,000 nucleotides), it is likely that every possible single point mutation (10
 <sup>4</sup>) and many double mutations will occur by the time the population reaches the size of many natural virus populations. In contrast, the total number of possible single mutations for a mammalian genome is about 10
 <sup>10</sup>, well above the population size of mammalian species. In RNA viruses, although specific combinations of multiple mutations may be rare, it is clear that the degree of potential genetic change drives their diversification in response to selective pressures of host immune responses or antiviral therapies (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
