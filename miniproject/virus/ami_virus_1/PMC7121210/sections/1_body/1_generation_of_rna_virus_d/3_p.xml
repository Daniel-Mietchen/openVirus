<p>In addition to mutations made by viral polymerases, other mechanisms are implicated in the generation of mutant clouds. RNA recombination and reassortment both create genetic diversity in RNA viruses; these processes are mechanistically different, but both require that two or more viruses infect the same host cell. Recombination can occur in all RNA viruses, irrespective of whether their genomes are composed of single or multiple segments. The process corresponds to the formation of chimeric molecules from parental genomes of mixed origin. A widely accepted model of RNA recombination is “copy choice” recombination (Lai 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1992a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">b</xref>), in which the RNA polymerase in RNA viruses (and reverse transcriptase in retroviruses) switches from one RNA molecule to another during synthesis, while remaining bound to the nascent nucleic acid chain, generating an RNA molecule with mixed ancestry. Reassortment is restricted to viruses that possess segmented genomes, and involves packaging of segments with different ancestry into a single virion. An important example of reassortment occurs in the influenza A virus; reassortment of different gene segments encoding influenza envelope or surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), is associated with evasion of host immunity and sometimes with the occurrence of epidemics (Lindstrom et al.
