<p id="p0075">Since the first outbreak of influenza in 1580, the virus has continued to cause epidemic and pandemic in different geographical places and time scale. It has been observed that following an outbreak influenza virus tend to re-assort with different kinds of genetic modifications resulting in a new strain, which may further cause an epidemic. World Health Organization reports that in the European region, the 2018/19 influenza season is dominated by influenza A virus; co-circulation of both subtypes (H1N1pdm09 and H3N2) however, the past season (2014/15â€“2016/17) was dominated either by influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 or by A(H3N2) [

The re-emergence of influenza virus in every season with some genetic modification or, introduction of a new strain brings about novel antigenic properties in them that may decrease vaccine induced immunity due to mismatch between vaccine and circulating strains. For this reason it is necessary to identify and characterize the novel strain of virus, and modify the vaccine according to the predominating strain to confer maximum protection against influenza infection.
