 <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3</xref>). Influenza type A accounted for 364 (59.3%) cases of infection whereas influenza type B was found in 248 (40.4%) cases. More than half number of patients 313 (51.0%) were found infected with influenza A/H3 strain alone. Among the 248 cases of influenza B infection, 106 isolates were further differentiated into lineage which revealed higher number of viruses from B/Yamagata lineage (11.1%) in comparison to B/Victoria lineage (6.2%). Interestingly, co-infection of influenza B and influenza A/H3 strain was found in two cases during the period of study (
