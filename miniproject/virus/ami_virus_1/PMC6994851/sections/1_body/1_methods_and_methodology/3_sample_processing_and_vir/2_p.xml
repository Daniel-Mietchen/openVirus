<p id="p0035">All the samples collected in viral transport media were aliquoted into two micro-centrifuge tube following collection. One was used for RNA extraction and the other was stored at -70 °C. The identification of influenza virus was carried out by Applied Biosystems™ 7500 Real-Time PCR System using AgPath-ID™ One-step RT-PCR Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). RNA of influenza viruse was extracted using QIAamp® Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer's recommended procedure. The extracted RNA was first tested for the presence of influenza A and B viruses. The sample showing positive for influenza A/B was further differentiated into sub types and lineages. Influenza A positive samples were screened for Pdm A, Pdm H1, A/H3 whereas samples showing influenza B positive were tested for B/Yamagata and B/Victoria lineage. Due to limited number of PCR kit, only 106 influenza B positive samples were processed to identify their lineages. The primers and probes used in the reaction mixture for identification of different types, subtypes and lineages of influenza virus (H1N1, H3N2, H1N1pdm09, Influenza B, B/Victoria, B/Yamagata) were provided by US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the assays were performed following the manufacturer's protocols [
