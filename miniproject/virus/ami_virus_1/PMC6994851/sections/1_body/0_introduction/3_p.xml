<p id="p0015">Influenza virus is a member of the family orthomyxoviridae and it is classified into four genera: influenza A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B are mainly responsible for infection in human and are also the cause of seasonal epidemics [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Influenza C virus causes only mild illness whereas influenza D virus is not known to cause illness in human. Influenza A virus is divided into subtypes based on haemagglutin (H1 – H18) and neuraminidase (N1 – N11) transmembrane glycoproteins. Influenza B virus is divided into two lineages: B/Yamagata and B/Victoria [
