In addition, it was also difficult to conduct study at molecular level due to limitation of resources and poor setting. In this perspective we carried out this study with two central objectives: 1. to determine the seasonal activity of influenza virus in Nepal in year 2016 and, 2. to check whether the recommended vaccine matched the prevailing strain during the season or not.
