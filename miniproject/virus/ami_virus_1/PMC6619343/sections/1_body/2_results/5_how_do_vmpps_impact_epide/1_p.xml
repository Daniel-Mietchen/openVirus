<p>In reality, the population dynamics of winged and wingless aphids are concurrent: crowding stimulates production of the winged form (Braendle et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>, Irwin et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). When populations are composed of winged and wingless individuals, we use simulations to extend our key findings. The distinction in aphid form in mixed populations allows us to introduce a new epidemiological measure: the level of inoculum released by the local population of host plants, i.e., number of virus‐bearing winged aphids that emigrate away from the local host population (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C; glossary of specialist terms in Box 1). By leading to higher aphid density on infected plants, retention is associated with greater production of winged aphids (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>A). By leading to lower aphid density on infected plants, deterrence is associated with lower production of winged aphids. The incidence of virus‐infected plants and the likelihood of acquiring the virus during probes combines together with the population size of winged aphids to determine the amount of inoculum released (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). Therefore, the cumulative number of winged aphids bearing NPT virus emigrating over the season (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C) is maximal for intermediate levels of aphid retention on infected plants. The blue dashed line represents, as a baseline, the case where the vector population is already endemic when the virus invades. It confirms the robustness of our results to assumptions regarding vector endemicity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).
