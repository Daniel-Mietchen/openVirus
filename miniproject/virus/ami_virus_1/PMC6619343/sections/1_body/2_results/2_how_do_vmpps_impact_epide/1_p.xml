<p>When epidemiological dynamics are taken into account the epidemic is described by an equation for the incidence of virus‐infected plants, Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref>. Assuming that 
 <italic>A</italic> is constant makes the analysis comparable to previous studies (McElhany et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>, Sisterson 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). In Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> full disease progress curves are shown, and compared with epidemic trajectories from event‐based stochastic simulations, for several representative values of plant acceptability, ε (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>A), and several representative values of plant attractiveness, ν (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>B). This illustrates the effect of these VMPPs, and confirms the accuracy of the deterministic solution (dashed curves from the mathematical solution vs. red curve for median stochastic trajectory). The epidemic is additionally summarized in Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>A in terms of initial epidemic growth rate, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> (
 <italic>x</italic>‐axis, calculated according to Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0003" ref-type="disp-formula">(3)</xref>) and final incidence (
 <italic>y</italic>‐axis; solution of Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> = 0) for a range of VMPP combinations (separate curves for values of plant attractiveness, ν, with a range of plant acceptability, ε, values within each curve). For instance, comparison of disease progress for a no‐VMPP virus and an attract and deter virus verifies that increased transmission (cf. Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>) is reflected in rapid early epidemic growth and higher final incidence.
