<p>Assuming 
 <italic>A</italic> varies at a dynamic equilibrium, instead of being a constant background population size, goes beyond existing studies as a setting for studying NPT virus epidemics (i.e., we explicitly model aphid population dynamics). This case is analyzed by solving Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> with steady‐state 
 <italic>A</italic>*(
 <italic>i</italic>) (itself the solution of Eqs. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0006" ref-type="disp-formula">(6)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0007" ref-type="disp-formula">(7)</xref> = 0). Crucially, if 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0 the results are identical to when the aphid population size is assumed to be constant (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B with A). However, when 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0, the effects of VMPPs on epidemics are driven by their impacts on vector population size (cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C, F), and the result is that too much deterrence reduces final incidence (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C). Taken together, these results indicate a major cost to deterrence strategies. Although they increase the likelihood that aphids will acquire an NPT virus during superficial probes, too much deterrence is ultimately self‐limiting for the spread of infection because it depletes vector population size.
