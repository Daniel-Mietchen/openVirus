<p>Because in nature aphid populations are dynamic (i.e., not constant but continually changing; Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> with 
 <italic>A</italic> = 
 <italic>A</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>)), a key question is how VMPPs influence aphid density. Analysis of aphid population size, once the epidemic has spread, i.e., solving Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0006" ref-type="disp-formula">(6)</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0007" ref-type="disp-formula">(7)</xref> with steady‐state 
 <italic>i</italic> (itself the solution of Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> = 0), shows that overall population size is highly sensitive to retention (ε &gt; 1) vs. deterrence (ε &lt; 1) if 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, F, cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). This sensitivity is seen when 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0 but not when 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0. When 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0 (no risk of aphid loss per flight) the aphid population size is approximately constant irrespective of the level of plant acceptability VMPP, ε, and matches the value of 
 <italic>A</italic> from the constant aphid background case (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>E, cf. Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>D). However, the scenario of 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0 is highly unrealistic, as it implies 100% escape from risks associated with movement such as rain, or exposure to wind, which can lead to dramatic displacement (Irwin et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Therefore, too much deterrence depletes the vector population size. This novel finding emphasizes that VMPPs impact vector density, which drives our results. In contrast, we find that attraction (ν &gt; 1) vs. repulsion (ν &lt; 1) does not significantly alter final aphid population size.
