<p>The fundamental benefits of VMPPs conditioning plant attractiveness and plant acceptability for transmission can be seen by examining Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref>, mean transmissions per dispersal. Eq. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0001" ref-type="disp-formula">(1)</xref> can be interpreted as the likelihood of acquisition and inoculation (numerator) scaled by the number of plants visited (1/denominator). Attraction toward infected plants (ν &gt; 1) increases the numerator, and therefore increases the mean number of transmissions, for low 
 <italic>i</italic>, but decreases it for high 
 <italic>i</italic>. Deterrence of feeding after probing (ε &lt; 1) increases the numerator and increases the expected number of plants visited (1/denominator), therefore increasing mean transmissions for any value of 
 <italic>i</italic> (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>: Fig. S1). These patterns are the basis of suggestions that a virus inducing attraction and deterrence, i.e., attract‐and‐deter (Table

 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) will undergo more frequent transmission than a virus that induces no change in plant phenotype (McElhany et al.
