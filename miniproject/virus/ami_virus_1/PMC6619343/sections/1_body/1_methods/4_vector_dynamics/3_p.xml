<p>Hence we take 
 <italic>A</italic> at its dynamic attractor, i.e., 
 <italic>A</italic>*(
 <italic>i</italic>), as the epidemic, 
 <italic>i</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>), spreads. The assumption that vector density on individual plants reaches a steady‐state faster than the spread of infection among plants implies a separation of timescales for vector and infection dynamics, and that the vector is already endemic when the virus invades. Throughout, all analyses are supported with event‐based stochastic simulation, described in full in Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>, which does not make any assumption of separate timescales. In addition, the assumption that the virus invades an environment where the vector is endemic is relaxed in the following section using event‐based stochastic simulation.
