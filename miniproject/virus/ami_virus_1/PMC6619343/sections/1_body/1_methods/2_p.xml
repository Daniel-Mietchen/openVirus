<p>In the remainder of this section we outline the technical details required for our modeling. In outline this consists of deriving several quantities from the Markov chain in Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B. First, we show that the Markov chain leads to an expression for the expected number of transmissions per aphid dispersal and hence to an equation for disease progress (

Second, we show how the Markov chain leads to expressions for the probabilities that dispersing aphids settle on different types of plants (i.e., healthy vs. virus infected) and hence to equations for vector density (
