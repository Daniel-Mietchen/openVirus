<p>More generally, the Markov chains in Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>B are extended to incorporate loss of aphids through emigration/mortality as well as imperfect acquisition and inoculation. We define loss of aphids through emigration/mortality as a constant probability of aphid loss per flight between plants, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0. We define imperfect acquisition and inoculation as a constant probability of virus acquisition when virus‐free aphids probe infected plants (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>acq</sub> &gt; 0), and a constant probability of virus inoculation when virus‐bearing aphids probe healthy plants (
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>inoc</sub> &gt; 0), respectively. Equations in the main text assume 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0, 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>acq</sub> = 1, and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>inoc</sub> = 1 for simplicity of presentation, but the extension of these calculations to 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ 0, 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>acq</sub> ≤ 1, and 
 <italic>P</italic>
 <sub>inoc</sub> ≤ 1 (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>) are used to produce the results in this paper.
