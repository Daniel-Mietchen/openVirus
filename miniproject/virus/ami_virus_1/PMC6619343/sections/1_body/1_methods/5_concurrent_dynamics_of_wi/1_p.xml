<p>A key feature of natural aphid populations is that individuals can be either winged or wingless, with winged aphids developing under crowding and with wingless the norm at low aphid density (Braendle et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>). Furthermore, whereas in some situations viruses invade environments with endemic vector populations, in other situations virus and aphid invasion may occur simultaneously. To test our results with these more realistic factors we extend our event‐based stochastic simulation so that winged aphids can disperse to any host plant, but wingless aphids move only between neighboring plants. By assuming that the probability that offspring develop to be winged is a sigmoidal, increasing function of on‐plant aphid density, we allow for concurrent dynamics of winged and wingless aphids. By varying the delay between the initial immigration of a single winged aphid (which initially produces only wingless offspring at low density) and virus invasion, we contrast results from two important invasion scenarios. At one extreme, virus invasion occurs when the vector is endemic (i.e., large delay between winged aphid immigration and virus invasion), at the other extreme, vector and virus invasion coincide (i.e., no delay between winged aphid immigration and virus invasion). The spatial nature of the stochastic simulations captures spatial correlations in the incidence of virus infection. These correlations may additionally influence the impacts of VMPPs.
