<p>Aphids vector the majority of arthropod‐transmitted plant viruses and about 30% of known plant viruses (Gray and Banerjee

 <xref rid="ecy2725-blkfxd-0001" ref-type="boxed-text">1</xref>). However, most aphid‐transmitted viruses do not circulate internally and cannot infect the insect. Instead, virus particles attach loosely to the insect's piercing mouthparts (stylets), a form of vectoring called nonpersistent transmission (Gray and Banerjee

 <xref rid="ecy2725-blkfxd-0001" ref-type="boxed-text">1</xref>). The aphid–NPT virus interaction is ephemeral, and virus particles are rapidly flushed out of the stylet channel when aphids salivate into plant epidermal cells (Powell

 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Virus acquisition is most efficient when aphids briefly sample the virus‐laden cells of an infected plant's epidermis in exploratory probes and then disperse quickly to another host, having rejected the plant as unpalatable (Powell

 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Conversely, prolonged feeding from phloem tissue of the virus is thought to hinder the spread of NPT virus (Mauck

 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). Hence, the epidemiology of NPT viruses, and as such the epidemiology of diverse virus species infecting a wide range of host plants, is intimately related to the behavior of their aphid vectors (initial surface probes vs. deeper feeding) as they move among potential host plants.
