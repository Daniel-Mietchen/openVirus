<p>To understand the impacts of VMPPs on virus epidemics, we developed a mathematical model that links virus‐induced effects on aphid–plant interactions to aphid behavior. We achieve this by explicitly modeling aphid ‘feeding dispersals’. In this context, a feeding dispersal is defined as the departure of an aphid from a no‐longer desirable plant and its relocation, ultimately with feeding, to a new host plant (Irwin et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Box 1). Therefore, although feeding dispersal ends with phloem feeding on a new host plant, the preceding period may involve alighting on, probing of, and rejection of several plants. Distinguishing among key components of aphid behavior (i.e., aphids probe epidermal cells prior to feeding on phloem) and life history (i.e., aphid offspring develop to be either winged or wingless in response to local density) is essential to understand the epidemiological dynamics. To date, models for virus transmission ignore vector form (winged vs. wingless) and probing/feeding behavior. For instance, in a range of plant virus modeling studies (McElhany et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>, Jeger et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">1998</xref>, Sisterson 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>, Shaw et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>), the central property of NPT, that acquisition occurs when aphids sample epidermal cells of host plants, is omitted because of a focus either on generic or persistently transmitted plant viruses.
