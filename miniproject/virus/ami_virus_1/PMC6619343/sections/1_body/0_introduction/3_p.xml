<p>Nonpersistently transmitted viruses can also induce VMPPs that enhance the acceptability of hosts to aphids, i.e., promote the opposite extreme of 
 <italic>plant acceptability</italic> VMPP rather than deter (Table 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). This type of manipulation is caused by inhibiting synthesis of distasteful substances and/or by increasing nutrient content in virus‐infected plants. Such effects, which can enhance aphid performance, were seen in CMV‐infected tobacco and in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> infected by turnip mosaic virus (Ziebell et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>, Casteel et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0007" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>). Because this form of VMPP would encourage aphids to settle for prolonged feeding on infected plants, it is thought to inhibit transmission of NPT viruses (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). It has also been proposed that VMPPs that encourage aphid settling occur when NPT viruses and their hosts are poorly adapted to each other (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>).
