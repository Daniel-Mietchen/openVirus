<p>In this paper we model the infection process as a by‐product of aphid probing of plants during feeding dispersals rather than as frequency‐dependent contacts between susceptible hosts and infected vectors. Because natural aphid populations comprise both winged and wingless individuals, we conclude by contrasting the effects of VMPPs on virus transmission and epidemic dynamics when the dispersing aphids are both winged and wingless. Thus, aphid behavior and disease progress are linked to aphid development, in particular to the production of nonwinged or winged forms (Braendle et al.
