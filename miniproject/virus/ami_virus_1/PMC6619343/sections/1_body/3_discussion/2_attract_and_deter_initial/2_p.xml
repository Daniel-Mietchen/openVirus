<p>We have established a modeling framework that distinguishes aphid probing of epidermal cells (which promotes viral acquisition and inoculation) from prolonged phloem feeding (which prevents viral acquisition and inoculation). When we assumed a constant population size of aphids that can move anywhere in the population of plants to most closely match previous studies (McElhany et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>, Sisterson 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0031" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>), our results support previous suggestions (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, Westwood et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, Carmo‐Sousa et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>) that attract and deter enhances virus transmission. However, if we instead allowed for the aphid population size to be dynamic, previous published conclusions are only supported under certain restricted conditions. Specifically, if 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0, i.e., 100% of aphid movement between plants escapes emigration or dispersal mortality. But 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0 is a highly unrealistic assumption, as aphids are exposed to risks associated with movement, including increased mortality and long‐distance dispersal (Irwin et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). If 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0, VMPPs impact aphid population dynamics as the virus spreads among plants and previous conclusions are no longer supported. Thus, an important and novel finding is that induction by a virus of deterrence to settling is ultimately self‐limiting under this feedback, because it leads to a decrease in the vector population size.
