<p>What we term attract and deter (Table 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>) is a combination of VMPPs causing infected plants to become more attractive to aphids but inhospitable to settling. This VMPP combination has been seen in several plant–virus interactions and has been proposed to be a manipulative adaptation that viruses utilize to enhance their own transmission by aphids (Mauck et al.

 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, there are examples where NPT viruses induce a hospitable state in the host and where the performance (growth, reproduction) of aphids placed on virus‐infected plants is enhanced (Boquel et al.
