<p>These results are based on the assumption of a constant background density of aphids. But it is overly simplistic to assume that aphid population size is constant over time. Moreover, changes in aphid behavior because of VMPPs must impact aphid population size in some way. Therefore, in addition to disease progress, we modeled aphid population dynamics and, to the best of our knowledge, the results that emerged are entirely novel. We found that plant acceptability VMPPs influence vector density when movement between plants is not completely free from the risks of dispersal or mortality (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>F, 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0). The consequences of this for conventional interpretations is seen in Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>: there is no change to VMPP impacts when virus invades steady‐state aphid populations if 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0, compared with when aphid density is constant (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>B with A). However, VMPP impacts are changed substantially when 
 <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0 (compare Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>C with A). In particular, for the first time we show that deterrence comes at the cost of lower aphid density and that for this reason enhanced spread of the virus because of deterrence is ultimately self‐limiting.
