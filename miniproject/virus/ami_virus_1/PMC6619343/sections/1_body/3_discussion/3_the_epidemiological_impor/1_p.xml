<p>The other extreme of plant acceptability VMPPs is retain (Table 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which has the opposite effect to attract and deter by encouraging aphid population growth through settling. Retention is likely to foster aphid reproduction and survival on virus‐infected plants, but it is thought not likely to enhance NPT, based on current ideas (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, Westwood et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, Carmo‐Sousa et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). Importantly, however, a retain VMPP is likely to encourage increased birth of winged aphids. In nature, wingless is the norm when density is low, but local aphid crowding leads to increased tactile contact between individuals, stimulating birth of winged aphids (Braendle et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">2006</xref>, Irwin et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Hence, we extended our framework to distinguish between local transmission (facilitated by wingless aphids) and longer‐distance virus transmission (facilitated by winged aphids). We found that the transient population dynamics of aphids are characterized by rapid increase in numbers of wingless aphids followed by an increase in winged aphids (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref>: Fig. S1). The changing balance between winged and wingless aphid densities is critical for virus epidemics for two reasons: (1) it results in distinct movement scales, and (2) in combination with disease progress and the incidence of virus infection in plants, it determines the rate of emigration of virus‐bearing winged aphids. An important new finding is that aphid population size, and the proportion of aphids that are winged, are highly sensitive to VMPPs affecting plant acceptability. Therefore, inoculum release (i.e., export of virus bearing aphids to different fields) is also sensitive to VMPPs affecting plant acceptability. In particular, when virus‐infected plants deter feeding, substantially less inoculum is released from local host plant populations than when viruses have no effect on plant phenotypes (Fig. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>C). In addition, inoculum released is maximal for intermediate values of a retention strategy. This introduces a major new dimension to the costs of deterrence at a previously unstudied scale and, conversely, introduces an important benefit for transmission arising from VMPPs causing retention. Indirect support for this comes from experiments showing that higher aphid (
 <italic>Aphis gossypii</italic>) densities with relatively higher production of the winged form occurred on zucchini plants infected with zucchini yellow mosaic virus (an aphid transmitted NPT plant virus) than on uninoculated plants (Blua and Perring 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0001" ref-type="ref">1992</xref>).
