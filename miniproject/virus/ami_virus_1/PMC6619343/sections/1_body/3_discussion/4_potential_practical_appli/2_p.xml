<p>It is possible to adapt our modeling approach to determine how crop plants, with different degrees of attractiveness to vectors, could be arranged so as to disrupt transmission dynamics. For example, encouraging virus‐bearing aphids to alight preferentially on decoy plants or virus‐resistant hosts would be expected to reduce the transmission of NPT virus. Accordingly, in an “attract‐to‐contain” intercropping system (see Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>: Fig. S1), an agronomically desirable susceptible variety of the host plant would be intercropped with a variety that attracts aphids and carries major gene resistance to the NPT virus. Modeling could contribute to understanding the effectiveness of such systems, and to refining their deployment. For example, the proportion of attractive, resistant plants required to have a significant effect in reducing NPT epidemic spread can be estimated using the framework introduced in this paper (Appendix 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-sup-0009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9</xref>: Fig. S1). These ideas for inhibiting aphid‐mediated virus transmission borrow heavily from the highly successful “push‐pull” approach in which intercropping with insect‐attracting decoy plants has been used to inhibit spread of lepidopteran pests (Khan and Pickett
