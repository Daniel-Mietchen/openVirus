<p>A potential practical use for the insights gained from the model introduced in this paper is to devise new ways of decreasing crop losses by disrupting NPT. Current aphid control methods such as insecticide application are limited in their ability to prevent NPT. In large part this is because inoculation occurs very rapidly for nonpersistently transmitted viruses and before an insecticide can take effect on the vector (Hull

Some insecticides, notably the neonicotinoids, have been successfully used to inhibit aphid‐mediated virus transmission, particularly of PT viruses. The long‐term utility of such chemicals is curtailed by restricted use because of environmental concerns over toxicity (Godfray et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). There is also a high risk of evolution of insecticide resistance in aphid populations (Westwood and Stevens
