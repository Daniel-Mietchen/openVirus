<p>Ideas that NPT viruses modify plant phenotypes to increase virus transmission have become increasingly influential in discussions of virus–plant–aphid interactions (Mauck et al.

 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). Although VMPPs influence aphid behavior under experimental conditions, these phenomena have been largely ignored in epidemiological analyses (cf. Cunniffe et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2015</xref>, challenge 8) despite a few exceptions (see, e.g., McElhany et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>, Daugherty et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>, Shaw et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). However, it is not yet certain that VMPPs are genuine manipulative adaptations (sometimes referred to anthropomorphically as viral strategies) or incidental by‐products of infection (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>, Groen et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>, Carr et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2018</xref>). On the assumption that VMPPs can arise as the result of host virus coadaptation it has been suggested that if a VMPP conditions settling of aphids on an infected plant, this inhibits NPT, and indicates that the virus and host are poorly adapted to each other (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). In contrast, because deterrence against settling is thought to enhance NPT, it has been conjectured that when viruses engender VMPPs conditioning ‘deter’ or ‘attract and deter’ (see next section), this means that a host and virus are coadapted (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2016</xref>). Our analysis does support the idea that VMPPs that first attract and subsequently deter aphids from infected plants initially increase transmission (Mauck et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>, Westwood et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">2013</xref>, Carmo‐Sousa et al. 
 <xref rid="ecy2725-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2014</xref>). However, our analyses predict that the enhancement of initial transmission would be self‐limiting. Perhaps most importantly, we found that VMPPs that promote aphid settling, and hence reproduction (which requires aphids to be settled on host plants), lead to increased development of winged aphids, and do not inhibit NPT but, rather, are more likely to cause longer‐range virus transmission and trigger larger‐scale epidemics.
