<p>We analyzed in detail the effects on NPT of the searching behavior of aphids during feeding dispersals, the role of vector dynamics (including the crowding‐induced developmental transition of wingless to winged aphids), and the influence of VMPPs. The analyses support an established hypothesis that NPT is accelerated if virus infection alters a host so that it becomes more attractive to aphids, while also stimulating it to accumulate compounds that deter aphid settling (the attract and deter VMPP; Carmo‐Sousa et al.

Importantly, however, VMPPs that deter settling put aphids at risk of being lost to the local host population (e.g., wind‐borne long‐distance movement, failure to locate another host, mortality associated with rain and wind) and do not encourage feeding and reproduction, for which settling on a host plant is required. Thus, virus transmission stimulated by attract and deter VMPPs leads to decreased aphid density and is ultimately self‐limiting. The second, potentially highly significant, outcome of the analysis refutes previous conjectures that retentive VMPPs (i.e., those that foster aphid settling) inhibit NPT. Rather, a retain VMPP may be highly efficient in launching epidemics through longer‐range virus transmission by virus‐bearing winged aphids. If attract and deter and retain are indeed the results of authentic viral manipulative adaptations or strategies, we think it plausible that both have roles to play in enhancing NPT virus transmission and epidemic development, but at distinct spatial scales.
