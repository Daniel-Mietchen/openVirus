  <p>Comparison of epidemic trajectories for different VMPP combinations. (A) Trajectories are shown for contrasting values of plant acceptability VMPP, ε. Aphids have no preference between alighting on healthy and infected plants (i.e., no effect of virus infection on plant attractiveness, ν = 1). (B) Trajectories are shown for contrasting values of plant attractiveness VMPP, ν. Aphids accept healthy and infected plants with the same probability (i.e., no effect of infection on plant acceptability, ε = 1). In (A) and (B) black dashed curves represent solutions of the mathematical model (i.e., Eq. 
   <xref rid="ecy2725-disp-0002" ref-type="disp-formula">(2)</xref> was solved numerically using MATLAB version 2018a ode45 solver). Red curves represent median of event‐based simulations throughout. Therefore, both results of the mathematical model and the event‐based simulation model are presented in (A) and (B). Intervals representing the 95% percentiles are shown, for simplicity, only for ε = 1 (A) and ν = 1 (B), in both cases for several representative time points. (A) and (B) were generated with
