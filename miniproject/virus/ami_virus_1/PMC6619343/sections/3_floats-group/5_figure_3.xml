  <p>Incorporating feedback of VMPPs to vector density alters established conclusions about VMPPs. (A)–(C) show the benefits of VMPPs to NPT virus epidemics, as summarized by 
   <italic>R</italic>
   <sub>0</sub> and final incidence. (D)–(F) show the corresponding effects on vector population size. Results are contrasted across a range of assumptions relating to population dynamics of the vector. (A, D) Assuming a constant background population of aphids as is consistent with previous studies. (B, E Assuming an equilibrium background population of aphids (when virus invades) with no risk of aphid loss associated with movement between plants (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0). (C, F) Assuming an equilibrium background population of aphids (when virus invades) where there is risk of aphid loss associated with movement between plants (
   <italic>p</italic> = 0.2). In (A)–(F) there are three curves for plant attractiveness VMPP representing attract, no modification, and repel. Each curve is composed of varying plant acceptability VMPP from ε = 1/4 to ε = 4; see color bar. In (A)–(C)
