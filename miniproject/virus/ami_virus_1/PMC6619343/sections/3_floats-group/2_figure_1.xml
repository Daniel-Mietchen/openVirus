  <p>Aphid feeding dispersals where aphid feeding behavior is influenced by virally modified plant phenotypes (VMPP) of plant attractiveness (red cross) and plant acceptability (red tick). (A) Feeding dispersal is a sequence of trials involving exploratory probing of host plants by aphids where virus is potentially acquired from an infected plant and subsequently inoculated into a susceptible plant. (B) Markov chain model for virus transmission during individual feeding dispersals of aphid vectors in a population of infected (
   <italic>I</italic>) and susceptible (
   <italic>S</italic>) plants.
