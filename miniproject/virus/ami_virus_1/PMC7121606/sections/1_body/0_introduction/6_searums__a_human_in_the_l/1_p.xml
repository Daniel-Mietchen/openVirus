<p>Realizing the advantages of simulation-based epidemiological analysis requires the use of an effective software environment for Eco-modeling,HITL bio-simulation, and analysis (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007a</xref>). In addition, the software environment must facilitate rapid simulation to minimize analysis time frames. We also envision the software must be portable and accessible to enable its widespread use (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2007a</xref>). Accordingly, we have endeavored to design and develop an Eco-modeling and bio-simulation software environment called SEARUMS.
