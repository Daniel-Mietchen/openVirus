<p>Currently, SEARUMS is geared for analyzing the global epidemiology of avian influenza, with migrating waterfowl as the primary vectors for intercontinental spread of the disease. However, the methodology is sufficiently generic and can be easily adapted for other diseases. Accordingly, this chapter elucidates the modeling, HITL-simulation, and software design principles underlying SEARUMS so that the concepts can be readily adapted and applied to other diseases as well. Furthermore, SEARUMS is envisioned to serve as a global, multi-disciplinary environment that seamlessly integrates knowledge from various fields so that epidemiologists, economists, and disease control centers can collaboratively use it to combat global epidemics.</p>
