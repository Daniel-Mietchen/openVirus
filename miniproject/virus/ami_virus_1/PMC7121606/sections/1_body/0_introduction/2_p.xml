<p>The aforementioned epidemiological, antigenic, and socio-political traits of communicable diseases are salient characteristics of several recent global epidemics, such as: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Hufnagel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>), avian influenza (H5N1) outbreaks (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2006</xref>), and swine flu (H1N1) outbreak (Garten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2009</xref>; Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2009</xref>). Such emergent viral epidemics cause significant morbidity and mortality, both in humans and livestock (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>; WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). For example, human influenza-A viruses causes more than 500,000 moralities in humans annually (Russell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>). Its highly pathogenic avian homologe, namely H5N1, has caused economic devastation, particularly to poultry farming, in excess of 10 billion dollars (Kilpatrick et al.
