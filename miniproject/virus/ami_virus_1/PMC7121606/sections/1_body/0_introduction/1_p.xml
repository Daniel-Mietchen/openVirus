<p>Communicable and vector-borne diseases, primarily induced by viral and bacterial infections, are the most common forms of ailments amongst humans and domesticated farm animals (Flint et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). Despite numerous advances in epidemiology and medicine many of these diseases, particularly zoonotic diseases, continue to defy human efforts to treat and control them (Flint et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2004</xref>). The source of such resistance to treatment and control is twofold. First, the incessant evolutionary processes such as genetic reassortment, recombination, and mutation induce changes to organisms, thereby constantly morphing their antigenic characteristics (Russell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2008</xref>). Second, the vectors of the diseases, such as birds and animals, often disperse the pathogens over wide areas (Hagemeijer and Mundkur 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>; Normile 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2006</xref>). The scenario is further convoluted due to complicated symbiotic processes between the vectors and other organisms including humans. Rapid changes in phylogeny and bio-diversity pose significant challenges in vaccine manufacturing (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2007a</xref>). In addition, socio-political restrictions and technological limitations further magnify the challenges involved in controlling intercontinental spread of infectious diseases (WHO
