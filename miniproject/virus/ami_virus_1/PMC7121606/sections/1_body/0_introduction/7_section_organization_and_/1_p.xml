<p>The principles underlying the Eco-modeling and HITL bio-simulation infrastructure of SEARUMS span a broad range of disciplines, including: mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, computer science, and software engineering. Furthermore, the multi-disciplinary nature of SEARUMS garners interest from a broad range of audience, including: epidemiologists, economists, software architects, and disease control centers. Consequently, the various sections in this chapter are organized to emphasize a specific aspect of SEARUMS. The objective of this organization is to enable readers from a particular discipline to focus on pertinent topics. Accordingly, common concepts that are pervasive across the various sections are discussed as the background information in 
 <xref rid="Sec6" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.2</xref>. This section also reviews some of the pertinent related research investigations. 
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Section 8.3</xref> discusses the software architecture and design principles underlying SEARUMS. The procedure used for modeling, incorporation of real-world statistical data, and analysis using SEARUMS is presented in 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.4</xref>. Results from some of the analysis conducted using SEARUMS are summarized in 
 <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.5</xref>. 
 <xref rid="Sec16" ref-type="sec">SectionÂ 8.6</xref> concludes the chapter while emphasizing the utility and broader applicability of the HITL-simulations infrastructure of SEARUMS to other diseases.
