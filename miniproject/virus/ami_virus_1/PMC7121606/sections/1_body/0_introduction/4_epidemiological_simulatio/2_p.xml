<p>A fundamental and widely used framework underlying epidemiological analysis is compartmentalized model of communicable diseases (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>; Daley and Gani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). In a compartmentalized model, the sub-population that are in the same epidemic state are partitioned into non-intersecting sets called compartments (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>; Daley and Gani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). The temporal progress of an epidemic is modeled by transitioning a suitable fraction of the population from one compartment to another (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>; Daley and Gani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). The transition functions are typically modeled as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with time as the independent variable. Constants in the ODEs are determined based on characteristics of the disease being analyzed. A more detailed description of the compartmentalized models is presented in
