<p>The technological, macro-economic, and socio-political issues surrounding emergent, viral and communicable diseases (discussed in 
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.1</xref>) have led to a rapidly growing emphasis on analyzing the global epidemiology of diseases. Epidemiology broadly covers the study of various facets of communicable diseases in a selected population, including: transmission characteristics of diseases, epidemic and endemic states, environmental factors impacting disease transmission, and impacts of containment and prophylactic interventions (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>). Epidemiology is a multidisciplinary method involving biology, biostatistics, geographic information science, social science, and computer science (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>; Daley and Gani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). It has steadily evolved from its inception in early nineteenth century and is now a mainstream methodology that forms the corner stone for public health measures and preventive medicine (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>). Epidemiological analysis enables more accurate forecasting of epidemics and aids improving efficacy of geographically targeted antiviral prophylaxis (Epstein

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>; Longini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). Nevertheless, epidemiology is an active area of research as it continues to evolve in conjunction with breakthroughs in other disciples, such as: microbiology, genetics, proteomics, and meta-genomics (Rao et al.
