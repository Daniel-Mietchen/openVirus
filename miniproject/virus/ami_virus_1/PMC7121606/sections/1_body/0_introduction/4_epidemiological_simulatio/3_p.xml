<p>Analysis of compartmentalized epidemiological models is performed by simultaneously solving the ODEs at different time steps to obtain characteristics of the epidemic being studied (Anderson and May

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). One of the most powerful and widely used approaches for such an analysis is computer-based simulation. Simulations have gained significant importance epidemiology because they are the only practical approach to analyze large and complex epidemiological models (Epstein

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). Furthermore, the need to conduct a variety of multi-faceted analysis within short time frames necessitates the use of computer-based simulations. Moreover, simulation is a cost effective and non-destructive methodology from which results can be easily displayed in an intuitive form. More importantly, it enables effective explorations of policies and procedures associated with complicated control measures, such as: targeted layered containment [the main concept behind US governmentâ€™s containment strategies (Halloran et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>)], quarantine, social distancing, school closing, and targeted antiviral prophylaxis (Epstein
