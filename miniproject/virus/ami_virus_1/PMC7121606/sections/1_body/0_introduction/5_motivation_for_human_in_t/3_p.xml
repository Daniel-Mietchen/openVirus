<p>One of the important prerequisites of simulating selected scenarios is to have the model in a state that accurately reflects the conditions associated with the scenario. One strategy is to seed the simulation, i.e., manually initialize the state to appropriately model the scenario being analyzed. However, such an approach is typically tedious, cumbersome, and error prone. Moreover, in stochastic models, accurately capturing temporal, causal relationships (Lamport

These issues often lead to conspicuous inefficiencies when multiple scenarios have to be analyzed. An alternative approach is to commence simulations in a given, verified initial state and then steer the simulations to desired scenarios of interest. Strategies for steering simulations can be broadly classified into three main categories, namely: automatic, semi-automatic, and manual steering. Note that this taxonomy is based on the degree of human involvement in the steering process.
