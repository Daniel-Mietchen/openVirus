<p>The complex, stochastic nature of global epidemiological models necessitates the use of manual steering. Manual steering of a simulation requires a human-in-the-loop (HITL) to intermittently modify the state of the simulation; thereby altering its trajectory to the desired scenario. Such HITL epidemiological bio-simulations enable efficient generation of various scenarios to be analyzed. In addition, this approach preserves the causal inter-dependencies in a stochastic model. Moreover, simulating from a validated initial state minimizes modeling errors and reduces continued verification efforts. Last but not the least, HITL steering enables some degree of adaptation and modeling of unplanned or unanticipated scenarios that could occur in emergent epidemics. Consequently, HITL-simulations hold significant potential to play a vital role in epidemiology and in establishing pertinent public policies.</p>
