<p>Typically, only a selected subset of scenarios is analyzed to evaluate effectiveness of a candidate set of containment strategies (Ferguson et al.

Narrowing the subset of scenarios to be analyzed is critical because hundreds of thousands of simulation runs are needed even to analyze a specific subset of scenarios. The numerous runs are necessary to provide sufficiently accurate and statistically significant results using realistic, stochastic models (Epstein
