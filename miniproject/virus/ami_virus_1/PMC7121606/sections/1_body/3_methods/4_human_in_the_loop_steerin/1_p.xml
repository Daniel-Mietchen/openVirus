<p>The first step in our study was to calibrate the model to ensure that it provides a sufficiently accurate representation of real-world epidemiology. The calibration was performed injunction with verification and validation of the model. We verified the accuracy and fidelity of the aforementioned Eco-description by performing extensive HITL-simulations with initial source of infection set to outbreak in Indonesia, a notable epicenter of H5N1 epidemics (WHO

The Eco-description was interactively calibrated by suitably tuning the following attributes: start date for simulation, initial infection percentage, intra-flock disease spread rate, and inter-flock transmission mechanism. Note that we calibrated only the attributes that were indirectly derived from published statistics. We established validity of the Eco-description and SEARUMS by confirming that the timing and chronology of several outbreaks observed in the simulations correlate with the significant real-world incidents reported (WHO
