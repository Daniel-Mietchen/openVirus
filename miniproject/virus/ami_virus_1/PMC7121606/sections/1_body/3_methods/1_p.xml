<p>In our current research, we have drawn inferences and conclusions from a variety of case studies conducted using a calibrated Eco-description. First an initial Eco-description was developed via SEARUMS using the modeling methodology described in 
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.3</xref>. Table

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>), used to develop the Eco-description. The migratory flyways of the waterfowl and their population have been collated from data published by various organizations (CDC

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2006c</xref>). For modeling and simulation purposes the dates for migration were approximated to the middle of the months reported in the statistics. Due to the significant variation in migration patterns the approximated migration dates are expected to have deviations of ±2 weeks which are accounted for through stochastic changes in migration dates each time a simulation is performed. The radius of the waterfowl agents were computed using the population, density, and dispersion data obtained from published statistics (GROMS 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2006</xref>; Hagemeijer and Mundkur 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2006</xref>).
