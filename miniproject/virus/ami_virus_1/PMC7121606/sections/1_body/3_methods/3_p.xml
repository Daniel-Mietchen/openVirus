Note that our Eco-description includes only a selected subset of the waterfowl as complete migration data is unavailable. However, to the best of our knowledge, it is the most comprehensive model of its kind reported to date. Furthermore, it can be readily extended to include additional waterfowl entities from other parts of the world.
