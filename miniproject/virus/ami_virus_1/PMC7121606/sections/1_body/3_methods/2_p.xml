 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">8.1</xref>, our model includes the complete human population (approximately 6.646 billion) humans represented by 1,314 agents. On an average, each human agent models 5.058 million humans living in a contiguous circular region. However, the precise population represented by an agent varies depending on the density of the region it models. Agents modeling dense metropolitan areas have higher human populations while agents modeling rural areas of the world have lower population. In contrast, the radius of all the human agents in the model is equal. The radius was computed using the grid size of gridded human population data from SEDAC (
