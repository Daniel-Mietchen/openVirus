<p>Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">8.6</xref> illustrates one of the trans-Atlantic transmission pathways to the continental US. We observed that the spread was determined by migratory pathways and timelines of different species of waterfowl rather than initial infection percentages (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). One of the interesting observations is that our experiments correctly predicted an outbreak in the UK (WHO

 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">8.7</xref> presents the impact of avian influenza outbreaks on poultry population in the continental US. Decrease in poultry population corresponds to H5N1 induced death and culling of birds to control the disease. Increase in poultry population reflects regeneration of poultry flocks after an outbreak. As illustrated by the graph, infections in poultry also follow a cyclic pattern that correlate with annual migration of waterfowl. The mortality figures can be translated to corresponding dollar figures for financial analysis. Additional case studies and experiments conducted using SEARUMS are discussed in the literature (Rao et al.
