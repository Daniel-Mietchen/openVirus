<p>The calibrated Eco-description (see 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.4</xref> for details) has been used to conduct several experiments to analyze the potential impact of avian influenza to poultry farming in the US. The study was conducted using a number of bio-simulations with three different experimental groups of migrating waterfowl. The three flocks were chosen based on their close proximity to known primary sites of disease outbreaks (Rao et al.
