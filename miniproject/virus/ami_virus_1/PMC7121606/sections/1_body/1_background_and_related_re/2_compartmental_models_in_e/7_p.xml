 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>) focus on analyzing pandemic mode of H5N1 in Thailand. In pandemic mode rapid and sustained human-to-human transmission is assumed. Since human-to-human transmission is assumed, these investigations use a highly detailed spatially explicit model based on SEIR concepts. The modeling approach used by Halloran et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2008</xref>) is similar to those proposed by Ferguson et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2006</xref>) and Longini et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). Moreover, these three investigations are based on the premise that H5N1 has already mutated to a pandemic form and epidemics are being caused primarily due to human-to-human transmission.
