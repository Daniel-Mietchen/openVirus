<p>In contrast, our investigations assume and reflect the current, real-world situation; i.e., H5N1 is yet to mutate into its pandemic state and human-to-human transmission is unsustained. Furthermore, our research aims to utilize waterfowl migration data to forecast zoonotic epicenters and timelines of potential epidemics. In addition, we also emphasize the role of poultry (extensible to swine) as intermediate hosts. These aspects notably distinguish our efforts from the aforementioned recent related investigations.</p>
