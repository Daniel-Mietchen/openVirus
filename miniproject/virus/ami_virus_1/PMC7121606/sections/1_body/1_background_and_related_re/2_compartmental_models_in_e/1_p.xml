<p>The most widely used mathematical framework for epidemiological analysis are compartmentalized models (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>; Daley and Gani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>). In a compartmentalized model the population being analyzed is partitioned into a few non-intersecting subsets called compartments. Compartments are defined such that the sub-population within a compartment exhibits a vital disease characteristic (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>; Daley and Gani 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2001</xref>), such as:
