 <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.2.1</xref> covers the compartmental models used in epidemiology. Although the compartmental models can be applied to many diseases, in this article we focus on its use for analyzing global epidemiology of avian influenza. Consequently, the ecology of avian influenza is summarized in

 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.2.3</xref> presents an overview of the Markov processes that are used to model the natural interactions occurring in the ecology. This section also illustrates the interactions between the compartmental models and Markov processes. 
 <xref rid="Sec10" ref-type="sec">Section 8.2.4</xref> presents a brief survey of the concepts and software frameworks pertaining to HITL steering of simulators and software systems.
