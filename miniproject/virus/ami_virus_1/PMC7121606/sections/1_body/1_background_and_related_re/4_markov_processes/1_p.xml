<p>The compartmental epidemiological models focus purely on the temporal progression of the disease in a given entity, may it be waterfowl, human, or poultry. However, the compartmental SEIR models (see 
 <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.2.1</xref>) do not embody the complete ecology, such as seasonal migration, occurring in nature. Consequently, such ecological processes need to be suitably modeled in conjunction with the epidemiological process. Accordingly, we envision using the concept of a Markov processes to model the overall ecological processes. Furthermore, our Eco-modeling approach suitably incorporates the SEIR models to provide a complete, holistic representation of the real-world ecology.
