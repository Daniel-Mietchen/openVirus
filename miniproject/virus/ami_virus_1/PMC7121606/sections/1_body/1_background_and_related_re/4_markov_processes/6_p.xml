<p>In our software system the three primary aggregate entities, namely: (1) flock of waterfowl; (2) poultry; and (3) group of humans have been modeled using the aforementioned Eco-modeling approach. The Markov processes have been suitably implemented using the modeling framework provided by SEARUMS. The Markov process for the waterfowl entity is shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>. Readers are referred to the literature for more details on the Markov processes for various entities and the associated mathematical equations (Rao et al.
