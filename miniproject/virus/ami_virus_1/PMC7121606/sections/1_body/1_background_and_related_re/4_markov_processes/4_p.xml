<p>Another important aspect of our Eco-modeling methodology is the aggregate representation of sub-populations. At a global scale, the varying populations of entities are typically modeled at a coarser granularity or aggregate entities (Booth

A large collection of birds, such as a poultry farms are represented as a single entity. In an analogous manner, humans living in geographic proximity to each other are modeled as a single entity.
