<p>The motivation for such a coarser grained, aggregate representation is two fold (Booth

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>; Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>). First, such an approach is necessary to reduce the size and complexity of the model to more tractable scales. Aggregated models continue to provide the necessary fidelity as long as the aggregation is performed at a sufficiently fine granularity (Law et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2005</xref>). Second, various real-world statistical data on population dynamics, seasonal migratory behaviors, and disease progresses are determined through random sampling of a large subset of the population. Such data is more meaningful and relatively straightforward to apply at an aggregate level.
