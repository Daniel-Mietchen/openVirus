<p>In our approach, the SEIR operations are repeatedly preformed in an appropriate state in the Markov process. It must be noted that the SEIR models involving ODEs are inherently based on the notion of continuous simulation-time (Anderson and May 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1992</xref>). However, the Markov processes operate in discrete simulation-time steps (Winston 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1994</xref>). Consequently, our Markov process-based approach approximates the SEIR model. However, the discrete simulation-time steps are chosen to be sufficiently small to provide adequate accuracy without degrading performance (Rao et al.
