<p>HITL-simulations can be further classified into constructive HITL-simulations and virtual simulations. In a virtual simulation, simulation-time progressed as the same rate as the real, wall-clock time (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007b</xref>). Furthermore, interaction between the human and the simulation occurs in a synchronous manner. Virtual simulations are primarily used for training, gaming, and education (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007b</xref>). On the other hand, in a constructive simulation, simulation-time progresses at a different rate than real time. Human interactions with a constructive simulation are typically intermittent or on a “as needed” basis. The interactions are triggered based on an user gesture or when predefined events occur in the simulation.
