<p>In conjunction with advancements in microprocessor technologies, computer-based simulations have become an important, indispensable, and multi-disciplinary methodology for study and analysis of complex systems (Railsback et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). Today, simulations are widely used in fundamental sciences, applied sciences, engineering, medicine, economics, and in the military (Tobias and Hofmann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2004</xref>). During its inception, simulations were run purely as an offline or batch processing task without requiring any interaction with a human operator. However, the growing demand and diversification in needs in various disciplines have led to the development of simulations which involve interactions with a human operator (Rao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007b</xref>). Such simulations, which permit or require a human to interact, are classified as HITL-simulations. The process of impacting the state of the simulation to divert the simulation to another state is called simulation steering. Simulation steering is similar to program steering, which is a more generic concept (Gu et al.
