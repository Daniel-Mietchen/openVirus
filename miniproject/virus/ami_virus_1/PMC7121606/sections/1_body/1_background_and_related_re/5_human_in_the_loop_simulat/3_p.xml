<p>Constructive simulations are used for simulating large and complex systems such as the ecological and epidemiological models. Several such general purpose simulators have been described in the literature (Gilbert and Bankes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>; WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>). Some of the commonly used simulators include NetLogo, SWARM, SWARM-Java, Repast, and MASON. Railsback et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>) highly recommended NetLogo for its ease-of-use. However, it uses a custom language for modeling and its source code is proprietary. On the other hand, the latter four platforms uses traditional programming languages and source codes are freely available (Railsback et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>). These four platforms essentially provide a core framework for model development and a collection of library modules. The library modules are built using the core framework and can be readily reused for modeling. Moreover, the simulators provide some support for HITL interactions.
