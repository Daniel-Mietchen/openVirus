<p>This article motivated the need for HITL-simulation steering (see 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.1.2</xref>) to effectively analyze the global epidemiology of emergent diseases. As discussed in 
 <xref rid="Sec1" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.1</xref>, epidemiology is a vital discipline with far reaching impacts on human health and economics. Specifically, the article discussed the conceptual mathematical models (refer to 
 <xref rid="Sec7" ref-type="sec">Sects. 8.2.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">8.2.3</xref>) and their implementation in a custom Eco-modeling and HITL bio-simulation environment called SEARUMS. The article also discussed the software architecture of SEARUMS and its design in 
 <xref rid="Sec11" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.3</xref>.
