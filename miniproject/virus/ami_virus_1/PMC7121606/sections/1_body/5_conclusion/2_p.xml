<p>The procedure involved in utilizing SEARUMS for Eco-modeling and model calibration using HITL-simulation steering was discussed in 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Sect.Â 8.4</xref>. HITL-simulation steering played a vital role in enabling calibration of the model. The HITL infrastructure was developed because conventional approaches for suitably seeding the model were unsuccessful despite hundreds of attempts and simulation runs. Furthermore, the ability to create checkpoints using the HITL infrastructure enabled rapid analysis of various scenarios.
