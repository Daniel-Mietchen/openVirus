<p>Some of the experiments conducted using SEARUMS were presented in 
 <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.5</xref> to illustrate the multi-disciplinary applicability of SEARUMS. Researchers, epidemiologists, and ornithologists can utilize HITL-simulations for rapid “what-if” types of analysis to study impacts of other factors influencing epidemics. It can be used to analyze other scenarios such as those simulated by Los Alamos National Laboratory (

Note that use of SEARUMS does not require any special computing infrastructure or programming knowledge. Consequently, experts from multiple domains can collaboratively use SEARUMS to perform various types of analysis on a global scale, assess threats, and measure effectiveness of countermeasures. Our methodology and HITL-simulation environment will enable mankind to strategically invest precious time and resources to combat avian influenza, minimize its impacts on human life and global economy thereby averting a pandemic.
