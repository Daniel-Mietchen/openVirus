<p>The modules and subsystems constituting SEARUMS cooperatively operate on a shared, in-memory representation of the model called the Eco-description. The Eco-description is a centralized data structure that includes all the information necessary for modeling, simulation, and analysis. It is composed using a collection of Java classes and that provide efficient access to data and information required by the various modules. The primary information encapsulated by the Eco-description parameters for analysis relates to the smart agents (Hare and Deadman

 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref>, the agents are organized into an AGENT REPOSITORY to facilitate instantiation and use via Java reflection API.
