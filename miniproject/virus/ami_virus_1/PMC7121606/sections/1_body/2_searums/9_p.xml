<p>All of the aforementioned information is stored as an integral part of the Eco-description. The Eco-description can be saved for future reuse via the PERSISTENCE MODULE. The Eco-description is unmarshalled into a XML document that is compliant with a predefined XML schema. Serializing to a XML document provides a few advantages. First, it enables simple scripts to be developed that can modify specific values and perform multiple simulation runs in batch mode. Second, XML documents can be readily version controlled and archived using commonly available revision control systems such as CVS and subversion. Third, it eases documentation, validation, sharing, and reuse of valuable domain-specific statistical data collated by different researchers from diverse sources. Lastly, it is used to create checkpoints that reflect different scenarios. Such features play an important role in facilitating large-scale, collaborative epidemiological studies.</p>
