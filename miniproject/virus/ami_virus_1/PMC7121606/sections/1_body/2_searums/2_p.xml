<p>Each module shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">8.4</xref> has a well-defined functionality that can be accessed and utilized via a set of application program interface (API) method calls. APIs of the modules are Java interface classes that are implemented by each module. Interactions between modules are achieved through interface classes to ensure loose coupling. This approach permits seamless “plug and play” of modules and the environment is composed by loading suitable modules dynamically on-demand via Java’s reflection API (Bloch
