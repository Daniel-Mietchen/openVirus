<p>The agents implement the conceptual, mathematical model of the system developed using Markov processes as described in 
 <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Sect. 8.2.3</xref>. They are added to a model via suitable toolbar buttons or menu options provided by SEARUMS. Agent instances are created with default attributes from the agent repository by the AGENT CUSTOMIZER module using Javaâ€™s reflection API. Once instantiated, the attributes for agents can be modified via the ATTRIBUTE EDITOR module. The agents are implemented as a family of Java classes by extending a common base class called AGENT. The AGENT class provides methods for interacting with the simulation kernel, inspecting the neighborhood, scheduling events, and interfacing with the GUI modules.
