<p>The SIMULATION MODULE performs the task of conducting a discrete event simulation (DES) using the Eco-description. This module utilizes a multi-threaded DES kernel that manages and schedules the discrete events generated by the agents. Multi-threading enables the DES kernel to exploit the compute power of multiprocessor or multi-core machines thereby reducing the wall-clock time for simulation. The number of threads spawned by the DES kernel is configurable. Each thread processes concurrent events (events with the same timestamp) in parallel without violating the causal constraints between events.</p>
