<p>The agents in a model are logically organized into hierarchical sets called groups. SEARUMS permits multiple top-level groups with an arbitrary number of hierarchies, with one or more sub-groups at each hierarchical level. An agent can be a member of multiple groups. The groups serve several different purposes in SEARUMS. A group can be used as a parameter for statistical analysis and for plotting charts. For example, a group called US can be created with 50 different sub-groups, one for each state, encompassing various agents. The main US group can be selected for plotting charts and SEARUMS automatically collates and plots data for each state. Note that even though graph plotting is restricted to one hierarchical level, statistics for plotting are collated in a recursive, depth-rst manner and includes data from all agents in underlying hierarchies. A modeler can use a combination of groups to perform multi-faceted analysis at different scales. In addition, groups can be included or excluded from simulations for analyzing different scenarios. The GUI modules utilize groups to provide control on visibility of agents to manage details displayed on the screen. The group editor module provides the user interface for managing group entries and hierarchies.</p>
