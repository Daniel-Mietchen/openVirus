<p>The modules constituting SEARUMS are broadly classified as core modules and graphical user interface (GUI) modules. The core modules of SEARUMS are the agent repository, agent customizer, persistence module, HITL steering module, simulation module, and logging module. These modules provide the core M&amp;S functionality of SEARUMS. The GUI facilitates interactions with the core modules via convenient and intuitive user interfaces. The GUI modules can be further categorized into the editor subsystem, the simulation controller, and the visualization and analysis subsystem. The GUI presented by these modules is shown in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">8.5</xref>. SEARUMS uses the model-view-controller pattern to couple the core modules, the GUI models, and the Eco-description. The design permits the GUI modules to be easily replaced with a minimal command-line text interface for running SEARUMS in offline batch mode. The batch mode is useful for performing repeated runs or analyzing different scenarios on computational clusters.
