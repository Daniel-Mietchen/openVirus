<p>Once all the agent instances and groups have been established in a model, the parameters for observation are added to the Eco-description. These parameters are selected by the user via the Statistics and Charts editor from a list of options. The list includes the attributes of the agents and the groups in the Eco-description. Each parameter is configured to be sampled hourly, daily, or weekly in terms of simulation-time. Moreover, each parameter can be subjected to statistical operations, such as sum, mean, and median. SEARUMS can dynamically (i.e., during simulation) plot and save a variety of charts including: line graphs and pie charts. Multiple charts can be simultaneously used for analyzing a variety of data.</p>
