<p>SEARUMS is an Eco-modeling and HITL bio-simulation environment. Currently, it is optimized to enable study and analysis of global epidemiology of avian influenza. However, the design of its modeling and simulation framework is sufficiently generic. Therefore, it can be adapted for epidemiological analysis of other diseases. SEARUMS has been developed in Java by utilizing many of the language’s object oriented programming features (Bloch

SEARUMS is designed to be a user friendly, integrated, graphical modeling, simulation, visualization, and analysis environment for conducting epidemiological analysis. These design goals have been achieved by composing the system using a collection of interdependent but loosely coupled modules as shown in Fig.
