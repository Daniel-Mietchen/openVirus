<p>Currently, SEARUMS includes the following three smart agents: WATERFOWL AGENT that represents a migrating waterfowl flock, POULTRY AGENT that models behavior of poultry flocks, and HUMAN AGENT that models humans. Each agent has its own behavior that reflects the characteristics of its real-world counterpart. The behaviors are customized to represent specific instances of an agent by specifying suitable values for the exposed attributes via the ATTRIBUTE EDITOR GUI module. The attributes of an agent include:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Geographic attributes</italic> that indicate the location (latitude and longitude) and logical association with countries and continents. In addition, each agent has a circle or influence that circumscribes its neighborhood.
   </p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>
    <italic>Migratory attributes</italic> are specified only for agents whose location changes over the lifetime of the simulation. The migratory attributes are described as a sequence of migration points. Each migration point has geographical and chronological (arrival and departure dates) attributes associated with it. In SEARUMS, only one complete migration cycle needs to be specified. The software automatically reuses the information to simulate annual migratory cycles.

    <italic>Statistical attributes</italic> for agent instances include their initial population, density and distribution, initial infection percentage, infection spread parameters, incubation periods, mortality rates, and population re-growth parameters.
