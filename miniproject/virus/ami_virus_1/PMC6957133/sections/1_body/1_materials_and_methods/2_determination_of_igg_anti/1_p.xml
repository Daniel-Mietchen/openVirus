<p>Serum samples were analysed in the Centre for Virology of the Institute of Public Health of Vojvodina, where the serological diagnostics were performed. The ADVIA Centaur Rubella IgG assay (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics) was used for detection of rubella IgG antibodies. This immunoassay uses chemiluminometric technology. A direct relationship exists between the amount of rubella IgG activity present in the patient sample and the amount of relative light units (RLUs) detected by the system. Testing was performed on Siemens ADVIA Centaur automated analyser. As recommended by the manufacturer, all samples with anti-rubella IgG titres below 5.0 IU/mL were considered negative (susceptible to rubella). Values greater than or equal to 5.0 IU/mL, and less than or equal to 9.9 IU/mL, were considered equivocal (unknown rubella immunity status), while samples greater than or equal to 10.0 IU/mL were considered positive for IgG antibodies to rubella virus (protected against rubella). These values are based on the test manufacturerâ€™s recommendations (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Tarrytown, NY, USA) [
