<p>Statistical analysis of the results was performed using the Statistical Software Package for the Social Sciencesâ€”SPSS 21. Attributive features are shown as frequencies, percentages, and 95% confidence intervals. In order to investigate the connection of features, or to generate adequate statistical models, a univariate regression analysis was used. Binary Logistic Regression Analysis was used to generate odds ratios and confidence intervals. The testing of differences in the frequency of attribute characteristics was performed using the X
 <sup>2</sup> test. A two-factor ANOVA analysis was used to simultaneously test the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable, also identifying a potential impact of their interaction. The Bonferroni post-hoc test was used for correction for multiple comparisons. Values with a significance level of p &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.
