<p>Analysis of disease occurrence was performed during three separate periods. The first period is the endemoepidemic (sporadic combined with outbreak cases) period between 1978 and 1993. This is the pre-immunization period. The second one is the period of localized epidemics between 1993 and 2006. The vaccine against rubella was introduced in Serbia during this period, while the rubella infection occurred in the form of localized outbreaks affecting people in collectives. The third period is the period of sporadic cases, which began after 2006.</p>
