<p>Seroepidemiological study in the population of Vojvodina shows that the percentage of susceptible individuals is higher than 5%, which leads us to suspect that there is an increased risk of the rubella disease, which is especially dangerous in women aged 24â€“49. Although the incidence rate of rubella in Vojvodina has been continuously below 1 per 100,000 for the last ten years, due to the percent of seronegative individuals in our investigation as well as obvious decrease in the coverage of the MMR vaccine, there is still a risk of a potential outbreak as well as a possible occurrence of congenital rubella syndrome in newborns.</p>
