<p>A lower percentage of seropositive participants in the group of children aged 1 year (52.5%) can be explained by the fact that a portion of the subjects in this group have lost protective maternal antibodies but have not yet received the first dose of the MMR vaccine. The level of antibodies transferred from mother to child shows an exponentially declining trend, resulting in the loss of protection against rubella after a few months–well before the age of the first MMR vaccine dose [

The first dose of the MMR vaccine, which should be administered between 12 and 15 months of age, is often received later and, therefore, children aged 1 year have no protective antibodies. A similar result was obtained in a study conducted in Turkey, where the percentage of seropositives in the group of children aged 1–2 years was 51.9% [
