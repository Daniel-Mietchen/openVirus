<p>Individuals born between 1993 and 2006 (aged 12–23 years) have statistically significantly lower levels of anti-rubella IgG antibodies. During this period, the MMR vaccine immunization programme was introduced and the vaccination schedule changed. Introduction of the vaccine against rubella limited the circulation of the virus in the population. However, the coverage of the vaccination in this period was lower than required, so it is possible that many individuals did not receive both doses of the MMR vaccine. Consequently, the anti-rubella IgG antibody levels ​​are lower. This is confirmed by the study by Pebody RG. et al, who highlighted that the geometric mean antibody concentration of rubella was significantly higher in children who have received a second dose of the MMR compared to those who have received a single dose [

It is very likely that vaccine immunity has declined among these individuals because they have not received both doses of the vaccine. Consequently, it is not only individuals with equivocal test results who present a problem in this age group. After some time, the problem may also be with individuals who currently have sufficient levels of protective antibodies, but–due to the possible administration of only one dose of the MMR vaccine–might experience a more rapid decrease in antibody levels.
