<p>In contrast to our study, in the study conducted in Vojvodina between 1978 and 1984 on a sample of 1,550 individuals aged from six months to 60 years, the percentage of susceptible individuals aged ≥20 years ranged from 0% to 15% [

In our study, the percentage of susceptible individuals in the group aged ≥20 years was 4.2% (6.4% in the age group of 24–49 years, and 1% in the age group of ≥50 years). These data only confirm that the introduction of the MMR vaccine has significantly reduced the number of susceptible individuals in the Vojvodina population. Despite the high percentage of people with protective anti-rubella IgG antibodies, the number of susceptible individuals is still higher than recommended (&lt;5%) by the World Health Organization. The goal of rubella and CRS elimination can only be achieved when the population susceptibility is below the level that can sustain transmission. Thus, a population immunity of at least 95% is recommended to interrupt the transmission and eliminate rubella. Susceptibility should be lower than 5% especially in children and women of generative age [
