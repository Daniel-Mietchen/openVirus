<p>In children born after 2006, the lowest antibody level was among those aged 1 year. Most children in that age group have lost maternal antibodies, so their existing antibodies are the result of a single dose of the MMR vaccine. Although children are expected to develop normal antibody titres in response to the initial MMR dose, some children develop low antibody levels to all three antigens in the MMR vaccine, and some (the non-responders) develop no antibodies. Low antibody levels may be caused by a small proportion of complete vaccination failures, impotent vaccine, incorrect delivery, or individual factors related to an underdeveloped immune system [
