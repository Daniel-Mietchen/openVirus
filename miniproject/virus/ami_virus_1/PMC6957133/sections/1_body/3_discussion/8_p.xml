<p>Although the participants in the age group of 24–49 years were born during the pre-vaccination period, they have a slightly higher seronegativity (6.4%) compared to the group of ≥50 years. This difference is statistically significant (x
 <sup>2</sup> = 20.973; p &lt;0.001). A possible explanation can be found in the registered incidence of less than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants in Vojvodina in certain years during the period after 1986, which leads to the conclusion that not all individuals of that age came into a contact with the virus. This finding underlines the need for a vaccination strategy targeting older people as well, especially women of generative age [
