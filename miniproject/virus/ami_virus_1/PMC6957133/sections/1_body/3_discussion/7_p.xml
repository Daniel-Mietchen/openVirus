<p>In our study, the percentage of seropositives in children aged 2–11 years was 92.9%. The absence of a higher percentage of children with protective anti-rubella antibodies in this group can be explained by a lower immunization coverage of the MMR vaccine during certain years in the period from 2006 to 2017. Immunization coverage on the territory of Vojvodina was lower than 95% in 2012 (91%), 2014 (86%), 2015 (90%), 2016 (89%), and 2017 (78%). Decreasing immunization trend in Vojvodina can be explained by a reduction in timely availability of the MMR vaccine in Serbia from 2012–2016, as well as an increased activity and media presence of the anti-vaccination movement in the Balkan countries, which has contributed to a surge in vaccine scepticism and vaccine hesitancy [

 <xref rid="pone.0227413.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Maintaining such a negative trend in immunization coverage leads to an increase in the number of susceptible populations. This creates conditions for the importation and spread of the disease which was previously successfully prevented by immunization. Due to this situation, there was a measles epidemic outbreak in Vojvodina from November 12, 2017 to June 30, 2018, during which 177 cases were reported [

That happened probably because, if one dose of the MMR vaccine was higher in coverage than the other in a given year, there is a possibility that a certain level of antibodies was created, because one of MMR doses had higher coverage and there is a likelihood that more children received at least one dose of the vaccine. This means that, although there may be a lower level of antibodies in certain age groups, it seems to be sufficient to prevent the outbreak of rubella virus epidemics in the population, which was not the case with measles. In a study conducted in the northern part of Greece, the percentage of seropositives in children aged 6–10 years (71.8%) and 11–15 years (77.1%) was significantly lower than the percentage obtained in our study [
