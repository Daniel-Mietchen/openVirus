<p>In this study, the percentage of participants seropositive for rubella antibodies was 92.9% in the entire sample. This percentage of seropositivity is similar to the percentage obtained in a study in Luxembourg in 2004 [
 <xref rid="pone.0227413.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], but lower than the percentage obtained in Hungary, Slovenia, and Slovakia, and higher than the one found in Romania and Bulgaria in 2008 [
 <xref rid="pone.0227413.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. A higher percentage of seropositives in Hungary, Slovenia, and Slovakia can be explained by a &gt;95% coverage of the MMR vaccine in these countries, but also by a previously acquired immunity of the population following a natural infection.
