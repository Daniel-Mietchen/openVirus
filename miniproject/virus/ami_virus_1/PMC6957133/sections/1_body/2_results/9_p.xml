<p>Comparing the levels of anti-rubella IgG antibodies across these three periods, we found that in the period of single cases of the rubella disease, the lowest levels of antibodies were found in the 1-year old participants compared to the age group of 2â€“11 years old. The highest levels of IgG antibodies were detected in the age group older than 24 years, which belongs to the period of massive epidemics of the rubella infection.</p>
