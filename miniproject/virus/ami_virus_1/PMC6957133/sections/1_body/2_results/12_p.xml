<p>We further tested the effect of gender and age groups on antibody levels, as shown in the 
 <xref rid="pone.0227413.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. Using the Two-way ANOVA analysis, we tested the individual effect of gender and age groups, as well as a potential impact of their interaction, on antibody levels. The effect of gender and age group interaction on antibody levels was not statistically significant (F = 0.359; p = 0.698). There was a statistically significant individual effect of age groups (subjects’ age) on antibody levels (F = 99,472; p&lt;0.001), but no individual effect of subjects’ gender (F = 0.981; p = 0.322).
