<p>The highest number of seronegativity was found in the youngest (1 year) participant group (44.7%), followed by the age group of 24–49 years (6.4%) and the group of children aged 2–11 years (6.2%). Although the participants in the age group of 24–49 years were born during the pre-vaccination period, they have a slightly higher seronegativity (6.4%) compared to the group of ≥50 years. This difference is statistically significant (x
 <sup>2</sup> = 20.973; p &lt;0.001). The percentage of equivocal results in both females and males in the age groups of 1 year and 12–23 years ranged between 2.2 and 4.0%, while the percentage in the other age groups ranged between 0.4% and 1.2% (
