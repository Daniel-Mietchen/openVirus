<p>Also, we analysed whether there was a statistically significant difference in measured antibody levels in different age groups (during the three observed periods) in seropositive subjects. The analysis showed that there was a statistically significant difference in antibody levels compared to the observed age groups (ANOVA; F = 99,394; p &lt;0.001). The Bonferroni post hoc test showed that patients aged 12–23 years had statistically significantly lower antibody levels compared to those aged &lt;11 years (p &lt;0.001), as well as those aged 24+ years (p &lt;0.001). Patients older than 24 years (there is no difference between the age group of 24–49 years and those older than 50) also had statistically significantly higher antibody levels compared to those younger than 11 years (p&lt;0.001). Patients from the oldest age group had statistically significantly higher antibody levels than subjects aged 12–23 years (p &lt;0.001) (
