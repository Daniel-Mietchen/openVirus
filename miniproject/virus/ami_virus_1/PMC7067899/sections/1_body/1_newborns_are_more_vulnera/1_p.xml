<p>Despite the advantage of internal offspring development and the provision for passive immune protection, fetuses and neonates of higher vertebrates still remain vulnerable to environmental pathogens. Piglets 
 <italic>in utero</italic> are protected from eukaryotic parasites and bacteria, but are vulnerable to viruses (including parvovirus, PRRSV, and porcine circovirus 2) since they are able to cross the placental barrier (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). These cause pathological injury and often fetal abortion. In a number of mammals, viruses infect the thymus and can also cause hypergammaglobulinemia.

However, apoptosis is also a host mechanisms used to eliminating virus-infected cells (

Thus, the role and importance of virus-induced apoptosis awaits further research.
