<p>Since the adaptive immune system of fetal piglets is underdeveloped, the innate immune system is very important.

They discuss iNKT age-dependence, levels and distribution in relationship to various porcine viral infections. One of the first host responses to viral infection is the production of interferons, which are needed to drive other elements of innate immunity and adaptive immunity.

While the initial antibody response depends on broadly specific natural IgM antibodies, effective anti-viral immunity depends on an adaptive immune response that delivers IgG and IgA antibodies. Since adaptive immune responses depend on stimulation through the innate immune system, viruses that impair or interfere with the innate immune response, also impair adaptive immunity.
