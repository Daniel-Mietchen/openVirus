<p>Viral vaccines take various forms, the simplest being the use of killed virus. A more tedious procedure is to use only parts of the virus as the vaccine (subunit vaccines) that target the immune response to those viral epitopes that elicit VN antibodies. Killed viruses and subunit vaccines typically generate immediate responses that wane faster, making it imperative for long-lived mammals like humans, to receive booster vaccinations. A second approach to vaccine development is use of live attenuated virus that has been genetically modified or cell culture adapted and cannot produce a disease in the host but can still replicate. These are often more likely to stimulate virus-specific cytotoxic T cells and to induce longer term immunity.
