<p>Antibodies can intercept and neutralize a virus before it infects additional cells and can prevent further infection by blocking the viral receptor; these are called virus neutralizing (VN) antibodies. Naturally, a critical step in viral vaccine design is the identification of viral epitopes targeted by effective VN antibodies. This become increasingly important in the case of PRRSV in which effective VN antibodies are slow to appear and current vaccines are of questionable efficacy. This is also an ongoing challenge in the case of ASFV which is rapidly spreading and for which no vaccine exists.

While VN antibodies can block or delay infection, the ultimate elimination of a virus is to kill the cells in which the virus replicates which is the job of cytotoxic T cells. Portions of the virus are displayed on infected cells. These are called a T cell epitope, i.e., a molecular structure that binds to the T cell receptor (TCR). In this volume,
