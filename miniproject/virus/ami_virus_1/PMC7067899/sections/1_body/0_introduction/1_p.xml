<p>The swine industry is an important part of agriculture in many countries, generating over $11 billion annually in the US alone. Viral diseases in pigs pose a serious risk for swine health and significantly impact the economy of the global swine industry. Pigs also serve as zoonotic reservoirs for viruses transmittable to humans and other species, including influenza A virus, Nipah virus, and hepatitis E virus (

 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), the latter would have succumbed to microbial infection were it not for their adaptive immune system that uses somatic gene rearrangement and mutation to counter the rapid diversification of microbes. Immediately following viral infection, neonatal survival depends on innate immunity and passive protection by lactogenic immune factors such as pathogen-specific antibodies, until an adaptive immune response can develop. Thus, intervention against these moving targets, depends on availability of effective maternal and neonatal vaccines and strict biosecurity measures.
