<p>Wide-spread porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and swine influenza virus (SIV) represent major health challenges in the large US swine production systems and possibly worldwide. In the US alone, economic annual losses due to PRRSV are estimated to be 664 million U.S. dollar (USD) (
