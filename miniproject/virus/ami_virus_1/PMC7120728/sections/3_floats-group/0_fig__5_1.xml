  <p>Schematic of viral structures and key epidemiological features. (
   <bold>a</bold>) 
   <italic>Influenza</italic> virus is spherical or filamentous in shape. Hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope and project from the viral surface. Matrix (M1) protein underlies the envelope, and M2 forms an ion channel within the envelope. Eight single-stranded RNA genome segments are coated with nucleoprotein (NP) and bound by the polymerase complex. Nuclear export protein (NEP) mediates export of viral RNA. Influenza has estimated reproductive number (R
   <sub>0</sub>) between 1 and 2. Standard, droplet, and contract precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (
   <bold>b</bold>) virus is pleomorphic in shape. Hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope, and matrix (M) protein underlies the envelope. The single-stranded RNA genome is coated with nucleoprotein (N) and bound by the polymerase complex. Measles has an estimate R
   <sub>0</sub> between 9 and 18. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (
   <bold>c</bold>) are spherical in shape. Spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins are integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope. The single-stranded RNA genome is coated with nucleoprotein (N). SARS and MERS have an estimated R
   <sub>0</sub> of &lt;1â€“2. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission. (
   <bold>d</bold>) are oval to brick shaped. The biconcave viral core contains double-stranded DNA and several proteins organized as a nucleosome and surrounded by a core membrane. Two proteinaceous lateral bodies flank the core, and a single lipid membrane surrounds the cell-associated form of the mature virion (MV). A second host-derived lipid envelope covers the extracellular virion (EV). Smallpox has an estimated R
   <sub>0</sub> between 4 and 6. Standard, airborne, and contact precautions are recommended to prevent nosocomial transmission of smallpox
