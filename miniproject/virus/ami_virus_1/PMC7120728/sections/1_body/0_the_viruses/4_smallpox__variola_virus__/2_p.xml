<p id="Par8"> Poxviruses contain a biconcave viral core where the DNA genome, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and enzymes necessary for particle uncoating reside (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1d</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. This nucleosome is surrounded by a core membrane that is flanked by two proteinaceous lateral bodies. A singlelipid membrane surrounds the cell-associated form of the mature virion (MV). A second host-derived lipid envelope covers the extracellular virion (EV) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Poxvirus genomes are comprised of a large, linear double-stranded viral DNA genome that encodes ~200 genes. Highly conserved structural genes are predominantly found in the middle of the genome, whereas variable virulence factor genes that function in immune evasion, virulence,and viral pathogenesis are found at the termini of the genome [
