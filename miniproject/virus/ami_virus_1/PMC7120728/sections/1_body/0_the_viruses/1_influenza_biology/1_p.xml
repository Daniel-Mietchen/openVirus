<p id="Par2">Influenza viruses are spherical orfilamentous, enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of family 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> of approximately 100 nm to 300 nm in diameter that include types A, B, C, and D [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Influenza A and B viruses cause mild to severe illness during seasonal epidemics, and influenza A viruses cause intermittent pandemics. Influenza C viruses cause mild infections but not epidemics, and influenza D virus may cause subclinical infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Influenza A viruses are classified into subtypes based on the combination of the surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, with 18 H and 11 N known subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Specific influenza strains are named according to the World Health Organization (WHO) convention designating influenza virus type, host of origin (if not human), geographic origin, strain number, year of isolation, and subtype (for influenza A viruses) (e.g., Influenza A/California/7/2009[H1N1]) [
