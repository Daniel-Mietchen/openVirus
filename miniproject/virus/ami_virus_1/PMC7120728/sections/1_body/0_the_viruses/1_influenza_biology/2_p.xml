<p id="Par3">Influenza A viruses have eight genome segments that code for structural and nonstructural proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1a</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Surface glycoproteins include hemagglutinin (HA), required for viral binding and entry, and neuraminidase (NA), required for viral budding. Matrix (M1) protein underlies the host-derived lipid envelope providing structure, and M2 protein is an ion channel integrated into the envelope. Eight single-stranded RNA viral genome segments are coated with nucleoprotein (N) and bound by the polymerase complex, composed of basic polymerase 1 (PB1), PB2, and acidic polymerase (PA). Nuclear export protein (NEP) mediates trafficking of viral RNA segments and nonstructural protein (NS1) inhibits host antiviral responses. The virus can also expressaccessory proteins PB1-F2 and PA-x.
