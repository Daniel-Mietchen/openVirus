<p id="Par6">SARS- and MERS-CoV transcribe 12 and 9 subgenomic RNAs, respectively, which encode for the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) structural proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1c</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. S, E, and M are all integrated into the host-derived lipid envelope, and S facilitates host cell attachment to angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2 receptors for SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 receptors for MERS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The N protein encapsidates the viral genome to form the helical nucleocapsid. The viral replicase-transcriptase complex is made up of 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1â€“16) including a unique proofreading exoribonuclease that reduces the accumulation of genomemutations [
