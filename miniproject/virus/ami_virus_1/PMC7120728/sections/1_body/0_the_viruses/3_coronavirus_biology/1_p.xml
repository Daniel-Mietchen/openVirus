<p id="Par5"> Coronaviruses are spherical, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses of family

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. While coronaviruses are often associated with mild disease (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), a lineage B betacoronavirus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a lineage C betacoronavirus, are associated with severe and potentially fatal respiratory infection [
