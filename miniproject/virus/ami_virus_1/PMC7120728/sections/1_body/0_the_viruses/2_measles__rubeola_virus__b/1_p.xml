<p id="Par4">Measles virus is a pleomorphic, enveloped, negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of family of approximately 100 nm to 300 nm in diameter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Measles virus causes mild to severe illness during seasonal outbreaks in endemic areas and intermittent outbreaks in nonendemic area [

 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">5.1b</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) glycoproteins project from the viral surface and facilitateviral binding to cellular receptors and fusion with the host cell membrane, respectively. Matrix (M) protein underlies the envelope providing structure. The inner nucleocapsid is composed of RNA coated by nucleoprotein (N), bound by the polymerase complex which includes the large (L) polymerase protein, and phosphoprotein (P), a polymerase cofactor. The remaining nonstructuralproteins include C and V.
