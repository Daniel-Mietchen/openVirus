<p id="Par29">Annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended in the United States for all individuals aged 6 months or older and has been associated with decreased risk of pneumonia and death, particularly among high-risk groups [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Seasonal influenza vaccination does not provide protection against novel strains. Consequently, efforts are underway to develop a vaccine that would protect against most or all influenza strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Three classes of drugs are licensed for the treatment of influenza in the United States [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Adamantanes, including amantadine and rimantadine,are not currently recommended given resistance of circulating seasonal strains. Baloxavir morboxil, a cap-dependent endonuclease inhibitor, was recently approved for the treatment of uncomplicated influenza [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>]. Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) include oral oseltamivir, inhaled zanamivir, and intravenous peramivir. Prophylactic use of NAIs is recommended in unvaccinated individuals with risk factors for severe disease and during institutional outbreaks to limit spread. Therapeutic use is recommended for individuals with suspected or confirmed influenza that have developed or are at high risk for influenza complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Influenza complications,including respiratory and multiorgan failure, are managed with supportive care. Bacterial coinfection should be considered and empirically treated early pending results of microbiologic testing among severe cases.
