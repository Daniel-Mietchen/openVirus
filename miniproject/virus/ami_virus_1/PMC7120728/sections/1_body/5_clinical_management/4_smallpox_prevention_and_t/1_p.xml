<p id="Par32">While routine smallpox vaccinationceased at the end of the smallpox eradication program, it is still employed for those at increased risk for exposure. First-generation vaccines comprise a significant proportion of both the US national and global vaccine stockpiles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. However, first-generation vaccines carry high risk of adverse events due to use of replication-competent VACV and potential manufacturing contaminants. Second-generation smallpox vaccines have reduced concerns for contaminants and are expected to have similar protective efficacy as first-generation vaccines. ACAM2000® has garnered US Food and Drug Administration licensure for vaccination of those at high risk for exposure and is part of the US strategic national stockpile [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. ACAM2000® and the Lister-derived vaccines RIVM and Elstree-BN also contribute to the global stockpile. IMVAMUNE (MVA), a third-generation vaccine, is licensed in Europe and Canada and is part of the US national stockpile. Passive immunization with VIG has been employed to treat complications of vaccinations [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">149</xref>]. There has also been increasing interest in the development and licensure of small molecule antivirals for treatment of 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> infections. CMX001 (brincidofovir), a DNA synthesis inhibitor, has demonstrated protection against lethal VARV in nonhuman primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>] and has been granted ophan drug designation while also being included in the US Strategic National Stockpile. ST-246 (tecovirimat), which inhibits viral egress, has potent (IC50 &lt; 0.010 μM) and selective (CC50 &gt; 40 mM) inhibitory activities against multiple orthopoxvirues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>], is the only antipoxvirus therapeutic that has been granted approval in the US and has been added to the Strategic National Stockpile.
