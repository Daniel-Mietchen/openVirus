<p id="Par15">Measles is among the most highlycontagious respiratory infections, spread by exposure to large respiratory droplets through coughing, sneezing, or talking; by indirect contact with infected surfaces; or by small infectious droplets that can remain suspended in air for up to 2 hours [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Respiratory tract dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and alveolar macrophages are early targets of infection where during an average 8- to 12-day incubation period measles replicates and spreads to local lymphatics and respiratory epithelium and then disseminates in blood via infected lymphocytes to epithelial and endothelial cells in most organs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The infectious period begins with fever onset and extends for several days after rash appears [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> of measles is 9–18 dependent upon host susceptibility and social and environmental factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Measles infects and disrupts tissues throughout the body;however, severe disease is primarily due to lower respiratory tract and neurological complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Natural measles infection confers lifelong immunity, and passive transfer of maternal antibodies protects newborns during the early postnatal period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Individuals who recover from measles infection are at increasedrisk of secondary infection [
