<p id="Par16">SARS-CoV is transmitted by large respiratory droplets and by contact with infected surfaces. Epidemiologic data also support small droplet airborne transmission of SARS-CoV although the estimated R
 <sub>0</sub> of 0.86â€“1.83 argues against this being a predominate route of spread [

Acute kidney injury is multifactorial with evidence of acute tubule necrosis, vasculitis, and glomerular fibrosis, and central nervous system manifestations are at least in part attributable to direct infection of neurons resulting in edema and degeneration [
