<p id="Par17">MERS-CoV is transmitted by large respiratory droplets and by contact with infected surfaces with an estimated R0 of &lt;1 to &gt;1 outside of versus within healthcare settings, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. MERS-CoV binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) on respiratory epithelial cells and pneumocytes where it undergoes productive replication during a 2–14 days incubation period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Viral shedding from the lower respiratory tract may persist for weeks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Viremia, while not documented in all cases, is associated with severe disease and productive infection of DCs, and macrophages is thought to facilitate immune dysregulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. DPP4 is broadly expressed on cells outside of the lung; however, few autopsy data are available to define viral distribution [
