<p id="Par14">Influenza viruses are transmitted bylarge respiratory droplets by coughing, sneezing, or talking or through contact with infected surfaces [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Influenza viruses bind to sugar moieties on the surface of airway epithelial cells where early viral replication, propagation, and shedding occur during an average 1–2 days of incubationperiod [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. Peak viral replication typically occurs within 4 days of symptom onset and resolves within 7–10 days, lasting longer in children and immunocompromised hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. On average one person infects —one to two additional people; however, this reproductive number (R
 <sub>0</sub>) varies by viral strain and social and environmental factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. Viral infection impairs the airway mucosal barrier and disrupts the alveolar-capillary membrane contributing to leakage of fluid and inflammatory cells into the alveolar space which impairs gas exchange resulting in hypoxemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. Bacterial coinfection often complicates severe cases contributing to respiratory failure and death, with 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus species</italic> as predominant copathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Seasonal influenza virus infection is largely limited to the respiratory tract; however, H5 and H7 HPAI viruses have a polybasic cleave site within the hemagglutinin allowing for replication outside of the respiratory tract [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Infectionwith one strain of influenza does not confer complete immunity to other strains or subtypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>].
