<p id="Par10">Currently circulating seasonalinfluenza A subtypes H1N1 and H3N2 and influenza B viruses, Yamagata or Victoria lineage, cause annual epidemics during fall through spring in temperate regions and infections throughout the year in the tropics [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Antigenic drift of H and N surface glycoproteins drives annual epidemics. From 2017 to 2018, seasonal influenza caused approximately 49 million illnesses, 1 million hospitalizations, and 79,000 deaths in the United States alone [

When two or more influenza A viruses infect a common host, such as a bird or pig, individual gene segments may recombine to form a novel virus, known as antigenic shift. Influenza pandemics occur when novel viruses emerge into an immunologically naïve population and become adapted for sustained human-to-human spread. The 1918 “Spanish” influenza pandemic was the most severe on record, resulting in anestimated 50 million deaths [
