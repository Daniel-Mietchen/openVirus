<p id="Par9">Wild aquatic birds are natural reservoirsfor nearly all influenza A virus subtypes, which spread to domestic avian species and mammals, including humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. HPAIviruses cause spillover infections in humans that may be severe or fatal. Examples include outbreaks of H5N1 and H7N9 HPAI viruses in Asia with high case fatality among humans, although limited human-to-human transmission [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] has been reported. HPAI virus adaptations might lead to sustained human-to-human transmission, and so poultry outbreaks are managed by flock depopulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Influenza A subtypes isolated in swine include H1 to H5, H9, and N1 and N2. Subtypes that spillover into humans cause mild to severe illness and are known as swine “variant” viruses [
