<p id="Par11"> Measles is pathogenic for humans and nonhuman primates, although sustained transmission occurs only among humans raising potential for global elimination [

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">5.2b</xref>). By 2017, 85% of children worldwide had received at least one dose of the measles vaccine by age 1 year, and during 2000–2017, global measles mortality decreased by 80%, preventing an estimated 21 million deaths [

Despite these gains, measles remains endemic in many regions of the world including Africa, Western Pacific, South East Asia, and Europe, and measles has resurged in previously low-incidence areas (e.g., regions within Europe and the Americas) with epidemics attributable to importation of cases and suboptimal immunization coverage [
