 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">105</xref>]. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is a demyelinating autoimmune process that occurs within weeks of acute illness in approximately 1 in 1000 cases. ADEM is characterized by fevers, seizures, and neurologic deficits. Measles inclusion body encephalitis is a progressive lethal brain infection occurring within months of acute illness primarily among individuals with impaired cellular immunity. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) occurs 5–10 years following initial infection resulting in seizures and cognitive and motor decline resulting in death. SSPE affects an estimated 1 in 10,000 infants under 1 year of age and is attributed to host responses to defective viral particleproduction in the brain.
