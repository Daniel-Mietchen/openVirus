<p id="Par19">Influenza infection manifests as acute onset of fever, chills, malaise, headache, and myalgias following an average 1–2 days asymptomatic incubation period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most infections are self-limited resolving within 1–2 weeks. Upper or lower airway complications include otitis media, sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia with or without bacterial coinfection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. Risk factors for severe infection include age &gt;65 years or &lt;5 years; pregnancy; preexisting respiratory, cardiac, neurologic, or metabolic conditions; immunosuppression; andobesity. Progressive lethargy and shortness of breath, typically within 5 days of symptom onset, suggest development of lower respiratory tract complications which may rapidly progress to respiratory failure and death in severe cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. Pneumonia due to influenza infection alone versus influenza and bacterialcoinfection cannot be reliably distinguished by clinical or radiological grounds, and so a high index of suspicion is needed. Influenza complications outside of the respiratory tract include exacerbation of underlying heart disease including ischemic heart disease and heart failure, myocarditis, encephalopathy,and encephalitis [
