<p id="Par24">As the smallpox disease coursewas related to the clinical presentation of disease, Rao proposed a clinical classification system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>] that was later adopted by the WHO in 1972 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. was the most common clinical type of smallpox. The incubation period was 7–19 days and was followed by fever onset (38.5–40.5 °C), headaches, backaches, vomiting, and diarrhea [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Lesions first appeared on mucous membranes (including the tongue, palate, and pharynx) ~1 day prior to macular rash development, where lesions began on the face followed by proximal regions of the extremities, the trunk, and the distal extremities. Lesion development followed a centrifugal dispersionpattern, typically most dense on the face, with papules appearing within 2 days of macular rash development. Papules became vesicular ~2–4 days later followed by a pustular stage (5–7 days postrash) that peaked ~10 days postrash. Pustule resolution quickly followed and was accompanied by lesion flattening, fluid reabsorption, hardening, and scab formation (14–21 days postrash). Rao proposed for ordinary type smallpox to be further subdivided based on the macular rash pattern [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. These included 
 <italic>discrete ordinary-type smallpox</italic> , characterized by discrete skin lesions; , where pustular skin lesions were confluent on the face and extremities; and , where skin lesions were confluent on the face but disparate over the rest of the body. Modified-type smallpox, where lesions were less numerous than in ordinary-type smallpox, was primarily associated with vaccinated individuals and had an accelerated nonfatal disease course [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. Flat-type and hemorrhagic-type smallpox were the most lethalforms of the disease but were also very rare (~7% and 3% of patients, respectively) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Flat-type smallpox had high CFRs in both unvaccinated and vaccinated patients (97% and 67%, respectively). Hemorrhagic-type smallpox was nearly 100% fatal in both vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, and death normally came prior to macular rash development. The clinical symptoms of flat-type smallpox were more severe during the prodromal period and did not subside. Skin lesions were flat and often black or dark purple. Respiratory complications were common and patients were febrile throughout disease. Death typically occurred 8–12 days post-fever onset. Hemorrhagic-type smallpox could be divided into early and late hemorrhagic-type smallpox. 
 <italic>The early form</italic> was characterized by hemorrhage (primarily subconjunctival) early in the disease course. Generalized erythema,petechiae, and ecchymosis within 2 days of fever and flat matter lesions formed across the entire body surface. Lesions turned purple by day 4 with death by day 6 as a result of cardiac and pulmonary complications. In the late form, hemorrhages occurred following rash development and death followed between8 and 10 days post-fever onset.
