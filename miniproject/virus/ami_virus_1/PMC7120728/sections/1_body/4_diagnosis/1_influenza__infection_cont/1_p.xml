<p id="Par25">In healthcare settings, patients under evaluation for influenza should be isolated, and standard, droplet, and contact precautions should be implemented [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Newer antigen-based RDAs that employ a digital scan of the test strip, and molecular assays that employisothermal amplification technology have improved sensitivity and specificity that more closely approximates highly sensitive and specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based assays [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. Acceptable sample types for influenza testing include nasopharyngeal swab or wash and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens. Individuals suspected of zoonotic influenza infection should have case evaluation and specimen testing coordinated through local or state public health authorities.
