<p id="Par26">Measles should be consideredin patients without preexisting immunity and a compatible febrile rash illness. Travel to a region with ongoing measles transmission or exposure to other individuals with a febrile rash illness should raise suspicion. Patients under evaluation for measles require isolation and implementation of standard, airborne, and contact precautions. Local or state health authorities should be contacted within 24Â hours to assist with confirmatory testing, case finding, and infection control. Measles is typically confirmed by measles-specific IgM serology or detection of measles RNA in a nasopharyngeal, throat, or urine specimen by RT-PCR [

A fourfold or greater rise in measles IgG titers between acute and convalescent samples tested 2 or more weeks apart can assist with diagnostic uncertainty. Virus can also be cultured from respiratory, blood, and urine specimens in appropriate public health laboratories.
