<p>The progenitor strains were segregated outside the two groups, advisably indicating the order of WNV strains emergence in time and route of introduction to Hungary. In contrast to Italy, where mostly endemic clades persist [
 <xref rid="B37-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], we reported two WNV strains simultaneously co-circulating in Hungary. In our study, human-derived sequences permitted detailed phylogenetic analysis, mainly due to the short length of sequences, which resulted in a highly polytomic tree structure. Therefore, we indicated the presence of the two major genetic subclades on a heat map structure (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00123-f005">Figure 5</xref>), which substantially supports the findings of the phylogenetic analysis regarding animal-derived sequences. We hypothesize the dominance of these two subclades in the affected countries in our region during the 2018 season, and quite possibly prior. However, retrospective studies may likely verify this assumption in other countries of the region as well.
