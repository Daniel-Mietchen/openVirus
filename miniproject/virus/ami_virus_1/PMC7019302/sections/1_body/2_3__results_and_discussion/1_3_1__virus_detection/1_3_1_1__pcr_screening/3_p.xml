<p>During the entomological surveillance regarding infected horse cases in Dunaföldvár, we revealed the presence of abundant larval breeding sites within close proximity to the horses (swimming pool with neglected water body and rainfall pools in artificial containers). 
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic> larvae in the swimming pool were found to be PCR-positive for WNV RNA. However, we measured an extremely low viral load, represented with PCR Ct values of 40–42, which prevented any successful 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> isolation or sequencing attempts. No other mosquito species were trapped or found around the site. The total set of 36 pools from overwintering mosquitoes (
 <italic>Culex pipiens</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles maculipennis</italic>, 
 <italic>Culiseta annulata</italic>) were found to be negative for WNV RNA, which supports the previous observation regarding low-level infection rates being sufficient for the persistence of WNV in overwintering mosquito populations [
 <xref rid="B33-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In addition to the role of mosquitoes, persistent bird infections should be also considered as a possible way of virus persistence and overwintering, as previously reported [
 <xref rid="B34-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, a more detailed and extensive sampling strategy likely will verify this observation in future studies. Metadata of this investigation are available as
