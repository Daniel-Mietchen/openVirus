<p>During the transmission seasons, between 2014 and 2017,

 <italic>n</italic> = 103 reported cases were examined using molecular diagnostic methods. Altogether, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 32 (40.0%) were positive by both diagnostic real-time and confirmatory nested RT-PCR assays. In contrast, during the transmission season of 2018, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 225 autochthonous and imported WNV cases were reported to the ECDC. In total, 
 <italic>n</italic> = 53 patients were found to be positive for WNV RNA by diagnostic PCR screening, while only those samples from 
 <italic>n</italic> = 46 patients (27.7%) were eventually confirmed by WNV nested RT-PCR and sequencing. Comprehensively, the results suggest a 1.4-fold increase in the number of PCR-positive cases within a single transmission period compared to the total number of cases from the previous four years (
