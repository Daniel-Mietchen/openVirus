<p>The geographic distribution of infected birds coincided with the zones regarding PCR-positive human cases (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00123-f003">Figure 3</xref>). From the 150 wild and exotic bird carcasses examined from January to November 2018, we identified 14 cases of WNV related mortality. The first WNV case was detected on 2 July in a hooded crow (
 <italic>Corvus cornix</italic>) carcass from Debrecen, while the last two positive bird cases were submitted on 4 September, including a white stork (
 <italic>Ciconia ciconia</italic>) and a peregrine falcon (
 <italic>Falco peregrinus</italic>) from Tiszaalpár and Pilisvörösvár, respectively. The wide range of affected species comprised the hooded crow (3), black headed gull (
 <italic>Chroicocephalus ridibundus</italic>) (1), greenfinch (
 <italic>Chloris chloris</italic>) (1), mute swan (
 <italic>Cygnus olor</italic>) (1), monk parakeet (
 <italic>Myiopsitta monachus</italic>) (2), great tit (
 <italic>Parus major</italic>) (1), goshawk (
 <italic>Accipiter gentilis</italic>) (1), African penguin (
 <italic>Spheniscus demersus</italic>) (1), kea (
 <italic>Nestor notabilis</italic>) (1), peregrine falcon (1), and the white stork (1). As expected from our earlier experience [

 <xref rid="B30-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], birds of prey were found affected, and sporadic mortality cases of hooded crows were identified at two locations. Although active monitoring of European corvid species was suggested by several studies [
 <xref rid="B31-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,
 <xref rid="B32-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], we only detected 6 specimens (1 magpie, 2 Eurasian jays, and 3 hooded crows) from the 130 examined corvid carcasses during the past 14 years of passive bird mortality monitoring. Nevertheless, starting an active surveillance of selected corvid species in the future may prove beneficial in the early detection of seasonal WNV circulation.
