<p>C6/36 Aedes albopictus cells (ATCC
 <bold>
  <sup>®</sup>
 </bold> CRL-1660™) and Vero E6 kidney cells (ATCC
 <bold>
  <sup>®</sup>
 </bold> CRL-1586™) were maintained in Eagle’s Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) and Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM; Lonza, Switzerland), respectively, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biosera, Nuaillé, France) and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Lonza, Switzerland). C6/36 cells were maintained at 28 °C, while Vero E6 cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> until reaching 70% confluency in a 24-well plate. An amount of 200 µL of supernatant from WNV PCR-positive mosquito pool homogenates, goshawk, and horse brain tissue homogenates were placed on the cell monolayer and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Thereafter, cells were supplemented with 1 mL of extra fresh medium and were monitored for cytopathogenic effect for seven days post-infection. After seven days, cells were frozen at −80 °C and thawed in order to lyse the cells, and 200 µL of the inoculums was used for three additional passages from the previous plates.
