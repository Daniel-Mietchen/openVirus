<p>Diagnostic WNV TaqMan real-time RT-PCR screening of human clinical specimens was carried out using primers and probes targeting the conserved region of the 5′-UTR and part of the capsid gene of the WNV genome. Primer and probe sequences were described previously [
 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00123" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The real-time PCR was carried out in a Light Cycler 2.0 instrument (Roche Life Science, Mannheim, Germany). The 20-µL total reaction volume contained 10 µL of template cDNA, 3.5 µL of ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Roche Life Science, Mannheim, Germany), 4.0 of µL ready-to-use hot start reaction mixture (Light Cycler

A second-round PCR assay consisted of 2.5 µL of first-round PCR product, 7.5 µL of ultra-pure DNase/RNase-free distilled water (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 12.5 µL of ready-to-use 2× My Taq Red Mix (Bioline, London, UK), and 2.0 pmol of each nested primer [

In full compliance to the manufacturer’s recommended guidance, 423-nucleotid-long nested RT-PCR amplicons were extracted by PCR Advanced™ PCR Clean-Up System (Viogen Biotek Corporation, New Taipei City, Taiwan). Bidirectional sequencing of the amplicons was performed using a 3500 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) and the BigDye
