<p>Based on our sequence and phylogenetic data, the situation of 2018 was more likely caused by endemic strains rather than recently introduced novel WNV strains. We identified the presence of multiple phylogenetic subclades (Balkans subclade and the Central/South-West European subgroup) in Hungary prior to the epidemic in 2018. Therefore, we hypothesize that the main trigger factors behind the outstanding case numbers during 2018 were likely the result of favorable environmental conditions for mosquito vectors and the increased contact of these mosquitoes with native animal and human populations. However, we do not have an integrated surveillance system in the country providing a long-term comprehensive dataset to support this theory. Therefore, at this level, it is just a logical hypothesis. Since previous studies pointed out Hungary as an important ecological niche for virus diversification and dissemination in our geographic area [

Our work also reflects the urgent need for a country-wide, organized surveillance system regarding the West Nile virus.
