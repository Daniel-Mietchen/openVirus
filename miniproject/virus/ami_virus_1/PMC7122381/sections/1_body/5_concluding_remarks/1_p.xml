<p id="Par28">At present, foodborne pathogen surveillance activities are usually the responsibility of local government departments and are non-existent or at sub-optimal level in both developed and developing countries, are confined to pathogens with known economic impact, and suffer from a lack of integration on a global scale. With the continuing globalization of the food market and changing trends in eating habits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], it is unsurprising that the general public is faced with an increasing rate of “food safety scares”. In order to turn the tide, a huge global effort in virus syndrome and diagnostic surveillance is required, which is justified in the light of global health impact in general, and timely with the development of new metagenomics tools that hold the promise of not only identifying viral pathogens, but possibly the complete microbiome in a single assay. This does not apply to foodborne viral diseases alone. The interrelatedness of animal and human health with global interconnectedness in the twenty-first century is drawing all health related issues together as never before [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. The combination of sustained pathogen surveillance in animals, humans, plants, environment and food alike with next generation sequencing approaches and a standardized global analytical framework with associated clinical and epidemiological data would provide insight into pathogen incidence, level of co-infections and their correlation to clinical disease instead of focusing on one or a few pathogens as is classically done (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">9.3</xref>). This information is crucial in deciding which pathogens provide the most substantial health risk, for evidence-based risk assessments for policy development and to implement preventive measures.
