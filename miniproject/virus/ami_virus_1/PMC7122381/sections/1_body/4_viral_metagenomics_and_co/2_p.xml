<p id="Par27">Improvements in the microbiological safety of food have largely been shaped through response to disease outbreaks. Resources for foodborne diseases have been directed mainly to well-known foodborne pathogens and monitoring in the food chain has been implemented based on a farm-to-fork approach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] by encouraging improvement of hygiene measures and incorporating Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles that identify potential contamination hazards and focus on subsequent control and prevention. The latter requires methods for detection of foodborne pathogens and evidence of their disease association. Most of the microbiological quality control criteria on a global scale rely on standard counts of coliform bacteria as a measure of faecal contamination. Needless to say that these criteria are inadequate for protection against foodborne viruses. Viral metagenomics would theoretically be an option to obtain information regarding viral presence in food. However, microbiological testing of food in general has some limitations as a control option. These are constraints of time, as results are not available until several days after testing as well as difficulties related to sampling as small food samples may not be representative for entire lots, analytical methods and the use of indicator organisms and reference standards. Therefore, it has been argued that there are no practical systems for providing safety or assurance of safety by microbiological end-product testing and viral metagenomics approaches would not change the existing pitfalls.
