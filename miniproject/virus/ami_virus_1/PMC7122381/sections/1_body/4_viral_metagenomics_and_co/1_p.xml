<p id="Par26">For food safety at present, an integrated system for monitoring of specific food safety threats exists in Europe, which involves sampling and pathogen characterization largely through species specific assays for a subset of major pathogens across the food chain, and linking and analysis of these data to study trends, detect diffuse outbreaks, and monitor effects of control measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>]. Molecular typing plays a crucial role in this system, but relies among others on the willingness of clinicians to refer patients for laboratory diagnostics and of these laboratories to refer isolates to public health laboratories for typing. The changing clinical practice, with rapid transition from culture-based methods to molecular detection, challenges this decade-old model of disease surveillance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>]. In addition, these surveillance systems are less suited to capture the “new generation” of outbreaks, related with the global food market, as illustrated by recent examples of international diffuse food-borne outbreaksshowing the vulnerability of the European population and industry for novel food-borne diseases [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">127</xref>]. The currently used microbiological control criteria are not suitable for monitoring of presence or absence of emerging disease risks, and recent studies have shown vast underestimation of levels of contamination for many human pathogens, but also raise questions about the interpretation of molecular detection data in relation to consumer risk [
