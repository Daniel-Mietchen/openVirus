<p id="Par4">Foodborne pathogens share the mode of transmission (fecal-oral) and their ability to infect hosts following oral inoculation. Symptoms may arise from replication and the ensuing damage and inflammatory responses in the intestinal tract, but also from generalised infection as observed for instance for orally transmitted hepatitis viruses (hepatitis A and E), or neurotropic enteroviruses. The greatest burden of foodborne viral disease has been attributed to noroviruses and hepatitis A (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">9.1</xref>). In addition to these endemic pathogens, the potential for foodborne transmission is a key question in every emerging disease outbreak. In fact, zoonotic emerging infections can be introduced into the population through food preparation or consumption, although these risks are minimal with proper food preparation. Commonly studied in relation to food are viruses from the families Picornaviridae (polio-, entero-, coxsackie-, echo-, and hepatitis A viruses), Reoviridae (rotaviruses), Adenoviridae (adenoviruses 40, 41 primarily), Caliciviridae (noro- and sapoviruses), Hepeviridae (hepatitis E virus), and Astroviridae ( Mamastroviruses). They replicate initially in the intestinal tract, are environmentally stable, are shed in high numbers in the faeces of infected individuals with up to 10
 <sup>11</sup> virus particles per gram of stool being documented, and are highly infectious with only 10â€“100 viral particles required for transmission [

The Food epidemiology reference group (FERG) of the World Health Organisation is currently preparing a global burden of foodborne disease estimate, but the underlying systematic reviews have already signalled large data gaps, particularly from resource limited regions [
