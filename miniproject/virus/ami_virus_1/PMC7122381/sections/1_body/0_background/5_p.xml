<p id="Par6">As in every disease outbreak, including foodborne viral disease outbreaks, the following are some of the most urgent questions to answer: Is the group of ill persons normal for the time of year and/or geographic area or is something extraordinary occurring? If so, which pathogen(s) is causing the disease? Who gets infected? How do people get infected? What is the source of infection? What are transmission routes? How can infection be prevented, treated and/or contained? An integrated multidisciplinary approach utilizing expertise in several areas will be required to understand the dynamics of foodborne viral infection and to mitigate potential effects of future threats. Major challenges regarding recognizing, detecting, characterizing, and effectively responding to foodborne viral threats to health exist, which will be outlined in this chapter, with a focus on how genomics-based tools are a potential candidate to respond to some of these challenges in the field of foodborne viruses.</p>
