<p id="Par3"> Foodborne viral transmission can occur by consumption of food handled by infected food handlers, by contamination of food during the production process (for instance through contaminated water), or by consumption of products of animal origin harbouring a zoonotic virus (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">9.1</xref>). Food handler–associated foodborne illness results from the manual preparation of food by an infected food handler shedding viruses, usually resulting in limited outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], although their size may be substantial depending on the nature of the contamination. A problem is that food-handlers may transmit viruses before showing symptoms, or have asymptomatic infections [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Food contamination can also occur during primary production, as has been observed in particular in fresh produce such as berries and green onions, or bivalve filter-feeding shellfish. Here the nature of contamination is dependent on location of the production area and nature of sewage contamination. In contrast to food handler–associated contamination, production process contamination events may involve multiple pathogens present in sewage, including animal viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Zoonotic foodborne infection occurs when meat, organs, or other products from an infected animal are consumed. For viruses, this may be the least common mode of transmission, although the potential for such transmission is a cause for concern with every emerging disease outbreak.
