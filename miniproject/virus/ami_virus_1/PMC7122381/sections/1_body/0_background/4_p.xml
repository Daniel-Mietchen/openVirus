<p id="Par5">A combination of factors is responsible for the lack of knowledge of the true incidence of foodborne viral illness. A case of foodborne illness is only identified when a patient falls ill, seeks medical help and undergoes diagnostic testing which leads to identification of the aetiological agent. For some pathogens with long incubation periods (e.g. hepatitis A and E), even when diagnosed, identification of a food source may be extremely difficult due to the long delay between exposure and symptom onset. A third factor compromising the ability to detect foodborne disease is the high rate of asymptomatic infections associated with some pathogens. Therefore, linked cases are difficult to detect. These challenges in diagnosis of foodborne diseases are illustrated by the fact that “unrecognized agents” account for up to 81 % of all U.S. foodborne illnesses and hospitalizations and 64 % of deaths [

Rapid population growth and urbanization, deforestation, invasion of previously pristine habitats for agriculture, and increasing demand for animal protein all likely contribute to increased emergence of novel infectious disease threats, while climate change and the increasing global connectedness and mobility facilitate their global spread [

Consequently, the pattern of disease outbreaks has changed, from localized clusters of disease in confined populations to dispersed outbreaks with excellent opportunity for further transmission. Similarly, a transition is observed from localized foodborne epidemics to diffuse international foodborne outbreaks due to globalization of the food market [

The foodborne nature is often disguised by person-to-person transmission after the initial infection(s) because of the highly infectious nature of most foodborne viral pathogens. Some of these viruses are of major public health concern amongst others because of their food- or waterborne nature, low infectious dose required for infection and serious health-related implications and associated costs.
