<p id="Par15">As described above , many viruses are able to spread via the faecal-oral route and many more can be detected in human stool in both healthy and diseased adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. Frequently, the mode of transmission, disease potential and incidence levels of newly recognized viruses detected in stool samples are unknown but potential for food-borne transmission exists. How do we deal with that?
