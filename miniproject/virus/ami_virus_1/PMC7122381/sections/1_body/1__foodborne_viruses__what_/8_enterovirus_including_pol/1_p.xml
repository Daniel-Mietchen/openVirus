<p id="Par14"> Enteroviruses are a genus of positive-stranded RNA viruses in the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> with a genome of ~7.5 kb. They are divided in at least 12 species containing over 100 (sero)types. Enteroviruses affect millions of people worldwide each year, are spread through the faecal-oral route, and cause a wide variety of symptoms ranging from mild respiratory illness (common cold), hand, foot and mouth disease, acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, severe neonatal sepsis-like disease, and acute flaccid paralysis. Historically, the most prominent member was poliovirus, causing a disabling paralytic illness that has largely been eradicated in most countries through vaccination. Human enterovirus 71 (EV71) epidemics have affected many countries in recent years. Infection commonly causes hand, foot and mouth disease in children, but can result in neurological and cardiorespiratory complications in severe cases. Genotypic changes through inter- and intratypic recombination have been observed, giving rise to serious outbreaks with mortality rate ranging from 10 to 25.7 % [

With the emergence of highly pathogenic EV 71 and widespread epidemics, there is great interest in development of an effective EV 71 vaccine and antiviral strategies. In addition, enterovirus 68 has recently emerged as an important cause of severe respiratory disease worldwide [
