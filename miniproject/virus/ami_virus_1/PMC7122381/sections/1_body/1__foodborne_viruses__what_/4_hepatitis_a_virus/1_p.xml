<p id="Par10">Hepatitis A is a liver disease caused by hepatitis A virus, a non-enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>. Humans are the only naturally known reservoir for hepatitis A viruses and ~5 % of foodborne viral disease is attributed to hepatitis A virus infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. The virus is spread via the faecal-oral route and the disease is closely associated with inadequate sanitation, poor personal hygiene, and limited access to clean water [

In developing countries, most children are infected with hepatitis A virus by the age of 10 years and the disease is usually asymptomatic in this age group. Epidemics in these countries are practically non-existent as older children and adults are immune to reinfection. In countries with improved sanitary conditions and transitional economies, the rate of infection in young children is lower, resulting in a higher susceptibility of older children and adults and larger outbreaks of disease. The incubation period is 14–28 days and symptoms range from mild to severe, and can include fever, malaise, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal discomfort, dark-coloured urine and jaundice which last for up to 8 weeks. Some 10–15 % of people experience a recurrence of symptoms during the 6 months after the initial infection and fulminant hepatitis and acute liver failure occurs although rarely and is most common in the elderly [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In developed countries, hepatitis A infection is uncommon and predominantly associated with high-risk groups, such as people travelling to areas of high endemicity. Hepatitis A viruses are stable in the environment and can resist food-production processes routinely used to inactivate and/or control bacterial pathogens. Seroprevalence data indicate tens of millions infections yearly and an estimated 1.4 million clinical cases occur yearly worldwide which have significant social and economic impact [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. Improved sanitation, food safety and vaccination are the most effective ways to prevent hepatitis A virus infection [
