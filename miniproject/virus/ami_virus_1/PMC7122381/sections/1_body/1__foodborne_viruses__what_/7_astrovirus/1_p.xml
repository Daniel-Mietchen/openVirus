<p id="Par13"> Astroviruses (Family 
 <italic>Astroviridae</italic>) are non-enveloped positive-stranded RNA viruses with a genome of ~7–8 kb. Classically, eight human serotypes have been described, although since 2008 a large increase in detection of different human astrovirus variants is observed. Human astroviruses spread via the faecal-oral route via contaminated water and/or food and are an important cause of gastroenteritis in young children worldwide. Most astrovirus infections are not severe, self-limited and do not require hospitalization. Disease symptoms can include diarrhoea, followed by nausea, vomiting, fever, malaise and abdominal pain, which last for 3–4 days. The majority of children have acquired astrovirus antibodies by the age of 5 and, looking at the pattern of disease, it suggests that antibodies provide protection through adult life, until the antibody titre begins to decline later in life [
