<p id="Par7">Viruses pose a substantial global health burden to humans and the list of human viral infections is ever-changing and continually growing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Mortality in humans from recently emerged viral diseases ranges from a few hundred in the case of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to millions of people from acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We are continuously facing novel pathogens, most of which are zoonotic or originated as zoonoses before adapting to humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], a proportion of which are likely transmitted via food and/or water [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Breakthroughs in the field of metagenomics have had far-reaching effects on the identification and characterization of newly emerging viral pathogens and on the recognition that a growing number of diseases that were once attributed to unknown causes are actually directly or indirectly caused by viral agents [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Many previously unknown viruses have been characterized in human stool in recent years including sali-, cosa-, bufa-, picobirna-, reco-, anello-, hepatitis E, astro-, and polyomaviruses of which the clinical disease spectrum, route of transmission, and foodborne nature remains to be elucidated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. For some of the “older” viruses, such as norovirus and hepatitis A virus, the foodborne risk of transmission is clearly recognized, for others such as adeno- and astroviruses the picture is less clear.
