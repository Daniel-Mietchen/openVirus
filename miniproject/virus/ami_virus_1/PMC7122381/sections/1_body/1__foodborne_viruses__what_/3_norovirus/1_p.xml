<p id="Par9"> Noroviruses are positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the family . The genus Norovirus is divided into seven genogroups (GI-GVII) that are further subdivided into numerous genotypes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. The GI, II, and IV are capable of infecting humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], and GII.4 has been associated with the majority of global outbreaks since the mid-1990s. The other genogroups have not been detected in humans, but systematic studies evaluating their role are lacking. Norovirus infections are a leading cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks among all age groups and are transmitted directly from person to person and indirectly via contaminated water and food [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. They are extremely contagious requiring low viral loads for transmission and are common in closed settings such as healthcare facilities, cruise ships, and nursing homes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The infection can cause nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhoea and abdominal pain, although asymptomatic infections are common [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare in developed countries. Ahmed and coworkers noted a gradient of decreasing prevalence from community to outpatient to inpatient groups, which supports the notion that norovirus is a more common cause of mild acute gastroenteritis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], although in the USA norovirus infections result in ~70,000 hospitalizations and 800 deaths yearly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. In developing countries, noroviruses are estimated to cause more than 200,000 deaths annually among children younger than 5 years of age, and it is predicted that these viruses will become the predominant cause of diarrhoea in all age groups worldwide once rotavirus infection is controlled through vaccination [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The economic impact of foodborne related norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks is high with an estimated $2 billion healthcare related costs in the USA alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>].
