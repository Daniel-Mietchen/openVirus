<p id="Par12">Adenoviruses (Family 
 <italic>Adenoviridae</italic>) are non-enveloped single-stranded DNA viruses with a genome of ~26–48 kb. Adenoviruses infecting humans belong to the genus Mastadenovirus and over 50 serotypes are differentiated based on neutralization assays. Adenoviruses are highly stable in the environment and are thought to spread via respiratory droplets and the faecal-oral route. Adenovirus infections are usually subclinical but certain types are associated with disease which can range from respiratory disease, keratoconjunctivitis, to gastrointestinal disease [

Especially human adenoviruses F types 40 and 41 are associated with diarrhoea in young children with acute gastroenteritis and are another major cause of infantile viral diarrhoea in developing countries, following rota- and noroviruses. Symptoms include watery diarrhoea with mucus, fever, dehydration, abdominal pain, and vomiting lasting for 3–11 days [
