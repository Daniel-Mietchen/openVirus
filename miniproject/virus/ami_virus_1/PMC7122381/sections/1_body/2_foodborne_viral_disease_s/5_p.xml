<p id="Par20">In conjunction with the amount of surveillance data that is required and the huge amount of data generated by next-generation sequencing, the availability of relatively simple user-friendly bioinformatics tools, curated databases of full and partial viral genome sequences, analysis pipelines, and computational infrastructure are crucial and at present largely under development. One example is COMPARE [A COllaborative Management Platform for detection and Analyses of (Re-)emerging and foodborne outbreaks in Europe] which is a collaboration between founding members of the Global Microbial Identifier (GMI) initiative (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.globalmicrobialidentifier.org</ext-link>) and institutions with hands-on experience in outbreak detection and response. GMI was established in 2011 with the vision to develop the potential of breakthrough sequencing technologies for the field of infectious diseases through a joint research and development agenda, with applications in clinical and public health laboratories across the world. In order to achieve that long-term goal, the GMI group aims to promote development and deployment of novel applications, data sharing and analysis systems across the diversity of pathogens, health domains and sectors. The COMPARE project is set up to put this vision into action in Europe. It aims to improve rapid identification, containment and mitigation of emerging infectious diseases and foodborne outbreaks by developing a cross-sector and cross-pathogen analytical framework with globally linked data and an information sharing platform that integrates methods for collection, processing and analysing clinical samples with associated (clinical and epidemiological) data with state of the art technologies, such as next generation sequencing, for the generation of actionable information for relevant authorities in human and animal health and food safety.
