<p id="Par18">With the increasing resolution and use of molecular detection and sequencing, there is great potential for integrated genomic surveillance. The NoroNet network (

In depth bioinformatics analysis of data collected over the course of 10 years has shown the potential merit of genomic surveillance for detection of diffuse foodborne outbreaks [

While these systems target individual pathogens, viral metagenomics tools are a potential candidate to respond to the challenge of obtaining epidemiological estimates on the global disease burden and associated health-related costs of a whole range of (potential) foodborne viruses. Sequence-independent amplification of nucleic acids combined with next-generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses or viral metagenomics is a relatively new promising strategy for rapid identification of pathogens in clinical and public health settings. The detection of viruses using an unselective metagenomics approach has been hampered by the generally small size of virus genomes compared to bacterial or eukaryotic hosts. The detection is facilitated by enriching for viruses using filtration and nuclease treatments to remove bacterial and human nucleic acids whereas viral nucleic acid is retained through protection by the viral capsids and/or membrane envelopes. In contrast to classical molecular detection techniques that identify a single virus species or virus family, viral metagenomics allows the characterization of numerous known pathogens simultaneously and also novel pathogens that elude conventional testing. This approach has already resulted in the identification of a plethora of previously unknown human and animal viruses, many of which have been found in diarrhoea specimens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>] with the added value of virus type information becoming available simultaneously. In addition, the cost of next- generation sequencing is dropping steadily and steeply each year outpacing Moore’s Law. Although computational resources required for analysis of the vast amount of data are often not included in the calculations, the overall costs will likely be able to compete with conventional viral diagnostic molecular methods in the not so distant future in terms of cost and sensitivity, although not yet in speed.
