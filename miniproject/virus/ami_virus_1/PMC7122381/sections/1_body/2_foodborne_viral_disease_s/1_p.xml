<p id="Par16">Adequate health crisis management is largely dependent on early detection of potential public health threats. At present, early cluster identification is notoriously difficult as many diseases are not notifiable, diagnostics can be relatively slow and biased for what we know, and clusters are not recognized when patients attend different healthcare facilities. One of the most overlooked but crucial aspects in identifying a potential foodborne related incident is the role that medical practitioners, veterinarians and epidemiologists, in other words the gatekeepers play in recognizing idiopathic disease cases or more than average occurrences of certain disease symptoms [

This is not a trivial task as these professionals need to recognize relatively uncommon or completely new infectious diseases, on the basis of changing clinical and epidemiological trends or a “gut-feeling”, as syndromic surveillance systems targeting non-respiratory disease are sparse. Integrated networks for syndrome surveillance in combination with routine diagnostic surveillance activities for known pathogens in theory would aid in identification of threats which may otherwise fly under the radar. To date, however, no precise and consistent global baseline syndromic surveillance exists, with the exception of the sentinel surveillance system for influenza. Reliable estimates of the global burden of foodborne viruses are important in order to assess their impact, to advise policy-makers on cost-effective interventions [
