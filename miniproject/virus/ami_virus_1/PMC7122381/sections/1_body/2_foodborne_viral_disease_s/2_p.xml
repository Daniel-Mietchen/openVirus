<p id="Par17">Classically, many viral pathogens were detected through culture-based and immunological methods, which shifted to molecular detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in more recent years ([

 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">9.2</xref>). The clinical molecular virology field was greatly affected by the development of applications involving viruses that do not proliferate in standard cell cultures and quantitative molecular assays (real time PCRs) that provided medically useful tools in assessing viral load, patient prognosis, treatment response, and antiviral resistance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>]. Currently, the field is moving towards assays that allow detection of multiple viruses. Multiplex PCR assays allow detection of a number of different viruses in a single reaction (e.g. ID-Tag Respiratory Virus Panel Assay identifying influenza A virus [H1, H3, and H5]; influenza B virus; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, 3, and 4; adenovirus; rhinovirus/enterovirus; RSV A; RSV B; hMPV; and coronavirus [SARS-CoV, NL63, 229E, OC44, and HKU1] [TM Bioscience, Toronto, Canada]). Generic PCR assays are PCR assays specific for a broader taxonomic range than one virus species (e.g. a whole genus or family of viruses), which allows detection of new virus species within already known viral families [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. These technologies are aiming to decrease time and effort in demonstrating the presence of a known pathogen in clinical samples, although sometimes at the cost of losing some sensitivity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The limitations of the multiplex or generic PCR assays become readily apparent as multiple different viruses or previously unknown viruses can be present in complex biological samples and continuous updating of the assays is required as viruses, especially RNA viruses, are constantly evolving. In addition, in a diagnostic setting discrimination between subtypes or genera of viruses requires additional labour-intensive procedures based on partial genome characterization as is currently done for example for noroviruses, hepatitis A viruses and enteroviruses, for final diagnosis.
