<p id="Par19">To obtain insight into the baseline circulation of foodborne viruses and the burden of associated disease, a large and systematic set of enteric samples from around the globe from a large range of different individuals with and without (underlying) disease should be analysed. Human exposure to viral infection and susceptibility to virus-associated disease is dependent on numerous factors, including age, lifestyle, diet, geographic location, climate and season, pre-existing immunity and even host microbiome [

Furthermore, the human gut virome is not static and will vary over time due to ongoing zoonotic transmission events from animal reservoirs, increasing globalization, changes in food preference, demographic shifts in human populations, and human intervention strategies [

However, with the foreseen further implementation of genomic technologies in routine clinical settings, a huge potential surveillance repository is developing. Its validity will depend on the ability to capture meaningful metadata, but the NoroNet and CaliciNet examples have shown that widespread hidden foodborne outbreaks can be detected with sequence data with minimal associated data. Obviously, the validity of such surveillance programs should be carefully evaluated against the current standards to ensure that they provide the necessary information in a timely, efficient, and cost-effective manner [
