<p id="Par21">Assuming the major hurdles towards implementation can be overcome, the combination of sustained virus surveillance (both syndrome and diagnostic) with next generation sequencing approaches and a standardized global analytical framework with associated clinical and epidemiological data would provide insight into (1) pathogens or combinations thereof involved in disease burden, (2) as yet unidentified pathogens and zoonotic events, (3) effects of vaccination or other interventions on incidence levels and whether other pathogens fill the niche that vaccination leaves behind, and (4) geographic difference in virus-associated disease burden. This knowledge would in turn guide development and deployment of vaccines and other intervention strategies. Well, everyone has a wish-list and end-goals â€¦ what is the practical translation of viral metagenomics in foodborne viral diseases at present?</p>
