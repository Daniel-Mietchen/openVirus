<p id="Par25">The new developments in data generation with new sequencing possibilities in combination with epidemiological data provide a challenge for existing platforms aiming to enlarge the knowledge on geographical and temporal trends in the emergence and spread of (foodborne) virus infections, such as the ECDC Food- and Waterborne Epidemiology Intelligence Platform (FWD-EPIS) [

In addition to these existing systems, there is a multitude of other existing (inter)national databases and networks that have in common that they are widely accepted and used by the scientific and public health community and authorities for exchange of sequence-based data and other relevant structured and semi-structured information of relevance to human health, animal health and/or food safety. None of these is currently capable of handling the complex data from next generation sequencing platforms, but ensuring interoperability of these databases and compatibility of analytical workflows and data information sharing systems will be crucial in order to ensure translation to actionable data.
