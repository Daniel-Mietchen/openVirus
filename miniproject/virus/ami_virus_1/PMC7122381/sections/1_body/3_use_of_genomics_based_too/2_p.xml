<p id="Par23">At present, viral metagenomics is mostly used in hindsight to obtain whole viral genome sequences for tracking-and-tracing purposes and to obtain epidemiological information after the virus was identified by more standard molecular assays. In epidemiology, identifying pathways of infectious disease transmission allows amongst others quantification of incubation periods, heterogeneity in transmission rates, and duration of infectiousness, which are important parameters to identify potential points of control and predict future spread of viruses. However, foodborne viral outbreaks are notoriously difficult to recognize, and tracking and tracing potential contacts is logistically challenging and often inconclusive. A variety of data sources can be exploited for attempting to uncover the spatio-temporal dynamics and transmission pathways of a pathogen in a population, by combining disease symptoms, data from contact tracing, results of diagnostic tests and, increasingly, pathogen genetic sequences [

Identification of related nucleotide sequences of viruses in patients, also referred to as cluster detection, is an important tool in outbreak investigations in modern day public health and clinical laboratories especially in cases that prove difficult to unravel such as diffuse food-borne outbreaks involving several countries [

Preferentially, cluster detection-based approaches and epidemiological inferences are done on whole viral genome sequences, as it provides the most detailed view. Next generation sequencing techniques have been used for tracking purposes in hepatitis A virus (HAV) foodborne outbreaks showing that whole HAV genome analysis offers a more complete genetic characterization of HAV strains than short subgenomic regions [
