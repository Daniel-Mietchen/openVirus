<p id="Par22">Syndrome surveillance has been used for early detection of disease outbreaks, including food-related incidents, to follow the size, spread, and tempo of outbreaks, to monitor disease trends, and to provide reassurance that an outbreak has not occurred. An example is an outbreak of acute norovirus gastroenteritis in a boarding school in Shanghai in 2012, where a diarrhoea syndrome surveillance system covering a dozen sentinel hospitals in Shanghai reported to the Pudong District Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( PDCDC) that more than 100 students at a boarding school had developed symptoms of diarrhoea and vomiting within 3 days [

A current practical translation of viral metagenomics, which due to its unselective nature allows the characterization of numerous known pathogens simultaneously, is to use it as an identification tool to unravel the causative viral agent. In the cases in Shanghai, an epidemiological study focusing on a number of viruses (and bacteria) with standard molecular assays subsequently implicated norovirus as the etiological agent [
