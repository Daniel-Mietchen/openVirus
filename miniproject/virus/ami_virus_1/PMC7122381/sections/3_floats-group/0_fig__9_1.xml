  <p> Foodborne viral illness. Foodborne viral transmission can occur by consumption of food handled by infected food handlers, by contamination of food during the production process (for instance through contaminated water), or by consumption of products of animal origin harbouring a zoonotic virus. Foodborne pathogens share the mode of transmission (fecal-oral) and their ability to infect hosts following oral inoculation. Symptoms may arise from replication and the ensuing damage and inflammatory responses in the intestinal tract, but also from generalised infection as observed for instance for orally transmitted hepatitis viruses</p>
