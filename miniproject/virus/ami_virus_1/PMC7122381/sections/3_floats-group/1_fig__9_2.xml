  <p> Viral detection methods. Classically, many viral pathogens were detected through culture-based and immunological methods, which shifted to molecular detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in more recent years. Currently, the field is moving towards assays that allow detection of multiple viruses by multiplexing real time PCRs and application of viral metagenomics tools</p>
