<p>An outstanding question is the specific circumstances by which the 2009 H1N1 virus transmitted from swine to humans. Both IAV-S sequence data and epidemiological data in humans support swine-to-human transmission occurring in Central Mexico [

 <xref rid="ppat.1008259.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, by the time the first human cases were detected by surveillance, the virus had already diversified genetically, evidence of transmission in humans for several months [

There are multiple challenges to understanding the humanâ€“animal interface for IAVs: (1) There is a need for coordination between animal health and public health research, (2) the genomics of host switches are too complex to accurately predict zoonotic potential from genetic sequence alone, and (3) spillover events can be rare and difficult to detect via traditional modes of virological surveillance, particularly in developing countries.
