<p>Notably, as soon as the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus became established in humans, the virus disseminated back to swine in at least 30 countries, spanning Africa, Asia, North and South America, Europe, and Australia [

In addition to seeding genetically novel viruses in swine populations globally, the human-origin viruses frequently reassort with other IAV-S lineages. The proliferation of new reassortants complicates control in swine, introducing new strains that poorly match those included in commercially available vaccines, and presents new risks for humans. As a case in point, novel IAV-S reassortants with segments derived from human-origin pandemic viruses have been associated with over 450 zoonotic infections in the US since 2011, largely in the context of agricultural fairs [
