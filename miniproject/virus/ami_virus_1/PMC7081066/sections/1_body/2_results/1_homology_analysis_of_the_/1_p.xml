<p>Phylogenetic analysis of the spike protein sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and Bat-CoVs, SARS-CoV is shown in Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>. The results are in agreement with recent reports of an independent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 from a Bat-CoV, different from the spillover which led to the introduction of SARS-CoV, being the Bat-CoV of 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> the probable ancestor of this new virus (Wong et al., 2020[
 <xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]). Indeed, the sequences of the whole spike of this Bat-CoV and of SARS-CoV-2 share 97.7 % identity (Figure 1
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">(Fig. 1)</xref>). More divergence is found however in the S1 subunit, particularly in the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the different spike proteins. SARS-CoV and Bat-CoV from 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic> (originally signaled as the most closely related virus to SARS-CoV-2) exhibit several amino acid substitutions and deletions in the RBD compared to SARS-CoV-2. The RBD of Bat-CoV from 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic>, although more closely related to the one of SAS-CoV-2, also displayed several amino acid substitutions (Figure 2
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">(Fig. 2)</xref>).
