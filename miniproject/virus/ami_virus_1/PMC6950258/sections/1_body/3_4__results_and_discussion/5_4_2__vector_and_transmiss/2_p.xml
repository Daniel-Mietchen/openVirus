<p>As most prevention strategies are mainly based on personal protective behavior, often requiring behavioral modification and significant awareness among the population, novel entomological approaches to cut off transmission routes for DENV, ZIKV, and CHIKV disease gain increasing attention in public health. Control of disease-carrying mosquito populations through the blockage of virus replication within 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes showed a significant reduction in the level of virus transmission by 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B48-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Indicating promising results in field trials and laboratory research, scientists are aiming to minimize the risk of (re-)emerging epidemics in pilot projects throughout the Pacific region. Through the infection of 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> using 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bacteria strains, the vector competence for viruses, including ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV, can be strongly reduced by inhibiting virus replication inside the mosquitoes, even under highly conducive environmental conditions [
 <xref rid="B49-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Considering the climate-sensitivity of mosquito vectors and mosquito-borne viruses, such programs may benefit from knowledge on local environmental suitability levels and transmission thresholds, e.g., by targeting local transmission pockets during high seasons to release 
 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infected mosquitoes and ensure effective establishment. Recent achievements of the World Mosquito Program (

 <italic>Wolbachia</italic> method, are described in
