<p>Based on the paucity of research specifically aiming at investigating diseases transmitted by vectors, more specifically mosquito-borne dieseases in the Pacific region in a climate change context, a study was performed on a sample of recent case studies and projects focusing on vector-transmitted diseases in the Pacific region, with an emphasis to mosquito-borne diseases. The reason for this focus is because such diseases are not as widely documented in the Pacific region as other communicable diseases are. The study consisted of three main elements:
 <list list-type="simple">
  <list-item>
   <label>(a)</label>
   <p>an analysis of the literature of case reports and research projects specifically concerned with the connections between climate change and vector-borne diseases in the Pacific region;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(b)</label>
   <p>the identification of examples of recent mosquito-borne outbreaks and public health activities in the Pacific region, as case studies;</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <label>(c)</label>
   <p>the description of their nature, i.e., the main factors driving the outbreak, the projectsâ€™ focus, and their main challenges and implications for outbreak management and control in public health</p>
