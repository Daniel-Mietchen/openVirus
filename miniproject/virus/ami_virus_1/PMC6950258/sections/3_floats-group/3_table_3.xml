    <td colspan="5" align="left" valign="middle" style="border-top:solid thin;border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1">Aim: Research shows that the global temperature rise, changes in precipitation patterns and increasing global trade and travel facilitate range expansion of MBD, and may further extend transmission seasons in endemic areas, like the Pacific region. As a consequence, emerging diseases, such as ZIKV disease, have successfully expanded to geographical areas where only DENV epidemics used to occur, including the Fiji Islands. The project aimed at exploring ZIKV environmental suitability and potential of (re-)emergence in the Fiji Islands looking at population susceptibility, variations in temperature, and rainfall levels on the main island Viti Levu.</td>

    <td colspan="5" align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1">Methods: Meteorological data from 11 weather stations (Ø minimum and maximum temperature °C, total precipitation mm/km2, 1960–2018) and reports on confirmed DENV and ZIKV infection (2007–2018) were acquired on a monthly basis in order to describe overall meteorological and epidemiological trends in Viti Levu, Fiji. Additionally, evidence from recent ZIKV serological studies was acquired to explore overall ZIKV susceptibility levels in the Fiji population. Environmental DENV and ZIKV epidemic exposure was then assessed using pathogen-specific thermal thresholds derived from laboratory studies (ZIKV = 22.6–34.8 °C, DENV = 17.8–34.6 °C) [

    <td colspan="5" align="left" valign="middle" style="border-bottom:solid thin" rowspan="1">Key findings: Recent findings could only confirm low-level transmission of ZIKV in Fiji during 2013–2017, indicating low-level herd immunity in the Fiji population [

     <xref rid="B43-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Overall transmission season could be observed from November to June (warm and wet season), with highest counts of DENV and ZIKV infection recorded in Fiji’s densely populated areas, mainly after rainfall events. Moreover, meteorological records (1960–2018: Ø Tmin =20.8 [+0.3] °C; Ø Tmax = 29.1 [+0.3] °C) indicate suitable temperature conditions for DENV year-round transmission since 1960, especially in Fiji’s main urban areas in the South-East and North-West of Viti Levu, whereas only seasonal ZIKV transmission risk could be identified, especially due to minimum temperature levels dropping beyond the ZIKV transmission threshold levels.

     <xref rid="B44-ijerph-16-05114" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and as temperature rises, there is a risk of ZIKV re-emergence in Fiji, with potentially extended transmission season in the near future. The findings demonstrate that ZIKV must still be considered a potential health threat in the Pacific, although no infected cases have been reported recently, which makes awareness raising and epidemic preparedness a public health priority.
