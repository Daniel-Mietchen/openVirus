<p>Arumowot virus (AMTV; Bunyaviridae) is a sandfly (Phlebotomus)-borne virus first isolated from a mosquito, Culex antennatus, from Sudan in 1963 [
 <xref rid="B95-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Several sandfly-borne viruses including Sandfly Fever Sicilian (SFSV) (13–16% seroprevalence), Sandfly Fever Naples (SFNV) (14–33%), Arumowot (1.4–16.7%), SudAn. 754–61 (17–28%), and Karimabad viruses (1–4%) have been detected in sera collected in 1975 from different parts of Sudan [

 <xref rid="B97-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. In 1988, the seroprevalence of SFSV and SFNV in central Sudan was 54% and 34%, respectively, and 53% and 32% in northern Sudan in 1989 [
