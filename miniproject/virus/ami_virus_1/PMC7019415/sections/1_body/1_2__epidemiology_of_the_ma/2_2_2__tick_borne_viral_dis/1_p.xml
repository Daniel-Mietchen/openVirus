<p>Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV; Nairoviridae) is endemic in Sudan, and infections have been documented throughout the middle region of the country (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00081-f007">Figure 7</xref>). The seroprevalence of CCHF in the northern province was 5% in 1989 [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Two outbreaks of CCHFV infection occurred in central and southern Sudan in 2008 and 2009 with a 57% case fatality rate. Interestingly, despite the short interval between the two epidemics, they were caused by two different strains of CCHFV, the Mauritanian ArD39554, and one strain belonging to the Group III lineage (strains commonly found across several African countries) [

 <xref rid="B87-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Two nosocomial outbreaks were reported among healthcare providers who were attending to CCHF patients in endemic areas in southwestern and central Sudan in 2008 and 2010 [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. The circulation of CCHFV in southwestern and central Sudan has been reported in cattle populations in 2013 and 2015, with a concomitant outbreak of CCHF in the human population in 2013 and 2014 [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. CCHFV was detected in various Sudanese domestic animals from different areas of the country, showing that there is active transmission of the CCHFV in most of Sudan, with seroprevalence between 7% and 21% [

 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Tick infestation, age, area, and animal breeding were risk factors for CCHFV infection among animals. Further, animals following an open grazing system were 27 times more likely to become infected [

 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. CCHFV has been isolated from pools of tick including several species removed from Sudanese sheep exported to Saudi Arabia, but local vectors of CCHFV have not been investigated comprehensively [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00081" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Detection of CCHFV in ticks infesting sheep imported from Sudan to Saudi Arabia suggested that the diseases might have been introduced from Sudan [
