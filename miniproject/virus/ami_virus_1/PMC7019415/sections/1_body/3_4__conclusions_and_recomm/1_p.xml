<p>Although the risk of arboviral diseases in Sudan is high, it receives little attention, mainly due to limited resources, which heavily undermines building the capacity of healthcare providers and researchers with advanced training. Also, the lack of advanced diagnostic tools is a major challenge as detection of arboviruses typically requires molecular techniques and equipment such as simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR) machines that are available in very limited healthcare facilities. Additionally, the very inadequate funding for research limits the generation of evidence about the epidemiology and dynamics of arboviruses in Sudan; therefore, neither healthcare providers nor health policymakers are aware of these remarkably fast-growing public health threats and the need to develop a multisectoral approach to disease control and prevention. It is critically important to improve surveillance and investigate the circulating strains of these viruses and to establish viral genomic databases as a reference for current and future research. An arbovirology research center in Sudan, which would offer an extraordinary opportunity to advance the research and control of arboviral diseases in the region, is critically needed (

This could occur through local and international partnerships to generate evidence about the burden of disease, building the capacity of the local scientists, healthcare providers, and public health policymakers, and raising the awareness of the public and related stakeholders about the risk and need for prevention and control interventions. Drawing global attention to fill gaps in funding, research, and healthcare particularly for the poor and remote communities would likely save many lives and avoid great economic loss.
