<p>Dengue virus (DENV) and Zika virus (ZIKV) are etiological agents of reemerging and emerging infectious diseases that constitute important global public health concerns [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Both are RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>, that are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected mosquitoes of the 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> genus (
 <italic>Stegomya</italic> subgenus) [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Consequently, DENV and ZIKV present an epidemiological overlap, with occurrence influenced by similar environmental and socioeconomic characteristics, having the same geographical distribution and seasonality [
