<p>Differential diagnosis between DENV and ZIKV infections is challenging due to their similar signs and symptoms [
 <xref rid="pone.0229847.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In the rural area under investigation, 20 people presented an exanthematous febrile illness and four had laboratory confirmation for DENV infection. One infection by DENV-1 was identified, and the same serotype was found in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic>. Despite the absence of confirmed cases of ZIKV infection in humans, six human cases of febrile illness were considered to be not caused by DENV and could have plausibly been a result of ZIKV infection or diseases with similar symptoms, such as those caused by other arboviruses not investigated, e.g. Chikungunya, Mayaro fever and yellow fever. A subsample of mosquitoes infected by ZIKV was engorged, indicating the potential involvement of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in a silent transmission of this virus, despite it is not possible to know if the virus was originated from the human blood or from the mosquito. Therefore, it requires further investigation, also because only the presence of the virus in the mosquito is not enough to confirm its ability to transmit the pathogen to humans and due to this vector feed on non-human hosts in the sylvatic environment. Despite the lack of molecular detection of ZIKV or other arboviruses in the studied human cases, the assumption on the participation of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> in the transmission is credible, due to the absence of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> even after an extensive entomological sampling. 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> normally feeds in the daytime and outdoor but can rest and feed indoors [
