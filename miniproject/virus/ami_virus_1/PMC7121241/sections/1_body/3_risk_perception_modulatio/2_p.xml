 </disp-formula> where the rate of susceptibles depends on the recruited into the population 
 <italic>Λ</italic> and on the media coverage over time 
 <italic>M</italic>(
 <italic>t</italic>) times the constant recruitment rate, λ; μ is the natural death rate and δ is the recovery rate. This model is able to highlight different levels of beneficial effects of media coverage. M(t) depends on both the number of cases and their rate. Their model is successful in fitting some relevant data but also opens the possibility for parameter estimation. Recent work by Durham and Casman [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] has taken a step towards constructing a model for SARS that is based on time series of media coverage regarding the disease and on the proportion of the population wearing face masks during the outbreak. The approach of [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] demonstrates the possibility of identifying parameters of human behaviour using various data sources such as news, surveys or even search engine query data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Models are at the level of the intensity of single source of data acquisition; we still need to approach the variety of data acquisition.
