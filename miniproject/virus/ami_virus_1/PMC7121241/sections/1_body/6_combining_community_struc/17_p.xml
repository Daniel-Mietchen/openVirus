<p>The combining analysis of micro- and macroscales of an epidemic could provide an accurate estimate of the effective reproduction number of the disease. The aim of mitigation strategies is to reduce the effective reproduction number of the disease to a value close to or less than the epidemic threshold and thus prevent the disease from causing a large epidemic outbreak.</p>
