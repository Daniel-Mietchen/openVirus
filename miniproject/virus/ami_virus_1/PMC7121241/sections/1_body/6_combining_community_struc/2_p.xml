<p>The investigation of the effects of boundary nodes (i.e. nodes within a community with at least one external connection) is a common procedure when examining community structure in networks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In the case of non-overlapping communities, these nodes have a high betweenness centrality and represent the only means by which infection may travel between communities. In this model the probability of connection between two nodes, members of the communities X and V, respectively, is
