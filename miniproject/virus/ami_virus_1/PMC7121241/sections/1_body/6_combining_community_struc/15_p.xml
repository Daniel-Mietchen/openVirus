<p>Applying a different transmission model to this framework is also possible. For example, if we wished to implement a susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) model we could easily do so by defining the mean period of time α for the exposed period, so that at every time step an individual in the exposed state becomes infected with probability 1 ∕ α. An important consideration might be to allow for the modelling of diseases with asymptomatic infectious cases, such as influenza. Asymptomatic individuals may still be infectious, although potentially less so than symptomatic cases.</p>
