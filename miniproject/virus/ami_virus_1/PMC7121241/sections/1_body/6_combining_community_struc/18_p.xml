<p>Recently Lio et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] have combined formal languages and hybrid modelling to model the use of different therapies between therapies following the spread of an epidemic. Important efforts are focused on developing multi-scale approaches of epidemics: from the intracellular signalling and the communication between cells which form the levels of the immune response, to the tissue and organs levels that form the level of the structural response variation induced by the disease and are at the core of therapies application, to the population levels where parameters are related to social contacts, economy, psychology, for instance the cost of the therapies and vaccination. Note that all scales of description are dependent on each other. Furthermore, usage of personal technology tools will increase the individual and community differences of awareness.
