<p>An isolated community is simply an ER random graph. Let us consider for simplicity the case of the arrival of the infection from outside the community and not its subsequent spread. The set of parameters we need to consider are thus the community size n (the size of the infected outside world is 
 <italic>N</italic> − 
 <italic>n</italic>), the probability of external connectivity 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> (
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub> = 1 for the outside world) and the awareness of the community H. The expected number of infections entering a susceptible community is simply the number of boundary nodes which would become infected. The probability of an individual becomes infected following contact with at least one of its infectious neighbours is given by equation above.
