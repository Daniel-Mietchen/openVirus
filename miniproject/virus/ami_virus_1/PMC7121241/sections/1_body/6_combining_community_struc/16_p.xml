<p>At the microscale modelling, more efforts are needed to estimate better the effective reproduction number of seasonal versus pandemic disease and how the magnitude of this number is affected by both the presence of risky conditions because of health (e.g. the genetic structure) or behaviour of a community and the genetic diversity and the accumulation of mutations of the pathogen, particularly its antigenic evolution. At the macroscopic scale, the current economic crisis seems to produce relevant effects on the possibility of pandemic and seasonal diseases due to the toughened conditions for certain high-risk groups, including migrants, homeless persons, and prison populations that are particularly vulnerable to reductions in treatment access, quality of care due to drops in government spending [

Clearly a better description of the information acquisition dynamics and of heuristics involved in the decision making process for various communities would lead to better prediction.
