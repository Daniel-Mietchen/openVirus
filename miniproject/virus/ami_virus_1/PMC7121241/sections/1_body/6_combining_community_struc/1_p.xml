<p>Mean-field approach shows that, in the presence of several communities, a value of 
 <italic>J</italic> higher than the critical value for the homogeneous case, is necessary to prevent a community from experiencing an epidemic. Since in a realistic situation the amount of precautions an individual can take are limited, a consequence of this result is that, in the presence of community interactions, even high awareness of the disease may be insufficient to prevent an epidemic. Different ethnic communities or communities in geographical regions (e.g., countryside versus city) may respond differently to an epidemic, so community models will provide a better fit to real situations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] the authors developed an epidemic prediction tool that uses a combination of geographical, demographic and housing information. We foresee that similar tools will have automatic update of the relevant information. Following [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] we consider a network of N individuals described by five parameters: C is the number of communities; 
 <italic>n</italic>(
 <italic>X</italic>) is the size of community X; 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>X</italic>) is the probability of connection between nodes in community X; 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>X</italic>) is the probability of connection between nodes in community X and the nodes of any other community; and 
 <italic>H</italic>(
 <italic>X</italic>) the awareness of the disease in community X. We use ς to denote the set of all communities in the network. The first four parameters allow for variation in size and connectivity per community and are necessary for constructing a network of heterogeneous communities. The parameters 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>i</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>X</italic>) and 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>e</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>X</italic>) are chosen based on the required average internal and external connectivity per individual in each community. The 
 <italic>H</italic>(
 <italic>X</italic>) parameter is only necessary when the communities modeled also have varying levels of risk perception. A common approach for generating networks to test community detection algorithms is the use of the planted l-partition model [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The algorithm divides a set of N nodes into l equally sized groups according to two probabilities: 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>in</italic>
 </sub> is the probability of connection between nodes in the same group; 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>out</italic>
 </sub> is the probability of connection between nodes belonging to separate groups. Links are generated between all pairs of nodes according to these probabilities and the result is an Erdos-Renyi-like (ER) random network of 
 <italic>l</italic> communities, provided that 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>in</italic>
 </sub> &gt; 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>out</italic>
 </sub>. This approach generates a network of communities of varying sizes. The average connectivity in the resulting network is homogeneous for individuals within the same community but varies across communities. The communities exhibit the small-world property. Across communities, the average shortest path L is likely to be larger than within communities, due to the lower density of edges between communities.
