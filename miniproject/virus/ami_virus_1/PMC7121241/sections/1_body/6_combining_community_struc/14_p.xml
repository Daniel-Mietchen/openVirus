<p>This model has been implemented in an open software available from the authors that allow testing for different community structure, topologies of connections (variable boundaries), individual and community awareness

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] showed that in the presence of interaction between communities, values of J higher than the critical value are necessary to prevent a community from experiencing an epidemic. Since in a realistic situation the amount of precautions an individual can take are limited, a consequence of this result is that, in the presence of community interactions, even high awareness of the disease may be insufficient to prevent an epidemic.
