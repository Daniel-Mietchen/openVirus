<p>There is growing interest in using technological devices to continuously monitor oneâ€™s own health. In the past these tools were used by people trying to lose weight or improve their fitness. Athletes and their coaches commonly make detailed notes on nutrition, training sessions, sleep and other variables. New technologies (e.g. wristbands for heart rate, sleep patterns, skin conductance) make it simpler than ever to gather and analyse personal data. Sensors have shrunk and become cheaper. In USA and Europe, quantified self conferences are showing people new ways to deal with medical problems or improve their quality of life with technology. For instance together with various signals such as heart rate, posture, motion and temperature, co-ordination, reaction times, memory and emotions could be monitored. Personal genomics will provide an estimate of the personal risk in an epidemics. Ultra-high-throughput sequencing strategies have now been used to sequence more than 10,000 full, individual human genomes. One of the clinical implication is the possibility to obtain an almost complete map of the antigenic coverage of each of us against existing and predicted (on genomic basis) epitopes of pathogens. The availability of personal genome sequences and antigenic response data will require the development of models that will incorporate such information. It is noteworthy that the price of sequencing is dropping quickly. This suggests that samples could be collected from mining sewage systems and spots like toilets in pubs, trains, airports or emergency rooms to monitor public health concerns, for example, flu outbreaks that can then be sent off for sequencing, allowing us to build an early alarm map over time of the arrival of pathogens. We can imagine this map to be consulted using a phone in the same way we now watch the weather forecasting map. The combination of personal genomics would provide useful information on the personal threat posed by the arising pathogen strain.</p>
