<p>A study on the psychological responses to the 2009 H1N1 virus, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], reported significant reduction in the use of public transport, a high number of flight cancellations and a considerable amount of investment in preventative goods. Individuals undertaking such precautionary measures may succeed in reducing their susceptibility to the disease and thus potentially reduce the size of an epidemic outbreak. Despite the potentially considerable impact of behavioural changes in the population, the majority of mathematical models have only considered changes in human behaviour resulting from various public health interventions. The aim of such models is to study the effectiveness of interventions such as social distancing and the provision of treatment and prophylaxis in containing an emerging pandemic. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] have also considered the compliance with suggested interventions, mentioning that the compliance of individuals may be closely related to various demographics and that levels of compliance may vary over the course of the disease outbreak. Even in the absence of institutionally enforced interventions, individuals may occasionally take the initiative and change their personal behaviour in response to their perceived risk of becoming infected. The risk perception framework was applied by [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] to study the effect of human behaviour on both homogeneous and directed scale-free networks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. In this framework, as a result of alertness to the disease, the probability of transmission of the disease due to contact between an infectious and a susceptible individual is multiplied by a factor of

The probability that an individual becomes infected following contact with at least one of its infectious neighbours is modelled as
