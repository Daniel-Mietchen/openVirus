<p>Undervaccination is observed in both poor and wealthy communities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. In poor countries, intensive international programmes aiming at familiarising adult primary care providers (APCPs) with vaccine-preventable diseases and the importance of using vaccines are needed in order to improve vaccination rates. Recent work shows poor familiarisation of APCPs to inform hospitalised individuals about vaccinations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Noteworthy, on Facebook (2011), there are more than 40,000 pages on vaccinations and more than 1200 groups; 95 % of them are negative towards vaccination; on Youtube 90 % of the 10,000 movies about vaccination are against. So the background noises for rumours have become much louder, making it so much harder to detect the really important segments. Typical reasons found in blogs are the following: 
 <italic>mom knows best;if vaccines caused autism, I would probably opt out of most vaccines, because most kids don’t die of whooping cough or scarlet fever, but autism is forever; don’t want my kids to get autism. So I will risk a deadly disease instead</italic>. Clearly the decision is based on a heuristic approach and not on a careful reasoning which should have considered that for highly contagious viruses, like measles, about 95 % of the population need to be immunised to effectively prevent spread. In some sense the mother had not made a choice for her son only, but for everyone with whom he had come in contact. Is it reasonable that this mother’s rights should include the right to have her child catch and transmit a potentially fatal infection? Peadiatricians must also take proactive precautions with the growing number of unvaccinated, potentially biohazardous children and immediately place them in an examination room away from office traffic flow. It is totally unfair to expose the rest of your patients who are trying their best to protect their children with recommended vaccines. Mathematical models have highlighted the different values of vaccination strategies and information (see for instance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]). A model with pulse vaccination has shown that the media can trigger a vaccinating panic if the vaccine is imperfect and simplified messages may result in the vaccinated mixing with the infectives without regard to disease risk [
