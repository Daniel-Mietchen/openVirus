<p>Current and future public health hazards do not depend only on the biological characteristics of the infectious organism and on our immune system capability of response but also on the responsible behaviour of individuals, particularly of those who are more likely to be infected. We find difficult to accurately evaluate infection risk because of the lack of data and multi-scale and multi-factorial conditions of infection events. We are able to estimate different health threats of different viral strains by comparing the binding energies of viral proteins with host membrane receptors, but it is still difficult to estimate all interaction combinatorics at the whole cell proteomics level. Recently animal models have provided important experimental data on influenza spreading. Lowen and co-authors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] have found that the influenza virus can pass between guinea pigs by means of droplet spread and was transmitted from infected guinea pigs to healthy guinea pigs housed in the same cage, an adjacent cage, or a cage placed 91 cm away. Coughing, sneezing, talking, and breathing generate a cloud of airborne particles with diameters ranging from a few mm to less than 1 μm. Alford et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] revealed that humans could contract influenza by inhaling an experimental small-particle aerosol containing low levels of influenza virus. We trust hospitals as safe places but they are known to originate the spread of infectious diseases in patients. Even isolation rooms equipped with advanced heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) systems may not be completely safe as shown in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Here, 3D models of the room consider different, most typical, positions of the patients. Results indicate the best conditions for high induction air inlet diffuser and the scheme of pressures imposed in the room to provide the effective means of controlling flows containing virus droplets. The authors used finite element modelling software and CAD techniques to model the isolation room under different operating conditions (negative and positive pressure of the isolation room, airflow patterns associated with different cough conditions, switch on off of the HVAC). The authors found difficult to obtain technical details of surgery theatres, probably because results could change patients awareness and highlight structural deficiencies during economic crisis. The seasonal flu infection follows an age pattern: Brownstein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed that influenza spread firstly in children aged 3–4 years old, then the infection involves their brothers and sisters who may have more hygienic behaviour, then their parents and with the start of the winter it spreads among the elderly who may be at greater risk. People affected by severe immune pathologies could have different infectious risks and different awareness. With age, both frailty and risk perception usually increase. A challenge task is to evaluate the probability of the emergence of new variety of pathogen strains. Although about 3,000 different viruses are nowadays known, next generation sequencing and metagenomic approaches have revealed the vast majority of the viruses on Earth is not yet characterised. Statistical bioinformatics models will be increasingly used to calculate the number of viral mutations between safety and pandemics with little population awareness due to scarce education about DNA sequences.
