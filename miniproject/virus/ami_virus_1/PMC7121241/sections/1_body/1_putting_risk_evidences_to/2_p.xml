<p>An important approach in evidence synthesis is that of back-calculation, which is based on convolution equations; it uses reported numbers of diagnoses of a disease (say AIDS) in each calendar period, together with estimates of the distribution of time from infection to diagnosis of AIDS (the incubation period) to generate estimates of the underlying incidence of infections. Combined with information on survival, this approach allows to estimate current HIV prevalence. However, cheap diagnostic tools and medical treatments would change the actual incubation period (information ignorance). Another approach is the direct method where the general population is subdivided into mutually exclusive groups, indexed by 
 <italic>g</italic>, at risk for HIV and information on the proportion of the population in each risk group, Î³
 <sub>
  <italic>g</italic>
 </sub>, is derived from routinely collected statistics or the census [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The task is then to estimate the number of prevalent diagnosed and undiagnosed infections in each risk group, as well as the risk group totals 
 <italic>RG</italic>, which can be expressed as 
 <disp-formula id="Equ1">
  <label>1</label>
  <tex-math id="M1">\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document} $$RG = \sum\limits_{g}N(\pi _{g}\gamma _{g}\delta _{g} + {\pi _{g}}_{g}(1 - \delta _{g})).$$ \end{document}</tex-math>
 </disp-formula> The direct method is not easy to implement in practice because it requires complete data from all the risk groups to compute confidence intervals for each group and the relationships between the various items of evidence. Interesting example of software is the Estimation and Projection Package [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] that fits a simple infectious transmission model to the prevalence data via sampling importance resampling and generates a cluster of epidemic curves for each urban/rural and subgroup-specific sub-epidemic. A novel promising approach is that of multi-parameter evidence synthesis which offers a coherent analytical framework designed to make rational and exhaustive use of the whole body of information available [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It constructs a formal specification of the relationships between data and parameters, which dictates how direct and indirect evidences on the parameters of interest can be integrated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].
