<p>Expensive and complex epidemiological data are gathered and being analysed in a rather simple way that runs the risk of missing the opportunity to uncover combinations of predictive and meaningful profiles among the data. The challenge is to establish whether any causal conclusion suggested by the best fitting model is warranted by the data. Formal approaches to causal inference are needed in order to guide the researcher specifying the underlying causal assumptions, formulating the causal hypothesis in a non-ambiguous way, determining whether the data provide information to address that hypothesis. The complexly structured data, embracing molecular, subclinical and clinical, epidemiological information, social network require novel methodology to elucidate epidemics and health-related mechanisms. The multilevel data point at a huge space of causal models. The problem is not simply one of defining a suitable class of models and, within this class, to search for those models which provide the best fit but to combine the multilevel data within a study, with one type of data across studies, into multilevel data across studies. There is an increasing need to use all the available information, even with missing values, from different datasets (meta-analysis) and different dimensionality, which may be called super meta methodology.</p>
