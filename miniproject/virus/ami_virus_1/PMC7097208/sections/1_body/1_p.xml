<p id="Par3">Wuhan, a strong virology hub in China, was well-equipped to detect and deal with the outbreak. However, it has put Chinaâ€™s epidemic preparedness to the test in a part of the world that still actively remembers the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak in 2003. Then, the 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">virus spread </ext-link> from China to 25 other countries, infecting more than 8,000 people and killing almost 800 before it was contained. In the present case, the speed with which the Chinese authorities reported the outbreak to the international community was commendable and suggests that lessons have been learned from past outbreaks. Within ten days of having communicated the initial cluster of cases, the first genome sequence of the so-called 2019-nCoV was reported in the open access repository

Five additional virus sequences related to the outbreak were deposited two days later in

The sequence information has identified 2019-nCoV as a betacoronavirus closely related to SARS and other coronaviruses that originate from bats, although its source remains unclear as various animals are sold at the market where it emerged.
