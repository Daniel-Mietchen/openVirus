The patient presented with low-grade fever, cough, sneezing, fatigue, and lymphopenia. Multiple peripheral ground-glass opacities are present in both lungs (predominant on the right side), with a subpleural distribution. Imaging findings are nonspecific and might be seen with other viral pneumonias as well.
