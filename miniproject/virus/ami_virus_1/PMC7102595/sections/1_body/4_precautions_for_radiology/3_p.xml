<p id="p0055">CT and MR machine gantries, noninvasive ultrasound probes, blood pressure cuffs, and image viewing station mice and keyboards need to be disinfected after every contact with suspected patients. According to the Spaulding classification of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and FDA, these surfaces need to be either washed with soap and water or decontaminated using a low-level or intermediate-level disinfectant, such as iodophor germicidal detergent solution, ethyl alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol. Environmental services staff members need to be specifically trained for professional cleaning of potentially contaminated surfaces after each high-risk patient contact [
