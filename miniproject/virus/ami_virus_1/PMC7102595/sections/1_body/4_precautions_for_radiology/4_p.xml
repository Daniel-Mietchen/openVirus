<p id="p0060">US health care imaging facilities need to be prepared for the escalating incidence of new cases of COVID-19. If appropriately prepared, radiology department staff members can take greater measures to manage the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the facility and personnel. A multidisciplinary committee should convene to outline guidelines to prevent the spread of the virus through human-to-human contact and the department equipment. Implementation of a robust plan can provide protection against further transmission of the virus to patients and staff members.</p>
