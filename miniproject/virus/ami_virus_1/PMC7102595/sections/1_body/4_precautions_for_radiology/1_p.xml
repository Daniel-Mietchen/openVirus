<p id="p0050">Radiographers are among the first-line health care workers who might be exposed to 2019 novel COVID-19. Diagnostic imaging facilities should have guidelines in place to manage individuals with known or suspected COVID-19 infection. The novel COVID-19 is highly contagious and is believed to transmit mostly through respiratory droplets, but there is uncertainty as to whether the virus can be transmitted by touching a surface or an item that is contaminated (ie, a fomite). A thorough understanding of the routes of virus transmission will be essential for patients’ and health care professionals’ safety. Droplets have the greatest risk of transmission within 3 ft (91.44 cm), but they may travel up to 6 ft (183 cm) from their source [

For the purpose of diagnostic imaging in individuals with NCIP, whenever possible, portable radiographic equipment should be used to limit transportation of patients. On the basis of experience with SARS, the use of a satellite radiography center and dedicated radiographic equipment can decrease the risk for transmission from known infected individuals. If a patient needs to be transported to the radiology department, he or she should wear a surgical mask during transport to and from the department.
