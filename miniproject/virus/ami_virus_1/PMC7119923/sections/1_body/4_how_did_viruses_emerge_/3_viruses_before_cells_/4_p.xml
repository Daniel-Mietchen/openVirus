<p>The attempts to derive the actual nature of the last common ancestor of cells have lead to a strong indication that the ancestor was not any particular cell, but instead a last common community from which the modern domains of life eventually emerged (Doolittle 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2000</xref>; Theobald 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2010</xref>). This community appears to have been evolving mainly horizontally by swapping genetic information between proto-cells rather than in “Darwinian” manner by passing genes vertically to proto-cell offspring (Woese 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">1998</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2000</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2002</xref>; Koonin and Martin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>). This suggest that the proto-cells themselves were not coherent genetic entities but instead more or less random collections of independent genetic replicators. The system probably evolved collectively, which might have maintained the common genetic code (Vetsigian et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2006</xref>). Physically the proto-cells could have been, for example, fixed inorganic formations that served as containers for enriching products of biochemical cycles and other essential resources (Koonin and Martin
