<p>Novel sequencing and sampling techniques have made it possible to determine the overall genetic information in any particular sample. Moreover, sequences of complete organisms have revealed the true genetic diversity of living entities. These studies have lead to the revelation that many organisms harbor a variety of genes that are unknown to science (Mocali and Benedetti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2010</xref>). In other words, our biosphere is abundant with genetic information for which we cannot assign a role, function or evolutionary origin (Cortez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>). Interestingly, a fair portion of these novel genes are found from viral genomes (Yin and Fischer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2008</xref>; Prangishvili et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2006</xref>) or belong to genome integrating genetic elements (Cortez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>). How did these genes end up in viruses?
