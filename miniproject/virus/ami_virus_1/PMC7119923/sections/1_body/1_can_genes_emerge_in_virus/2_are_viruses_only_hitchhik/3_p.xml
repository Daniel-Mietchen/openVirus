<p>In principle, it is possible that majority of genes evolve in such a fast pace in viruses that the sequence can no longer be recognized to be of cellular origin (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009b</xref>). Indeed, general analyses of the divergences of amino acid sequences propose that even the most conserved proteins in our biosphere have not discovered all potential ways to encode their function (Povolotskaya and Kondrashov 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2010</xref>). Therefore there appears to be room in the sequence space into which the host-derived genes can evolve to in viral genomes.
