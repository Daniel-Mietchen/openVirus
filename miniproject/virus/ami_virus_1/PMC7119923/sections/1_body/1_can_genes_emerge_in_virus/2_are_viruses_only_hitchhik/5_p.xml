<p>Viruses seem to have genes that produce structurally and functionally conserved proteins, which have no apparent cellular ancestors (Bamford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Koonin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>; Keller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2009</xref>). These genes have been within (relatively) independently evolving viral genomes perhaps for as long as billions of years and they can still be shown to share a common ancestry. Did these genes emerge in virus genomes in the first place? It seems possible, given that many of these conserved “hallmark” virus genes (Koonin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>) encode for viruses specific tasks such as capsid proteins or packaging enzymes that facilitate the transfer of viral genome into the capsid.
