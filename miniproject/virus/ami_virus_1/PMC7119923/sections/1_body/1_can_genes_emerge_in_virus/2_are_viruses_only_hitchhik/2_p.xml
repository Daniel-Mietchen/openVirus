<p>However, many viral genes appear to have no cellular counterparts (Yin and Fischer 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2008</xref>; Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009b</xref>). Why is this? Do we need to sequence more bacterial genomes in order to find the common ancestor form a cellular chromosome? Yet, as the number of sequenced bacterial chromosomes has increased, the number of unknown genes in viruses has remained unchanged (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009b</xref>). Sometimes when some rare types of virus genes are finally discovered from host chromosomes, it turns out that the genes in the chromosomes actually belong to genome integrated viruses (Jalasvuori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2009</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). Therefore the sequencing of bacterial chromosomes does not seem to provide an easy way out of the puzzle. Perhaps the genetic novelty of viruses is of genuine nature and there are no cellular homologies to be found. Or could it just be that the rapid evolutionary rates of genes in viruses is simply making the homology with cellular genes untraceable?
