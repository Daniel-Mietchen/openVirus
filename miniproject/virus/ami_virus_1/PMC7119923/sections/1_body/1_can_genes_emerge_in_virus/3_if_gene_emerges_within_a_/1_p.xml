<p>Naturally, the emergence of a gene in a virus does not indicate that the gene popped into existence within the protective capsid in an extracellular environment (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009b</xref>; Forterre 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Jalasvuori 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Rather, it would mean that a virus, while replicating in a cell, ended up having an altered genetic sequence. This altered sequence opened the road for the emergence and evolution of a new gene. In practice the gene would form through point mutations and other genetic changes similarly with any other emerging genes (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2009b</xref>).
