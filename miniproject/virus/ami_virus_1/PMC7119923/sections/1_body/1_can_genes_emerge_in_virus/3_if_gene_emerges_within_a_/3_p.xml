<p>Even if the 
 <italic>de novo</italic> origin of genes actually occurred in viruses, it would be only a starting point from which to approach other interesting questions. What do these novel genes do? There are countless unique genes in viruses, but are they also encoding countless unique functions. Or is it possible that they only have unique sequences while affecting very similar cellular processes? And what would that indicate?
