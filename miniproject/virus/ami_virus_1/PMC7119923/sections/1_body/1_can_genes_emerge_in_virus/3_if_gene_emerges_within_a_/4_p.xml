<p>Viruses of bacteria, also known as bacteriopahges, can have genes for very different types of functions. Some phages encode transfer RNAs and other essential cellular functions (Miller et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>). Others can carry genetic information for mediating photosynthesis (Mann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2003</xref>) or producing lethal toxins (Oâ€™Brien et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1984</xref>). Much of the phage genes, however, affect genetic regulation, virion assembly and host-virus interactions. Yet, other viruses (like Mimivirus) have genes that were earlier considered to be only part of cellular chromosomes and thus blurred the line between what viruses can and what they can not do (Raoult et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2004</xref>).
