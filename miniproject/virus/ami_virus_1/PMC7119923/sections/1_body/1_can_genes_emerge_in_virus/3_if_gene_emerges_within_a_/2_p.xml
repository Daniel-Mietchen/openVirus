<p>But if the new gene would emerge within a cell, is it not rather a cellular gene than a viral one (Moreira and López-García 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>)? Doesn’t this indeed only enforce the view of cellular origin of viral genetic information? No, it does not, if we allow ourselves to consider viruses to be more than just their encapsulated extracellular forms (Forterre 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). If the gene formed through mutations in a viral genome and the new gene was able to survive due to its benefits to the virus and not to the host, then it would seem only reasonable to consider the gene to be of viral origin (Jalasvuori 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Therefore, even if a cell serves the function of a vessel for the development of a new gene, the gene would remain in the global gene pool because of viruses. Eventually, when metagenomic studies, for example, are performed, these novel genes could be discovered from capsid enclosed genomes of viruses with no apparent counterparts in any cellular organisms.
