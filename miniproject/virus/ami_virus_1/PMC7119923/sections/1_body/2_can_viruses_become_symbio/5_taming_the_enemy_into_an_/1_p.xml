<p>During a roaming virus epidemic, this integration of a virus to germ line cells could provide an advantage to an individual (Jern and Coffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2008</xref>). Indeed, in many cases endogenous viruses appear to protect their hosts against exogenous viruses (Maori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>; Katzourakis and Gifford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). However, such endogenous viruses themselves seem to be able to reinfect the germ line cells (Belshaw et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2004</xref>). Nevertheless, the endogenous virus may be able to make the host organism to be able to ignore the ill-effects that the epidemic causes to other individuals. Naturally inheritable resistance against chickenpox is not a significant advantage but resistance against a more severe virus could be.
