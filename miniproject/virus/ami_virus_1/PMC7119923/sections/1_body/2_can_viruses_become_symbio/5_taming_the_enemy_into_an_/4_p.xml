<p>Endogenous viruses can integrate repeatedly into various places within and among host chromosomes (Katzourakis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). The number of elements and the site of integration can have significant effects on the phenotype of the host cell. The establishment of the viral genome into the host chromosome appears to be followed by in-genome evolution (Tarlinton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2006</xref>; Katzourakis et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>). Does this evolution select for the viruses to be integrated in positions where they induce the lowest possible cost on the host or, perhaps, even induce changes that increase the host fitness?
