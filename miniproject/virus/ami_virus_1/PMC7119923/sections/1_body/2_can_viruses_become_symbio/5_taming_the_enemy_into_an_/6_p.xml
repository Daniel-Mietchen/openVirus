<p>Some or even most of the endogenous viruses may be just insignificant remnants of previous infections and as such they would not much affect the evolution of their host species. But other symbiotic viruses probably made a real difference. As an example of such, a virus derived gene, labeled as syncytin, appears to be crucially important for the morphogenesis of placenta (Mi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2000</xref>). Did pregnancy as humans and other placental mammals experience it emerge as a result of viral endogenization?
