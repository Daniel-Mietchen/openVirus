<p>So, in principle and under certain conditions, germ line infection could prove to be a favorable trait within a population (Maori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2007</xref>). The new 
 <italic>virus alleles</italic> may even be able to invade the whole population, if the maintenance of the virus remains to improve the fitness of the virus-containing individuals over their virus-free counterparts (Katzourakis and Gifford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Indeed, as with bacteriophages, endogenous viruses of animals can remain partly active even after endogenization (Coffin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">1997</xref>; Tarlinton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2006</xref>) and thus the virus itself can maintain the pressure to retain the virus allele within the population.
