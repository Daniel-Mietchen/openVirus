<p>Some viruses that infect bacteria are known to form temporary mutually benefiting symbiotic relationships with bacterial cells (Roossinck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2011</xref>). These viruses enter the host cell and, instead of producing vast number of virions and destroying the cell, they take up residence within the host. During this latent infection temperate viruses replicate their genomes along with the cell but deter from making virions. Only in the distress of their hosts they ignite the production of virions and they do it in order to escape the potentially doomed bacterium.
