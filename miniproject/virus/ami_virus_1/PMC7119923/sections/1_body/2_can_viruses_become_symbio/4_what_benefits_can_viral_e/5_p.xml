<p>However, there is another way by which temperate viruses of bacteria boost the survival of their hosts. Whenever a bacterial virus resides within a bacterium, it renders the cell immune to infections by similar viruses. And this quality of viruses, the incapability of a single virus type to multiply infect an already-infected cell (i.e. the resistance of superinfection), appears to be very common among all viruses and therefore also applicable to other organisms (Berngruber et al.
