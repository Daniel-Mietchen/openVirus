<p>Nevertheless, viral genetic information is often found to be incorporated to cellular genomes (Holmes 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). For example, human chromosomes contain more viral DNA than actual human genes. In fact, remnants of viruses are abundant in genomes of many different organisms, ranging from animals to bacteria (Casjens

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>; Jalasvuori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>). How did these viral elements get into all these organisms? What types of evolutionary processes may be responsible for these genomic fusions, and could they be of evolutionary importance?
