<p>Are the existing viral remnants in genomes mere evolutionarily insignificant left-overs of previous virus infections (Jern and Coffin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2008</xref>)? Were they so insignificant to the fitness of the hosting cell that there simply was no selection to get rid of the element? Many of the endogenous viruses are relatively conserved and have persisted over evolutionary times in various species, such as humans and our primate cousins, suggesting that the relatively error-free host polymerases that are used to replicate the endogenous viruses are able to preserve these sequences as viral fossils over evolutionary times (Duffy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>). However, many of the virus elements have also shown to accumulate inactivating mutations and thus they are evolving only as non-encoding pseudogenes in animal genomes (Katzourakis and Gifford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2010</xref>). Yet, other virus genes have remained functional, suggesting that there has been a purifying selection to maintain the correct sequence.
