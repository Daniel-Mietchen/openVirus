<p>Bacteria are the most abundant type of a cellular organism on earth and their viruses are equally common. Bacteriophages almost exclusively form virions with a spherical head on which a tail is attached to. The head beholds the genetic information of the virus whereas the tail serves as a tool for attaching onto new host cells and, sometimes, as an injection needle during the infection process. This homologous group of viruses is known as 
 <italic>Caudovirales</italic> (Ackermann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1998</xref>). Other types of bacterial viruses also exist, but they are not many (Ackermann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>): there are icosahedral viruses with inner â€“ and outer membranes, amorphous viruses and helical viruses (Oksanen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2010</xref>). Altogether, we have discovered only less than ten truly different types of virion-architectures from all currently known bacteriophages.
