<p>Hyperthermophilic creanarchaea are very deeply branching organisms in the tree of life and their viruses are equally unique (Ortmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>). They also inhabit extremely hot environments. Are these clues relevant for understanding the diversity of viral phenotypes? Indeed, when the viruses of less thermophilic archaeal organisms have been studied, they were found to less diverse morphologically. Could it be possible that there was wider diversity of viral phenotypes during the early steps of the evolution of life? And has this diversity been somehow better prevailing among hyperthermophilic crenarchaeal organisms whereas it was lost among other prokaryotes (Jalasvuori and Bamford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2009</xref>)? The viruses of most deep-branching hyperthermophile bacterial families (like 
 <italic>Thermotoga</italic> or 
 <italic>Aquifex</italic>) have not been studied. It would be interesting to see if their viruses resemble only the usual head-tail viruses or whether they are more like the ones infecting crenarchaea â€“ or something totally different.
