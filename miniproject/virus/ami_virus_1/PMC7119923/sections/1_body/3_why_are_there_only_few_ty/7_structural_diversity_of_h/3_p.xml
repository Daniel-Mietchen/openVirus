<p>It is likely that all contemporary life forms on earth have evolved from thermophilic ancestors (Di Giulio 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2003</xref>). There are at least two potential explanations for this, both of which can be correct. First, life may have emerged within a hot habitat such as hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Second, life may have faced multiple near-extinction level catastrophes in which all the surviving organisms were thermophiles. Indeed, earth is known to have been under heavy bombardment of massive comets and asteroids during the Hadean period (ending about 3.8 billion years ago). This bombardment must have elevated the temperature levels significantly, sweeping all non-thermophilic organisms.
