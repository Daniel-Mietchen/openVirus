<p>The proteins on the virion dictate whether or not viruses are able to attach to a suitable host cell and therefore there should be constant selection driving the evolution of these proteins (as well as their host counterparts) Weitz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2005</xref>. This is indeed what has been observed: the genes responsible for encoding virion proteins that mediate host-cell attachment are the ones that evolve most rapidly (Saren et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2005</xref>; Paterson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2010</xref>). Even closely related viruses may have completely different genes for producing the host-recognizing spikes on the virion (Jaakkola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>).
