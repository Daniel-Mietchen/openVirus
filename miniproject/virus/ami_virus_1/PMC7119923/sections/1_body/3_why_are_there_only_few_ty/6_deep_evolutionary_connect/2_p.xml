<p>Closer analysis of both of these viruses and their other relatives revealed more things in common (Krupovic and Bamford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>). Vast majority of them had an inner lipid membrane beneath the protein capsid, a generally rare trait among viruses. Moreover, these viruses encode related ATPases (with certain specific motifs) which have been shown to facilitate the transfer of the viral genome into empty capsids. Later on similar viruses were found to infect thermophilic crenarchaea (Khayat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2005</xref>) and reside in the genomes of thermophilic euryarchaea (Krupovic and Bamford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2008</xref>). In terms of genetic exchange, the Archaeal phylum of Crenarchaeota consists of deep-branching organisms that appear to have been evolving relatively isolated from all other life forms since the emergence of cellular life (Gribaldo and Brochier-Armanet 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>). Together these characteristics suggested that convergence appears to be an improbable cause to explain all the common features and thus it is reasonable to assume the existence of a common ancestor in some distant past. But this leads us to the same question as before: how distant are we actually talking about? 100 million years? A billion? Four billion?
