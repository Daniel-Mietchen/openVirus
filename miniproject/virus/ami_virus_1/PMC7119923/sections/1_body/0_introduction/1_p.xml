<p>Life on Earth is composed of multitude of cellular organisms, some of them being as tiny as bacteria, others as complex as humans. Yet, this cellular way of living is overwhelmed in both number and genetic diversity by non-cellular entities, each of which is capable of enforcing cellular organisms to fulfill their selfish needs. A word 
 <italic>virus</italic>, a Latin term for poison, commonly refers to this strategy for survival. And for a poison they are often treated. This is of no surprise, given that the apparent simplicity and inanimate nature of deadly viruses (van Regenmortel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2000</xref>; Moreira and López-García 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2009</xref>) may lead us to intuitively neglect or completely ignore them in our approaches to understand the evolutionary spectacle that living things have to offer. Yet, while being relatively simple in comparison to cells, there is much that we do not know about viruses or their roles in evolutionary processes. Viruses have been here for a long time (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009a</xref>), and studies suggest that viruses appear to have played a part in events such as the origin of cellular life (Koonin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>) and the evolution of mammals (Gifford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2012</xref>). But what has their role been exactly? When does the inclusion of viruses into the frame of analysis lead to evolutionary insights? Or even breakthroughs?
