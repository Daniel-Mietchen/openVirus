<p>However, arguably, the actual virus is more than its dead shell in the environment. Virus is part of a living organism when it is inside a host cell. And the phenotype of this organism is partly expressed by the virus (Forterre and Prangishvili 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2009a</xref>; Forterre 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Jalasvuori 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Many viruses maintain the potential for producing inanimate virions during their endure within the cellular organism, but virus itself should be considered to be its full reproductive cycle including both external and internal parts (Villarreal and Witzany 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2010</xref>; Jalasvuori 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). Yet, strictly speaking, only the within-cell reproductive cycle is required for the survival of the viral genetic information (Krupovic and Bamford 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>; Jalasvuori 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2012</xref>). And this requirement lets us approach viruses as a genuine form of life that can exploit foreign cell-vehicles for preserving and propagating their genetic information (Forterre

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2011</xref>).
