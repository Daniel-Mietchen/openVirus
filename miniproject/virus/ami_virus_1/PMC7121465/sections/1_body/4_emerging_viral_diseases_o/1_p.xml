<p id="Par31">Increasing numbers of South American camelids (SACs), particularly alpaca (
 <italic>Vicugna pacos</italic>) and llama (
 <italic>Lama glama</italic>), are being imported to various countries outside of South America, including Europe, for wool (fiber) production, breeding, and as pack and companion animals.
