<p id="Par35">Alpacas and llamas are susceptible to BTV infections, but rarely show significant clinical signs. However, they remain infectious for several weeks and may thus serve as reservoirs of infection. Already Rivera et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1987</xref>) showed that camelids can be infected with BTV. About 100 sampled “healthy” alpacas were positive for specific antibodies against BVT. Although camelids are considered a “low-risk species,” there are reports of cases, e.g., during the recent outbreak of BT in Europe 2007 (Henrich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2007</xref>). One alpaca in the area that was affected in Germany during this outbreak was infected within a radius of 5 km from clinically BTV-infected sheep (with high mortality) and cattle. Ortega et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2010</xref>) described a fatal BTV infection in an alpaca (
 <italic>Vicugna pacos</italic>) in California. Meyer et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2009</xref>) described a lethal BTV infection in llamas. Vaccines are available and are used for ruminants. They are not licensed for SACs but may be used (Zanolari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2010</xref>) and are recommended by many.
