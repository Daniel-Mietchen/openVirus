<p id="Par34">The bluetongue virus (BTV) is an 
 <italic>Orbivirus</italic> with 24 known sero-variants and is present worldwide. It exists in a broad band around the world covering large parts of the Americas, Africa, southern Asia and northern Australia (Mellor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008</xref>). Occasionally it has occurred on the southern borders of Europe. The BTV is transmitted by midges (
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> spp.) and naturally infects domestic and wild ruminants. The disease is considered to be one of the most important infections of domestic livestock. It is quite severe in sheep, less so in cattle. In June 2006, BTV appeared in northern Europe for the first time (Carpenter et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>) and successfully wintered. Subsequently it caused substantial losses in livestock in 2007 and 2008. The virus has never previously occurred so far north anywhere in the world (Mellor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2008</xref>). The explanation to this dramatic change in the epidemiology of BT is many, but one is linked to the recent extension in the distribution of its main vector(s) 
 <italic>Culicoides imicola</italic> and perhaps new 
 <italic>Culicoides</italic> vector(s) and to the ongoing climatic change (Wilson and Mellor 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2009</xref>).
