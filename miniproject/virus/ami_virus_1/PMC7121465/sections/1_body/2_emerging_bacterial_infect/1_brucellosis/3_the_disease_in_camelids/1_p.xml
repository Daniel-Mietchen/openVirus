 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2010</xref>). Clinical disease was also reported (Musa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2008</xref>; Al-Majali et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). Clinically, brucellosis in camelids induce symptoms similar to those in other livestock species. However, various researchers have noticed that abortion related to brucellosis is less in camels in comparison to other animals. Brucella infections in camels may cause stillborn calves, retained placenta, fetal death, mummification, reduced milk yield, delayed service age, and fertility (Wernery
