<p id="Par21">Camels of both species (
 <italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic> and 
 <italic>Camelus bactrianus</italic>) are highly susceptible to brucellosis caused by 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic> and 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic>. However, too few bacteriological surveys have been conducted to draw conclusions on the relative importance of either species of 
 <italic>Brucella</italic> in the etiology of camel brucellosis in the respective countries (Abbas and Agab 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2002</xref>). A recent report regarded brucellosis as a regionally emerging zoonotic disease in North Africa, the Middle East, and India (Gwida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2010</xref>). Camels are infected by 
 <italic>Brucella abortus</italic> and 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic>, which cause abortion and infertility (Wernery and Kaaden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2002</xref>). 
 <italic>B. melitensis</italic> was isolated from camels in Iran, Libya, and Saudi Arabia; 
 <italic>B. abortus</italic> was isolated in Sudan, Egypt, and Kuwait.
