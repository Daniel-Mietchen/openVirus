<p id="Par30">The above is one of many examples of emerging diseases transmitted by ticks and other arthropods (phylum Arthropoda including the class Insecta). The AHFV belong to tick-borne flaviviruses, which are among the medically most important arboviruses in Asia and Europe. Some are very important as human and animal pathogens; others have not yet been associated with human or animal diseases. Changes in human behavior, animal husbandry, land use, and/or climate may change the actual geographical distribution pattern and transmission intensity. This is already taking place, and it is often related to the present climate change. Tick-borne flaviviruses and other arboviruses may increase in medical and veterinary importance as, e.g., in the case with bluetongue virus (see below).</p>
