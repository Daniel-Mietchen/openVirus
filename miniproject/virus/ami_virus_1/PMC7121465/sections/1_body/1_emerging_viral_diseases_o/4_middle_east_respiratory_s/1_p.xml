<p id="Par17">Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is an emerging pathogen associated with severe respiratory symptoms and renal failure in infected persons. Saudi Arabia is the country most severely affected by the virus and is where the first recognized case was reported in September 2012. The origin of MERS-CoV remains a mystery. Phylogenetic analyses of complete and partial genome sequences by Cotten et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2013</xref>) enabled estimates of the timing of introduction and geographic distribution of distinct virus clades. The authors proposed that MERS-CoV emerged in humans in 2011 and noted that sequence divergence among clades is consistent with multiple sporadic introductions of the virus into the human population, presumably from an animal reservoir (Alagaili et al.
