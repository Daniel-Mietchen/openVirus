<p id="Par19">Susceptibility of dromedary camels to and infection with MERS-CoV have been documented by the detection of high levels of antibodies to the virus and viral sequences in nasal swabs and lung tissues. Nevertheless, infection remained subclinical with only mild upper respiratory tract symptoms (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">20.6</xref>) observed in some camels (Khalafalla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2015</xref>). Experimental infection of dromedary camels with a human isolate of MERS-CoV induced no systemic illness despite shedding of large quantities of virus from the upper respiratory tract (Adney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2014</xref>). It is therefore concluded that MERS-CoV causes no well-defined disease in camels.
