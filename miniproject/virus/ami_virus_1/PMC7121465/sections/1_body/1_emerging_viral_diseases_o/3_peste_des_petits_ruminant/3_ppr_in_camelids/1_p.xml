<p id="Par14">Camels were not reported as possible hosts to PPR until Ismail and coauthors (Ismail et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1992</xref>) in Egypt detected the infection through serology in Sudanese camels. The first documented outbreak of PPR in camels reported from Ethiopia in 1996, consisted of a highly contagious respiratory syndrome with elevated morbidity and low mortality rates (Roger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2000</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2001</xref>). Consecutive outbreaks of a similar disease occurred in Eastern Sudan in 2004 and later in Somalia and Kenya. Though investigations in Somalia and Kenya were inconclusive and failed to identify the real causative agent, the disease in Sudan was diagnosed as a PPR virus (small ruminant virus) infection (Khalafalla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2010</xref>). The incriminated virus belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> in the family 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>â€”a group of RNA viruses characterized by continuous evolution and species jumping. Newly evolved viruses in this family include phocine distemper virus and Hendra virus, formerly called equine 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> (Earle et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2011</xref>).
