<p id="Par13">The disease is caused by the peste des petits ruminant virus (PPRV), which belongs to the 
 <italic>Morbillivirus</italic> genus of the paramyxovirus family of viruses. PPRV is a non-segmented negative-strand RNA virus closely related to the rinderpest virus of cattle and buffaloes, the measles virus of humans, the distemper virus of dogs and some wild carnivores, and the morbilliviruses of aquatic mammals. To date, genetic characterization of PPR virus strains has allowed them to be categorized into four groups: three from Africa and one from Asia. This virus has a particular affinity for lymphoid tissues and epithelial tissue of the gastrointestinal (GI) and respiratory tracts, where it produces characteristic lesions.
