<p id="Par15">The clinical and epidemiological picture of the previous PPR-suspected or PPR-confirmed outbreaks in northeast Africa is not similar. At least two forms can be identified: a per acute disease characterized by sudden death, abortion, and diarrhea with a high mortality rate occurred in the region during 2004–2007 (Gluecks and Younan

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>; Khalafalla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2010</xref>), whereas the early outbreaks (1992–1996) showed an acute respiratory disease with low mortality rates (Roger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2000</xref>). The presence of more than one form points to involvement of other pathogens as secondary invaders or to the genetic variations of the causative virus. The last hypothesis was verified by detecting lineage III of PPRV from camels in Ethiopia in 1997 and lineage IV from camels affected by PPRV in 2004 in Sudan (Kwiatek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2011</xref>). Kwiatek and coworkers (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2011</xref>) suggested that a virulent lineage IV strain might have been introduced in Africa during the 1990s, resulting in outbreaks in both camels and small ruminants.
