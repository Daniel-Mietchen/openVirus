<p id="Par11">Recently, El Mamy et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2014</xref>) have reported confirmatory evidence for a field camel infection with RVF. In September of 2010, an RVF outbreak occurred in northern Mauritania involving mass abortions in small ruminants and camels (
 <italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic>) and at least 63 human clinical cases, including 13 deaths. In camels, serological prevalence was 27.5â€“38.5 %, and for the first time, clinical signs other than abortions were reported in this species, including hemorrhagic septicemia and severe respiratory distress (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">20.4</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses of the genome of isolates from camels suggested a shared ancestor between the Mauritania 2010 strain and strains from Zimbabwe, Kenya, South Africa, Uganda, and other strains linked to the 1987 outbreak of RVF in Mauritania.
