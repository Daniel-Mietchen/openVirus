<p id="Par10">RVF is caused by an RNA virus of the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Phlebovirus</italic>. Camels have been regularly involved in the RVF epidemics in East Africa and Egypt. However, clinical disease is not seen in adult camels, but abortion occurs and some early deaths have been observed (OIE 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2008</xref>). Serological evidence of dromedary camel infection with RVF was documented. According to Davies et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1985</xref>), camel sera collected after an epizootic of Rift Valley fever in Kenya revealed positive sera with high titers of serum neutralizing antibody found in 22 % of camels at one of the seven sampling sites. Furthermore, the demonstration of specific IgG antibodies in camels (Nabeth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2001</xref>) indicates that these animals are naturally infected. The disease emerged in Egypt in 1977, in Mauritania in 1998 (Nabeth et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2001</xref>), and in the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 (Abdo-Salem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2006</xref>). In addition, the disease reappeared in Kenya in 2006/2007 (Bird et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2008</xref>). It also involved camels beside sheep, goats, and humans, again with abortion as the only clinical symptom.
