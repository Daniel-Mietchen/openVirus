<p id="Par8">It has been over 106 years since camelpox was first described in Punjab, India, in 1909 (Wernery and Kaaden 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2002</xref>), but the zoonotic nature of the CMLV remained a debate. According to Baxby (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1972</xref>), CMLV is different from the VARV, the causative agent of smallpox, and is incapable of infecting man. Kritz in Somalia (Kritz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1982</xref>) described the first report of a case of human camelpox. The case was a 40-year-old camel herder who developed lesions resembling those of smallpox in June 1978. From the 1970s until recently, it has been well accepted that CMLV rarely infects humans (Duraffour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2011</xref>). This is probably due to the cross-immunity induced via smallpox vaccination that ended in the late 1970s. It was therefore postulated that human camelpox may become more common as the immunity of the human population wanes (Duraffour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2011</xref>). Human population more than three decades after cessation of the smallpox vaccination has lost protection against that deadly virus and all zoonotic infections caused by human and animal OPVs as well. The first conclusive evidence of zoonotic CMLV infection in humans, associated with outbreaks in dromedary camels, has been recently reported in India where three human cases of camelpox have been reported (Bera et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2011</xref>). They were detected in animal handlers during an outbreak of camelpox, and the lesions were confined to the hands and fingers of camel handlers and passed through all the stages of pox lesions until the formation of scabs. These are the first confirmed cases of zoonotic camelpox as infection was diagnosed by conventional PCR and seroconversion. Additional four cases of camelpox in humans (camel herders) were detected recently in 2015 in Showak area of Eastern Sudan (Khalafalla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2016</xref>, Vector borne &amp; Zoonotic Diseases, accepted) (Fig.
