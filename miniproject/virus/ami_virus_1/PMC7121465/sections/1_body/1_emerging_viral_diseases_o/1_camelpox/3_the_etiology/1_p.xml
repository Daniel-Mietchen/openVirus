<p id="Par5">Camelpox is caused by the camelpox virus (CMLV), which belongs to the genus 
 <italic>Orthopoxvirus</italic> (OPXV) of the subfamily Poxvirinae in the family Poxviridae. Phylogenetic analysis of CMLV revealed that CMLV is most closely related to variola virus (VARV), sharing all genes involved in basic replicative functions and the majority of genes involved in other host-related functions (Afonso et al.
