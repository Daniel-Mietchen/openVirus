<p id="Par37">The small liver fluke or the lancet fluke (
 <italic>Dicrocoelium dendriticum</italic>) is rarely found in camelids. However, natural infections with this intriguing parasite have been reported from a few countries in alpacas in Europe, Switzerland, Germany (Wenker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1998</xref>), and recently Sweden (de-Verdier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). Infection rates are most probably rel. high leading to rel. few but significant mortalities. Llamas and alpacas may act as aberrant hosts to some parasites. In the USA, e.g., llamas cohabiting with the common white-tailed deer (
 <italic>Odocoileus virginianus</italic>) may be infected with a meningeal worm (
 <italic>Parelaphostrongylus tenuis</italic>), a nematode-causing neurological disease in the aberrant hosts (Fowler
