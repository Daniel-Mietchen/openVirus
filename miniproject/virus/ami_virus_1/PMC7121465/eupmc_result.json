    "Growing interest in camelids presents a unique challenge to scientists and veterinarians engaged in diagnosing infectious diseases of this species. It is estimated that 65 % of fatalities in Old World camels (OWC, i.e., Camelus dromedarius and C. bactrianus) and 50 % in New World camelids/South American camelids (NWC/SAC, i.e., the domestic alpaca (Vicugna pacos) and llama (Lama glama)) are caused by infectious diseases. Factors that contribute to disease emergence in camelids involve climate change and increased demand for camel products resulting in the intensification of production and expanding camel contacts with other animal species and humans. In this chapter, the most important emerging diseases of camelids are described and discussed. The most notable emerging viral infections in OWC include camelpox, Rift Valley fever (RVF), peste des petits ruminants (PPR), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection. Brucellosis, Johneâ€™s disease (JD), and dermatophilosis are the emerging bacterial diseases in OWC. Emerging diseases of NWC include infections with bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bluetongue (BT), and coronavirus. Parasitic emerging infections in NWCs include the small liver fluke (Dicrocoelium dendriticum) and meningeal worm (Parelaphostrongylus tenuis)."
