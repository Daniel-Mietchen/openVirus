<p>There is no more 
 <italic>terra incognita</italic> on Earth. Humans, by migratory habits, professional or recreation occupations explored already the entire natural environments on the planet, stepping into the immense variety of its ecosystems. While the vast ocean is still open for discovery, zoonotic risk is not out of the scope. As an example, humans are more likely to interact with pinnipeds, than with any other marine mammals and a newly described influenza from seals may potentially infect humans (White et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2013</xref>). Influenza B virus as well as measles can be shared by human and seals . Also it is well documented that transmission occurs from human to animals like 
 <italic>Coxiella burneti</italic> found infecting seals in Alaska. Moreover, 
 <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic>, a member of human gastrointestinal normal flora, is known to infect sea mammals as well as other marine fauna including fishes (!) among others (Delannoy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2013</xref>; Duncan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2012</xref>).
