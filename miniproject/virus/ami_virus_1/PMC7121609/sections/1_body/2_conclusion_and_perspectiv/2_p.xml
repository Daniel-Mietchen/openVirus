<p>A literature review by Olival, Bogich, Karesh et al. (pers. comm. 2013) on virus isolation from different animal hosts shows that NHP, primates and small domestic ungulates are the mammals that share the most virus species with humans; when corrected for the number of species and by the respective sampling/research methods, monkeys, rodents and bats are the most important reservoirs for zoonotic agents. Moreover, if we focus on known viruses and correct for the number of species and sampling per taxonomic order, chiropterans appear to potentially harbor three and six time more different virus species than rodents and NHP, respectively. Also Rodent and Chiropteran are one of the most species richness among the vertebrate orders, they harbor a variety of viruses that can be potentially infectious for human. Moreover, apes share a so close relationship by nature with human, i.e. &gt; 90 % of genomic identity, that they theoretically can easily exchange pathogens and pass such “thin” inter species barrier form NHP to Human Primates.</p>
