<p>More than 60 % of 335 emerging infectious diseases identified since 1940 have a zoonotic origin. Among them more than two third are from wildlife animal (Jones et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">2008</xref>). Furthermore, specific territories or domains of emergence, within a given environment, where people, livestock and wildlife encounter each other, have been identified and characterized. An analysis of all documented events has led to develop a spatial and temporal approach for a better understanding of dynamic risk factors (so-called drivers) associated with disease emergence (Souris et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">2010</xref>). By understanding these variable drivers of different scales (e.g. from molecular to spatial, including environmental factors) using computing assisted analysis and mathematical models we might finally be able to predict and hopefully prevent emerging zoonotic infections (Morse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2012</xref>). Obviously, theoretical models will have always to be sustained by accurate survey networks coupled with multidisciplinary research. Several of these drivers have to be carefully monitored, e.g. human expansion and its propensity to invade animal territories (i.e. protected area), the emergence of new pathogens from the natural fauna, ecological and environmental conditions, human and animal behaviors, socioeconomic changes, etc.
