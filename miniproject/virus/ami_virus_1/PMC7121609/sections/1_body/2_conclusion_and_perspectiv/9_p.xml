<p>Survey and networking, connected to research, molecular biology and/or virus discovery are the strategic key to predict and prevent the emergence of new zoonoses as well as the next pandemic zoonosis (Gonzalez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2011</xref>). Moreover technological advances in molecular diagnostics, mathematical modeling, communication, and informatics enable a targeted global surveillance of emerging and previously unknown infections in both human beings and other species (Morse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2012</xref>).
