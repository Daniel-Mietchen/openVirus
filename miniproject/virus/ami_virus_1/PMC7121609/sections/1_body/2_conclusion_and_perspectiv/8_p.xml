<p>Climate change and societal behavior favor the encounters of hosts, vectors and pathogens that never “met” before: Human and animal populations are highly reacting to climate change (e.g.: mosquitoes) and move or expand towards new territories. Human density, i.e. risk of encounter/transmission from animals to humans, and changes in behavior (pets, hunting) are the driver of emerging zoonoses.</p>
