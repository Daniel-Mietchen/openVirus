<p>Biodiversity plays a role in both directions, favoring the risk of exposure to new potentially pathogenic agents and protecting the host against unknown microbes. On one hand, biodiversity exists for the microorganisms as well as for all the other animals, such increasing the variety of potential human pathogens that have not yet “jumped” from animals to humans. On the other hand, the biodiversity of the human major histocompatibility complex, MCH, helps to prevent infection by new pathogens. Eventually, new pathogens may adapt to a new human host (humanization) and ultimately resist to disappearance (i.e. drug resistance) (Maillard and Gonzalez
