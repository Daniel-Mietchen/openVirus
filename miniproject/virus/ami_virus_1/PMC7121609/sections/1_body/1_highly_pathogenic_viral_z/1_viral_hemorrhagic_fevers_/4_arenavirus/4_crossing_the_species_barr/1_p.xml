<p>Virus transmission within rodent populations occurs through vertical (mother to progeny), or horizontal routes (directly through bites or indirectly by contacts with urine or feces). Arenavirus transmission from natural rodent hosts to humans occurs through contacts with infected rodent biological fluids (i.e. blood, saliva or urine), when people (through rodent bites, trapping or eating rodents) are directly exposed to the infected rodent, or indirectly, when exposed to food contaminated with rodent urine and/or by inhalation of infested rodent excreta. Also, human-to-human transmission may occur and arenaviruses can be transmitted trough aerosolized particles and sperm fluid. Moreover, transmission to humans may occur by accidental inoculation with infected body fluids and through tissue transplantation (Emonet et al.
