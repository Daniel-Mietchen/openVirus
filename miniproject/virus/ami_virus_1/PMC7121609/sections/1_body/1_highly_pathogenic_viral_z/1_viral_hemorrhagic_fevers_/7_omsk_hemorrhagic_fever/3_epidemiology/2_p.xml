<p>The sylvatic cycle of OHFV involves rodents and in particular the nonâ€“native muskrat as a natural OHFV reservoir, but also water voles (
 <italic>Arvicola terrestris</italic>), while most animals within endemic areas can be infected and bitten by the tick vectors. OHFV survives in water and is transferred to humans via contaminated water or an infected tick.
