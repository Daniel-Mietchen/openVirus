<p>Two independent studies reported that Ebola virus cell entry and replication requires the cholesterol transporter protein Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). The studies described that when cells from Niemann Pick Type C1 patients were exposed to Ebola virus in the laboratory, the cells survived and appeared immune to the virus, further indicating that Ebola relies on NPC1 to enter cells. The same studies described similar results with Ebola’s cousin in the filovirus group, Marburg virus, showing that it too needs NPC1 to enter cells (Carette et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>; Côté et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). Furthermore, NPC1 was shown to be critical to filovirus entry because it mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein (Côté et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). Miller et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2012</xref>) confirmed the findings that NPC1 is a critical filovirus receptor that mediates infection by binding directly to the viral envelope glycoprotein and that the second lysosomal domain of NPC1 mediates this binding. Carette et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2011</xref>) showed mice that were heterozygous for NPC1 were protected from lethal challenge with mouse adapted Ebola virus . Together, these studies suggest NPC1 may be a potential therapeutic target for an Ebola anti-viral drug.
