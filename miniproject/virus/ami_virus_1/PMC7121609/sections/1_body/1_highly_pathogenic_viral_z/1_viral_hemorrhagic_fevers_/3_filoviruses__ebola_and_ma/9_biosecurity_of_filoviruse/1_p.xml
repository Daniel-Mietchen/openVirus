<p>Filoviruses (Ebola viruses and Marburg viruses) are listed as World Health Organization Risk Group 4 Pathogens, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Category A Priority Pathogens, Select Agents, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Category “A” Bioterrorism Agents due to the absence of prophylaxis or treatment regimens, their high lethality (up to 90 % in larger outbreaks), their high infectivity (LD
 <sub>50</sub> = 1 virion in rodent models), and their stability in artificial aerosols. Research on infectious filoviruses requires Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories.
