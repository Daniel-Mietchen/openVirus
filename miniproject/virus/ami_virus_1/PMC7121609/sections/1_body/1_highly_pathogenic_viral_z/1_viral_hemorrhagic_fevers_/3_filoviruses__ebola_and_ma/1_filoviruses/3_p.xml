<p>The genus 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> contains five species: 
 <italic>Bundibugyo ebolavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Zaire ebolavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Reston ebolavirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Sudan ebolavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Taï Forest ebolavirus</italic>, whose members are Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), Ebola virus (EBOV) , Reston virus (RESTV), Sudan virus (SUDV), and Taï Forest virus (TAFV), respectively (Kuhn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2010</xref>). Ebola-Reston is the only known Filovirus that does not cause severe disease in humans; however, it can still be fatal in monkeys and it has been recently recovered from infected pigs in South-East Asia. A third, tentative genus (“
 <italic>Cuevavirus”</italic>) has been suggested for a novel filovirus, Lloviu virus (LLOV; species “
 <italic>Lloviu cuevavirus</italic>”), which has not yet been isolated in culture. With the exception of RESTV and possibly LLOV, all of these viruses cause severe and often fatal viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) upon infection in humans (Negredo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2011</xref>).
