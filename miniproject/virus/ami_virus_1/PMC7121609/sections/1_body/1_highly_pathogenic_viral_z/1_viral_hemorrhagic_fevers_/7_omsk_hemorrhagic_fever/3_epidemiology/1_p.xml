<p>The geographic distribution of the OHFV appears restricted to western Siberia (Kharitonova and Leonov 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1985</xref>) in Omsk, Novosibirsk, Kurgan, and Tyumen oblasts. The main hosts of OHFV are rodents and in particular the nonâ€“native muskrat (
 <italic>Ondatra zibethica</italic>) as a natural OHFV reservoir. Muskrat was imported to Siberia from Canada in the 1920s and the virus finds a particular receptive host to replicate and spread efficiently.
