<p>Prevention of arenavirus infection consists of interrupting virus transmission from rodents to humans, and from humans to humans. Rodent control seems to be efficient only in certain conditions (i.e.: urban settings). Hospital based nursing barrier appears highly efficient, including personal protective measures (gloves, masks and gowns), good hygiene and appropriate sterilization of equipment. The highest-risk of infection occurs during unprotected contact with body fluids from an infected person. Linens should be handled per CDC guidelines

Environmental surfaces and contaminated equipment are properly disinfected by 1:10–1:100 dilution of sodium hypochlorite or other EPA-registered disinfectants. The viruses can also be inactivated by ultraviolet, gamma irradiation, temperatures of 56 °C for 20 min and, by a pH less than 5.5 or greater than 8.5.
