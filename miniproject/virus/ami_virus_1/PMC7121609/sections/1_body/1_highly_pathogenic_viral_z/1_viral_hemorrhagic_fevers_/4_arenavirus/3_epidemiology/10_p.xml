<p>Sabía virus was first isolated from a fatal case of Brazilian HF (BrHF) in the village of Sabía, outside of Sao Paulo, Brazil in 1990 (Lisieux et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">1994</xref>). Two other non-fatal accidental infections were later recorded (Gandsman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1997</xref>). Chapare virus infected patients were also clinically considered as BrHF cases. Both viruses do not have an identified reservoir, however, like the other arenaviruses, they naturally appear to have only a limited geographical distribution.
