<p>Ebola virus disease (EVD) was first described after almost simultaneous viral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks occurred in Zaire and Sudan in 1976 (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">1978a</xref>). EVD is believed to occur after an ebolavirus is transmitted to a human index case via contact with an infected animal host. Human-to-human transmission occurs via direct contact with blood or bodily fluids from an infected person (including embalming of a deceased victim) or by contact with contaminated medical equipment such as needles. In the past, explosive nosocomial transmission has occurred in underequipped African hospitals due to the reuse of needles and lack of implementation of universal precautions. Aerosol transmission has not been observed during natural EVD outbreaks, although there are reports suggesting or suspecting aerosol transmission between NHP or in humans based on epidemiological observations (Dalgard et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1995</xref>; Roels et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">1999</xref>). The potential for widespread EVD epidemics is considered low due to the high case-fatality rate, the rapidity of demise of patients, and the remote rural areas where infections occur .
