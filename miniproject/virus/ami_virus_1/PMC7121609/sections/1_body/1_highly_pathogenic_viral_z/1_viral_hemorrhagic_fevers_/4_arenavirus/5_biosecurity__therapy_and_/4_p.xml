<p>Among all arenaviruses, only one vaccine, i.e. the live attenuated Junín virus vaccine Candid #1, has been conclusively developed and produced: its immunogenicity and efficacy in humans was proven to be greater than 84 % without causing any serious adverse effects (Maiztegui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">1998</xref>). Other vaccines tested in animal models include: an attenuated recombinant LASV vaccine using vesicular stomatitis virus as vector that causes a protective immune response in NHP against a lethal LASV challenge (Geisbert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2005</xref>); an attenuated Lassa/Mopeia construct ML-29 virus demonstrated protection against LASV challenge in guinea pigs and Rhesus macaques (Lukashevich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2008</xref>); a yellow fever 17D vaccine expressing LASV glycoprotein precursor protected also guinea pigs against LASV challenge (Bredenbeek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; Charrel and de Lamballerie 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2010</xref> for review).
