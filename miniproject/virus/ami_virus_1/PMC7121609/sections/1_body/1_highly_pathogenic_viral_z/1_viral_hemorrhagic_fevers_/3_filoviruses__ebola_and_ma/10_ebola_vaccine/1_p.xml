<p>Most of the Ebola virus VP proteins are capable of eliciting protective immune responses and therefore are important to consider as potential components of a vaccine to protect humans from Ebola hemorrhagic fever. An “Ebola ∆VP30” strain replication incompetent virus as been generated with a lack of the gene encoding for the VP30 protein, therefore it cannot replicate and do not form infectious progeny in wild-type cells. The genome is stable, without a single event of virus replication; experimental infection of animals did not cause disease in infected animals (Halfmann et al.
