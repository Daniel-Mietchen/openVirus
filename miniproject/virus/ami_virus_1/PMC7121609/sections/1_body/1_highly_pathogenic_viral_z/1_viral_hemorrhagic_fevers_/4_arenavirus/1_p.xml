 <bold>Arenaviruses</bold> are negative stranded RNA viruses of the 
 <italic>Arenaviridae</italic> family. They naturally and chronically infect asymptomatic rodent host-reservoirs. Each rodent species is persistently infected by a specific virus and represents a model of virus-host coevolution (Gonzalez et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2007</xref>). One exception is made with the Tacaribe virus that has been isolated from naturally infected chiropteran (Downs et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">1963</xref>).
