<p>Between 1976 and 1998, from 30,000 mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods sampled from outbreak regions, no 
 <italic>Ebolavirus</italic> was detected apart from some genetic traces found in six rodents (
 <italic>Mus setulosus</italic> and 
 <italic>Praomys sp</italic>.) collected from the Central African Republic (Pourrut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2005</xref>). Traces of EBOV were detected in the carcasses of gorillas and chimpanzees during outbreaks in 2001 and 2003, which later became the source of human infections. However, the high lethality from infection in these species makes them unlikely as natural reservoir (Pourrut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2005</xref>). Plants, arthropods, and birds have also been considered as possible reservoirs; however, bats are considered the most likely candidate. Bats were known to reside in the cotton factory in which the index cases for the 1976 and 1979 outbreaks were employed, and they have also been implicated in Marburg virus infections in 1975 and 1980 (Pourrut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">2005</xref>). Of 24 plant species and 19 vertebrate species experimentally inoculated with EBOV, only bats became infected (Swanepoel 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">1996</xref>). The absence of clinical signs in these bats is characteristic of a reservoir species. In a 2002–2003 survey of 1030 animals that included 679 bats from Gabon and the Republic of the Congo, 13 fruit bats were found to contain EBOV RNA fragments (Leroy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2005</xref>). As of 2005, three types of fruit bats (
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti</italic>, and 
 <italic>Myonycteris torquata</italic>) have been identified as being in contact with EBOV. They are suspected to represent the EBOV reservoir hosts (Pourrut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2007</xref>).
