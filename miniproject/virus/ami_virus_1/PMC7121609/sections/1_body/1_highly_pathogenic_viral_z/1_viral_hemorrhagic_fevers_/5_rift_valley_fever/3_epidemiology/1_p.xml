<p>Human infections can result from direct contact with infected animal biological products, by handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Consequently, herders, slaughterhouse workers, farmers and veterinarians are at high risk of infection. The virus can infect humans through inoculation (i.e.: wound), inhalation of aerosols, by ingesting unpasteurized or uncooked milk or from mosquito bites . To date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented. Outbreaks of RVF occur essentially in rural environment (see WHO
