<p>Viral Hemorrhagic Fevers (VHF) appear as a whole clinical entity characterized by (high) fever and bleeding that can progress to shock and death. The first severe VHF identified was the Ebola Hemorrhagic Fever (1976), although the Marburg virus was isolated and characterized earlier in 1967; Marburg virus, however, appears in the medical literature as part of the nosocomial framework of VHF only in 1977 when published aside with the Ebola virus (Bowen et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">1978</xref>); the Lassa fever and Bolivian and Argentine HF, Yellow Fever, Rift Valley Fever, Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), and others. The group of VHF was identified as a nosologic entity associated with viruses belonging essentially to five distinct families of RNA viruses: the four Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Bunyaviridae, and Flaviviridae. Only recently in September 2012 scientists reported the isolation of a member of the Rhabdoviridae family responsible for VHF in the Bas-Congo district of the Democratic Republic of Congo (Grard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2012</xref>). Several VHFs share many important features: (1) many of them may be transmitted by arthropod-borne agents (usually mosquito vector), (2) person-to–person transmission is possible through direct contact with infected patients, their blood or other body fluids; (3) natural animal reservoirs are mainly rats and mice , but also domestic livestock , monkeys or other NHP may serve as intermediate hosts. Moreover, with the increasing international travel, these mainly tropical viruses may now be imported into non-endemic countries thus posing a major global risk for human public health. Furthermore, several of these agents have been associated with nosocomial outbreaks involving health care and laboratory workers.
