<p>Lassa fever (LF) was described in 1956 in the eponym village of Lassa. LF occurs in rural West Africa, and appears to be hyper-endemic in Sierra Leone with an antibody prevalence of 8–52 %, Guinea (4–55 %) and Nigeria (21 %). Natural transmission of Lassa virus (LASV) occurs from its domestic, ubiquitous, prolific and common multimammate rodent virus reservoir, 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic>. As for other Arenaviruses it is transmitted to humans directly through rodent urine and faeces or indirectly by contaminated food. Person-to-person transmission has been described posing a risk for healthcare workers. The virus can also be contracted by an airborne route or by direct contact with infected human blood, urine, or semen, up to three months after clinical recovery. LF is a prominent threat outside the endemic area with several imported cases in Germany (Gunther et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">1990</xref>), the United Kingdom (Kitching et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2009</xref>) among others. About 80 % of patients experience a mild or asymptomatic infection. LF has a relatively low mortality rate up to 5 %. Among the endemic countries, it is estimated that LF is responsible for about 5000 deaths a year. Pregnant women have the greatest risk of fatality. After an incubation period of 1–3 weeks an acute illness develops while the virus infects every tissue from the mucosa (e.g., intestine, lungs and urinary system) and subsequently progresses to the vascular system. Initial non-specific symptoms include fever, facial swelling, muscle fatigue, conjunctivitis and mucosal bleeding. Later on there might develop gastrointestinal tract bleeding, bloody vomiting, dysphagia, melena, accompanied with cough, dyspnea worsening to cardiovascular system dysfunctions (pericarditis, tachycardia) and hepatitis; finally hearing deficit, meningo-encephalitis and seizures occur. Death is due to multiorgan failure. With respect to this multiple organ infection and accompanying HF signs differential diagnoses include other VHFs such as Ebola or Marburg, malaria or influenza (Yun and Walker
