<p>The natural reservoirs of Marburg viruses remain to be identified unequivocally. However, the isolation of both MARV and RAVV from bats and the association of several MVD outbreaks with bat-infested mines or caves strongly suggest that bats are involved in Marburg virus transmission to humans. Avoidance of contact with bats and abstaining from visits to caves is highly recommended, but may not be possible for those working in mines or people dependent on bats as a food source. Monkeys are susceptible but are incidental hosts and individuals handling infected monkeys or their fluids and cell cultures of Marburg virus have become ill (Towner et al.
