<p>Argentine HF (Junín virus) was identified in the early 1940s in Argentina and described in the 1950s in the rural area of Buenos Aires province, while the virus was characterized only in 1958. Today the virus distribution expend to 150,000 km² of the Pampa. The Vesper mouse (
 <italic>Calomys</italic> spp.) is the natural host and direct rodent-to-human transmission occurs via ingestion of contaminated food or water, inhalation of rodent urine infested particles or via direct contact of broken skin with rodent excrements. Currently, Argentine HF remains a major and severe enzootic disease of public importance in Argentina with an endemic risk of crossing the natural barrier of the Rio Paraná and spill over to the closest neighboring countries of Uruguay (Polop et al.
