<p>The virus can be transmitted through body fluids. Transmission through oral or conjunctiva exposure is likely and has been confirmed in NHP (Jaax et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1995</xref>). Filoviruses are not naturally transmitted by aerosol. They are, however, highly infectious as breathable 0.8–1.2 μm droplets in laboratory conditions; because of this potential route of infection, these viruses have been classified as Category “A” biological weapons (Johnson et al.
