<p>Besides the specific association between “arenavirus species—rodent species”, the geographic range of an arenavirus ecologic niche appears to be more restricted than the one of its rodent reservoir-host with a more circumscribed enzootic domain, which is often limited by natural barriers (e.g. rivers, elevations, climate, food access). This appears as one of the major characteristics of the epidemiological and dispersion patterns of arenaviruses and therefore VHFs associated with them (Salazar-Bravo et al.
