<p>Several antiviral molecules are under development with the most promising one directed to interfere with arenavirus cell entry (Larson et al. 2008; York et al. 2008; Charrel et al.

Although hyperimmune serum has been effectively used in several instances, clinical experiences are limited and only circumstantial reports are available. Hyperimmune serum treatment has been used successfully for AHF patients and a plasma bank was established in Argentina (Maiztegui et al.
