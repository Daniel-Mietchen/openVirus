<p>In humans, VEEV usually causes mild to severe influenza-like symptoms; 4–14 % of cases, however, develop neurological complications (Gardner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2008</xref>). Children and young adults are more likely to develop encephalitis; however, fatalities in humans are rare reaching about 1 % of all reported cases (de la Monte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1985</xref>). Usually, flu-like symptoms such as headache, myalgia, fatigue, vomiting, nausea, diarrhoea, pharyngitis and fever appear abruptly, 2–5 days after exposure to the virus. The VEE virus can also cause retro-orbital and occipital headaches as well as leucopenia and tachycardia. Symptoms of encephalitis, only appearing in a minority of cases, occur 4–10 days after exposure and include somnolence, convulsions, confusion, photophobia, and coma. Fatal human cases are usually caused by encephalitis as well as brain, lung and gastrointestinal bleeding (Weaver et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1985</xref>). Generally, the symptoms last between 3 and 8 days and can be biphasic, recurring 4–8 days after the initial symptoms (Sidwell et al.
