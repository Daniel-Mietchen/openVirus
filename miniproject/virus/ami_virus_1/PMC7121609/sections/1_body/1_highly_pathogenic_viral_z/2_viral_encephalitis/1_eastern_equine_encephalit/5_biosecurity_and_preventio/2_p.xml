<p>EEEV is difficult to isolate from clinical samples; almost all isolates (and positive PCR results) have come from brain tissue or CSF. Laboratory acquired infections have been reported, and accidental parenteral inoculation, contact of the virus with broken skin or mucous membranes, and bites from infected laboratory arthropods or rodents are the primary hazards associated while working with these viruses.</p>
