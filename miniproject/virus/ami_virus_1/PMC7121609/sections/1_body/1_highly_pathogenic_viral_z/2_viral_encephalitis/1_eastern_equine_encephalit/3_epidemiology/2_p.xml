<p>In the United States, about six human cases of EEE are reported annually. Most cases of EEE have been reported from Florida, Georgia, Massachusetts, and New Jersey. EEEV transmission is most common in and around freshwater hardwood swamps in the Atlantic and Gulf Coast states and the Great Lakes region. Between 1964 and 2010, there were 270 confirmed cases of EEE in the US. Several states in the northeastern USA have seen increased virus activity since 2004. Between 2004 and 2006, there were 17 equine cases and at least 13 human cases of EEE reported in Massachusetts. In 2006, approximately 500,000 acres (2000 km
 <sup>2</sup>) in southeastern Massachusetts were treated with mosquito adulticides to reduce the risk of humans contracting EEE. Subsequently, between 2007 and 2010, there were two confirmed human cases and six equine cases reported to CDC and USDA respectively.
