<p>VEEV can be found in the body fluids of horses, and transmission by direct contact or aerosols is theoretically possible in this species. However, natural transmission of VEEV between horses or from horses to humans has not been seen. Infected laboratory rodents can also shed this virus, and people have been infected after exposure to aerosolized debris from cages.</p>
