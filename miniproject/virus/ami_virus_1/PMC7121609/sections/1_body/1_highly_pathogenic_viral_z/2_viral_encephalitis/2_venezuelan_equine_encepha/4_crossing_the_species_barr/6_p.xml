<p>Epidemic VEEV can cause serious disease in horses, mules, burros, donkeys and zebras. During epizootics, fatal cases have also been reported in domesticated rabbits, dogs, goats and sheep. Cattle, pigs, bats and opossums can also be infected. Experimental infections have been reported in NHP, guinea pigs, mice and hamsters; some isolates are fatal for laboratory rodents, although they are usually asymptomatic in their normal rodent hosts.</p>
