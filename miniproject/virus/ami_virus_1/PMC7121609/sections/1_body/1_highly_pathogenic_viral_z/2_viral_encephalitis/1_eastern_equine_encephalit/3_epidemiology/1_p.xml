<p>EEEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected mosquito. Human EEEV cases occur relatively infrequently, largely because the primary transmission cycle takes place in and around swampy areas where human populations tend to be limited. Overall, only about 4–5 % of human EEEV infections result in EEE. EEEV infection is thought to confer life-long immunity against re-infection. It does not confer significant cross-immunity against other alphaviruses (e.g., Western Equine Encephalitis Virus), and it confers no cross-immunity against flaviviruses (e.g., West Nile Virus) or bunyaviruses (e.g., La Crosse Virus)</p>
