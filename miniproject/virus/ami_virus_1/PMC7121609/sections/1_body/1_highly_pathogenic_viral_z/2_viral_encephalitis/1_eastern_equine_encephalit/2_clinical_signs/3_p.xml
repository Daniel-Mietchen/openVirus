<p>EEE is the most severe of the arboviral encephalitis entities and has a mortality of 50–75 % (Petersen and Gubler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">2003</xref>). Death usually occurs 2–10 days after onset of symptoms, but can occur much later. Of those who recover, 15–50 % are left with disabling and progressive mental and physical sequelae, which can range from minimal brain dysfunction to severe intellectual impairment, personality disorders, seizures, paralysis, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Many patients with severe sequelae die within a few years (Zacks and Paessler
