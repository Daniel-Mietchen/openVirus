<p>Being a zoonosis, TBE cannot be easily eliminated from endemic areas. However, the introduction of large-scale vaccination campaigns has proven to be highly effective in reducing the burden of disease. In Austria, where the vaccination coverage in the general population has reached approximately 90 %, the number of clinical cases could be reduced to about 10 %, as compared to the prevaccination era (Heinz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2007</xref>). In most highly TBE-endemic countries, large-scale vaccination campaigns are not implemented (Heinz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2008</xref>). The risk of acquiring TBE in a highly endemic area in Austria was calculated at approximately 1/10,000 per person-month (Rendi-Wagner

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2012</xref>) recommends tick bite prevention in endemic areas during the summer months; only at-risk travellers should be offered vaccination. Travellers are considered to be at risk when hiking or camping in rural and forested areas up to altitudes of 1400 m (WHO
