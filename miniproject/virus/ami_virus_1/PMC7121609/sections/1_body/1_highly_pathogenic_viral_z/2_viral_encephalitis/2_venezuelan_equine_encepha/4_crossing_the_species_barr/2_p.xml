<p>VEEV is typically spread by mosquitoes, although certain types of ticks and mites can spread the virus as well (Weaver et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2004</xref>). The 
 <bold>Culex (Melanoconion</bold>) mosquito is normally responsible for the dispersal of the enzootic strain of the VEE virus (Zacks and Paessler

 <bold>Ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus, Psorophora confinnis, Psorophora columbiae, Ochleratus sollicitans, Mansonia titillans</bold> and 
 <bold>Anophilis aquasalis</bold> are some of the species of mosquitoes known to carry the epizootic varieties of the VEEV (Weaver et al.
