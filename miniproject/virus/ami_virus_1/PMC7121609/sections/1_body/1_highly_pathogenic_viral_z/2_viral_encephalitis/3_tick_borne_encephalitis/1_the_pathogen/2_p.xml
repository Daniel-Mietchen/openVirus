<p>The family Flaviviridae includes other tick-borne viruses affecting humans and these viruses are closely related to TBEV and Russian Spring Summer encephalitis, such as Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus in Siberia, Al Khumra virus in Saudi Arabia, and Kyasanur Forest disease virus in India. Louping ill virus (United Kingdom) is a member of this family; it causes disease primarily in sheep and has been reported as a cause of a TBE-like illness in laboratory workers and persons at risk for contact with sick sheep (e.g.: veterinarians, butchers) (see above paragraphs 5.2.1.4 and 5.2.1.5).</p>
