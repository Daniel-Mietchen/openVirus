<p>VEE epidemics typically begin in horses, with human cases developing weeks later: Unlike EEE outbreaks, which usually end with the onset of colder temperatures, VEE epidemics can last for several years. Epizootic subtypes of VEEV can cause significant morbidity and mortality in equids; the infection rate can be as high as 90 %, and the morbidity rate varies from 10–40 % in some areas to 50–100 % in others. The CFR in horses is 38–90 %. Fatal infections have also been reported in goats, rabbits, dogs and sheep during epizootics, as well as in laboratory rodents infected with some isolates.</p>
