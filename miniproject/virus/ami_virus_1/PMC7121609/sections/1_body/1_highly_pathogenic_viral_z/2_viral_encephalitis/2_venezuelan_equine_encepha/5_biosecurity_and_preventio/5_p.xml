<p>During the Cold War, both the United States biological weapons program and the Soviet biological weapons program researched and weaponized VEEV. In April 2009, the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick reported that samples of VEEV were discovered missing during an inventory of a group of samples left by a departed researcher. The report stated the samples were likely among those destroyed when a freezer malfunctioned.</p>
