<p>TBEV is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected tick of the Ixodes species, primarily 
 <italic>I. ricinus</italic> (European subtype) or 
 <italic>I. persulcatus</italic> (Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes). The virus is maintained in discrete areas of deciduous forests. Ticks act as both vector and virus reservoir, and small rodents are the primary amplifying host. Tickborne encephalitis (TBE) can also be acquired by ingesting unpasteurized dairy products (such as milk and cheese) from infected goats, sheep or cows, and reports of this route of infections come from Slovakia, Poland, the Baltic States, and other Eastern European countries (Kerbo et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">2002</xref>; Balogh et al. 2010). TBEV transmission has infrequently been reported through laboratory exposure and by slaughtering viremic animals. Direct person-to-person spread of TBEV occurs only rarely, through blood transfusion or breastfeeding (Dumpis et al.
