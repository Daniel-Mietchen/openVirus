<p>VEE complex viruses are divided into epizootic (or epidemic) and enzootic (or endemic) groups. The epizootic viruses, which are amplified in equines and are responsible for most epidemics, are found in VEEV subtypes I-AB and I-C. The remaining viruses, including VEEV I-D, VEEV I-E and variants in subtypes II-VI are enzootic (sylvatic) subtypes. These viruses are generally found in limited geographic areas, where they usually occur in natural cycles between rodents and mosquitoes. The enzootic subtypes are typically non-pathogenic for horses and are not amplified in this host; however, in 1993 an enzootic I-E variant was responsible for an outbreak of VEE among horses in Mexico (Weaver etÂ al.
