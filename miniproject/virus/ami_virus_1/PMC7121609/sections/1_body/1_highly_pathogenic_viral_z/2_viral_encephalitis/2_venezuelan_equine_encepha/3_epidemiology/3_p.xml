<p>VEE can be widespread in human populations during epidemics; more than 10 % of the population in an area may be affected. Between epidemics, sporadic cases of VEE are caused by enzootic viruses. Humans are highly susceptible to VEE; approximately 90–100 % of exposed individuals become infected, and nearly 100 % develop clinical signs. However, most infections are mild. Less than 1 % of adults develop encephalitis, with approximately 10 % of these cases ending in death; the overall CFR in adults is less than 1 %. Very young or elderly patients are more likely to develop severe infections. Encephalitis, with a CFR of 35 %, occurs in approximately 4 % of children less than 15 years of age. More severe disease, with a higher incidence of neurologic signs, might occur in both children and adults after a biological attack with aerosolized virus.</p>
