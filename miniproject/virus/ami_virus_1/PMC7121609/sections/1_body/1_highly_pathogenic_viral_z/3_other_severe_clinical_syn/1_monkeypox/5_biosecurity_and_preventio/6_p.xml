<p>Health-care workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed monkeypox virus infection, or handling specimens from them, should implement standard infection control precautions. Healthcare workers and those treating or exposed to patients with monkeypox or their samples should consider being immunized against smallpox. However, the smallpox vaccination should not be administered to people with comprised immune systems.</p>
