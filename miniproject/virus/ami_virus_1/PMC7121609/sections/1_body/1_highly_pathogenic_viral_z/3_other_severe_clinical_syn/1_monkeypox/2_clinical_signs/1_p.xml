<p>Monkeypox disease is characterized by the onset of non-specific symptoms which can include fever, headache, backache, and fatigue during a prodromal period of 2–3 days (Reynolds et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2006</xref>). This is followed by a 2–4 week period in which a rash develops and progresses from macules, to papules, to vesicles, and then to pustules, followed by umbilication, scabbing and desquamation (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2003</xref>). The rash is usually confined to the trunk, but can spread to the palms and soles of the feet, occurring in a centrifugal distribution (Parker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2007</xref>). Lesions can also develop on mucous membranes, in the mouth, on the tongue, and on the genitalia (Nalca et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">2005</xref>). The pathogenicity of monkeypox is similar to that of smallpox except for the pronounced lymphadenopathy associated with monkeypox and generally milder symptoms (Heymann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2008</xref>). Lymphadenopathy is thus considered to be a key distinguishing feature of monkeypox (Weber and Rutala 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2001</xref>). The CFR is approximately 1–10 % in Africa, with higher death rates among young children (Parker et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">2007</xref>). In children unvaccinated against smallpox, the case-fatality rate ranges from 1 to 14 % (Heymann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2008</xref>). In addition, children may be more susceptible to monkeypox due to the termination of regular smallpox vaccinations following the worldwide eradication of the disease in 1980.
