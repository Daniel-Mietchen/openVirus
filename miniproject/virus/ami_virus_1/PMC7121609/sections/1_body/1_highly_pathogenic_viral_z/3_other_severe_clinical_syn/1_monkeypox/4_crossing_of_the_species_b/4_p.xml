<p>Likos etÂ al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2005</xref>) investigated phylogenetic relationships between Monkeypox virus isolates by examining five whole-genome sequences and confirmed the existence of two distinct groups: the first group contained isolates from the Congo Basin (Congo Basin clade), and the second group included isolates from countries in western Africa. Differences in epidemiologic and clinical features between Monkeypox virus isolates (e.g., higher morbidity and CFR caused by the Congo Basin clade) support the differentiation between these two clades.
