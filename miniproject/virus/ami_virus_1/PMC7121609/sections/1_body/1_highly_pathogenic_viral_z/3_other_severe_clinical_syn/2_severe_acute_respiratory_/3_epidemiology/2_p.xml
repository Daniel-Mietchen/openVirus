<p>The virus is supposed to have originated from its natural host, a horseshoe bat (
 <italic>Rhinolophus</italic>
 <italic>sinicus</italic>). Subsequently, it is thought to have been transmitted to and mutated within a secondary host, the palm civet (
 <italic>Panguma larvata</italic>) serving also as an amplification host, before it was passed into humans as a new human-pathogenic virus, the SARS-CoV (Zhong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">2003</xref>). SARS-CoV was found to infect also raccoon dogs (
 <italic>Nyctereuteus</italic> sp.), ferret badgers (
 <italic>Melogale</italic> spp.) and domestic cats. SARS-CoV emerged several times from the same intermediate host, the palm civet, to transgress the species barrier and infect humans. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV seems to have also emerged several times in the past in the province of Guangdong, but remained unnoticed as potential epidemic risk. The conclusion was that bats acted as a reservoir of SARS-CoV with the potential to infect other mammals including humans (Li et al.
