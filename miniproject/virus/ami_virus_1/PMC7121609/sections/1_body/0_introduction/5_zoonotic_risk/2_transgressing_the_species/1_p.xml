<p>The pathogen species-jumping ability is relevant from wild as well as domestic animal species that can transmit their own microbes to human. The species barrier can easily be violated when species are sympatric and/or taxonomically closely related (e.g.: Arenavirus and different rodent species). Although some pathogens have a high infectious specificity and are usually restricted to infect one host species, some of them can pass the species barrier after a mutation or genetic re-assortment (e.g.: the SARS coronavirus from chiropteran to Palm civet
 <italic>,</italic> avian influenza from bird to pig) and/or after an alteration of the permissive host (e.g. due to immunodeficiency). Ultimately, zoonotic diseases result from parasites, 
 <italic>sensu lato,</italic> that can live apparently harmlessly in a natural host while producing disease upon entry into a different host. Some prominent examples are e.g. HIV having a non-human primate origin and influenza viruses generated from pig and bird viruses after genetic re-assortment, both subsequently evolving to be adapted to a human-to-human virus transmission.
