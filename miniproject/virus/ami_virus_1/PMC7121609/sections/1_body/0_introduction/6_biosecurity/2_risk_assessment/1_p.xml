<p>The biological risk can be either of natural (i.e.: the random encounter of the pathogen, the natural host and human), accidental (i.e.: unexpected “spill over” of the pathogen that infect another host including human), or deliberate origin (i.e.: an individual—criminal—or a group—terrorist—undertaking taking action to infect human or animals). Preventive measure needs a risk assessment with respect to the identified pathogen and its potential to target human and animal (or vector) populations. Several pathogens have been identified as particularly dangerous in that matter regarding their intrinsic characteristics. Ultimately, human and animal populations can consequently be identified concerning their vulnerability to the agent (i.e.: pathogenicity and occurrence in the same environment) (Table
