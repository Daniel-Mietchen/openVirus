<p>The origin of zoonotic diseases occurred probably when humans came in close contact (scavenging or hunting) with wild animals. Indeed, several zoonoses have been known since early prehistoric times. The first hominids were in direct contact with animal groups which previously appeared on Earth some 540 million years ago (ya.). The history of mankind, starting with Australopithecus, begins about 5 million ya. and coincides with the first contact and potential of microbe exchanges between fauna and this human precursor. Also, one of the most ancient hominids, Australopithecus, was not hunter, but a pretty game (!) hunted by large and powerful carnivorous. Also sick and infected individuals were eaten by such large predators, and human epidemics turned short (Debré and Gonzalez

 <italic>Homo</italic> species from the Pleistocene era (2.6 million–11,700 ya.) utilized larger animals for subsistence (Rabinovich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">2008</xref>) including mammoths, long horned bisons, saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths, among others mammals of North America, Asia, and Europe. It is quite acceptable that these creatures were able to exchange their parasites, e.g. intestinal and blood parasites or fur ectoparasites, with humans.
