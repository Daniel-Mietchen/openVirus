<p>Hunting remained a crucial component of hunter-gatherer societies before the domestication of livestock and the dawn of agriculture 11,000 ya. First attempts to domesticate dogs, goats, and sheep, occurred as early as 15,000–9,000 ya., giving rise to domestic zoonotic parasitic disease. Ultimately, about 1000 ya., 22 species were domesticated including dog, goat, sheep, cattle, camel, pigs, and chicken. Later, during the Neolithic period, when agricultural practices appeared, domestication was well under way supporting the appearance of e.g. flea-or louse-transmitted bacterial zoonoses or pyogenic infections after contact to wild and domestic animals . In fact, in prehistoric times, when human populations were organized in small tribes with a limited number of 100–200 individuals, the human population was actually an accidental victim of infectious diseases, developing rapidly an herd immunity and leaving the pathogens to infect and survive in the more abundant animal populations (e.g. anthrax, rabies, tularemia, cysticercosis) (Debré and Gonzalez
