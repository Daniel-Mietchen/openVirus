<p>More than 75 % of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting humans are of animal origin; about two third of all human pathogens have an animal source as a natural reservoir (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">2001</xref>). The nosologic term of “Zoonosis” has been crafted to gather all transmissible diseases harboring a potential to infect both human and animal (Palmer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2001</xref>). Zoonosis (i.e. zoonotic diseases) are transmissible diseases between animals and man with an infectious (microbes and prions) or parasitic origin. In another term, a zoonotic disease represents any animal disease communicable to human and/or vice versa. Ultimately, zoonosis can be transmitted from animals to humans, directly or indirectly, sometimes by a vector or an intermediate host, or also from humans to other animals. This is considered as reverse zoonosis and called anthroponotic disease, or zooanthroponosis. Zoonoses can be of viral (Yellow Fever, HIV, hantavirus), bacterial (tularemia, leptospirosis, lyme disease), rickettsial (Q-fever), fungal (aspergillosis, histoplasmosis), parasitic (giardiasis, cryptosporidiasis), or prions (Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease) origins. Also the mechanisms of transmission are the main factors driving the risk of human infection. Infectious agents are transmissible under natural circumstances from wild or domestic vertebrate animals to humans. They can also be transmitted from animal products causing foodborne diseases, e.g.
