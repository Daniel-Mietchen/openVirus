<p id="Par49">Although all Neotropical NHP have been considered sensitive to YFV, most of the records and studies are related to 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> and 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic>. From 2221 NHP deaths, caused by YF, from 1996 until June 2016, in Brazil, the most affected NHP were 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> sp. (85.0%) followed by 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp. (8.3%), 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic> sp. (0.8%), 
 <italic>Cebus</italic> sp. (0.22%), and 
 <italic>Saimiri</italic> sp. (0.05%). From July 2016 until April 2019, at least 3569 NHP deaths were caused by YF. From these total, most of the identified specimens were 
 <italic>Alouatta</italic> sp. (31.7%) and 
 <italic>Callithrix</italic> sp. (17.1%), followed by 
 <italic>Sapajus</italic> sp. (1.1%) and 
 <italic>Cebus</italic> sp. (1.0%). For the first time, SINAN registered cases of YF in 
 <italic>Callicebus</italic> sp. (0.45%), 
 <italic>Aotus</italic> sp. (0.03%), and 
 <italic>Ateles</italic> sp. (0.03%). Also, the first case of YF was registered in 
 <italic>Leontopithecus rosalia</italic> (golden lion tamarin), an endangered species native of Atlantic Forest (data received from SINAN, June 2019).
