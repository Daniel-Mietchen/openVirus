<p id="Par21">Studies have also been conducted to investigate the predictors of severity and death in different groups of YF patients. Age and elevated levels of AST, ALT, and creatinine have been independently associated with mortality in YF patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], while higher values of serum lipase and lower values of factor V were related to severe cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Kallas and colleagues (2019) analyzed data from 76 YF patients and observed that age, neutrophil count, AST, and viral load were independently related with death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Clinical and laboratory indicators could support the management of patients and the establishment of prognosis. However, one should keep in mind that YF evolves rapidly, and clinical characteristics may vary according to different factors related to the host and the phase of infection.
