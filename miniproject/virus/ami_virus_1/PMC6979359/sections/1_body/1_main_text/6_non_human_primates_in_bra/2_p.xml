<p id="Par38">The family Pitheciidae comprises NHP without prehensile tails which use quadrupedal locomotion, and most of the species are herbivorous. The species within the genera 
 <italic>Pithecia</italic>, 
 <italic>Cacajao,</italic> and 
 <italic>Chiropotes</italic> are distributed in the Amazon region. However, 
 <italic>Callicebus,</italic> the species-richest genus of Neotropical NHP, has a wide occurrence in the Brazilian territory in areas covered by the Amazon, Atlantic Forest, Caatinga, and Pantanal biomes [

 <italic>Callicebus</italic> specimens are much smaller than the other members of the family (0.8–1.5 kg) and differ in social organization, living in small family groups with a single monogamous adult pair. They mainly eat fruits, but also leaves, flowers, insects, bird eggs, and small vertebrates [
