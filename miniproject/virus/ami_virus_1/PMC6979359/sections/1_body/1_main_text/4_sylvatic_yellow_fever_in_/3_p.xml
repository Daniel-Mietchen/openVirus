<p id="Par29">In 2016, a sylvatic YF outbreak started in Minas Gerais state, and then it spread to São Paulo, Espírito Santo, Rio de Janeiro, and Bahia states in 2017 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The YFV lineage causing this outbreak was estimated to exist for at least two years before the outbreak and likely reached the Southeast region by passing through the Midwest region of Brazil [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. YFV-positive NHP were detected in Minas Gerais state throughout 2017 until mid-2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These findings raised the possibility of viral persistence in the Southeast region, which was later confirmed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. YFV cases occurred until 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>] in Minas Gerais, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, and São Paulo states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In 2019, YF outbreaks were reported in São Paulo, and the virus spread to Santa Catarina and Paraná states [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].
