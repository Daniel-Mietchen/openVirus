<p id="Par21">Generally, even when higher expression levels have been obtained (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>), immunogenicity was not tested, and research focused on increasing expression levels and not on producing an immunogenic commercial product. The focus on S-COE has left a gap in the research on plant production of other PEDv proteins. However, our recent results have shown that M can be produced 
 <italic>in planta</italic> and that VLPs can be produced for PEDv (Khamis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>). VLPs represent a step-forward for subunit vaccine design, demonstrating higher immunogenicity than regular subunit vaccines. In the future, advances in subunit vaccine design, such as VLPs, and a commitment to improving yields and testing immunogenicity and protective immune responses to these VLPs may lead to the commercialization of a plant-produced subunit PEDv vaccine.
