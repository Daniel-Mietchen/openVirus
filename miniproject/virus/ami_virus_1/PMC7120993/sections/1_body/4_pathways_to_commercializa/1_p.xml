<p id="Par20">While proof of concept studies show that S-COE can be produced in plants, many of these studies show poor yields. Generally, even when higher yields are reported, the push forward to testing the immunogenicity of these vaccine candidates does not occur. There have been two instances where the direct immunogenicity of plant-produced S-COE has been tested. The first was incomplete, as it did not test whether the mounted immune response was virus-neutralizing (Huy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>). The other candidate that successfully took steps to test immunogenicity was the vaccine candidate produced by (Bae et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>). However, while the immune response in mice inhibited PEDv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls, complete immunity was not achieved (Bae et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>). Likely due to this, and due to the need for higher expression levels, no further efforts were made with this vaccine candidate.
