<p id="Par11">Nonetheless, due to the early recognition of the antigenic importance of the protein, PEDv recombinant protein production has focussed on S. Work has been done to produce S or S epitopes in 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Van Noi and Chung 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2017</xref>), 
 <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic> (Ge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2012</xref>), and via the Orf virus as a vaccine delivery vector (Hain et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2016</xref>). However, most recombinant PEDv S production has occurred in plants, with all of these plants producing S-COE. The protein yield has varied widely, as has the plant host utilized. Historically, tobacco has been the most established and developed platform for high-yield plant-based recombinant protein production (Conley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>). As such, it follows suit that five of the fourteen reports of S-COE production were carried out using tobacco (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Four of the reports expressed S-COE in a stable transgenic line, with yields between 0.1% of TSP (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2005b</xref>) and 2.1% of TSP, depending on codon optimization (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2005a</xref>), while one reported transient production at 5% of TSP (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2004</xref>).
