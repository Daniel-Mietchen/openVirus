<p id="Par12">Many of the alternative plant choices resulted in yields that were either not quantified, or very low, despite often using the same promoters and enhancers as the tobacco studies. Like the tobacco studies, a double-enhanced 35S (2x35S) cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) promoter was used in carrot and potato expression experiments. Expression in potato reached 0.1% of tuber TSP, while expression in carrot was not reported (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2003</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>). Expression of S-COE has also been reported in 
 <italic>Lemna minor</italic> [35S promoter, not quantified, (Ko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2011</xref>)], sweet potato [35S promoter, not quantified (Yang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005</xref>)], and corn [2x35S, 0.122% TSP (Kun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2014</xref>)].
