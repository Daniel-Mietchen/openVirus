<p id="Par13">The use of fusion proteins, particularly the heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit of 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (LTB), have recently gained popularity in subunit vaccine design, and have been utilized in the production of S-COE. Three studies have expressed such fusions in rice, which has shown promise in reaching equivalent accumulation levels as tobacco. Rice was used to express S-COE both in the endosperm and in calli. While accumulation levels in the calli using the rice α-amylase 3D promoter (RAmy3D) only reached 0.083% for a S-COE-M cell-targeting ligand (Co1) fusion (Huy et al.
