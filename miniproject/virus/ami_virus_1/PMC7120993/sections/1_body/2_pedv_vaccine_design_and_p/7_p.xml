<p id="Par14">So far, only three studies have tested the immunogenicity of plant-produced S-COE. LTB-S-COE produced in tobacco was able to bind to the GM1-ganglioside intestinal membrane receptor (Kang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2006</xref>). More directly, mice orally immunized with Co1-S-COE fusion protein produced in rice calli had threefold and eightfold higher levels of IgG and IgA secreting cells in their lymphocytes, respectively, compared to unimmunized mice (Huy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2012</xref>). While this is encouraging, in order for a vaccine to be effective, the antibodies produced must be virus-neutralizing. Bae et al (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2003</xref>) took this next step, showing that feeding ground lyophilized transgenic tobacco containing S-COE was able to induce an immune response in mice that could inhibit PEDv plaque formation by 49.7% in comparison to controls. While full immunity was not conferred by the mounted immune response, this study marks the most significant achievement to date in plant-based PEDv vaccine research.
