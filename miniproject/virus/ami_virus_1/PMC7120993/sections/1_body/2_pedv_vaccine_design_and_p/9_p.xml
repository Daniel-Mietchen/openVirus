<p id="Par16">Through sequence homology with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, a gammacoronavirus), M was found to have a B-cell epitope on its C-terminus from amino acids 195â€“200 (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2012</xref>). However, it is likely that with further research sequence homology studies will find more epitopes on PEDv M. For example, the M protein of SARS-CoV has B-cell epitopes on the N and C-termini (He et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>), and two cytotoxic T-cell epitopes in the second and third transmembrane domain (Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2010</xref>), while the M protein of MHV has a CD4+ T-cell epitope on its C-terminus (Xue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1995</xref>).
