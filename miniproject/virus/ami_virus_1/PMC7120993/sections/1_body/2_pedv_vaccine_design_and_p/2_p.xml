<p id="Par9">Of the four structural proteins, S and M are the most antigenic. To date, the S protein has been the primary focus of subunit vaccine design due to its antigenicity, and the role it plays in viral entry, as it regulates interactions with host cell receptor protein, aminopeptidase N (Bosch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2003</xref>). S contains three antigenic regions. The first epitope that was recognized spans amino acids 1495–1913. Called the CO-26K equivalent (COE), this epitope induced a neutralizing immune response and was identified through sequence homology with TGEV, which induces similar clinical symptoms in pigs (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2002</xref>). Subsequently, the motif spanning amino acids 1368–1374, and the epitope region from amino acids 636–789 have also been found to induce the production of neutralizing antibodies (Cruz et al.
