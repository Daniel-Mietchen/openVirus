<p id="Par15">M is the other antigenic protein of PEDv, and the most abundant component of the viral envelope (Utiger et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1995</xref>). In contrast to 
 <italic>S</italic>, 
 <italic>M</italic> is more conserved, showing 5.5% the number of mutations as 
 <italic>S</italic> after 100 serial passages (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>; Sato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>). The use of a protein that remains stable is important for subunit vaccine design to ensure that a vaccine can be used for a wide variety of strains and locations. The M protein of TGEV and SARS-CoV show virus-neutralizing activity in the presence of complement, the component of the immune system that enhances the ability of antibodies to clear pathogens. This virus-neutralizing activity was demonstrated to be higher or comparable to the neutralizing capacity of 8 individual S protein fragments (Pang et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1988</xref>).
