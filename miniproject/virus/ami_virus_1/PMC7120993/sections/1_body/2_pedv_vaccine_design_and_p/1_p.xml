<p id="Par8">To produce an effective vaccine against PEDv, it is important to understand the structure of the virus. The Coronavirinae subfamily consists of three genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, and gammacoronavirus. PEDv is an enveloped alphacoronavirus encoded by a 28 kilobase single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (Song and Park 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). Coronaviruses have the largest known RNA genomes of all viruses (King 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). The PEDv genome has seven open reading frames (ORFs), which code for three non-structural polyproteins, and four structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N)]. These open reading frames are flanked by a 5′ cap and a 3′ polyadenylated tail (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>) (Song and Park 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). The ORFs encoding the non-structural proteins consist of two overlapping open reading frames, ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two polyproteins. These polyproteins are processed by three virus-encoded proteases, a 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro) and two papain-like proteinases (PLP) which results in 16 non-structural proteins required for genome replication and mRNA transcription (John et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2016</xref>; Prentice et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2004</xref>). The accessory protein ORF3 is a potassium ion channel, but its role is not well defined (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2012</xref>). Reports on transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV), another alphacoronavirus, indicate that S and E are only present in the virion in small quantities, with E estimated to occur 20 times in a virion (Godet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1992</xref>). N and M occur in higher numbers, at a ratio of 1N:3M (King 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). A recent study examining mouse hepatitis virus (MHV, a betacoronavirus), severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV, a betacoronavirus), and feline coronavirus (FCoV, an alphacoronavirus), has determined that coronaviruses have approximately 1100 M dimers, 90 S trimers, and N proteins in a ratio from 3M:1N to 1M:1N (Neuman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2011</xref>). Thus, M is the most abundant structural protein displayed at the viral surface.
