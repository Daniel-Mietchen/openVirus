 <italic>S</italic> has been shown to be prone to mutations through serial passages (Sato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2011</xref>), and has high genetic variability among PEDv strainsâ€“strains have even been found with 582 nucleotide deletions in the

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2015</xref>). Indeed, the variability of 
 <italic>S</italic> makes it the gene of choice to study the genetic relatedness of different PEDv strains (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). The difference in amino acid sequence between the S protein of different strains can lead to different epitopes being presented, and may explain why previous vaccines have failed to provide effective immunity against infectious strains (Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2012</xref>).
