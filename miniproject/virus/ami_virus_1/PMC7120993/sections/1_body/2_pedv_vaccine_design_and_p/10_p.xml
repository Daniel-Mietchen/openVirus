 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2016</xref>) resulted in the production of virus-like particles (VLPs), an important development of subunit vaccine design. While subunit vaccines have previously failed to completely protect piglets from PEDv infection due to subpar immunogenicity, VLPs are more immunogenic because they resemble the native structure of the virion. Plant-made VLPs for influenza are shown to induce four- to six-fold higher levels of antibody response than fifty times more flu antigen not in VLPs (Dâ€™Aoust et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>). The ability to produce PEDv VLPs using M may lead to the first commercial plant-produced PEDv vaccine.
