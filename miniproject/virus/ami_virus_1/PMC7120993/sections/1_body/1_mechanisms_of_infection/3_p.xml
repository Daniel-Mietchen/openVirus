<p id="Par7">Once PEDv enters enterocytes it causes them to undergo acute necrosis (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>). PEDv also causes a reduction in the number of goblet cells, the cells which secrete mucins to defend against microbial infection (Jung and Saif 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2015</xref>). Cytolysis additionally leads to shortening and severe atrophy of intestinal villi, and causes the tips of villi to erode or become covered with attenuated epithelial cells (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>; Stevenson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2013</xref>). The atrophy of intestinal villi results in microscopic lesions, which are typical of an enteritic infection, (Sueyoshi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1995</xref>). PEDv also results in swollen cells, and the detachment of cells from adjacent cells and from the membranes of the basal surfaces (Stevenson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2013</xref>). These factors inhibit the pigâ€™s ability to absorb water and nutrients, and result in the malabsorption and diarrhea discussed above.
