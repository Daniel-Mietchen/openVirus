<p id="Par6">PEDv causes sickness through its actions in the intestines of pigs. The virus enters porcine enterocytes, which line the inner surface of the intestines, via interaction between the viral S protein and the enterocyte aminopeptidase N which acts as a cellular receptor for PEDv. Through this receptor PEDv enters the enterocyte cells, where new virions assemble by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus membranes (Ducatelle et al.
