<p id="Par19">None of the PEDv vaccines used commercially, at least in the U.S. and Canada, are made 
 <italic>in planta</italic>. The ability to vaccinate orally through feeding plant tissue is important as (Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2007</xref>) demonstrated that oral vaccination was more effective than injection for their PEDv vaccine. When comparing oral to intramuscular administration of their attenuated virus vaccine, Song et al. found that more IgA’s were produced by orally vaccinated pigs, and that the mortality rate for this group was 13% in comparison to 60% for the intramuscular group. Current vaccines on the market are also either based on S, which is prone to mutations, or are killed or live attenuated vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines present risks, as they can potentially mutate and become pathogenic again, and allow for genome segment re-assortment on farms—one Chinese PEDv strain is thought to have evolved from a live attenuated vaccine (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2010</xref>). Inactivated vaccines, in comparison, are safer, but have a high cost of production, and present concerns over the reliability of inactivation methods (Calvo-Pinilla et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). Both live attenuated and inactivated vaccines rule out the possibility of using “distinguish infected from vaccinated animals” (DIVA) assays, as they contain the entire virus. As such, the market has a need of an effective subunit vaccine based on the current infectious strains. Further research on current plant-made candidates could prove to fill this need.
