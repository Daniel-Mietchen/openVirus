<p id="Par18">Much of the PEDv vaccine research has occurred in Asia, where outbreaks have been most severe, but none of the produced vaccines are completely effective against Asian PEDv strains (Song and Park 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2012</xref>). Available Asian vaccines are based on strains that are genetically different from those sequenced in the U.S. that are currently causing epidemics globally (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>). This has been on display in China, where vaccinated herds experienced PEDv breakouts that were found to be due to newer strains of the virus (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2012</xref>). Two PEDv vaccines were given conditional licenses in the U.S. by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). The first was a vaccine originally produced by Harrisvaccines, Inc., and is based on their SirraVax
 <sup>SM</sup> RNA platform. Using this platform, part of the RNA genome of a Venezuelan equine encephalitis alphavirus is replaced with a gene for PEDv S protein. After injection with genetic material, the pig’s dendritic cells produce the S protein and an immune response is launched against the produced protein (Harrisvaccines, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2015</xref>). Merck Animal Health acquired Harrisvaccines in 2015 (Merck Animal Health 2015) but the product is still sold under a conditional license in the U.S., where safety and field trials are ongoing. The second conditionally licensed PEDv vaccine in the U.S. is an inactivated virus particle vaccine produced by Zoetis, Inc. (Zoetis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>). Efficacy and potency studies are still in progress for the Zoetis vaccine, and duration of immunity has not been evaluated. It must be refrigerated, and used all at once when opened (Zoetis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2016</xref>). A third vaccine candidate is being developed by VIDO-Intervac (Vaccine and Infection Disease Organization—International Vaccine Centre) in Canada and is currently undergoing field testing. This vaccine candidate is a subunit S1 protein expressed in mammalian HEK-293 T cells, and although it induced production of neutralizing antibodies, it was not fully protective to suckling piglets (Makadiya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2016</xref>).
