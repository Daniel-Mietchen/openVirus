<p id="Par3">The first known PEDv outbreaks occurred in Europe in the 1970s and 1990s, including in Belgium (Pensaert and de Bouck 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">1978</xref>) and Hungary (Nagy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1996</xref>). While PEDv has since posed less of a threat to Europe, it has re-emerged in Italy (Martelli et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008</xref>), Germany (Hanke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2015</xref>), and France (Grasland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2015</xref>) affecting pigs of all ages. PEDv spread to Asia in the early 1980s, where it was first detected in Japan in 1982, and then in South Korea, China, and Thailand (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). Since October 2010 China has seen a severe outbreak of PEDv, resulting in high porcine mortality rates and economic losses (Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2012</xref>). PEDv was first detected in the United States (U.S.) in May 2013 (Stevenson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2013</xref>) and then in Canada in January 2014 (Ojkic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2015</xref>). These two countries have experienced severe economic losses due to the death of millions of suckling piglets and to diarrhea-derived weight loss in fattening pigs (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2014</xref>). The North American serotypes are most closely related to a recently emerged Chinese serotype (Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2013</xref>) and since the North American epidemic, they have spread to South Korea, Taiwan, and Japan (Lee
