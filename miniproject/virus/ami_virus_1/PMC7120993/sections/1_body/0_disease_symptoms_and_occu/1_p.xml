<p id="Par2">Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) is a coronavirus that causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) in pigs. Its high mortality rate for piglets, at 90–95% (Stevenson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2013</xref>) is a key distinguishing factor between PEDv and the similar transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In suckling piglets, the PEDv incubation period is around two days, varying from 1 to 8 days. Diarrhea and vomiting can develop within 24 h, and as a result dehydration, anorexia and severe weight loss occur. In older pigs and sows, morbidity varies, and the period between onset and end of clinical symptoms is 3–4 weeks (Lee
