<p>The identification of the time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) and rate of substitution provides information about the pattern of evolution and origin of CHIKV. Therefore, the dataset of 153 unique E1 gene sequences was checked for different evolutionary models using the program Model Test 3.7 (coupled with PAUP 4.0b 10) to find the best fit model of substitution for the sequence alignment [

 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. GTR (General Time Reversible) as a nucleotide substitution model and G (Gamma distribution) with four rate categories were chosen as the site rate variation model (GTR + G4) for the evolutionary analysis. The tMRCA and nucleotide substitution rate were determined using BEASTv1.8.3 software [

The constant size population, exponential growth and Bayesian skyline coalescent tree priors (demographic models) in both strict as well as relaxed molecular clocks were used for the analysis. The MCMC chain was run for 200 million steps with parameter values sampling at every 20 000 steps for all the six different combinations of demographic models and molecular clocks. Log marginal likelihoods were determined by path sampling and stepping stone sampling values [
