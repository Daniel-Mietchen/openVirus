<p>The sequences for the present study were taken from different countries at varying time intervals or from the same country at different times in order to avoid the repetition of similar sequences. A total of 265 such sequences (latest available till March 2019) of the partial E1 protein gene of CHIKV were downloaded after an extensive search in GenBank. The dataset also included 153 unique sequences that were used for Bayesian analysis. The details of the sequences used in the study are in Supplementary Table S1.</p>
