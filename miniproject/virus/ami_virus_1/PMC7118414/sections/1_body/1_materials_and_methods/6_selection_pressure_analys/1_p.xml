<p>The selection pressure analysis of partial E1 gene sequences of all the 153 unique sequences was done using Datamonkey online server (

 <xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Estimation of dN/dS (ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous mutations) was done using HKY85, F81 and REV nucleotide substitution models each under three different approaches that are single likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed effects likelihood (FEL) and inverse FEL (IFEL) methods [
