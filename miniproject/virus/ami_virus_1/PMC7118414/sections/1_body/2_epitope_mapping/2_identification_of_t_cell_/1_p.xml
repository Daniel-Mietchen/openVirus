<p>The T-cell epitope prediction was done through IEDB tools. The MHC-I epitope prediction included the identification of 9mer peptides in the E1 protein that could possibly be the CD8+ T-cell epitopes. Various HLA A, B and C associated epitopes with binding affinity &lt;200Â nm (IC50&lt;200) were shortlisted by NetMHCpan tool [
 <xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. These epitopes were further analysed using combined predictor (combined score of proteosomal cleavage and transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) score), NetCTL (Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte), MHC-NP (Naturally processed Peptides by the MHC) and conservancy and immunogenicity scores. The epitope prediction for MHC class II molecules was done using NetMHCIIpan. All 9mer peptides with IC50&lt;50 were considered to be potential epitopes. These were further analysed using PREDIVAC online tool to reach the most specific epitopes (
