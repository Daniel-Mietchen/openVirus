<p>The Network analysis revealed that in the West African region, Nigerian CHIKV strain further diverged to Senegal and Cote D'ivoire [
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. This West African genotype was localised in this region from the late 1950s till 2009 that was not reported from other geographical regions. Our data also suggested that the emergence of the Asian genotype was from Thailand due to the first Asian epidemic in this region during 1958 [
 <xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Subsequently, the Asian genotype from Thailand diverged in three different directions. The first branch spread towards India, the second one continued circulating in Thailand and the third one moved to Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. These strains in India and Thailand did not branch further and were observed until the 2004 epidemic. The third branch further diverged towards the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean region. We further analysed the divergence of this third branch of the Asian genotype in detail. The epidemic involving Asian strains started from Indonesia in 2010 causing the first outbreak in New Caledonia in 2011, Philippines, Yap Island (Micronesia) and China in 2012 [
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. This branch further moved towards other Pacific Ocean regions and French territories including Tonga and Papua New Guinea. Similar strains were also reported from East Timor, Moscow, France and the Caribbean Islands [
 <xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The travel-associated spread of the virus in some areas of the Caribbean region lead to the establishment of mosquito–human life cycle of the virus in these areas. Subsequently, many autochthonous cases were reported from these regions [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. The virus then spread throughout the Caribbean region and then to Brazil, Mexico and French Polynesia [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].
