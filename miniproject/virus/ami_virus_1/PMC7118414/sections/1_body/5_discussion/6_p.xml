<p>The ECSA strains are presently circulating in many Asian countries namely India, Sri Lanka, Bhutan, China, Singapore, Cambodia and Vietnam that originated from a cluster of the epidemic strains [
 <xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The other branch of the epidemic strains diverged into the sequences reported in recent years from Thailand, Sri Lanka and American regions (including Brazil, Mexico and USA). Thus, during recent years (2013–14), ECSA has started a parallel circulation with Asian strains in the American continent and the Caribbean regions [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Further, the phylogenetic analysis of the ECSA genotype suggested a close similarity between these 2013–17 strains reported from the USA and one particular travel-associated case that was imported from Angola to the USA [
 <xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These branching patterns of CHIKV strains across the globe based on the E1 gene reflect its gradual and consistent evolution.
