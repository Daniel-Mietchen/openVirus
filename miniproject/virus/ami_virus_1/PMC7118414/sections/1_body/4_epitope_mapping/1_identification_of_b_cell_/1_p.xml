<p>Six different prediction methods available in IEDB were used to predict the probable B-cell epitopes (Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Fig. S4). This included the following: (1) Bepipred linear epitope prediction: the peptide ranging from amino acid number 185 to 214 had higher prediction values with a maximum score of 1.8. The average and minimum scores were 0.089 and −3.2, respectively, with a threshold value of 0.09. (2) Chou and Fasman 
 <italic>β</italic>-turn prediction: amino acid number 180–215 with a higher prediction score of 1.25 and an average and minimum score of 0.9 and 0.5, respectively, with a threshold value of 1.00. (3) Emini surface accessibility prediction: maximum surface accessibility was found in the region from 200 to 215 amino acids with a score of 6.0 with a minimum and average surface accessibility score of 0.03 and 1.00, respectively, at a threshold value of 1. 4. The highest flexibility score calculated by Karplus and Schulz prediction was 1.095 in the 190–212 amino acids with an average of 0.9 and a minimum score of 0.8 at a threshold value of 1. (5) Kolaskar and Tongaonkar method: higher score of 1.2 amino acids 210–220 with an average, minimum and maximum scores of 1.056, 0.9 and 1.3 at a threshold value of 1. (6) Parker Hydrophilicity Prediction calculated the highest value of 5.9 in 200–220 amino acid positions with an average score of 1.46 and a minimum score of −7.2 at a threshold of 1.48. Amino acid positions from 200 to 214 were found to be common by almost all the prediction methods.
