<p>The reconstruction of the geographic distribution of CHIKV suggested a distinctive branching pattern owing to gradual alterations in the E1 gene. The recent movement of the virus to non-endemic regions of the world is associated with travel cases and its autochthonous transmission. Co-circulation of CHIKV with other arthropod-borne viruses like Dengue and Zika in many regions has been reported from different geographical regions. Overlapping clinical symptoms and limited diagnostic tests, particularly in underdeveloped countries, can complicate the accurate reporting of CHIKV infections. Therefore, a comprehensive surveillance of all the arthropod-borne viruses at both hospital and community levels would go a long way in determining the transmission dynamics of these pathogens. This is likely to provide intellectual enrichment on the global disease burden and the formulation of possible control measures for the prevention of these viral infections.</p>
