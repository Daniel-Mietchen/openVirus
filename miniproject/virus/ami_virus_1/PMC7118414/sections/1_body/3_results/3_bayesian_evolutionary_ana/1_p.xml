<p>Bayesian skyline coalescent tree prior under strict clock was chosen to be the best fit on the basis of Bayes factor (Supplementary Table S2). The Maximum Clade Credibility Tree was constructed using the log file generated in the best run (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). The MCMC tree also revealed the clustering pattern of the sequences as described earlier by phylogenetic analysis. The CHIKV was calculated to be originated around 491 years ago (1526) with 95% Highest Posterior Density (HPD) ranging from 357 (1660) to 637 years (1380) with a global nucleotide substitution rate of 2.78 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> (HPD 95%: 2.14 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> to 3.47 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup>) across all the genotypes. The tMRCA of ECSA was calculated to be 114 years (1903) (HPD 95% 87 (1930) to 140 (1877)). The age of Asian and West African genotypes was calculated to be 68 years (1949) (HPD 95% 57 (1960) to 81(1936)) and 61 years (1956) (HPD 95% 52 (1965) to 71 (1946)), respectively.
