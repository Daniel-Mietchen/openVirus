 <caption>
  <p>The phylogenetic Network showing clusters of the Chikungunya virus sequences from different geographical regions. The network shows the pattern of emergence of CHIKV related to the first isolated strains. The size of the circles is representative of the number of clustering haplotypes from different parts of the world. The sequences in panels a, b and c show probable origin of the virus in ECSA strains, the distinct epidemic strains and the initial Asian strains. The cluster highlighted with a black circle contains recently circulating strains of Brazil, Mexico, the Caribbean and Micronesia. The arrows show the divergence of new and recently reported strains from their origin. The length of lines and distances between strains are not proportional to the mutational distances amongst these strains.</p>
