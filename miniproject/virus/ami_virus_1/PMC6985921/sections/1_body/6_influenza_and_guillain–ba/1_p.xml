<p>Even before the term “Guillain–Barré syndrome” was used in the clinical medicine, cases of infectious polyneuritis have been reported during influenza pandemic in the early twentieth century. About two-thirds of the influenza-infected patients initially present respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infections. Two studies in England (2007 and 2009) reported a strong association between influenza infection and GBS, with GBS occurring within 3 months after the influenza-like illness (ILI).

 </sup> In further strengthening the association of influenza infection to GBS, another study conducted on GBS patients confirmed a prior influenza infection.

 </sup> The relative incidence of GBS after influenza was highest in the first week after infection and decreased during the next 6 weeks. The estimated risk of GBS after influenza was reported as 17.2 cases per 1 million patients hospitalized with influenza.

 </sup> A study in Norway during the 2009 pandemic (H1N1) influenza showed a much higher GBS in influenza patients with a relative risk of 4.89 (95% CI: 1.7–20.36). The risk of incidence of GBS post influenza infection was also higher than the relative risk of 1.1 (95% CI: 0.51–2.43) reported for pH1N1 vaccination.
