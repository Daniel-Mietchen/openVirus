<p>Given the very strong association between influenza infection and the incidence of GBS, and considering the requirement of vaccination in the prevention of influenza, we should not deprive the general population from getting vaccinated on the grounds of risk for GBS due to vaccination. It is to be noted that preventing the complications of influenza is one of the important benefits of the influenza vaccine. In fact, the complication of GBS due to vaccination is a rare event and thus poses very minimal risk. Therefore educational programs are required to erase this fear from the general public opinion.</p>
