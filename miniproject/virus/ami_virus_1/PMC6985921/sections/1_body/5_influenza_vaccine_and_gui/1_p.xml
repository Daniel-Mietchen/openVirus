<p>Incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was first reported in 1976 during a national vaccination program against pandemic swine flu in the United States.

 </sup> About 40 million people were vaccinated with the influenza A vaccine (influenza A vaccine in New Jersey) during the pandemic, and subsequently an eight-times increase in GBS incidence was observed (especially at 2–3 weeks or even more after vaccination).

 </sup> Since then, many researches evaluated the risk of GBS after receiving the seasonal and pandemic inactivated influenza vaccine. An overview conducted on 39 studies reported that the relative risk of GBS after pandemic influenza vaccination was higher than that after seasonal influenza vaccination, with an overall relative risk for the incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2–1.7).

 </sup> Other studies investigating the association between GBS and seasonal influenza vaccines after 1976 indicated the risk as very minimal with less than one case per million.

 </sup> Risk of GBS is maximum in the first 2–3 weeks post vaccination, but in most cases the estimated risk was one to two cases per million vaccinations.

 </sup> Furthermore, the biologic mechanism for GBS following influenza vaccine may involve the synergistic effects of endotoxins and vaccine induced autoimmunity. Following the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009 and the administration of the pH1N1 monovalent vaccine due to its similarity to the H1N1 monovalent vaccine in 1976, there were concerns about the probability of GBS. However, the studies that investigated this issue estimated the attributable risk to be about one to five per million doses of vaccination. In a meta-analysis conducted following the 2009 H1N1 monovalent influenza vaccination program (the largest nationwide vaccination program in the United States), the incidence of GBS was reported as 1.6 cases per million vaccinated people, which is approximately equal to the attributable risk reported for the seasonal influenza vaccination. Therefore, there is currently no consensus on the prohibition of the administration of the influenza vaccine. Nonetheless, it was recommended that caution should be taken in the revaccination of persons who have developed GBS within 6 weeks after receiving the influenza vaccine.
