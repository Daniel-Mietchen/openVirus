<p>Since the eradication of polio, GBS has become the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis. GBS is an autoimmune disorder affecting the Schwann cells of the PNS. This immune-mediated demyelinating neuropathy can rapidly evolve over a period of few days or more and can lead to paralysis or even death.

 </sup> The initial symptoms of GBS include muscle weakness that starts from distal limbs which subsequently progresses to proximal limbs.

 </sup> GBS may lead to respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation over 15% of cases.

 </sup> In some cases, GBS can affect the heart rate and changes the blood pressure by disrupting the autonomic nervous system.

 </sup> The disease can be self-limiting, with muscle strength reaching a lowest point in few days, followed by a partial or full recovery over weeks to months. Diagnosis of this syndrome is based on the clinical signs and symptoms and through rule out of other differential diagnoses as shown in 
 <xref rid="j_jtim-2019-0028_tab_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The treatment includes administration of intravenous immunoglobulins or plasmapheresis, and supportive therapies. Although most people have an uneventful recovery, up to one-third of the cases are left with severe neurological deficits.

 </sup> The mortality rate of the disease is approximately 8% in developing world, but much lower in developed countries.

 </sup> The incidence of GBS increases with age, and people older than 50 years are at greatest risk for developing GBS. The estimated risk of developing GBS in the world is one to two cases per 100,000 people per year.

 </sup> Severe autoimmune responses resulted from infections by external infectious agents are considered as major initiating factors of the syndrome.

 </sup> Infection by

 <italic>Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza</italic>, and influenza have been reported.

 </sup> Vaccination to influenza has been implicated in GBS, although the evidence for this link is controversial.
