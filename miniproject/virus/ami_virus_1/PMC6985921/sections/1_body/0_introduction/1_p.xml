 </sup> The etiology of GBS is still unclear. Recent investigations demonstrated that GBS can be triggered by several respiratory tract and intestinal infections. A significant number of GBS cases were also inflicted by Zika virus infection. After a large-scale vaccination campaign in 1976 against swine influenza, an increase in the incidence of GBS was noticed and thus raising the doubts on the safety of influenza vaccination.

 </sup> Subsequently, many studies were performed to evaluate the association of infections and in particular influenza as well as influenza vaccination with an incidence of GBS.
