<p>Influenza vaccines are commonly available for seasonal influenza and new versions of the vaccines are developed every year as the virus rapidly changes. Pandemic influenza vaccines are produced against certain strains of the influenza virus, such as the 2009 pH1N1 virus for rapid distribution during an influenza pandemic.

 </sup> Flu vaccines are available either as injectable inactivated vaccines or nasal spray flu vaccines (live attenuated influenza vaccine).

 </sup> Some resources report that injectable trivalent and quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccines are frequently used globally. Serious side effects to the flu vaccination are not very common. The most common adverse effects include pain at the injection site, muscle aches, fever, and malaise.

 </sup> GBS after influenza vaccination was first reported in 1976, which has become the origin of numerous studies on the association between this neurological disease and the vaccine.

 </sup> Before that, GBS was only associated with infectious diseases, but since 1976 an increase in the incidence of GBS after influenza vaccination has been noted with the same antigenic similarity in the role of vaccines, especially the influenza vaccine.
