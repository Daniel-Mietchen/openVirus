<p>Access to the PNS by the immune system requires crossing of the blood–nerve barrier. The blood–nerve barrier is not as tight as the blood–brain barrier, so that small amounts of circulating proteins and immunoglobulin G (IgG) can leak into PNS making it vulnerable to the immune attacks. The blood–nerve barrier is particularly leaky within the dorsal root ganglia and is altogether absent at nerve terminals, making these areas especially vulnerable to immune-mediated attacks. As previously mentioned, GBS begins with infectious agents such as influenza virus. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and B lymphocytes are in the frontline dealing with the influenza infections.

 </sup> Epitopes displayed by the virus interact with pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on APCs, especially DCs. Stimulation of APCs results in T cell activation and differentiation into either a Th1 (T helper cell type 1) or Th2 phenotype. Each phenotype has its specific cytokine signature and function. Once inside the PNS, the Th1 phenotype of differentiated Th cell recruits and activates macrophages. Macrophages initiate damage to PNS by producing and secreting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and nitric oxide.

 </sup> Humoral responses are initiated through activation of B cells by Th2 lymphocytes or by the epitopes of the virus cross-linking the B cell receptors. Both these pathways can result in class switching of activated B cells to IgG-producing plasma cells. The secreted IgG binds to viral surface epitopes and cross-reacts with similar epitopes in the peripheral nervous tissues. These antigen–antibody interactions can activate the complement system, resulting in membrane attack complex (MAC) formation
