<p>Typical symptoms of influenza infection include fever with shaking chills, myalgia, fatigue, anorexia, and diarrhea. The severity of these symptoms and their sudden occurrence can help differentiate influenza from other respiratory viral infections.

 </sup> Symptoms such as cough and sore throat are prevalent in influenza; however symptoms such as coryza are more due to common cold infections than influenza infection.

 </sup> Influenza viruses are divided into influenza A, B, and C types. Influenza A and B viruses circulate in the community in the winter every year and are found to be responsible for seasonal epidemics.

 </sup> Influenza C viruses usually have no symptoms or show mild symptoms and do not cause epidemics.

 </sup> Mutations in the influenza viral genomes leading to antigen changes (shift or drift), as well as the existence of animal reservoirs, can make the influenza treatment challenging as public immunity from previous immunizations may not be enough for protection.

 </sup> In some instances the changes to the viral genomes are so intense that the existing vaccines may no longer be effective leading to pandemics, such as a late winter outbreak of swine flu (pH1N1) in 1976 and flu pandemic or swine flu in 2009 (caused by influenza A virus type pH1N1).

 </sup> The complications of influenza infection can be either mild or very severe. Sinusitis and otitis are examples of moderate complications of influenza.
