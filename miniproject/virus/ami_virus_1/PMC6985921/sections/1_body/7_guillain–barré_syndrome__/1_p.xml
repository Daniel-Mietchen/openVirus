<p>According to several studies, there has been no proven association between the incidence of GBS and influenza vaccination with the exception of 1976 H1N1 influenza vaccination campaign in New Jersey.

 </sup> In fact 1976 H1N1 influenza vaccine in New Jersey is the only proven association of GBS and influenza vaccination. A study that analyzed few cases of GBS or Miller Fisher syndrome reported that the increase in the incidence of GBS syndrome was unlikely to occur over 40 days after vaccination.

 </sup> These studies suggest that the proven association between influenza vaccines and GBS is very little, and most often occurs in the case of pandemic vaccines. It seems that no prohibition can be considered for administration of influenza vaccine, except in persons who have had a history of GBS within 6 weeks after vaccination. On the other hand, some studies have noted seasonal winter patterns for GBS incidence.

 </sup> A study that examined the seasonal pattern of GBS for the year 2009 reported that an increase in vaccination coverage from 19.7% to 35.5% resulted in no similar increase in GBS cases.

 </sup> Some other studies revealed that influenza cases increased during 2004â€“2005 exactly overlapping with the wave of hospitalization due to GBS during the same period.

 </sup> These findings suggest a significant association between hospitalization due to GBS and influenza cases, but the coverage of influenza vaccine did not significantly affect the pattern of GBS incidence in the general population.
