<p>In developing the urgent recommendations of hospital infection control of COVID-19, we recruited guideline committee members including clinicians, hospital managers, methodologists and other practitioners. Seven critical questions were raised from first-line healthcare practitioners who participated in a focused, methodologist-mediated topic selection meeting. Prioritizing the public and then the patients, committee members answered these questions using least-to-recommendation (LTR) evidence with the help of methodologists. With rigorous evidence-based approaches, the multidisciplinary team completed the urgent recommendations within one week.</p>
