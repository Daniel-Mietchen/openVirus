 <p>The first genotyping data on measles virus (MeV) strains in Cameroon dates from 1994, while other studies were realized in 2001 and 2011 with the establishment of MeV virological surveillance. However, the genetic data of MeV strains circulating in Cameroon remains fragmented and concentrated in certain regions, hence the need for an update. The objective of this study was to have recent data on MeV genotypes circulating in Cameroon. Ninety throat swabs collected during recent measles outbreaks were analyzed by MeV genotyping RT-PCR using the nucleoprotein gene N. The resulting sequences were analyzed on the basis of 450 nucleotides with MEGA 7 software. Overall genome analysis was performed on 40/90 sequences. The strains were from all ten regions and all belonged to cluster 1 of genotype B3. The genotype B3 has been circulating in Cameroon for long periods of time; efforts must be made in immunization for its elimination.</p>
