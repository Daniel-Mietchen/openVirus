<p>According to the phylogenetic analyses, all the sequences from Cameroon belonged to cluster 1 of genotype B3. The same cluster was detected in Cameroon in 2001 and from 2010 to 2011 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]; in Nigeria and Ghana in 1998 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]; in Sudan from 1997 to 2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]; and in the Central African Republic in 2000 [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Cluster B3.1 strains remain endemic in Cameroon, where they have been circulating for about 17 years. This study is the first to characterize the MeV strains among Cameroonians in Adamawa, East and South regions. The East region borders the Central African Republic by Garoua Boulai and Betare Oya health districts and the South region borders Gabon and Equatorial Guinea by Olamze health district. Although there is no evidence of imported MeV strains in this study, the possibility of cross-contamination between Cameroonian populations and those bordering them is not excluded as the same genotype (B3) circulates in almost all of sub-Saharan Africa [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. A previous study reported the circulation of this same genotype in the East region of Cameroon though it was among refugees from Central African Republic [
 <xref rid="pone.0222428.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].
