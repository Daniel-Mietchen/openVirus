  <p>Optimization of biomass and NVCP VLP accumulation. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Biomass and NVCP yield under natural and artificial light. 
   <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants were growth either under natural or artificial light for 5 weeks. Leaf biomass (
   <italic>green square</italic>) and NVCP expression level (
   <italic>red column</italic>) were measured by weighing and ELISA, respectively. (
   <bold>b</bold>) Temporal pattern of biomass yield and NVCP expression. Plants were grown under artificial light for 5 weeks, and biomass production (
   <italic>green square</italic>) and NVCP accumulation (
   <italic>red column</italic>) were examined. For both (
   <bold>a</bold>) and (
   <bold>b</bold>), mean ± standard deviation (SD) of samples (
   <italic>N</italic> &gt; 10) from three independent infiltration experiments is presented. (

   <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants were infiltrated either with GV3101 cultures that carry the three MagnICON vectors for GFP expression (
   <bold>c</bold>) or with infiltration buffer as a negative control (
   <bold>d</bold>). Leaves were examined and photographed 7 dpi under UV light. One representative of at least three independent experiments is shown (Adapted with kind permission from Springer Science + Business Media: Plant Cell Reports, Lai and Chen [
