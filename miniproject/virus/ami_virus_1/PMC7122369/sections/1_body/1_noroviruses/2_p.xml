<p>Recent development of sophisticated molecular methods including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has allowed a more reliable NoV classification based on the amino acid sequence of the major capsid protein [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000815">15</xref>]. In this classification system, NoVs are divided into five genogroups and 29 clusters with eight clusters in genogroup I (GI), 17 in GII, two in GIII, and one each in GIV and GV (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00081" ref-type="table">8.1</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000815">15</xref>]. Within the five genotypes, GI and GIV strains are found to infect humans exclusively, and GII are found in both humans and pigs, while GIII and GV strains are animal viruses that infect cattle and murine species, respectively [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000815">15</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000816">16</xref>]. Currently, strains in cluster 4 of GII (GII.4) are the most prevalent NoVs in human population [
