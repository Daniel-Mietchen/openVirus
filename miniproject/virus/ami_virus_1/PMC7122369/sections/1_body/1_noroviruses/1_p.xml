<p>NoVs are a group of genetically diverse RNA viruses that belong to the genus of 
 <italic>norovirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>Caliciviridae</italic> family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00084">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00085">5</xref>]. They were first discovered and characterized in their prototype virus, the Norwalk virus (NV) in 1972 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00086">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00087">7</xref>]. Studies of NV revealed that NoVs are non-enveloped viruses with an RNA genome surrounded by a round capsid protein shell approximately 38 nm in diameter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00088">8</xref>]. Classification of NoVs, however, has proved difficult and controversial until the recent development of molecular biology tools. Since there is no culture system available to grow these viruses in vitro, accurate serotyping based on neutralization is not possible [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00089">9</xref>]. Instead, classification of NoV had to rely on cross-challenge studies in volunteers and immune cross-reactivity analysis with electron microscopy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000810">10</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000813">13</xref>], which lacks accuracy and reproducibility due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000814">14</xref>].
