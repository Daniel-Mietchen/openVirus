<p>In addition to providing the sole structural shell component of NoV capsid, VP1 has to perform other functions including immunogenicity and infectivity. It was suggested that the P domain may contain cellular receptor binding sites and viral phenotype or serotype determinants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000825">25</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000826">26</xref>]. The P2 subdomain has the most variable sequence among different NoV strains and is found to protrude outside the capsid surface, suggesting that it is responsible for the immune recognition and cellular interactions [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000828">28</xref>]. Studies of NV also indicate that the VP2 protein enhances the expression level of VP1 and stabilizes the VP1 in the viral capsid [
