<p>The genome of NoVs, which was first characterized in NV, contains a single-stranded positive sense RNA of 7.5–7.7 kb with three open reading frames (ORFs) and a poly A tail at its 3’ end [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000819">19</xref>]. ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is processed by viral protease 3CLpro into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and approximately five other nonstructural proteins including p48, the nucleoside triphosphatase, p22, VPg, and 3CLpro [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000820">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000821">21</xref>]. The two structural proteins, the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins, are encoded by ORF2 and ORF3, respectively [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000822">22</xref>]. Structural analysis of NoV has revealed that each viral capsid is composed of 90 dimers of VP1 in a

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00088">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000823">23</xref>]. VP1 folds into two domains: a shell (S) domain that is responsible for initiating capsid assembly and icosahedral contacts and a protruding domain (P), containing two subdomains of P1 and P2, that enhance the stability of the capsid by providing intermolecular contacts between VP1 dimers [
