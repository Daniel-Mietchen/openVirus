<p>NoVs are one of the leading causes of GE in people of all age groups and are responsible for more than 95 % of viral GE in adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000829">29</xref>]. With the development of new diagnostic methods, it is now recognized that the impact of these viruses had been significantly underestimated as they cause far more outbreaks and infections than previously realized [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000831">31</xref>]. NoVs require an extremely low infectious dose, as challenge studies with NV have suggested that the probability of infection with a single virus particle is approximately 50 % among susceptible human populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000832">32</xref>]. They can be transmitted by several routes including fecal-contaminated food or water, direct person-to-person contact, indirect exposure through droplets, or contaminated objects of infected persons [
