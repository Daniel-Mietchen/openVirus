<p>Viral shedding may start before symptoms even occur and continue after they have disappeared. This prolonged shedding period (several weeks) of NoVs further enhances the secondary attack rate and usually results in large-scale outbreaks [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000840">40</xref>–

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000846">46</xref>]. It was suggested that this seasonality is due to climatic conditions that promote a closer person-to-person contact and favor the survival of the viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000847">47</xref>]. Further studies demonstrated that various NoV strains have different seasonal outbreak periodicities as GII strains mostly occur in winter, while GI viruses are more evenly spread over the year [
