<p>The life cycle of NoV has not been fully understood due to the lack of an in vitro cell culture system and a small animal model of infection. However, a study by Asanaka and colleagues has demonstrated that an expressed NV genomic RNA has the ability to replicate, to be transcribed into NV subgenomic RNA, and subsequently translated into VP1 in mammalian cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000863">63</xref>]. Moreover, the expression of VP1 was found to generate virus particles filled with NV genomic RNA in this particular cell [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000863">63</xref>]. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of mammalian cells in supporting the replication of NoV genomic RNA and the assembly of viral RNA into virus particles. Thus, the failure of NoV replication in mammalian cell cultures is not due to the lack of host factors to support intracellular expression of NoV RNA. Instead, the problem may lie in the steps of viral binding to cellular receptors, virus entry into cells after receptor binding, or uncoating of virus particles for releasing genomic RNA into the cytoplasm.
