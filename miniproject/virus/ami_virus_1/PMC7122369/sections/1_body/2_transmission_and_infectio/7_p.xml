<p>Although NoV-caused acute GE is usually mild and self-limiting and can be treated with hydration fluids, instances of necrotizing enterocolitis and mortality due to dehydration do occur. It has been estimated that NoVs cause up to 200,000 deaths in young children in developing countries and 300 deaths in the US per year [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000845">45</xref>]. Since the emergence of a new NoV variant GII.4 in 2002, the number of outbreaks has increased significantly, and large epidemics have occurred worldwide almost every 2 years [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000871">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000872">72</xref>]. As a result, NoVs have been considered as emerging pathogens. Furthermore, because of the recent realization of their prominence in causing GE and their potential of causing rapid and large water-, food-, and possibly airborne outbreaks with as few as 10–100 viral particles, NoVs have been also classified as class B biodefense pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000873">73</xref>]. Currently, there are no effective drugs or vaccines available for treating or preventing NoV infections. Therefore, development of vaccines and therapies for these viruses is urgently needed.
