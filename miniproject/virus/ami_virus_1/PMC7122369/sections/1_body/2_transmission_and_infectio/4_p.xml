<p>Due to the routes of transmission, young children, elderly nursing home residents, students, military personnel, travelers, and immunocompromised people are particularly vulnerable to NoV infections. Recent studies indicate a possible genetic basis of susceptibility to NoV infection. For example, susceptibility in a human population is found to be associated with an individual’s ABH histo-blood type, mucosal cell-expressed carbohydrates, secretor status, and strain binding preferences of histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptors [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000851">51</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000855">55</xref>]. Furthermore, P2s of different viral genotypes have been found to have specific affinity for certain ABO HBGA, with GI NoVs preferentially binding to group antigens A and O, and GII to group antigens A and B [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000857">57</xref>]. Consequently, it is suggested that HBGA may serve as putative receptors for NoVs [
