<p>The high environmental stability of NoVs further facilitates their spread among human populations. For example, NoVs are stable at a wide range of temperatures from subzero to 60 °C and at pHs even below 2.7 and are resistant to treatment with chlorine (0.5–1.0 mg/L), ethanol, quaternary ammonium compounds, or detergent-based cleaners [

As a result, NoVs are highly contagious, spread rapidly, and their outbreaks commonly occur in various social places and settings where people share common food and water sources or are in close physical proximity, such as cruise ships, schools, military units, nursing homes, daycare centers, hospitals, restaurants, and catered events [
