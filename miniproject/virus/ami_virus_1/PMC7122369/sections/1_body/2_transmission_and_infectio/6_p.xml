<p>After ingestion of viral particles, symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea usually appear after a 12–48-h incubation period. These symptoms persist during the course of the illness (12–72 h) and are often accompanied by nausea, abdominal cramps, and occasionally by malaise, chills, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fever [

Furthermore, the target cell(s) for human NoVs has yet to be conclusively identified. However, it has been observed that NoV starts to multiply within the small intestine upon infection and cause histopathologic lesions in the jejunum and reversible broadening and blunting of the jejunal villi in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000866">66</xref>]. It is speculated that these changes may be involved in the blunting of the villi. While it is still not possible to visualize NoV particles in biopsies from challenge studies, in vitro binding experiments suggested that viral binding occurs mostly at the villi level [
