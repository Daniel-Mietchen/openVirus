<p>VLP vaccines produced from insect or mammalian cell cultures are purified products that require expensive downstream processing, cold storage, and transport temperatures [

This is an attractive approach as it may reduce the need for the costly purification steps and may circumvent logistic challenges to allow implementation of immunization programs in regions where refrigeration and other medical supplies are limited.
