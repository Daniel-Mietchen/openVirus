<p>Actually, VLP accumulated to its highest level at day four after vector introduction, indicating that this expression system can produce similar levels of VLPs in lettuce but in a much shorter time frame than the MagnICON system in tobacco [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008129">129</xref>]. This represents a significant milestone for the eventual commercial production of NoV VLP-based vaccines, as this would allow our production system to have access to unlimited quantities of low-cost material from existing commercial sources. Coupled with the almost unlimited nature of lettuce production, the high efficiency and scalability of our BeYDV replicon vectors provide us a new NoV VLP production platform that is low cost, robust, safe, and amenable to large-scale manufacturing.
