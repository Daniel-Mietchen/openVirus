<p>To further optimize the transient expression systems for commercial production of NoV VLP vaccines, we developed another robust expression system based on geminiviral BeYDV DNA replicon vectors and commercially available lettuce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008129">129</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008143">143</xref>]. There are two major advantages of this transient expression system: the noncompetitive nature of BeYDV DNA replicon vector and the use of commercially produced lettuce. In contrast to the MagnIcon system, which can produce proteins with maximally two different hetero-subunits, the geminiviral vector allows the production of VLPs with up to at least five hetero-subunits [
