<p>The major challenges up to this point for NoV VLP production in plants were the slowness of obtaining VLP-expressing plant lines and poor VLP yield. One of the strategies to overcome these challenges was the use of transient expression systems based on vectors developed from plant viruses. In these systems, transgenes are not integrated into one of the plant genomes, but instead, they are present in the plant nucleus transiently while being transcribed, and later, the transcripts are transported into the cytoplasm, and the transgenic proteins are translated [
