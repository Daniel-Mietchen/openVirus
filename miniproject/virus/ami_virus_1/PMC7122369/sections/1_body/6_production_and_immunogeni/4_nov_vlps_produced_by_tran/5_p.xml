<p>Lettuce is cultivated readily and rapidly produced in large quantities in well-established commercial greenhouses. Unlike tobacco and related species of 
 <italic>Nicotiana</italic> such as 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, lettuce is a palatable plant and can be consumed raw for oral delivery of NoV VLPs. When NVCP was expressed in 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants with BeYDV replicon vectors, assembled VLPs were accumulated up to 0.4 mg/g FLW in leaves [

 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> [
