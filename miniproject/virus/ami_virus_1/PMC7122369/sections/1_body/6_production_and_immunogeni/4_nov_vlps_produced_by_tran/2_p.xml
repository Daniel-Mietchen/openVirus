<p>These systems are focused on production speed and yield and gain the flexibility of nuclear gene expression with the speed and expression amplification of viruses. For example, the MagnICON transient expression system based on replication-competent TMV and potato virus X (PVX) allows high levels of recombinant protein production within 7â€“10 days of vector delivery [
