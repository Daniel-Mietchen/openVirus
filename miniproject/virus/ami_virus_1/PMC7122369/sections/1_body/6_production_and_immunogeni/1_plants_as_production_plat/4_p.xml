<p>The challenges of VLP production speed and yield has been overcome by the development of plant virus-based transient plant expression systems [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008131">131</xref>]. For example, our group and others have reported that the cloning and high-level transient expression of plant-derived VLPs can be achieved quickly in 1–2 weeks of vector infiltration with the MagnICON system, which is based on a tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA replicon system or a geminiviral DNA replicon system derived from bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008132">132</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008134">134</xref>]. These improvements in the speed and yield of VLP expression also provide plant expression systems, an additional advantage in versatility for producing VLP vaccines against NoV and other viruses that have rapid antigenic drift and multiple genogroups and strains with unpredictable epidemics around the world.
