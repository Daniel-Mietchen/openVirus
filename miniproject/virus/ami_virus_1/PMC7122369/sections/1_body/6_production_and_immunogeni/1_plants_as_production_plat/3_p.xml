<p>Plants are considered as an alternative protein vaccine production system because they can produce high levels of vaccine protein at low cost, and biomass production does not require expensive investment in cell culture facilities or facility duplication for scale-up production [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008127">127</xref>]. As a result, the flexibility and capital efficiency for plant biomass generation and scale-up are far more superior to current fermentation-based technologies [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008127">127</xref>]. Despite these potential advantages, earlier production of protein vaccines using stable transgenic plants resulted in slow and low levels of target protein accumulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000854">54</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>]. The long time frame (several months to a year) to generate transgenic plants, the lack of strong promoters and the position effects from the random insertion of the transgene are responsible for these problems that reduce the cost-saving benefit of plants as a production system [
