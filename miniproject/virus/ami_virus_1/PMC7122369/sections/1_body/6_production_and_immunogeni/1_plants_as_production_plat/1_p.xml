<p>Even though NoV VLPs or VRPs have shown promising results as NoV vaccine candidates, production systems based on insect and mammalian cell cultures have several limitations that may hamper the commercial development of these vaccines [

For example, the coproduction of baculovirus particles with NoV VLPs in the baculovirus/insect cell system may create problems in VLP purification, immunogenicity, and regulatory approval. Since residual baculovirus may alter the overall immunogenicity of NoV VLP preparation and raise safety concerns, they and their infectivity have to be removed or inactivated by cumbersome and expensive purification processes or chemical treatments. These procedures not only increase the overall production costs but may also impair the quality of the resulting VLPs [
