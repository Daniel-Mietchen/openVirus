<p>An effective NoV vaccine needs to be produced in the shortest achievable time frame after strain identification in order to halt the spread of the new strain, preferably by low-cost platforms that allow affordable vaccine manufacturing in locations including the developing world. A platform based on transient plant expression is likely to address such cost and time issues and provide the critical versatility that allows the rapid production of strain-specific vaccines to control potential NoV outbreaks in a timely manner.</p>
