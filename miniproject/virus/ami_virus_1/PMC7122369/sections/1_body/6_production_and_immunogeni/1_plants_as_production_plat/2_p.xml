<p>The production cost with the VEE/mammalian cell system is significantly higher than that of insect cell cultures. In addition, it also requires heavy capital investment to construct a BSL-3 manufacturing facility [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>]. Both insect and mammalian cell-based production systems also share challenges in scalability as new fermentation tanks and facilities have to be built for larger-scale production. These challenges may hinder the full realization of the health-benefit potential of NoV VLPs especially in the developing world. As a result, plants have been explored as a safe, cost-effective, and scalable production platform for NoV VLPs.
