<p>To achieve gut mucosal immunity against NV, four doses of 4 g uncooked potato tuber containing 40–80 μg NVCP were fed to mice at days 1, 2, 11, and 28. This immunization regime induced specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses in mice [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>]. Perhaps, the enrichment of assembled VLPs in the purified samples is responsible for the enhancement of humoral immunity because only ~50 % of the NVCP in the potato tubers was assembled into VLPs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000831">31</xref>]. It is also possible that NVCP was not efficiently released from the potato tissue to be delivered to GALT for antigen processing and presentation.
