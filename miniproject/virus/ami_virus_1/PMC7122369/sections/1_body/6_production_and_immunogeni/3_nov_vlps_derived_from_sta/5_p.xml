<p>The same study also showed that NVCP fed in freeze-dried tomato was more immunogenic than that in freeze-dried potato tubers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008138">138</xref>]. The less oxidative environment or the unique tissue structure in tomato fruits may allow better stability or more efficient release of VLPs and, in turn, better immunogenicity. It was also noticed that ingestion of NVCP air-dried tomatoes elicited more potent serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses than that NVCP freeze-dried tomatoes [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008138">138</xref>]. It is possible that the freeze-drying process altered the assembly status of VLPs in tomato fruits. Alternatively, air-drying may result in better VLP stability by preserving the architecture of VLPs and the tissue structure so that VLPs are better protected from the digestive enzymes in the oral-gastrointestinal tract or more efficiently released from the tissue for uptake by GALT. Overall, these data support the development of oral vaccines for NoV in tomato plants.
