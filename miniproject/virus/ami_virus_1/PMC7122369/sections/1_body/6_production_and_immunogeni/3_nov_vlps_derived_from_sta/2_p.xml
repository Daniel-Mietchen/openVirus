<p>As for other vaccine proteins, NVCP was first expressed in transgenic tobacco and potato plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008103">103</xref>]. It usually took several months to generate and select transgenic tobacco and potato plants that expressed NVCP. Expression of NVCP in these transgenic plants was approximately 10 μg/g fresh tissue weight, which is rather low compared with the insect or mammalian cell-based expression system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>]. However, assembled virion-sized icosahedral VLPs that resemble insect cell-derived VLPs or native NV particles were observed in transgenic tobacco leaves and in potato tubers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>]. In another experiment, the VP1 gene of NV was codon optimized and expressed in transgenic tomato plants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008138">138</xref>]. Comparative studies indicated that VLP yield and assembly varied depending on the codon usage, host plant species, and possibly the target tissue of NVCP accumulation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>]. For instance, NVCP expression level was low, and only 25–50 % of them was assembled into VLP in potato tubers, while at least ten-fold higher expression and more efficient VLP assembly were achieved in tomato fruits [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>].
