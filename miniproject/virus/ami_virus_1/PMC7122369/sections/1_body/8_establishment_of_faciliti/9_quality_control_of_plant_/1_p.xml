<p>One of the remaining challenges for the commercialization of plant-derived vaccines is the lack of examples that meet the required standards of regulatory agencies in identity, purity, potency, and safety [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008124">124</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008127">127</xref>]. As part of the efforts to overcome this challenge, our laboratory has identified and developed analytical assays to monitor the in-process samples and to ensure that the final VLP product meets preset specifications for the release of human pharmaceuticals in identity, purity, concentration, tertiary structure, functionality, and in concentrations of host contaminating molecules essential for the cGMP compliance (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab00082" ref-type="table">8.2</xref>). Our analyses showed that the identity and assembly of the final VLP product were confirmed and its purity, concentration, appearance, residual host DNA concentration, and stability all conformed to the insect cell-derived reference standard [
