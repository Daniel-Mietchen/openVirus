<p>Ongoing research by our group and collaborators is evaluating the systemic and mucosal immunity of the cGMP-purified VLPs when co-delivered mucosally with various adjuvants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000831">31</xref>]. Preliminary data suggest that mucosal immunization with several adjuvants evoked stronger serum IgG and mucosal IgA responses than with VLP alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000831">31</xref>]. We anticipate that the purified NVCP VLPs from our cGMP plant production runs and the adjuvants defined in our current studies will be used in a new Phase I human clinical trial in the near future.
