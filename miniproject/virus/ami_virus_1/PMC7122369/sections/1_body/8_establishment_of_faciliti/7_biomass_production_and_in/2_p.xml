<p>Methods for efficient introduction of 
 <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> into leaves by vacuum infiltration were also developed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>]. As illustrated by the expression of the GFP and NVCP VLPs, plants infiltrated based on these methods under scale-up conditions allowed efficient infiltration of vector-carrying 
 <italic>Agrobacteria</italic> in the entire leaf area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00084" ref-type="fig">8.4c</xref>) and accumulated the highest level of NVCP VLPs in leaves 7 dpi (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00084" ref-type="fig">8.4a, b</xref>). Moreover, the yield and temporal expression pattern of NVCP VLPs under these scale-up conditions are similar to that of our previous smaller bench-scale experiments [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008133">133</xref>]. These results clearly indicate that the upstream process for NV VLP production in plants is scalable and can be further scaled up for commercial production.
