<p>In the second trial, the safety and immunogenicity of NVCP VLPs were further tested in 36 adult seropositive healthy individuals between 18 and 40 years of age with two oral doses of increasing amounts (250, 500, and 2,000 μg) of antigens without adjuvant using the same immunization regime [

Significant increase in the number of NV-specific IgA antibody-secreting cells (ASC) was observed in all vaccinated volunteers and approximately 30–40 % of volunteers developed salivary, fecal, or genital fluid IgA antibody. An increase of NV-specific IgG titers was also detected in 90 % of participants who received 250 μg of VLPs [
