<p>Study 1 was a stepwise dosage escalation trial with 5, 15, and 50 μg of NVCP VLPs. Study 2 was a dose comparison study of the two highest dosages (50 and 100 μg) VLPs. These studies indicate that IN delivery of NVCP VLPs in a dry power formula with MPL and chitosan was well tolerated and no vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred [
