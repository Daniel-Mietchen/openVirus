<p>All vaccinees in the 50 and 100 Î¼g groups developed IgA ASCs. Furthermore, expression of homing molecules targeting to mucosal and peripheral lymphoid tissues was detected in these ASCs. Compared with the previously described oral nonadjuvanted VLPs, IN delivery of MPL-adjuvanted VLPs induced a higher number of these ASCs [
