<p>Insect cell-derived NVCP VLPs were initially tested in two Phase I trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008144">144</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008147">147</xref>]. In the first trial, 20 antibody-positive adult volunteers were given two oral doses (days 1 and 21) of 100 or 250 μg of VLPs formulated in water without adjuvant. It was observed that serum IgG responses were dose dependent and 100 % of vaccinated subjects who received 250 μg of VLPs increased their NV specific titers at least four-fold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008147">147</xref>]. Fifteen out of 18 participants responded in serum IgG titers after the first VLP dose and showed no increase after the second dose [
