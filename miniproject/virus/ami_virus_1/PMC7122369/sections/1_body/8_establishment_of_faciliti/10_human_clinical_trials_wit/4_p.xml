<p>While the results from the first two trials were encouraging, however, the maximal serum IgG titers elicited by oral immunization were lower than those after experimental NV infection. Consequently, two additional Phase I studies were conducted to investigate whether the immunogenicity of NVCP VLPs can be further enhanced by using mucosal adjuvants [
