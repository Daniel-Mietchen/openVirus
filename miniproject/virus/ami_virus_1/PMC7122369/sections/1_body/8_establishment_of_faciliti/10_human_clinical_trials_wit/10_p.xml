<p>Together, these results indicate the immunogenicity and safety of using edible VLP-containing plant parts as oral vaccines of NoV in humans. However, the overall antibody response was not as strong as that obtained by orally delivered purified NVCP VLPs (250 Î¼g per dose) produced in insect cells [

Perhaps, the variable effective VLP dosage due to inconsistent NVCP content and poor VLP assembly in potato tubers may cause this weak antigenicity. The potency of the plant-derived VLPs may also be further reduced by their poor release from the potato tissue in the gut lumen. In light of this and the results from recent human clinical trials with insect cell-derived VLPs, in the near future, we are planning a new human clinical trial with purified NVCP VLPs from our cGMP runs and the adjuvants defined in our current studies (see Quality control section above) [
