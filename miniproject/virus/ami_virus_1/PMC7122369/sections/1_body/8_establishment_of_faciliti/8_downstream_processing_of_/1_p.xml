<p>While eating unprocessed or partially processed NoV VLP-containing plant tissue remains a viable option for vaccine delivery, purified VLPs with a well-defined unit dosage are most likely to be the first generation of successful vaccine candidates for commercialization due to regulatory requirements [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008123">123</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008124">124</xref>]. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to have a robust and scalable downstream process that can effectively recover and purify VLPs in place in order for plant-produced NoV VLP vaccines to become commercial reality. An optimized downstream process should be able to preserve the integrity of VLPs and produce highly purified VLPs with a high recovery rate and a minimal number of processing steps.
