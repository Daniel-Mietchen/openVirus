<p>As part of the cGMP compliance of upstream processes, biomaterials including relevant 
 <italic>Agrobacteria</italic> strains and the 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plant line have to be qualified by the QMS. This process starts with the establishment of master and working banks of 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> strains that containing the NVCP expression vectors and a seed bank of wild-type 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> for growing biomass for transient expression. To generate plant material for cGMP-compliant production of NVCP VLPs, three 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> master banks, each containing the expression cassette for VLP production in TMV 3’ module, TMV 5’ module, and integrase of the MagnICON system, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008141">141</xref>] have been established in the bacterial strain of GV3101 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>]. The identity of the 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> host strain and associated functional genes and vectors are fully validated. These banks have been shown to be genetically stable over a 4-year period [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>]. A master seed bank for wild-type 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> was also established. Our experiment has shown that this seed bank has a germination rate of 99 % and produced uniform seedlings with typical 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> morphology even after a 4-year storage at 4 ± 2 °C (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00083" ref-type="fig">8.3</xref>) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008126">126</xref>]. These results collectively demonstrated that it is feasible to establish master and working banks of 
 <italic>A. tumefaciens</italic> strains and 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> seeds that meet the qualification standards of identity and stability for cGMP production of NoV VLPs.
