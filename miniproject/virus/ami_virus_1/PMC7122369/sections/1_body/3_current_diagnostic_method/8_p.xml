<p>Nevertheless, RT-PCR should be used in conjunction with ELISAs in both clinical diagnosis and outbreak investigations to confirm positive findings and assess negative samples. In contrast, if the goal of the diagnosis is to track down the point-source of infection in epidemiology studies, RT-PCR followed by DNA sequencing should be the method of choice due to its high sensitivity and specificity [

However, as more comparative results become available, it has been proposed that either RT-PCR or a positive result in two of the three assays discussed above should be regarded as the “gold standard” [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000890">90</xref>]. Regardless, it is recommended that at least two of the three methods among TEM, ELISA, and RT-PCR should be combined to achieve a reliable clinical diagnostic result, while all three methods are applicable for epidemiological investigations for NoV outbreaks depending on the number of samples available [
