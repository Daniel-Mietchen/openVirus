<p>Various diagnostic methods have been developed for NoV [

Since there is no culture system available for NoV, the detection of virus in stool samples has become the preferred method of diagnosis. Traditionally, NoV infection was diagnosed by detecting the virus by immune transmission electron microscopy (TEM) [

However, it does have the disadvantage of requiring sophisticated and expensive equipment and highly specialized technicians for its operation.
