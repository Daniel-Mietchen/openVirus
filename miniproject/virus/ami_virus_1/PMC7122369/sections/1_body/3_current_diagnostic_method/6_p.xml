<p>Overall, TEM, ELISA, and RT-PCR-based methods all have their advantages and challenges. TEM allows detecting all responsible viral agents, but is expensive and low throughput. In contrast, ELISA is high throughput, economical, and easy to use, but requires improvement in sensitivity. RT-PCR combines the advantage of both sensitivity and specificity and enables molecular epidemiological studies. The three methods detect different components of the virus and therefore are complementary to each other.</p>
