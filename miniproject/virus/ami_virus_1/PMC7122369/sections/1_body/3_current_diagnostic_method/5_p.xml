<p>Another advantage of RT-PCR is that, when combined with subsequent nucleotide sequencing, it allows genotyping to trace the source of outbreaks [

On the other hand, the high sensitivity of the assay may produce false-positive results from nonspecific amplification or potential sample cross-contamination. This challenge has been addressed by designing more specific primers to avoid amplification of nonspecific RNAs and by implementing more stringent procedures to prevent cross-contamination of samples. Due to the extraordinary sequence diversity among viruses in this genus, there is no single universal primer pair that can detect all strains of NoV. However, several primer pairs have been developed that can detect more than 90 % of all strains in GI and GII [

The robustness of RT-PCR-based diagnostic methods is being further optimized by employing faster and more sensitive assays such as real-time quantitative RT-PCR, which aims to rapidly detect even low copy number NoV in a large number of stool samples during outbreaks [
