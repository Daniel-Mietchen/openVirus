<p>Several enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that detect NoV antigens were later developed for NoV diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000876">76</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000877">77</xref>]. Antigen-based ELISAs are high-throughput, relatively easy to operate and can rapidly provide diagnostic results within one working day [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000878">78</xref>]. Consequently, they are usually the method of choice in situations where large numbers of specimens are required to be screened rapidly and economically. Studies have shown that NoV antigen-detecting ELISAs have high specificity (94–96 %) but poor sensitivity (40–60 %), most likely due to the antigenic diversity of NoV strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00084">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000879">79</xref>]. As a result, they are useful for specific detection of certain NoVs, but not sensitive enough for applications where a detection of a broad spectrum of NoVs is desired. The employment of pooled antibodies against multiple antigens or multivalent antibodies against a wider range of recombinant viral antigens has, however, improved the sensitivity of ELISAs [
