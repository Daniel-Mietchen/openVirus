<p>With the cloning of the NV genome in 1990 and the development of molecular biology methods, RT-PCR with stool samples (which detects the viral RNA) has increasingly become the popular assay for NoV diagnosis [

Similar to ELISA-based assays, RT-PCR is rapid and robust, because it can process large numbers of samples simultaneously and results can be obtained within a working day. However, it requires RNA extraction from fecal samples and needs expensive equipment and skilled workers to operate. Therefore, RT-PCR is more labor intensive and less economical than ELISAs. Using primer pairs designed for either highly conserved regions or strain-specific regions of the genome, RT-PCRs are versatile and offer both high specificity comparable to ELISAs and much higher sensitivity. The high sensitivity of this assay allows the detection of NoV in samples in which the concentration of virus is too low to be detected by other methods. These include clinical specimens with low viral load and environmental samples such as food and water [
