<p>For a particular diagnostic application, three factors should dictate the choice among TEM, ELISA, and RT-PCR. They include (1) the type of diagnosis such as epidemic investigations vs. clinical diagnosis, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of each assay, and (3) the speed, robustness, and ease of use of the assay. It is also crucial to remember that the heterogeneous and complex nature of stool samples and their storage conditions may often cause changes in the integrity of virus particles and/or RNA and consequently affect their reactivity in enzymatic and immunological assays. For example, the low sensitivity of ELISA-based methods will result in a significant number of false-negative samples if they are used as the only diagnostic method for clinical samples. Instead, they should be used only as “screening” assays for clinical diagnosis to take advantage of their speed and availability to be performed at a location close to the patient. However, the high specificity of ELISAs makes them an appropriate assay in outbreak investigations because the availability of multiple samples improves their reliability to confirm the cause of an outbreak [
