<p>Moreover, the concentration of intact virus particles in the samples has to be at least 10

However, since operators have to spend substantial amount of time in examining each specimen, TEM is not a high-throughput assay for rapidly processing a large number of samples. TEM relies on the identification of viral particles with characteristic NoV morphology, therefore, does not allow reliable speciation within the NoV genus, which lowers its specificity and may hinder diagnosis. These challenges may have contributed to the historic underestimation of NoV epidemics.
