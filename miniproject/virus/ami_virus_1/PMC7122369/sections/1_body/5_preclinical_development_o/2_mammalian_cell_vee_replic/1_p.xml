<p>VEE, an alphavirus, has been developed as a replicon vaccine vector. To express a specific vaccine, the coding sequence for the antigen of interest is cloned in place of the VEE structural gene just downstream from the 26S promoter in VEE replicon cDNA to drive its high expression levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008115">115</xref>]. These VEE VRPs can infect mammalian cells and accumulate large amounts of vaccine proteins [
