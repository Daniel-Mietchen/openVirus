<p>To produce NVCP VLPs, the gene for NV VP1 was cloned in VEE replicon cDNA and expressed in mammalian cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008118">118</xref>]. VEE-VRP/mammalian cell-derived VLPs can then be purified and delivered through parental or mucosal routes as immunogens. In addition, the recombinant VRPs can be used as vaccines themselves to produce VLPs in vivo. Therefore, this system can be used in two ways to induce immunity and potentially be advantageous, as VRPs can be directly used to infect permissive mammalian host target cells in which a large quantity of NVCP VLPs are assembled for antigen presentation to B and T cells [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00087">7</xref>] infectious units per dose) of recombinant NVCP-VRP through the footpads in mice elicited strong systemic IgG and intestinal IgA responses against NV VLP, as well as heterotypic responses to VLPs of another GI NoV [
