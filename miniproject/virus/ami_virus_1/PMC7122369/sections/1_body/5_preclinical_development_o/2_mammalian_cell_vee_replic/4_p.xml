<p>Compared with the insect cell-baculovirus system, the VEE VRP system can be cumbersome and more expensive due to the need of cotransfection and BSL-3 facilities for VRP production. However, parenteral VEE VRP inoculation has been shown to target DCs and stimulate potent humoral and cellular immunity including protection at mucosal surfaces from infection [
