<p>Multivalent NoV vaccine candidates have also been produced in the VEE-VRP system and tested in mice [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008119">119</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that inoculation of a cocktail of three or four VRPs that express strain-specific VLPs in mice not only induced strong serum antibody response against all inoculum strains but also elicited receptor-blocking heterotypic antibody response against novel strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008115">115</xref>]. Moreover, coadministration of a panel of eight human NoV VLPs that cover more than 95 % of all NoV infections revealed that inclusion of VLPs from both genogroups (GI and GII) in the vaccine cocktail did not detract from either genogroup-specific response, but induced receptor-blocking antibodies against intergenogroup strains [
