<p>As discussed earlier, it is desirable for NoV vaccines to elicit gut mucosal immunity. Oral delivery is a feasible strategy for NVCP VLPs to induce such immunity as evolutionary selection for enteric infection has allowed them to be stable in the oral-gastrointestinal environment and efficiently transport to GALT for antigen processing and presentation [
