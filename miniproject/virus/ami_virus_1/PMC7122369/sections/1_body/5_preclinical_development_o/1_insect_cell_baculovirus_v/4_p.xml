<p>In addition to intestinal IgA in fecal samples, a strong anti-NVCP IgA response was also detected in vaginal washes. Furthermore, these mucosal IgA responses were long lasting and could be detected a year after the IN immunization [

These data not only demonstrate that NVCP VLP is a potent mucosal antigen in stimulating systemic and local mucosal antibody responses, but also indicate its ability in eliciting antibody response at distal mucosa. These findings clearly demonstrated the ability of insect cell-derived NVCP VLPs in eliciting systemic and mucosal B-cell responses to potentially neutralize NV and inhibit its infection and also suggest their application as carriers of heterologous epitopes to combat sexually transmitted infections (STI). For example, chimeric NVCP VLPs that are decorated with epitopes of STI pathogens can potentially induce the production of neutralizing IgAs in the reproductive mucosa.
