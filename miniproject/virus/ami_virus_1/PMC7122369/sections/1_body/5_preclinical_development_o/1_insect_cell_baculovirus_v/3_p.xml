<p>The success of oral delivery of NVCP VLPs encouraged the exploration of their delivery through alternative mucosal routes. A study by Guerrero and colleagues demonstrated that intranasal (IN) delivery was more effective than oral delivery at provoking NVCP-specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses by low doses of VLPs [
