<p>While immunization by ingesting plant tissue still presents a viable approach to orally delivering plant-produced VLPs, product regulatory concerns have necessitated the development of downstream processing technologies to produce purified VLP vaccines with a defined unit dosage [

Therefore, for the promise of plants as an alternative for vaccine production to become a reality, the technology must be able to produce sufficient quantities of VLPs at a relevant scale and with product qualities that meet all required standards of regulatory agencies such as US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
