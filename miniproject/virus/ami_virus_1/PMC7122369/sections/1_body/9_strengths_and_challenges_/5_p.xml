<p>Overall, the potent systemic and mucosal immunogenicity, the robust and low-cost cGMP manufacturability in plants, and the safety profile in human clinical trials all support the further development of VLP-based vaccines for the prevention of NoV-related GE. Due to the diversity of capsid protein among different NoV strains and its rapid antigenic drift, vaccine development should focus on multivalent VLP vaccines that are derived from capsid proteins of the most prevalent strains. Furthermore, vigilant epidemiological surveillance must be coupled with NoV vaccine production to identify this moving target and to include the most prevalent circulating strains in the formulation for optimal protection. New data from ongoing and planned human clinical trials, particularly challenge trials, should shed new light on the efficacy of VLPs in preventing or limiting NoV infection in the next few years. They may also provide clues for the immune correlates of protection. This knowledge will facilitate the development of efficacious NoV vaccines.</p>
