<p>Similarly, potent systemic and mucosal immune responses were provoked in mice and humans by IN delivery. The ability to induce NoV-specific gut mucosal immunity by mucosal delivery provides VLPs a distinguish advantage as vaccines for these enteropathogenic viruses. Moreover, the safety of NoV VLPs have been demonstrated in several human clinical trials. The stability of NoV VLPs also favors them as commercial vaccines as they can be lyophilized or stored at 4 Â°C in simple buffers for many years without degradation [
