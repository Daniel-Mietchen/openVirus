<p>There are still remaining challenges for the development of efficacious NoV vaccines. For example, the question of whether VLP-based vaccines can protect humans against a live NoV challenge still remains unanswered. Moreover, it is difficult to predict the level of protection that new vaccine candidates can provide due to the lack of a complete understanding of the immune correlates of protection. This problem is further intensified by the lack of culture systems to cultivate NoV in vitro and the lack of small animal models of NoV pathogenesis. Furthermore, the lack of complete cross-protection among diverse genotypes and genogroups of viruses and the rapid evolution of new variant strains further hamper the development of efficacious vaccines that are protective against multiple NoV strains.</p>
