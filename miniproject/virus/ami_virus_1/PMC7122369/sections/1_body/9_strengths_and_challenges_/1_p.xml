<p>For uncultivable NoV, capsid protein-based VLPs possess the best properties in immunogenicity, safety, stability, and manufacturability as vaccine candidates to prevent NoV GE. Like other VLP-based vaccines, NoV VLPs have been shown to induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses without adjuvants due to their resemblance to infectious viruses. Since NoV naturally causes infection in the gastrointestinal tract, the VLPs are stable at low pH and resistant to digestive enzymes. As a result, they can be administered orally and elicit a potent mucosal antibody response and systemic response in mice and humans. For example, oral delivery of NVCP VLPs induced robust production of anti-NV serum and intestinal antibodies and interferon-Î³ in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [
