<p>The particulate nature and the dense repetitive array of epitopes on their surface make VLP far more immunogenic than other subunit vaccines. VLPs can effectively induce T-cell-mediated immune responses through interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs), especially dendritic cells (DCs). Specifically, VLPs can mimic the natural viral infection process by being specifically recognized and taken up by DCs and subsequently processed and presented to cytotoxic T cells to trigger their activation and proliferation [
