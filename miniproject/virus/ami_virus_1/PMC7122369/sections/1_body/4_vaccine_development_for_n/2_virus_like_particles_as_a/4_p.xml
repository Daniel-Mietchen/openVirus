<p>Since NoV is an enteropathogenic virus, a potent vaccine should also induce NoV-specific gut mucosal immunity such as through oral delivery. In general, oral delivery of subunit protein vaccines for gut immunity may not be effective due to the possibility of denaturation and degradation of antigens by stomach acid and digestion enzymes, poor transport to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) for antigen processing and presentation, and potential stimulation of systemic immune tolerance [

However, VLPs’ compact and highly ordered structures allow them to be more resistant to degradative enzymes in the digestive tract than other protein vaccines. The resemblance of VLPs to authentic viral particles may also present a “danger signal” that overcomes the perception of gut antigens as benign and thus prevents the development of immune tolerance [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000855">55</xref>]. Both of these characteristics are especially true for VLPs of NoV because their cognate viruses are natural gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover, they are also naturally recognized and efficiently transported into GALT [
