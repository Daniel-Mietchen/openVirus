<p>The lack of a tissue culture system also impedes the development of vaccines against NoV. Fortunately, the discovery of the spontaneous assembly of expressed VP1 into virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native viruses has facilitated vaccine development [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000873">73</xref>]. VLPs combine the best traits of whole-virus and subunit antigens for vaccine development. VLPs are noninfectious, therefore, safer than inactivated or attenuated virus due to the lack of viral nucleic acid genome. At least in theory, the immunogenicity of VLPs can even be enhanced over that of the native virus by excluding immunosuppressive viral proteins in their composition. Moreover, an inactivation process is unnecessary for VLP production. Consequently, no unintended epitope modification would occur, further ensuring the VLPâ€™s immunogenicity. Importantly, VLPs can induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses without adjuvants and are more effective vaccines than other subunit antigens because their architectures mimic infectious viruses. VLPs can be produced by recombinant technology in heterologous expression systems without requiring the ability to support viral replication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000831">31</xref>]. This is particularly important for NoV because no such culture system has been developed to support the growth of these viruses [
