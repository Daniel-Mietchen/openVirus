<p>VLPs can also be presented efficiently to B cells and induce strong antibody responses. Like live viruses, the quasicrystalline surface of VLPs, with its arrays of repetitive epitopes, presents a prime target that vertebrate B cells have evolved to specifically recognize [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008100">100</xref>]. This recognition triggers the cross-linking of surface membrane-associated immunoglobulins (Ig) on B cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008103">103</xref>] and leads to their proliferation and migration, T helper cell activation, antibody production and secretion, and the generation of memory B cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>]. Thus, VLPs can directly activate B cells at much lower concentrations than other subunit antigens and induce high titer and durable B-cell responses in the absence of adjuvants.
