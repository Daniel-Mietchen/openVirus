<p>VLPs of NoVs were first produced in insect cells using baculovirus vectors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000823">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008104">104</xref>] and then in plants using tobamovirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008101">101</xref>] and geminivirus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008102">102</xref>] vectors and in mammalian cells using the Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) replicon system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR0008105">105</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that expression of the major capsid protein VP1 alone can drive the self-assembly of VLPs that morphologically and antigenically resemble native virus particles (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig00081" ref-type="fig">8.1</xref>). VLPs generated by all three expression systems are similar to each other.
