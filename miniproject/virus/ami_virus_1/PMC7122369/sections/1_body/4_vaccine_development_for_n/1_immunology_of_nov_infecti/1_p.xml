<p>The immunological knowledge of NoV is mostly obtained from human challenge studies and natural outbreaks due to the lack of small animal models. These studies showed that infected volunteers did develop immunity after a NoV challenge [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000892">92</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000893">93</xref>]. However, immunity to one strain did not provide complete protection from challenge of heterologous strains, and symptomatic individuals could often be reinfected when exposed to the same NoV strain 2–4 years later, indicating their immunity seems to be strain or genogroup specific and short lived [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000892">92</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000894">94</xref>]. Challenge studies did not yield conclusive results regarding long-term immunity, which may be confounded by preexposure of volunteers to various circulating NoV strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000884">84</xref>]. However, other studies showed that close to 50 % of the genetically susceptible subjects were not infected by NoV challenge, which support the possibility of long-term immunity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR000895">95</xref>]. Furthermore, community cohort studies indicate that the duration of symptoms were generally decreased with age, suggesting the development of at least partial protection against NoV [
