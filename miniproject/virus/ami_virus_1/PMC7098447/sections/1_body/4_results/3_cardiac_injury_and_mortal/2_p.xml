<p>Subgroup analysis showed that in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS, cardiac injury was an independent risk factor for in-hospital mortality (adjusted HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.27–3.15) (Fig. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The analysis was not conducted among patients without ARDS, because only seven deaths were recorded. An association between cardiac injury and in-hospital mortality was observed in patients under 65 years old (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.12–3.24) as well as in those greater than or equal to 65 years old (HR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.04–6.24). Among patients with an APACHE II score less than 21, cardiac injury was significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.20–3.80). No significant association between cardiac injury and mortality was observed among those with APACHE II scores greater than or equal to 21 (HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 0.86–3.86). No significant association was found between preexisting cardiac conditions and mortality in all patients (HR, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.71–2.05) (Table S3, Supplemental Digital Content 1,
