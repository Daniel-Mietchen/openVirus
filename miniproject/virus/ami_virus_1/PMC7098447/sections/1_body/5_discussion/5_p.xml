<p>Our study is limited by its retrospective nature, and by the fact that we could not include all patients in mainland China with laboratory-confirmed influenza A (H7N9) viral infection. Nevertheless, we included patients from 17 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities, and the characteristics of our patients were similar to those for the general population of patients with H7N9 viral infection, based on data from the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Second, because patients varied between when they had their first cardiac examination and when infection manifested, we were not able to find the risk interval between H7N9 viral infection and cardiac injury.</p>
