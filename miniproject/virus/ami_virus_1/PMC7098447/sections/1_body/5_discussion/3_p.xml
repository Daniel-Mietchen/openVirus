<p>The mechanism of cardiac injury among patients with H7N9 viral infection is still uncertain. In one study, autopsy of two patients who died after H7N9 viral infection failed to detect the virus in heart tissue (
 <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). On the other hand, several studies have demonstrated the association between influenza infection and cardiac complications as well as higher risk of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest and myocardial necrosis (

 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Influenza viral antigen was demonstrated in the cardiocytes of mice by immunofluorescence (

 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). These studies suggest the potential of direct viral invasion as the cause of infection-associated cardiac injury (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Alternatively, severe influenza infection may trigger an exaggerated immune response, with many individuals with severe influenza infection showing increased serum cytokines (
 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). The activation or enhanced release of various inflammatory cytokines, or transient hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, may aggravate the impairment of intracellular calcium function, which may result in abnormal electrocardiography and echocardiography (

 <xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). In the present study, the proportion of patients with detectable viral RNA until discharge or death was significantly higher among patients with cardiac injury than among uninjured patients. Because influenza A (H7N9) virus can cause severe infection, we hypothesize that it promotes cardiac injury by up-regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines (

 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), but this needs to be further explored.
