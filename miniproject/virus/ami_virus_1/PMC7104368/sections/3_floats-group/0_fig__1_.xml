  <p>Study outline. To test the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection, three groups of six rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012; one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 24 h before inoculation (black circles), and one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 12 h after inoculation (red circles). One group of six control animals was i.v.-administered 1 mL/kg vehicle solution, with three animals receiving vehicle solution according to the prophylactic treatment schedule, and three animals receiving it according to the therapeutic treatment schedule. Treatment was continued once daily until 6 dpi, when all animals were euthanized. At 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 dpi, clinical examinations were performed to monitor the health status of the animals.</p>
