  <p>Viral loads in respiratory tract tissues of rhesus macaques inoculated with MERS-CoV and treated with remdesivir. Three groups of six rhesus macaques were inoculated with MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012; one group was i.v.-administered 1 mL/kg vehicle solution (vehicle control; gray circles), one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 24 h before inoculation (prophylactic remdesivir; black squares), and one group was administered 5 mg/kg remdesivir starting at 12 h after inoculation (therapeutic remdesivir; red triangles). Treatment was continued once daily until 6 dpi, when all animals were euthanized and necropsies were performed. At necropsy, tissue samples were collected from all six lung lobes, RNA was extracted, and viral load was determined as TCID50 equivalents per gram tissue. Individual animals and lung lobes are indicated (
   <italic>A</italic>), and averages and SDs per group (
   <italic>B</italic>). Similarly, viral loads were determined in additional tissues from the respiratory tract of each animal (
   <italic>C</italic>). R: right; L: left. Asterisks indicate statistically significant differences in a two-way ANOVA with Dunnettâ€™s multiple comparisons. *
