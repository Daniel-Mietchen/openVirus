<p>Therapeutic remdesivir treatment was administered at 12 h after inoculation with MERS-CoV, and, although this may seem relatively early after inoculation, it is close to the peak of MERS-CoV replication in the rhesus macaque model (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A drug that inhibits virus replication may be of little use once virus replication has reached its peak, as was shown in vitro (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, in a considerable number of severe cases of MERS, viral RNA and infectious virus can still be detected in respiratory tract samples several weeks after the onset of symptoms (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), with this prolonged virus replication most likely due to the presence of underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus (
 <xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Likewise, an increase in virus replication over a longer period of time was observed in immunocompromised rhesus macaques (
 <xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, remdesivir treatment could not only be of benefit to patients diagnosed with MERS early after symptom onset but may also improve recovery in those patients with severe cases of MERS where prolonged virus replication occurs.
