<p>Human safety data are available for remdesivir. It has been used on a compassionate basis in several unique cases of Ebola virus disease (
 <xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), as well as on a large scale in the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (
 <xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with around 400 treated patients. In addition, its efficacy is currently being tested in a clinical trial in Ebola virus disease survivors with prolonged virus shedding (
 <xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although the efficacy of remdesivir was lower in the Ebola virus trial than that of the different antibody treatments tested, survival was increased as compared to overall survival rate in this outbreak.
