<p>Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a nucleotide prodrug that has broad antiviral activity against viruses from different families in vitro (
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and therapeutic efficacy in nonhuman primate models of lethal Ebola virus and Nipah virus infection (
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Studies in human airway epithelial cells showed that remdesivir also inhibits replication of a wide range of coronaviruses, including MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Efficacy studies in mice showed that remdesivir had therapeutic efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and MERS-CoV in Ces1c
 <sup>−/−</sup> mice, deficient in a secreted carboxylesterase responsible for poor pharmacokinetics profile of remdesivir in mice, when administered before the peak of virus replication (
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In vitro studies with mouse hepatitis virus showed that remdesivir inhibits coronavirus replication through interference with the viral polymerase, despite the presence of a viral proofreading exoribonuclease (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Importantly, coronaviruses partially resistant to inhibition by remdesivir, obtained in vitro following &gt;20 passages in the presence of GS-441524, a parent nucleoside that is metabolized into the same active triphosphate metabolite, were still sensitive to higher concentrations of remdesivir, and fitness was impaired in the resistant viruses as compared to wild-type MERS-CoV (
 <xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). With these promising data in mind, we tested the prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque (
 <xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>).
