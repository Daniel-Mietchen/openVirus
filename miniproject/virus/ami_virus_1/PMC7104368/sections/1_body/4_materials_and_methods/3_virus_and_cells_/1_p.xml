<p>HCoV-EMC/2012 (Vero passage 6) was kindly provided by the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and propagated once in VeroE6 cells in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Logan), 1 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Lonza), 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin (Gibco) (virus isolation medium). Next-generation sequencing of our MERS-CoV inoculum revealed that there was a deletion in ORF5 in a small percentage of sequences (∼10%). VeroE6 cells were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 1 mM 
 <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 μg/mL streptomycin.
