To date, potential antiviral treatments for MERS-CoV have shown limited efficacy in animal studies. Here, we tested the efficacy of the broad-acting antiviral remdesivir in the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection. Remdesivir reduced the severity of disease, virus replication, and damage to the lungs when administered either before or after animals were infected with MERS-CoV. Our data show that remdesivir is a promising antiviral treatment against MERS that could be considered for implementation in clinical trials. It may also have utility for related coronaviruses such as the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China.</p></abstract><abstract><p>The continued emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) cases with a high case fatality rate stresses the need for the availability of effective antiviral treatments. Remdesivir (GS-5734) effectively inhibited MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) replication in vitro, and showed efficacy against Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV in a mouse model. Here, we tested the efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic remdesivir treatment in a nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the rhesus macaque. Prophylactic remdesivir treatment initiated 24 h prior to inoculation completely prevented MERS-CoV&#x02212;induced clinical disease, strongly inhibited MERS-CoV replication in respiratory tissues, and prevented the formation of lung lesions. Therapeutic remdesivir treatment initiated 12 h postinoculation also provided a clear clinical benefit, with a reduction in clinical signs, reduced virus replication in the lungs, and decreased presence and severity of lung lesions. The data presented here support testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. It may also be considered for a wider range of coronaviruses, including the currently emerging novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>MERS-CoV</kwd><kwd>antiviral</kwd><kwd>animal model</kwd><kwd>remdesivir</kwd><kwd>therapy</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="gs1"><funding-source id="sp1">Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (DIR, NIAID)<named-content content-type="funder-id">100006492</named-content></funding-source><award-id rid="sp1">N/A</award-id><principal-award-recipient>Emmie De Wit</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Friederike Feldmann</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Jacqueline Cronin</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Robert Jordan</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Atsushi Okumura</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Tina Thomas</principal-award-recipient><principal-award-recipient>Dana P.

Thus, although it is hard to compare different studies due to the fact that different species were used and treatment was initiated at different time points after inoculation, remdesivir appears to be one of the most promising antiviral treatments tested in a nonhuman primate model to date.</p><p>Therapeutic remdesivir treatment was administered at 12 h after inoculation with MERS-CoV, and, although this may seem relatively early after inoculation, it is close to the peak of MERS-CoV replication in the rhesus macaque model (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). A drug that inhibits virus replication may be of little use once virus replication has reached its peak, as was shown in vitro (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). However, in a considerable number of severe cases of MERS, viral RNA and infectious virus can still be detected in respiratory tract samples several weeks after the onset of symptoms (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), with this prolonged virus replication most likely due to the presence of underlying conditions such as diabetes mellitus (<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Likewise, an increase in virus replication over a longer period of time was observed in immunocompromised rhesus macaques (<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Thus, remdesivir treatment could not only be of benefit to patients diagnosed with MERS early after symptom onset but may also improve recovery in those patients with severe cases of MERS where prolonged virus replication occurs.</p><p>Human safety data are available for remdesivir. It has been used on a compassionate basis in several unique cases of Ebola virus disease (<xref rid="r21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="r22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), as well as on a large scale in the ongoing Ebola virus outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (<xref rid="r23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), with around 400 treated patients. In addition, its efficacy is currently being tested in a clinical trial in Ebola virus disease survivors with prolonged virus shedding (<xref rid="r24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="r25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Although the efficacy of remdesivir was lower in the Ebola virus trial than that of the different antibody treatments tested, survival was increased as compared to overall survival rate in this outbreak.</p><p>Taken together, the data presented here on the efficacy of remdesivir in prophylactic and therapeutic treatment regimens, the difficulty of coronaviruses to acquire resistance to remdesivir (<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), and the availability of human safety data warrant testing of the efficacy of remdesivir treatment in the context of a MERS clinical trial. Our results, together with replication inhibition by remdesivir of a wide range of coronaviruses in vitro and in vivo (<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>), may further indicate utility of remdesivir against the novel coronavirus 2019-nCoV emerging from Wuhan, China (<xref rid="r26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s6"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s7"><title>Ethics and Biosafety Statement.</title><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Rocky Mountain Laboratories, NIH and carried out by certified staff in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International accredited facility, according to the institution&#x02019;s guidelines for animal use, and followed the guidelines and basic principles in the United States Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Rhesus macaques were housed in adjacent individual primate cages allowing social interactions, in a climate-controlled room with a fixed light&#x02212;dark cycle (12-h light/12-h dark). Animals were monitored at least twice daily throughout the experiment. Commercial monkey chow, treats, and fruit were provided twice daily by trained personnel. Water was available ad libitum. Environmental enrichment consisted of a variety of human interaction, commercial toys, videos, and music. The Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) approved work with infectious MERS-CoV strains under BSL3 conditions. Sample inactivation was performed according to IBC-approved standard operating procedures for removal of specimens from high containment.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Study Design.</title><p>To evaluate the effect of remdesivir treatment on MERS-CoV disease outcome, we used the rhesus macaque model of MERS-CoV infection that results in transient lower respiratory tract disease (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Rhesus macaques were chosen because of the requirement of daily anesthesia and intravenous (i.v.) injections that were perceived to be problematic in the alternative nonhuman primate model of MERS-CoV infection, the common marmoset (<xref rid="r27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), due to their small size. All animals were randomly assigned to groups and inoculated as described previously with a total dose of 7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> TCID50 of MERS-CoV strain HCoV-EMC/2012 via intranasal, oral, ocular (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> TCID50 each), and intratracheal (4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> TCID50) routes (<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In the first experiment, the efficacy of prophylactic remdesivir treatment was tested in one group of six rhesus macaques (all males; female rhesus macaques were not available from the supplier at the time of this study) treated with 5 mg/kg remdesivir in vehicle solution (5 mg/mL 12% sulfobutylether-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin in water and hydrochloric acid, pH3.5) and three control rhesus macaques (all males) who received the same volume (1 mL/kg) of vehicle solution. This 5 mg/kg dosing in rhesus macaques is roughly equivalent to the 100-mg daily dosing used in humans in the Ebola virus clinical trials. Treatment was initiated at 24 h before virus inoculation and continued once daily until 6 dpi. After observing good efficacy of remdesivir upon prophylactic treatment, a second experiment was performed to assess its therapeutic efficacy. One group of six rhesus macaques (all males) was treated with 5 mg/kg remdesivir, and three control rhesus macaques (all males) received the same volume of vehicle solution. Due to the acute nature of the MERS-CoV model in rhesus macaques, therapeutic treatment was initiated at 12 h after inoculation with MERS-CoV and continued once daily until 6 dpi. Treatment was delivered as a slow i.v. bolus injection (total dose delivered over &#x0223c;5 min) administered alternatingly in the left or right cephalic and saphenous veins. The animals were observed twice daily for clinical signs of disease, using a standardized scoring sheet as described previously (<xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>); the same person, who was blinded to the group assignment of the animals, assessed the animals throughout the study. The predetermined endpoint for this experiment was 6 dpi. Clinical examinations were performed at 0, 1, 3, 5, and 6 dpi on anesthetized animals. On examination days, clinical parameters such as body weight and respiration rate were collected, as well as dorsal&#x02212;ventral and lateral chest radiographs. Chest radiographs were analyzed by a board-certified clinical veterinarian blinded to the group assignment of the animals. After euthanasia at 6 dpi, necropsies were performed. The percentage of gross lung lesions were scored by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals, and samples of the following tissues were collected: conjunctiva, nasal mucosa, mandibular lymph node, tonsil, pharynx, trachea, all six lung lobes, mediastinal lymph node, liver, spleen, kidney, and bladder. Histopathological analysis of tissue slides was performed by a board-certified veterinary pathologist blinded to the group assignment of the animals.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>Virus and Cells.</title><p>HCoV-EMC/2012 (Vero passage 6) was kindly provided by the Department of Viroscience, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and propagated once in VeroE6 cells in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) (Sigma) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) (Logan), 1 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine (Lonza), 50 U/mL penicillin, and 50 &#x003bc;g/mL streptomycin (Gibco) (virus isolation medium).
