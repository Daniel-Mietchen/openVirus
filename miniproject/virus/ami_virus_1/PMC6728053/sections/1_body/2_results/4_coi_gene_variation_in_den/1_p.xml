<p>Based on phylogenetic analysis of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> samples that were both susceptible and non-susceptible to DENV-2 from all three cities, we identified three 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> lineages; lineage 1 within which the domestic form (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti aegypti -</italic>Genbank Accession No. AF390098 and MF194022) clustered, lineage 2 containing the forest form (
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti formosusâ€”</italic>Genbank Accession No. AY056597), and lineage 3 which clusters within a well-supported 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> clade (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007686.g003">Fig 3</xref>). DENV-2 susceptible and non-susceptible 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> were fairly represented in all three lineages (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007686.g003">Fig 3</xref>).
