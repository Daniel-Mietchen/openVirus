<p>In this study, different risk parameters related to the DENV vector in the three major cities of Kenya; Mombasa, Kisumu, and Nairobi were studied in parallel to gain a better understanding on their potential influence on the observed differential outbreak patterns. We hypothesized that 1) the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> vector density differs between these three cities, 2) the ability of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> to transmit DENV-2 (vector competence) differs between populations from these cities and may be influenced by temperature, 3) the 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> populations in the three cities differed in their anthropophilic behavior, and 4) there is an underlying population genetic component to DENV-2 susceptibility of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in each city. An improved understanding of the factors responsible for differences in dengue outbreak risk is key to informing targeted interventions and preventing future outbreaks in the urban areas of Kenya.
