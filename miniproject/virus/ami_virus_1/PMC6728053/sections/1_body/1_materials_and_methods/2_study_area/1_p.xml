<p>This study was carried out in three major cities of Kenya; Mombasa (dengue endemic, average monthly temperature 27–31°C), Kisumu, and Nairobi (no dengue outbreak reports, average monthly temperatures of 28–30°C and 22–28°C, respectively). Mombasa (4°03'S 39°40'E, population 1.2 million people) is Kenya’s second largest city and is located on the coast. Apart from being a major tourist site, Mombasa is also an important port city. Inland Nairobi (01°17'S36°48'E, population 3.1 million people) is the capital city of Kenya. Kisumu (0°03′S34°45′E, population &gt;400,000) is located on the shores of Lake Victoria and is the third largest city in Kenya. All three cities are characterized by the presence of a national/international airport and thus serve as local, regional, and international transport hubs. These cities serve as main gateways to East Africa, and due to the ease of interconnectivity, we would expect periodic generation of dengue epidemics in all three cities resulting from either importation of infectious cases or infected vectors into these cities from within/outside the country [

This, however, has not been the case in Kenya, and epidemics (of DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3) remain primarily limited to the city of Mombasa, with DENV-1 and DENV-2 responsible for the highest number of cases. All three cities experience three seasons; the long-rain (April-June), the short-rain (October-December), and the dry (January-March and July-September) seasons. Outbreaks that have occurred in Mombasa have mostly been reported during the long-rain season [
