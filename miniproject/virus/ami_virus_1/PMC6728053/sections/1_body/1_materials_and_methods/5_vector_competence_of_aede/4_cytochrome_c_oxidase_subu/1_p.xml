<p>To determine possible genetic differences between DENV susceptible and non-susceptible 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquito populations from the three cities, genomic DNA was extracted from the body homogenate of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> mosquitoes (susceptible and non-susceptible to DENV-2), using DNeasy blood and tissue Kit (Qiagen, GmbH-Hilden, Germany). From the vector competence experiment, mosquitoes with DENV-2 positive bodies were considered susceptible to DENV-2 infection while those with a negative body were considered non-susceptible. The 860 bp barcode region of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (
 <italic>COI</italic>) gene was amplified using published primers [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and outsourced to Macrogen (Seoul, Republic of Korea) for Sanger sequencing (unidirectional sequencing–forward strand). Sequences were, viewed and edited in Chromas, prior to phylogenetic analysis using MEGA v 5 software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Homologous sequences in the Genbank database were identified through BlastN searches and aligned using ClustalW in MEGA v 5 to reference 
 <italic>CO1</italic> gene sequences for domestic 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> (Genbank No. AF390098 and MF194022) and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti formosus</italic> (Genbank Accession No. AY056597). The GTR+G model of sequence evolution was used to infer a Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree in MEGA v 5 and guided selection of priors for Bayesian inference (BI) with MrBayes 3.2 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007686.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Nodal support was assessed through 5,000 bootstrap replications for ML and from Bayesian posterior probabilities obtained from two independent runs of 20 million generations each, with burn-in set to 25%, for the BI analyses. The haplotypes generated in this study were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers MH410177 –MH410212.
