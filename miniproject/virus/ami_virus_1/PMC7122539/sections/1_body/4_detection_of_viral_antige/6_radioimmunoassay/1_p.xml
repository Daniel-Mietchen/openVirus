<p>Radioimmunoassay (RIA) techniques have been valuable for the detection of many compounds in laboratories and clinical medicine. Initially, the technique was developed for the determination of endogenous human plasma insulin levels [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] was a competitive binding assay in which the competition between an unlabeled antigen and a radiolabeled antigen reacting with a limited amount of antibody over a short period of time was monitored. Variations in RIA methods have been developed, with the most common being the direct and indirect solid-phase RIA. In the direct solid-phase RIA, antigen or antibody are captured on a solid support and detected by radiolabeled (usually 
 <sup>125</sup>I) antibody or antigen, respectively. The amount of signal increases proportionally to the amount of antigen or antibody present in the sample. In indirect assays, the capture of antigen or antibody to the solid phase prevents the binding of labeled antibody or antigen, respectively, so that the amount of signal detected is inversely proportional to the amount of antigen or antibody present. RIA methods currently are utilized mainly for the detection of antigens and antibodies of viral hepatitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The use of RIA for the detection of various hepatitis markers has demonstrated the assayâ€™s high degree of sensitivity. For the most part, RIA methods have been replaced by EIA for routine diagnostic purposes due to the complexity of the assay, the use of radioisotopes, lack of standardized commercially available reagents, and high equipment costs.
