<p>The OIA utilizes a virus-specific antibody coated onto a thin molecular film on a silicon wafer surface. The clinical sample is treated to extract and expose any viral antigens present and is then placed on the surface of the chip. Viral antigen is captured and the resulting antigenâ€“antibody complex changes the optical thickness of the film on the chip. The change in the surface thickness is magnified through addition of a second virus-specific antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase followed by addition of a substrate such as tetramethylbenzidine (TMB). The presence of virus antigen is then detected by a change in the color of reflected light from gold to purple. Kits have been developed for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus detection [
