<p>The TR-FIA is an immunoassay that replaces the reporter molecule with a lanthanide metal. When exposed to the appropriate wavelength of light, the lanthanide will fluoresce [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Compared to fluorescein and background autofluorescence, which have fluorescence decay times of less than five nanoseconds, the lanthanides have much longer decay times of 1,000 to 1 million nanoseconds [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The format of the antigen detection TR-FIA is similar to that of a sandwich EIA, where a microtiter plate is coated with a virus-specific capture antibody and is then blocked. The clinical sample and antibody conjugated to the lanthanide is added next, and after a suitable incubation period, the unbound components are removed by washing. An enhancement solution is added and the well is exposed to the appropriate wavelength of light. A fluorometer is used to measure fluorescence for 1 s, and the pattern of fluorescence allows the separation of antigen-specific signal from background fluorescence. Several different lanthanides are available for use, but europium is frequently used because of its long fluorescence decay time and the difference between its excitation wavelength (~340â€“360 nm) and emission wavelength (~615 nm) [
