<p>The detection of viruses or viral components is the foundation of diagnostic virology. Although the detection of antibodies to specific viral proteins remains an important element of viral epidemiology, the ability to isolate and/or characterize viral pathogens initially is critically important. The performance of any diagnostic test in a reproducible, sensitive, and specific manner is crucial in the study of viral diseases. Combinations of various techniques, including centrifugation-enhanced tissue culture, antibodyâ€“antigen detection, and detection of viral nucleic acid, can be used to supplement classic tissue culture methods.</p>
