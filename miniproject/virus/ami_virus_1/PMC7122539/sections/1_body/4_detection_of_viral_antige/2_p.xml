<p>Methods for the detection of virus-specific antigens have allowed rapid identification of a wide variety of viruses (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">3.1</xref>). Specific monoclonal antibodies conjugated to biochemical markers may provide high levels of sensitivity and specificity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The key to the success of the assays outlined below is the use of reliable virus-specific antibody. Molecular biological techniques that permit the production of relatively large quantities of avid monoclonal antibodies have facilitated viral antigen detection.
