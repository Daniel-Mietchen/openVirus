<p>The use of IF for the direct detection of viral antigens in clinical samples and the confirmation of viral growth in cell cultures has increased with the widespread commercial availability of relatively inexpensive antibodies specific for many of the herpesviruses and respiratory viruses. The IF method has the advantage of allowing rapid viral diagnosis in properly obtained specimens [

When working with large numbers of clinical specimens, the time required for sample collection, processing, and interpretation of the stained slide becomes substantial. The enthusiasm for this technique in clinical specimens has varied due to the time and degree of technical competence required to read such samples, the availability of other, the less labor-intensive antigen detection methods, and the frequency of false-negative results obtained because of the dependence of the assay on having a high degree of viral antigen expression in the clinical sample. Nevertheless, the appropriate use of this test can result in reliable and sensitive rapid diagnosis from clinical samples. The use of IF for the detection of RSV in pediatric patients by an experienced laboratory can detect up to 90–95 % of the samples positive by culture [
