<p>Viral-specific antibodies conjugated to a fluorescein-labeled moiety have been used to identify viral pathogens since the late 1950s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Immunofluorescence (IF) assays are widely used for the rapid detection of viruses in clinical samples and for definitive identification of a virus in tissue culture that may allow viral antigens to be sought before or after cytopathic effect (CPE) is evident. In the direct IF test (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">3.1</xref>), the virus-specific antibody labeled with a fluorescent dye such as fluorescein isothiocyanate or, less commonly, rhodamine isothiocyanate is allowed to react for a short time with cells obtained from a clinical specimen or from an inoculated cell culture. After allowing time for an antigen–antibody reaction to occur, the slides are washed and examined microscopically for direct visualization of the fluorescence of the infected cells in the specimen. In the indirect IF test, two different antisera are used: an unlabeled virus-specific antibody capable of binding to a specific viral antigen is used first and is followed by a fluorescein-labeled, species-specific antibody directed against the species in which the first antibody was raised. If a reaction occurs between the first antiserum and the clinical specimen, the second antibody will bind to the antigen–antibody complex and fluorescence of the virus-infected cells can be detected.
