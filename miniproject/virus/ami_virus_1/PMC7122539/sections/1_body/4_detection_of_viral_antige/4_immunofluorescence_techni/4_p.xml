<p>The combination of IF techniques with cell culture has increased the sensitivity of cell culture while providing a positive result in a shorter time period. With the use of centrifugation or other methods of enhancement of viral replication and pools of varying antibodies, cell cultures can be incubated between 1 and 3 days and then stained for a variety of virus antigens using indirect or direct IF methods. For some viruses, such as CMV or VZV, specific antibodies directed toward early or nonstructural antigens permit the rapid diagnosis within 48 h, well before CPE would be visualized under routine cell culture conditions [

Disadvantages of IF techniques include the need for fluorescent microscopes, difficulty in the interpretation of clinical specimens that have a high level of nonspecific fluorescence, and the fact that prepared slides are not generally stable over periods longer than 1 month [
