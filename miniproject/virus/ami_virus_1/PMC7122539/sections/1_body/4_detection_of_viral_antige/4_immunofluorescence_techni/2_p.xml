<p>The two IF methods each have advantages and disadvantages. Both tests allow an assessment of the quality of the sample in that samples that do not contain cells are poor quality and cannot be interpreted. The indirect IF is usually more sensitive because several fluorescein-conjugated molecules potentially are able to bind to each virus-specific antibody molecule attached to the viral antigen, resulting in amplification of the fluorescence. The direct IF test may offer enhanced specificity due to lower background fluorescence. The indirect IF method requires more reagents and more time to perform. Whether monoclonal or polyclonal antisera are optimal for use in either test method is still debated. The use of monoclonal antibodies generally provides the lowest background but may be limited by the high specificity of these reactions. This problem can usually be overcome by using a pool of monoclonal antibodies.</p>
