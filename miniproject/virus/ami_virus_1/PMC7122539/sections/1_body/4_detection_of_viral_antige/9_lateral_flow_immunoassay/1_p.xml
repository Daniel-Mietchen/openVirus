<p>The lateral flow immunoassay, also called the immunochromatographic assay, is an immunoassay that is performed on chromatographic paper along a single axis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3.3</xref>). The clinical sample is applied to an absorbent pad and then is drawn by capillary action through a conjugate pad. If viral antigen is present in the clinical sample, it will interact with a virus-specific antibody conjugated to a colored particle (often colloidal gold). The fluid in the sample carries the antigen–antibody complex to a reaction membrane to which another virus-specific antibody has been immobilized in a line perpendicular to the capillary flow direction. The antigen–antibody–conjugate complex is captured and can be observed as a colored line on the membrane. The sample is carried further across the reaction membrane to a control line. Antibody specific for the antibody–conjugate is immobilized along the control line, and visualization of the control line indicates that the sample migrated across the membrane and picked up the antibody–conjugate as designed. An absorbent pad is beyond the reaction pad and acts as a waste reservoir, drawing the clinical sample across the other pads by capillary action.
