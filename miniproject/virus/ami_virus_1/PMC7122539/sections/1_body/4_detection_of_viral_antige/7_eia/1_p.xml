<p>Enzyme immunoassays, or EIAs, have gained widespread acceptance in virology laboratories for the detection of a variety of viral antigens and antibodies. The assays used in this method rely on antibodies directed against a specific virus or viral antigen that are adsorbed or directly linked to polystyrene wells in microtiter plates, plastic beads, or membrane-bound material. When viral antigen is present in a specimen, it binds to the immobilized “capture” antibody and a second “detecting” antibody conjugated to an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase or alkaline phosphatase then attaches to the antigen, forming a three-layer “sandwich” consisting of the immobilized antibody, the antigen, and the detecting antibody with enzyme attached (Fig.

The test is quite simple to run, requiring only standardization of reagents and techniques such as dilution, incubation, and washing. The principles involved in EIA are similar to those involved in immunofluorescence and RIA, but the EIA test has the distinct advantages of being simple to perform, utilizing reagents that have long shelf lives, are inexpensive, and do not require sophisticated technical evaluation to determine results. Advantages of the EIA technique also include sensitivity (less than 1 ng/ml), specificity, rapidity, safety, automation potential, and low cost, particularly when many specimens require evaluation.
