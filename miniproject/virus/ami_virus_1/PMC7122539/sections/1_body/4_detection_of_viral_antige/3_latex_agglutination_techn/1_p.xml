<p>Viral-specific antibodies linked to latex beads can be used to detect viral antigens in a clinical sample. The presence of viral antigen in the sample results in cross-linking of the beads that can be identified by visual inspection. This strategy has most commonly been applied to detection of viral enteric pathogens like rotavirus and adenovirus, and it has the advantage of low complexity and providing rapid results (in less than 15 min). However, a major disadvantage is its relatively lower sensitivity (&lt;70 %) compared to other antigen detection methods (&gt;80â€“90 %) or culture [
