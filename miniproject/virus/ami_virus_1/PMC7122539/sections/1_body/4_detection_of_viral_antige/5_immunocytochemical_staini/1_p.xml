<p>Immunocytochemical staining is a sensitive and specific method for detecting viral antigens with labeled antibodies. This technique, pioneered by Coons [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] in 1942, has been used to study the structure and function of a variety of viral proteins and continues to be utilized in both the research and clinical laboratories. It has been used both for detection of viral infection of a monolayer prior to the appearance of cytopathic effect and in rapid screening assays for drug resistance [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. This method utilizes reagents similar to those used in the IF assay except that the fluorescent marker is replaced by an enzyme. When enzyme-specific substrates are provided, a colored precipitate forms at the site of reaction. Typical enzymes used to detect viral antigens include alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase. A major drawback of alkaline phosphatase-based reagents is their lack of stability; a major drawback of peroxidase as a marker is the fact that this enzyme is endogenous to some mammalian tissue, thus requiring either elimination of the endogenous enzyme or use of a nonmammalian enzyme, glucose oxidase [
