<p>Advantages of immunoenzymatic staining compared to IF staining include the virtual permanence of stained preparations and the ability to view slides using an ordinary light microscope. Both direct and indirect staining with immunoperoxidase and other enzymes have been utilized to detect many viruses. Refinements have been developed that allow even greater sensitivity than that seen with indirect staining without the need to conjugate enzyme to an antibody. For example, a modification of these techniques has been a four-layer sandwich technique involving (1) virus-specific antibody raised in species X, (2) an excess amount of a second antibody raised against the species X antibody, (3) a complex of peroxidase and antiperoxidase antibody (raised in species X), and (4) reducing substrate for peroxidase [

The sensitivity of antigen detection has been further improved by more recently developed signal amplification methods, including avidin–biotin complexes (binding of 4 biotins per streptavidin), chain polymer-conjugated technology where multiple enzyme and antibody molecules are attached to an inert molecule such as dextran, and the use of tyramine conjugates as substrates for horseradish peroxidase that allow signal amplication as much as 100-fold [
