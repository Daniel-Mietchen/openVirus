<p>Many problems still must be resolved in the area of viral diagnosis. The development of newer molecular assays with improved sensitivity have supplanted many antigen detection methods with lower sensitivity, but the ease of performance of the antigen detection methods still makes these assays attractive to many laboratories. While molecular methodologies offer the potential for great sensitivity and specificity, they often require specialized equipment for their performance. Ultimately, the ideal diagnostic test will be rapid, easy to perform, inexpensive, sensitive, and specific and will not require the use of specialized equipment. However, even if such a test is developed, the significance of the identified virus to the observed disease process will remain in the hands of the epidemiologist, virologist, and clinician.</p>
