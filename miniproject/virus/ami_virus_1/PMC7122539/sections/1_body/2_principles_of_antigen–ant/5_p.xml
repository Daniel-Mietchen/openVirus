<p>Another factor that can influence the assay development is nonspecific interactions between the antibody and other substances in the reaction mix (e.g., attachment to the reaction vessel, other microbial antigens). Although these are generally low-affinity interactions, the concentrations of the competing substances can be high enough to affect the readout of the assay. Many of the low-affinity interactions can be removed by washing steps, use of blocking reagents and use of lower concentrations of antibody, but each antibody used in a diagnostic assay should be evaluated for the presence of these nonspecific reactions. In addition, the use of appropriate controls can identify problems with assay performance [
