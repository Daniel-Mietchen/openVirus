<p>There are many factors that affect the interaction between an antigen and antibody and the ability to one or the other in a diagnostic assay. These include the temperature of the reaction conditions and the ionic strength of the solutions used in the assay. As noted above, antibody affinity and concentration are particularly important when developing an antigen detection assay. The relative concentration of antigen-specific antibody is lowest in postinfection sera. It can be increased through hyperimmunization with the antigen to generate polyclonal antisera, and the relative concentration can be increased further by affinity purification of the antibody. The highest relative concentrations are reached through the generation of monoclonal antibodies, and selection of high-affinity monoclonal antibodies for use in diagnostic assays is now widely used in the development of antigen detection assays [
