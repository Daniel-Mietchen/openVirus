<p>From this law, the formation of antigen–antibody complexes reaches equilibrium, and the amount of complex formed is proportional to the concentration of the antibody and antigen present. The binding constant is a measure of the strength of interaction between one epitope and one paratope and is also referred to as the affinity of the antibody. The higher the affinity of a paratope for a corresponding epitope, the greater the strength of binding and the lower the

Antibody avidity is correlated to its affinity, but it is also affected by the number (or valency) of interactions between the antibody and antigen. For IgG antibody, the valency is up to two. Since the antigen–antibody interaction is in equilibrium, the presence of multiple binding interactions can maintain the antigen–antibody complex once formed during periods of dissociation between an epitope and paratope.
