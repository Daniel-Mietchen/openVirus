<p>An antigen is defined as a substance capable of stimulating an immune response when introduced into the body (e.g., of an immunized animal). When the immune response is the production of antibody, the generated antigen-specific antibody can bind directly to the antigen. The portion of the antigen recognized by and specifically interacting with the antibody molecule is called an epitope. An antigen may have more than one epitope. When this occurs the epitopes either may be distinct molecular structures (and thus distinct epitopes) or they may be the same molecular structure (the same epitope) repeated many times. The portion of the antibody interacting with the antigen is called a paratope. The ability of the epitope and paratope to bind to each other is the basis of the specificity of an antigenâ€“antibody interaction.</p>
