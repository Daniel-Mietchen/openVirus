<p>The significance of detection or lack of detection of a virus or viral antigen remains difficult to interpret. Isolation of a virus from a normally sterile site, such as tissue, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or blood, is generally highly significant and usually establishes the etiology of the infection. The identification of certain viruses, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in respiratory specimens, also is diagnostic because an asymptomatic carrier state has not been shown to exist. However, prolonged and generally asymptomatic excretion or shedding of other viruses can make the determination of the effect of a particular virus on the disease process very difficult. Viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenoviruses, and enteroviruses are shed in disease states but also may be shed asymptomatically for prolonged periods of apparent good health. An additional complicating factor is the differentiation of primary infection from reactivation of disease, a problem common to the study of infections with viruses such as herpes simplex (HSV) or CMV, especially in immunocompromised hosts such as transplant recipients or patients infected with HIV. Interpretation of laboratory results in such situations requires a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of the virus.</p>
