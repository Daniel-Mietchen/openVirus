<p>Failure to detect a virus or viral antigen does not necessarily mean that the virus was not present previously or did not cause disease. Although failure to detect a virus may be a result of inappropriate or inadequate specimen collection and handling, it may also be a function of the time course of the disease, the age or antibody status of the patient, and the technical resources available to detect or cultivate the virus. The investigator today has many options to diagnose the presence or past presence of a viral infection, but careful epidemiologic and laboratory studies are still required to ultimately link the viral agent to a specific disease process.</p>
