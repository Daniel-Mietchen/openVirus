<p>Immunological methods are valuable strategies for the diagnosis and characterization of viral infections. These methods rely on antigen–antibody interactions, and they can be adapted to allow direct detection of the virus (antigen detection) or to identify the host’s immune response to the virus infection (antibody detection). The methods are also used to identify and characterize virus isolates following in vitro or in vivo propagation. Although molecular detection is often more sensitive than antigen detection, immunological methods still have an important role in the study of the epidemiology, pathology, and assessment of clinical disease associated with viral infection.</p>
