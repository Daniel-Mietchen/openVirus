<p>Difficulties arise in interpretation of serological tests when only a single convalescent serum sample is obtained and a high antibody titer is found or if high titers are present in both acute and convalescent sera without a fourfold rise. These results can reflect either current infection or persistently high antibody levels from a previous infection. Significance may be attached to these findings if the disease is a rare one in which the presence of antibody is unique, if the test reflects a short-lasting antibody, or if specific immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody can be demonstrated. A rapid drop in antibody titer in a subsequent specimen is also suggestive of a recent infection. Sequential testing of other family members also may be useful, since they may be in different stages of apparent or inapparent infection with the same virus. In an epidemic setting, comparison of the geometric mean antibody titer of sera collected early in illness from one group of patients with that from another group of patients convalescing from the same illness may permit rapid identification of the outbreak.</p>
