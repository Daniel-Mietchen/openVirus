<p>At times, a virus may be identified or an antibody rise demonstrated that is not, in fact, causally related to the illness. Sometimes dual infections with two viruses, or with a virus and a bacterium, occur, and the interpretation of the role of an individual viral pathogen in the disease process may be very difficult. On other occasions, no virus is isolated or the serological rise is not sufficient to demonstrate whether a specific virus is the real cause of the illness. A list of common causes for false-positive and false-negative results is given in Table
