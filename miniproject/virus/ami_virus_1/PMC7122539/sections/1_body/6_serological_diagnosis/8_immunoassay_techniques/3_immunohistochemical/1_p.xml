<p>The most commonly used immunohistochemical technique to detect antibody is the immunofluorescence technique (IF). Whereas direct techniques are used commonly to detect antigen in infected tissue or cells, indirect immunohistochemical techniques are used to detect antibody in sera or other bodily fluids. Variations on the indirect IF test, such as amplification immunoassay systems utilizing various sandwich techniques (double indirect IF or anticomplement IF) or chemical amplification systems utilizing biotinâ€“avidin complexes, are used in research settings [
