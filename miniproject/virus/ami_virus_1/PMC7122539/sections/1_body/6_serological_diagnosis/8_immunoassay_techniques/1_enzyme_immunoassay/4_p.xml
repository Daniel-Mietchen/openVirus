<p>Epitope-blocking assays using monoclonal antibodies have been used to examine serological responses to a number of viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. These assays measure the ability of a test serum to block the binding of a monoclonal antibody to a virus antigen. They have been particularly useful in determining serotype-specific immune responses to multivalent vaccines and in determining which of a number of cross-reactive virus strains is responsible for a natural infection in a given host.
