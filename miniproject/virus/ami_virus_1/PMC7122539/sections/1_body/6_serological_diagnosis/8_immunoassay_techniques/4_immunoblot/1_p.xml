<p>An immunoblot, also referred as a Western blot, is another widely used method for the detection of antibody to specific viral antigens. This technique relies on the incubation of patient serum with partially purified whole virus or recombinant viral proteins that have been separated by electrophoresis in a polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose paper [

The assay is based on the same principal as EIA but has the advantage of identifying antibodies specific for several antigens of the same virus simultaneously. Quantitation of the specific reactions can be determined by a densitometer. Difficulties with immunoblots include the expense and time required for the test, the technical requirements for performing and interpreting the test, and the problems encountered with preparing reagents such as purified virus and labeled antihuman IgG. The time interval from virus acquisition and seroconversion by immunoblot may vary for different patients, as well as different viruses, indicating that diagnosis of infection by immunoblot analysis, while extremely sensitive, is not always definitive [

Despite these problems, the immunoblot assay is widely used today in laboratories around the world as the “definitive” confirmatory test for HIV, and it is also used as a confirmatory test in some circumstances for the serological diagnosis of hepatitis C virus infection [
