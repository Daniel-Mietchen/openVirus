<p>Other variations of the immunoassay include isoelectric focusing and affinity immunoblotting. These techniques are useful because of enhanced sensitivity, particularly for diagnosis in the congenitally infected infant or for the differentiation of passively acquired antibody from endogenous antibody. Isoelectric focusing relies on the separation of serum antibody in thin-layer gels, with subsequent antibody detection by a reaction with antigen-coated membranes [
