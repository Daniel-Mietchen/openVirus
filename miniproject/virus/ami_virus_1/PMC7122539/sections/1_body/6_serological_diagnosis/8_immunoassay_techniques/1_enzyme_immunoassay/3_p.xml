<p>The lateral flow immunoassay described in Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">5.7</xref> can be modified to detect viral antibody. Antihuman immunoglobulin or protein A labeled with conjugate is used in the reagent pad in place of viral antibody conjugates, and the labeled conjugate can interact with virus-specific antibodies in the clinical sample. Recombinant viral antigen is used to capture the virus-specific antibody–antibody–conjugate complex in a “test” line, and a “control” line containing antihuman immunoglobulin is present to indicate that the assay performed as intended. The test format provides a rapid qualitative answer with sensitivity and specificity similar to that obtained by more complex laboratory-based enzyme immunoassays [
