<p>In the indirect IF test, tissue or cells containing viral antigen are fixed on a glass slide, a serum dilution is added, and a fluorochrome-conjugated antibody indicator system is used to detect the resulting reaction. The conjugated detector antibody can be varied to specifically measure the presence of antibody classes, such as IgG, IgM, and IgA. IF techniques provide sensitive methods to detect antibody that can be related to immunity to viruses, such as VZV, to detect congenital infections in newborns based on IgM-specific antibody, and to detect epitope-specific antibody [

In particular, the anticomplement-amplified indirect IF technique, utilizing a four-layer reaction including antigen, patient serum, complement, and fluorochrome-conjugated anti-C3 antibody, has been useful for the detection of the nuclear antigen of EBV, or EBNA [
