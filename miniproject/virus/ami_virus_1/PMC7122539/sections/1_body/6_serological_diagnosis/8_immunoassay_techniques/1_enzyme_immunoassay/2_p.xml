<p>Difficulties inherent in immunoassay techniques include those associated with obtaining and standardizing purified, sensitive, and specific IgG and IgM reagents. Although many of these reagents are commercially available, there can be variability in the specificity of the reagents so that during assay development the reagent specificity should be assessed. In general, results from different laboratories using different reagents are not directly comparable. Specific analysis for subclasses, particularly IgM, requires careful standardization and quality control to assure reliability and specificity of the assay. Attention to such detail is critically important in assays with life-threatening implications, such as the EIA assays currently used in blood banks to detect the presence of antibody to HIV or hepatitis B and C. Evaluation and standardization of tests, including commercially available kits, and comparison among different products prior to use in research and clinical settings remain an important part of EIA.</p>
