<p>Enzyme-based immunoassays (EIAs), sometimes called enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays or ELISA, are widely used for many purposes, including the detection of antigen-specific antibody. This methodology has replaced other methods in many laboratories in part due to the commercial availability of test materials and complete test kits. The most commonly used immunoassays employ a four-layer approach: antigen is bound directly to a surface, the unknown serum sample is then added, an enzyme-conjugated antihuman IgG or IgM is added next, and an indicator system is used to determine the amount of reaction between the enzyme-linked antibody and the antigenâ€“serum reaction. As discussed in Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">5.5</xref>, this method has gained widespread use due to its sensitivity, specificity, safety, simplicity, low cost, and ability to be automated. The system lends itself to automation because of readily available microtiter diagnostic systems and because multiple tests for different antigens may be run by varying only the initial antigen in the system. Clinical specimens from various sources besides serum or plasma, such as respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, and breast milk, also may be tested in this system. The EIA test may also be read visually and so is useful in developing countries unable to afford the photometric reader used in developed countries to accurately quantitate the antibody content.
