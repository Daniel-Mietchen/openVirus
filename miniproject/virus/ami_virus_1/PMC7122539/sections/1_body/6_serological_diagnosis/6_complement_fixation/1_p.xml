<p>The complement fixation (CF) test is a relatively simple technique that may be used successfully with a large variety of viral antigens. First developed in 1909 by Wasserman and coworkers [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] for the detection of syphilis antibodies, CF has been adapted to test for antibodies to many bacterial and fungal pathogens of animals and man. The CF test relies on competition between two antigen–antibody systems for a fixed amount of complement, with the result ultimately demonstrated by the lysis of erythrocytes. The serum is heated at 50 °C for 30 min to inactivate any complement that may be present. Antigen and a known amount of complement are added to dilutions of serum. The complexes formed between the initial antigen and antibody bind the available free complement, thus preventing further reaction of the complement in the second step of the assay. In the second step, a hemolytic indicator system using red blood cells (RBCs), which have been reacted with hemolysin to sensitize them to complement, is used to detect the free complement. The RBCs are reacted with hemolysin, or antibody to the RBC, and added to the assay. Lysis of the RBCs occurs if free complement is present. Thus, the presence of hemolysis at the conclusion of the assay is indicative of the absence of specific antibody, whereas the formation of clumped RBC (often referred to as a “RBC button”) indicates a positive test reaction. Antibody titers can be calculated using standard endpoint determinations. Antibodies detected by CF are primarily of the IgG class and develop during the convalescent stages of illness. The greatest application of the CF test lies in the demonstration of a rise in antibody in convalescent compared with acute sera. The CF test has been widely used for the serodiagnosis of many human viral pathogens because of its broad reactivity and effectiveness in detecting changes in antibody titers and it is often the standard against which new methods are compared. The CF test has largely been replaced in many laboratories by enzyme immunoassays, but it continues to maintain its usefulness in some circumstances because reagents are relatively inexpensive and readily available and the test is rapid, reliable, and relatively easy to perform [
