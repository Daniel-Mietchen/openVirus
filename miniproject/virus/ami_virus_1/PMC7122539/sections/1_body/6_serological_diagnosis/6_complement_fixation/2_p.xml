<p>Despite the widespread use of the CF assay over time and in many epidemiologic studies, the assay has some unique problems: (1) the test relies on a cascade of interactions involving multiple biological reagents that must be carefully monitored; (2) it is relatively insensitive because high concentrations of antigen are required to produce CF complexes and the assay is unable to detect small changes in antibody concentrations or low levels of antibody that may be predictive of protection in other assay systems (such as VZV or measles) [

Newer laboratory methods, such as EIA methods, are now available commercially and have largely replaced CF tests for many viral pathogens because of their ability to discriminate between IgG and IgM antibody, increased sensitivity, and enhanced specificity at a similar cost.
