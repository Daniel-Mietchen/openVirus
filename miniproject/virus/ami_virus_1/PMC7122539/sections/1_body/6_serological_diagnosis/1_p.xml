<p>The detection of newly developed, virus-specific antibody or the detection of an increase in titer of preexisting antibody is important in viral diagnosis and is one of the most commonly used methods in epidemiologic studies of viruses. Most primary infections or reinfections result in the production of specific antibodies. In addition, viruses such as EBV, HIV, rubella, hepatitis A and B viruses, and arboviruses are difficult to detect directly and the serological diagnosis may be the only practical means of identifying the particular agent.</p>
