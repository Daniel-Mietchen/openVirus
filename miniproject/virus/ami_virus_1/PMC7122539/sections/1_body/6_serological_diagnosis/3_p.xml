<p>Many different serological techniques have been used in the diagnosis of viral infections (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">3.2</xref>). Factors involved in the selection of a specific antibody assay include specificity, sensitivity, speed, technical complexity, cost, and availability of reagents (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3.3</xref>). All antibody assays rely on the proper collection and storage of sera and, ideally, the comparison of acute and convalescent specimens collected at an interval of at least 2 weeks. The development of newer techniques, such as EIA, for antibody determination is replacing some of the older methods, such as complement fixation, but an understanding of the available methods is important prior to choosing a laboratory test to evaluate a specific question.
