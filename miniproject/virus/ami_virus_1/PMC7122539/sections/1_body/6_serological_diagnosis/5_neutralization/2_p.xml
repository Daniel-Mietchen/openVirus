<p>The type of assay used to assess antibody is very important, particularly in the evaluation of susceptibility to vaccine-preventable or epidemic viruses such as measles or rubella, where low levels of antibody may be predictive of protection. Direct comparison of various laboratory methods used for the detection of virus-specific antibody may be important in designing studies or evaluating study results. For example, analysis of CMV antibody using neutralization by plaque reduction has shown poor correlation with CMV antibody using EIA [

Different neutralization methods also may give differing results, as has been shown in the analysis of antibody to RSV, where microneutralization assays appear to be more indicative of biological protection than either direct or competitive ELISA methods or complement-enhanced plaque reduction [
