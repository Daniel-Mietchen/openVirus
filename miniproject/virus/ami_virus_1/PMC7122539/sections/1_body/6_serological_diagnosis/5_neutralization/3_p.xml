<p>In general, measurement of neutralizing antibody is the most specific method that reflects immunity, although other tests for some viruses may be surrogate markers for this. However, neutralization tests are rather expensive since a demonstration of inhibition of viral replication in cell culture, embryonated egg, or laboratory animal (such as the suckling mouse) is required.</p>
