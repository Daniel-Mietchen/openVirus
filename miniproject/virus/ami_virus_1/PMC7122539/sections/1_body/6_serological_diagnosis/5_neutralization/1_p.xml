<p>Serum specimens may be assayed for neutralizing antibody against a given virus by testing serial dilutions of the serum against a standard dose of the virus. The antibody titer is expressed as the highest serum dilution that neutralizes the test dose of virus. As a bioassay, neutralization assays are highly specific and quite sensitive. For many viral agents, the neutralizing antibody level is directly correlated with immunity, an important clinical and epidemiologic endpoint. Disadvantages of the assay include the time required to obtain a result and the relatively high cost, due to the labor intensity and requirement for cell culture and titered viral stocks. Neutralization assays may be carried out in a variety of systems and the endpoint measured by a number of different procedures. Different neutralization systems include plaque reduction neutralization, sometimes using complement enhancement, where the number of virus plaques in control wells are compared with the number seen in cultures inoculated with the virus–serum mixture; microneutralization, an assay performed in microtiter plates requiring small amounts of sera; and colorimetric assays. Colorimetric assays rely on markers indicating metabolic inhibition of the virus in cell cultures or on antigen–antibody reactions with antibody tagged or reacted with enzyme-linked antibodies. Colorimetric assays are generally analyzed by measurement of optical density and have the advantage of being less time-consuming and costly to set up and analyze than other assays. Colorimetric assays often are more sensitive than assays relying on inhibition of CPE [
