<p>The immune adherence hemagglutination method is another method that has been used in the clinical laboratory. After an initial reaction between viral antigens and specific antibodies is allowed to occur, complement is added and binds to the antigen–antibody complex, if present. Human erythrocytes then are added and reaction to the antigen–antibody–complement complex with the C3b receptor causes hemagglutination. This method, commonly used as a microtiter procedure, has a well-defined endpoint and is rapid, inexpensive, and more sensitive than CF [
