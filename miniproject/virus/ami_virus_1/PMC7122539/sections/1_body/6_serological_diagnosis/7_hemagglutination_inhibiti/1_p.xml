<p>The hemagglutination-inhibition test (HAI) is based on the ability of some viruses to attach to receptors on certain species of erythrocytes and cause hemagglutination (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec19" ref-type="sec">6.2</xref>). While HAI may be used to identify an unknown virus with virus-specific antisera, it also is useful for the detection of virus-specific antibodies in the serum. HAI may be used to evaluate antibody titers of influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, rubella, arboviruses, and some strains of picornaviruses and noroviruses [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. In this assay, serial dilutions of sera are allowed to react with a defined amount (4 HA units) of viral hemagglutinin. Subsequently, agglutinable RBCs are added and the ability of the virus to agglutinate the RBCs is measured. Properly treated sera containing antibody specific to the virus will prevent agglutination of the RBCs, resulting in formation of RBC buttons in the test wells; sera lacking specific antibody will result in RBC agglutination. Nonspecific viral inhibitors can give rise to false-positive results in some systems, requiring that the sera be properly prepared prior to use. The specificity of the assay varies somewhat with the particular virus, with influenza and parainfluenza virus systems being more specific than the arbovirus system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. For example, the HAI test can identify specific strains of influenza viruses, whereas it identifies only the group-specific antigens of the arboviruses (with neutralization tests required for strain identification). Advantages of the HAI assay are its simplicity, the low cost for reagents and equipment, and speed of the assay. Disadvantages of this assay include the fact that the system only works with those viruses that cause hemagglutination and that nonviral-specific serum components may also inhibit hemagglutination, thereby invalidating the test results.
