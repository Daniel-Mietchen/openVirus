<p>The direct agglutination of sheep or horse RBCs by serum is a diagnostic test for the heterophile antibody of infectious mononucleosis. Removal of an inhibitory (Forssman) antibody by adsorption of the sera with guinea pig kidney extracts is required before testing. The hemolysis of beef cells by sera from patients with acute infectious mononucleosis due to EBV is another diagnostic test that does not require adsorption but is less sensitive (see 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_37).</p>
