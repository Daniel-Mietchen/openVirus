<p>Red blood cells or latex particles can be coated with viral antigens and used to determine the presence or absence of viral antibodies in reactions called passive hemagglutination and passive latex agglutination, respectively. If viral antibodies are present, the antigen-coated red blood cells or latex particles are agglutinated. This assay is subject to a prozone effect, in which an excess of antibody reduces or eliminates agglutination leading to a false-negative result. To circumvent this problem, negative samples can be diluted and the assay repeated. Commercial kits are available for the qualitative identification of antibodies to VZV and rubella virus [
