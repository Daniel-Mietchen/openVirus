<p>Problems specific to serodiagnosis of a viral infection include the broad cross-reactivity among some virus groups, such as the coxsackie A viruses that cross-react with antibodies to coxsackie B and echoviruses. Another serious limitation of this approach to diagnosis is the failure of some individuals, particularly young children or immunocompromised patients, to mount a detectable antibody response to a specific infection. However, serological methods remain extremely important in epidemiologic studies because results are not dependent on obtaining a specimen at the peak of illness, tests can be performed retrospectively for a variety of agents simultaneously, and large-scale studies can be conducted in a timely and cost-effective manner.</p>
