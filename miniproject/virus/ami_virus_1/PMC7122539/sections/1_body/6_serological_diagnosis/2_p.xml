<p>The detection of specific IgM antibody may be used to suggest a recent infection in a single serum specimen. Detection of specific IgM antibody in the neonate is useful to diagnose congenital infections, because maternal IgM antibody does not cross the placenta. IgM antibody also is useful to detect acute disease in a variety of other clinical situations, including infection with CMV, rubella, hepatitis A and B, and EBV. Limitations to the use of IgM detection include the following: (1) IgM-specific antibody is not restricted to primary infection and may be seen with reactivated disease, particularly with herpesviruses such as HSV or varicella–zoster; (2) false-positive responses may occur in the presence of rheumatoid factor or false-negative results from competition by IgG antibody for binding sites on the antigen; (3) IgM antibody may persist for months to a year or more after an infection occurred; and (4) heterotypic reactivation of IgM may be found with some infections (such as CMV or EBV). For example, removal of Coombs antibody from sera is necessary for the EBV–VCA–IgM test; otherwise, false-positive results may arise. Methods useful for the detection of viral-specific IgM will be described below, but, in general, diagnosis using a single IgM sample needs to be carefully controlled to exclude the detection of IgG or other interfering substances.</p>
