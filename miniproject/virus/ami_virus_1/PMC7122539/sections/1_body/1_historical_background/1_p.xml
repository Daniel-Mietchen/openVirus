<p>The recognition of immune-mediated virus neutralization dates back to the late 1800s when Sternberg extended observations of other scientists of the time and described the neutralization of vaccinia infectivity using serum from a recently vaccinated calf [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Immunofluorescent methods for detecting virus antigen were developed in the 1950s by labeling virus-specific antibodies with a fluorescent reporter such as fluorescein isothiocyanate [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] for detecting human plasma insulin, the method was adapted for virus antigen detection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The radioisotope used as a reporter was replaced later during the 1970s with enzymes such as alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase that allowed colorimetric detection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The method was also readily modified (see below) to allow detection of antibody. A further modification of immunoassay detection methods followed with the use of substrates that allowed detection of the antigenâ€“antibody interaction via measurement of a chemiluminescent reaction.
