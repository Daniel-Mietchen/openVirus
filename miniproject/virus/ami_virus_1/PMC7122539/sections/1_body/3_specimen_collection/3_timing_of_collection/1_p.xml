<p>Specimens to be used for virus identification should be obtained early in the course of the illness. For many viral infections, viral shedding begins before the onset of symptoms, peaks during the illness, and disappears around the time that symptoms resolve. There are notable exceptions; enteroviruses and adenoviruses may be shed in the feces for weeks to months, and congenitally acquired CMV is shed in the urine for prolonged periods. Some factors that influence the likelihood of successful virus identification include the type of virus, the site from which the sample was obtained, the test being used, the age of the patient being sampled (e.g., younger children shed influenza viruses longer than adults), and the immune competence of the patient (e.g., immunocompromised hosts shed HSV from genital lesions longer than do immunocompetent adults) [
