<p>A serum sample should be collected early in the course of illness for potential use in identification of a viral infection. For some viral infections, the identification of IgM antibody or the presence of high titers of antibody is sufficient to confirm a virus infection. A second, or convalescent, serum sample should be obtained 2â€“4 weeks later to look for a rise in virus-specific antibody titer.</p>
