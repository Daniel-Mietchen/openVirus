<p>The clinical syndrome caused by a virus and its pathogenesis of infection determine the specimen(s) that is most appropriate for virus identification. Viruses that primarily cause disease at a mucosal surface or cause vesicular skin lesions generally can be identified in specimens taken from those sites. However, viruses causing generalized or congenital disease or causing symptoms in an internal organ (e.g., central nervous system) often can be identified in specimens taken from multiple different sites. Viruses that cause respiratory tract disease such as influenza viruses, RSV, and rhinoviruses are most frequently identified in samples of respiratory secretions; viruses that cause gastroenteritis, such as rotaviruses, caliciviruses, and astroviruses, are identified in fecal specimens; and viruses that cause generalized or congenital diseases, such as measles, CMV, and mumps, are identified from respiratory secretions, urine, and blood. However, antigen detection methods may not be available for some of these different sample types. Furthermore, some samples may be more likely to yield a positive sample than others (e.g., fecal specimen vs. rectal swab for rotavirus and bronchoalveolar lavage for respiratory viruses in immunocompromised patients) [
