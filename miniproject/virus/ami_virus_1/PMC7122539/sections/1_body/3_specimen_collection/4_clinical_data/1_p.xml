<p>Clinical information may be useful in helping one choose the types of diagnostic assays that should be performed on a clinical specimen. The time of year and age of the patient are examples of epidemiologic information that will influence the likelihood of identifying certain viral infections. For example, rotavirus infections occur seasonally and are more common in young children, while norovirus infections often occur in outbreaks and are more common in older individuals. Enteroviruses are the most common cause of viral meningitis and tend to occur seasonally in epidemics, whereas HSV type 1 is the most common cause of sporadic viral meningoencephalitis. Knowledge of the pertinent epidemiologic information will permit the use of appropriate enzyme immunoassays (EIAs), immunofluorescence assays, and other diagnostic methods to identify a potential viral pathogen in the clinical specimen.</p>
