<p>The appropriate collection of specimens is of the utmost importance for the successful identification of viruses in clinical samples. The source of the specimen, the timing of collection in relation to onset of symptoms, the rapidity and method of delivery to the laboratory, and the clinical and epidemiologic data provided to the laboratory all are important variables that relate to the likelihood of successful identification of a viral pathogen. Knowledge of the restrictions of the diagnostic assay to be used is also important; many antigen detection assays are only approved for use when applied to a limited number of clinical sample types. For example, some influenza antigen assays should only be used with nasal swabs while other assays are approved for detection of influenza in a broad array of respiratory samples types, including nasal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swab, throat swab, and bronchoalveolar lavage [
