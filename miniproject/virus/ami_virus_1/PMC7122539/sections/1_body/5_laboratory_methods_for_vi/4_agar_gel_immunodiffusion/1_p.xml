<p>Agar gel immunodiffusion, or agar gel precipitation, has been used for the characterization of a variety of viral antigens using standard, or reference, antisera. A thin layer of agarose is made in a plate or on a slide, and small wells are cut into the agarose. The unknown antigen and known antiserum are placed in separate wells, and the proteins in the wells diffuse through the agarose. If the antiserum reacts with the virus antigen, a precipitation band appears. Though less sensitive than other methods and largely replaced by molecular assays, this method offers high specificity and is simple to perform. It has been used for the identification of orthopoxviruses, typing of influenza viruses, and subtyping of hepatitis B viruses [
