<p>Further characterization of a virus obtained from a clinical specimen is frequently desirable once an agent has been isolated. This can be done in a variety of ways, depending on what is known about the virus and what additional information is being sought. For example, if a previously unrecognized virus is recovered, characterization of its physicochemical as well as biological, antigenic, and genomic properties would be useful. Various immunological methods can be used for this purpose because of the general availability of immune reagents for most human viruses. Immunofluorescence, radioimmunoassay, and enzyme immunoassay formats may be used in a fashion similar to that described for the virus detection in clinical specimens (Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">5</xref>). Other methods for virus identification and characterization include virus neutralization assays, hemagglutination-inhibition assays, and epitope-blocking enzyme immunoassays using monoclonal antibodies.
