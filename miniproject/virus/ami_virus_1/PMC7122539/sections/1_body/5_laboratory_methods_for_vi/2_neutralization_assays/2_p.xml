<p>Pools of virus-specific antisera have been used to decrease the number of neutralization assays needed to serotype enteroviruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Each serum pool contains antisera to a discrete number of enteroviruses, and antiserum to a given enterovirus is present in one to three pools. Thus, the pattern of neutralization obtained from the use of only eight intersecting serum pools allows the identification of 42 different enteroviruses [
