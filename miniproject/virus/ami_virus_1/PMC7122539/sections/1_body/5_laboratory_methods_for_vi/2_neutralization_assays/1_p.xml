<p>Virus neutralization assays detect the loss of virus infectivity that results from the interaction of virus with specific antibody. Unknown viruses may be identified using virus-specific antisera, and antibody to a specific virus present in a serum sample can be detected or quantitated (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec23" ref-type="sec">7.1</xref>). The loss of infectivity can be measured in a number of ways, depending on the biological systems capable of supporting virus growth, the types of viruses being sought, and the capabilities of the laboratory performing the studies. The principal biological systems used for neutralization assays are tissue culture, embryonated chicken eggs, and adult and suckling mice [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Cell culture systems are used most commonly because they support the growth of a large number of viruses, are widely available, are easier to work with than the other two systems, and lack an immune system (that may influence test results). Embryonated henâ€™s eggs and mice are used as for primary isolation. Neutralization cannot be measured for some viruses (e.g., norovirus) because their infectivity cannot be measured in currently available culture systems.
