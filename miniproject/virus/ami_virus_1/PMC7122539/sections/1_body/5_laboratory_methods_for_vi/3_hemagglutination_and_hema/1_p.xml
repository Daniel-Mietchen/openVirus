<p>The ability to agglutinate erythrocytes, a property shared by many viruses, can be used for the identification of some of these viruses. The differential hemagglutination of rat, human group O, and monkey erythrocytes by different adenovirus serotypes allows their separation into groups so that fewer type-specific sera need to be used in neutralization or hemagglutination-inhibition assays [
