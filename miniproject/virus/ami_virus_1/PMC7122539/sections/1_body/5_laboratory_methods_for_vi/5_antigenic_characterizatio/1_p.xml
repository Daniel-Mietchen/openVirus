<p>The antigenic differences or similarities between vaccine and wild-type strains or among virus strains that have been isolated from different geographic locations or at different times may be examined in a number of ways. The availability of monoclonal antibodies permits the examination of these relationships and may detect differences or similarities that cannot be detected by polyclonal antisera [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. These assays examine the ability of a given monoclonal antibody to interact with a particular virus strain and are performed using the same formats used for polyclonal antisera: RIA or EIA, neutralization (if antibody is neutralizing), immunoprecipitation, hemagglutination inhibition (if the virus has hemagglutination activity), and so forth.
