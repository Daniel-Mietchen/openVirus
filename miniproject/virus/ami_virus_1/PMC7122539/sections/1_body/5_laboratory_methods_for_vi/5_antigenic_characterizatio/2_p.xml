<p>Monoclonal antibodies also have been used to map antigenic sites on virus proteins. When a virus is grown in the presence of a monoclonal antibody that normally neutralizes it, the only progeny virus will be escape mutants, or viruses that are no longer neutralized by the antibody. Frequently, escape mutants arise after substitution of a single nucleotide, resulting in a single amino acid change, and the location of the change can be determined by sequencing the virus gene(s) encoding the viral protein(s) important in neutralization (e.g., rotavirus) [

A less precise map of antigenic sites can be obtained through the use of a panel of monoclonal antibodies by determining whether an individual monoclonal antibody competes with other monoclones for an antigenic site and whether the antibody has activity against the escape mutants raised by a different monoclonal antibody [
