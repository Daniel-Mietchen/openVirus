<p>Two major EV-A71 genotypes (B5 and C4) are circulating in Asia. The genotype C1, C4, and C5 were reported to be circulating in Vietnam since 2005 and the dominant genotype of EV-A71 shifted from C5 to C4 in 2011 [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Since the sample size for measuring cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers in our study is small, it would be desirable to collect more sera from young children infected with different EV-A71 genotypes to measure cross-reactive neutralizing antibody titers. Moreover, vaccine candidates using different EV-A71 genotypes are evaluated in clinical trials in different countries (B2 in Singapore, B4 in Taiwan, and C4a in China). It is also critical to monitor cross-reactive neutralizing antibody responses using post-immunization sera collected from young children.
