<p>In Vietnam, EV-A71 was first identified in 2003 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and large-scale epidemics occurred in 2005, 2011 and 2018, respectively [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and over 53,000 hospitalized and 6 fatal cases were reported in the latest outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Genotype C5 and subgenotype C4a viruses were predominant in the 2005 and 2011 EV-A71 epidemics, respectively, and sporadic C5 viruses were also detected in the 2011 epidemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the C4a viruses isolated in 2011 were closely related to two C4a lineages in China, and the C5 viruses were genetically similar with that circulating in Vietnam since 2003 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The widespread EV-A71 infections in 2011 in southern Vietnam resulted in huge disease burden. The study conducted in the largest children hospital in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) identified 443 severe cases with a grade of 2b or higher among 3,791 HFMD patients [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and the report system in Vietnam indicated that a total of 170 cases died from HFMD in 2011 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. After the 2011 epidemic, EV-A71 genotypes in southern Vietnam switched from C4 in 2011 to B5 in early 2013 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Several studies have elucidated virological characteristics of the 2011 EV-A71 epidemic in Vietnam [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], yet seroprevalence data are limited. Therefore, we collected residual sera from 562 non-HFMD inpatients admitted to Children Hospital No. 1 (CH1), HCMC from 2012 to 2013, to determine the seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibodies.
