<p>Among the 553 subjects, 350 (63.3%) were males and 203 (37.7%) were females and age-specific seroprevalence of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody were not significantly different between these two gender groups (all P-values &gt;0.05, see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008124.s001">S1 Table</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008124.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, the age-specific seroprevalences of EV-A71 neutralizing antibody were 14.9% at under 0.5 year, 17.2% at 0.5–0.9 year, 23.5% at 1–1.9 years, 29.4% at 2–2.9 years, 57.6% at 3–3.9 years, 62.3% at 4–4.9 years, 66.1% at 5–5.9 years, 76.5% at 6–6.9 years, 68.6% at 7–7.9 years, 85.7% at 8–8.9 years and 75.5% at over 9 years. The median age of infection (50% seroprevalence) was about 3 years in southern Vietnam, which is much lower than that in Singapore (&gt;17 years) and Taiwan (&gt;15 years) but is higher than that in Cambodia (1.5 years) and similar to China (3.1 years) (
