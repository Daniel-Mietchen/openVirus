<p>The concept of airborne transmission and large droplet transmission is based on droplet size. The classic study of airborne transmission by Wells revealed the relation between droplet size, evaporation, and falling rate. It was determined by studying the evaporation of falling droplets and is referred to as the Wells evaporation-falling curve of droplets. Wells postulated what is now a widely accepted hypothesis of the distinction between droplet size and airborne transmission routes.</p>
