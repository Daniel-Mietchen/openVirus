<p>Other general recommendations include using a unidirectional/displacement ventilation system for a single patient room. It should 
 <italic>not</italic> be used in a multi-bed ward where the potentially aerosol-transmitted infection patient source is unknown as this ventilation system may unintentionally disseminate the infection throughout the ward to other patients. Hence, the situation where such a ventilation system is used needs to be considered carefully. Even though an ideal isolation unit is fitted with a negative-pressure system and sliding glass doors (to reduce airflow generated by traditional hinged doors), it is possibly the movement of people in and out of the room that produces the most significant airflow. Of course, it is impossible to prevent such movement in a health care facility, but reducing the number of times the room is entered or exited can reduce the volume of potentially infected air exchanged across the doorway.
