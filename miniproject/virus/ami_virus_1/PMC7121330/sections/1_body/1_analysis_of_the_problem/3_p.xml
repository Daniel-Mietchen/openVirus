<p>Small droplets start to evaporate after release, and thus change their size resulting in droplet nuclei that are sufficiently small to remain suspended in air for a long time and still be infectious. Large droplets (&gt;100 μm) can settle on the ground before they become droplet nuclei [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00342">2</xref>]. Most respiratory droplets are &lt;100 μm in diameter and evaporate rapidly in the surrounding environment. They become droplet nuclei, which are suspended in the air or are transported away by airflow. The size distribution of droplets is a matter of great debate, but in general various particle sizes are generated: large droplets (&gt;20 μm) that fall directly to the ground or surface; medium-sized particles (5–20 μm), fall at a slower rate or remain temporarily suspended by air currents and evaporate; to become droplet nuclei (aerosol) particles &lt;5 μm in diameter, which remain suspended for longer periods of time [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00344">4</xref>]. The suspension of these droplet nuclei may cause infection over greater distances and increase the duration of infection risk following generation of the initial respiratory aerosol. In addition, the concentration of particles in the secretion and the infectious dose of the pathogen affect the risk of infection. Droplets in the respirable range (~5 μm) may play a significant part in transmission. A few studies have quantified the viral load in droplets or aerosols [
