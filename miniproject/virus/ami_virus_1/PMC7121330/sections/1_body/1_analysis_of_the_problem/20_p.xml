There should be an established lung-protective, low tidal volume strategy for treating patients with acute lung injury or ARDS who require mechanical ventilation. The use of NIV remains controversial. Current infection-control policies that limit or prohibit the use of NIV as a high-risk intervention are based largely on supposition [
