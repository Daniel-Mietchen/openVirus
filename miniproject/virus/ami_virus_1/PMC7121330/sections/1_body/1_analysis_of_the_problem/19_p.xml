<p>The health care environment could be an important reservoir for viruses, bacteria, and fungi during outbreaks, given their proven ability to survive on surfaces and to become airborne. Changes in temperature and humidity in hospitals could have relevance for the viability of microorganisms and their spread to other patients. Adequate ventilation is necessary to dilute the airborne microbial load. Heat and humidity need to be controlled. It is recommended that upper and lower limits for temperature and humidity be specified according to the outbreak pathogen and that air changes at the patient level be tested regularly, especially after any restriction to airflow.</p>
