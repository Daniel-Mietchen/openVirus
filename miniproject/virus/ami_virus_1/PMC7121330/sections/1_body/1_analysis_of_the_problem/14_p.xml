<p>Protection of the HCW during mechanical ventilation includes isolation of infected patients, use of PPE, and strict hand hygiene by all. The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued guidelines that recommend the use of standard, contact, and airborne protection, including respirators of N-95 standard or higher, which filter at least 95 % of particles that are â‰¥1 mm with &lt;10 % face seal air leak. These filters not only protect against virus-transmitted diseases but also against tuberculosis (TB), filtering at least 95 % of the 3- to 5-mm TB bacilli out of the air inhaled by HCWs. The need for N-95 masks depends on the mode of transmission. If transmission is solely by droplet, face shields, eye protection, and surgical masks are adequate. However, if transmission is airborne, N-95 masks should be used. As reviewed earlier, there is evidence that airborne transmission of SARS occurred, at least from the super-spreaders or during aerosol-generating activities such as intubation or suctioning. Knowing that super-spreaders are identified only in retrospect, it may be prudent for workers to wear N-95 masks at all times.</p>
