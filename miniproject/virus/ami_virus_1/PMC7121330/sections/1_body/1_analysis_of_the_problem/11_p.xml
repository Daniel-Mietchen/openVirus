<p>In conclusion, NIV and chest physiotherapy are droplet- (not aerosol-) generating procedures, producing droplets &gt;10 Î¼m. Because of their large mass, most fall on local surfaces within 1 m. The only device producing an aerosol was the nebulizer. The output profile is consistent with nebulizer characteristics rather than dissemination of large droplets from patients. These findings suggest that HCWs who are providing NIV and chest physiotherapy and are working within 1 m of an infected patient should have a high level of respiratory protection. Infection control measures designed to limit aerosol spread (e.g., negative-pressure rooms) may have less relevance.</p>
