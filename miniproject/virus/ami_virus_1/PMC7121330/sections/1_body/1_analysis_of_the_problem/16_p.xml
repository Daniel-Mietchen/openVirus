<p>In view of the high risk of disease transmission during endotracheal intubation, airway management protocols have been proposed: Early intubation should be performed, preferably in the ICU, rather than performing a crash intubation on the ward. Adequate sedation and neuromuscular blockade is recommended during intubation to minimize cough and dispersion of respiratory secretions. Finally, the procedure should be performed by the most experienced person available to minimize the dispersal of infectious particles and reduce the number of individuals exposed during intubation [

Humidification should be done via heat-moisture exchangers with viral-bacterial filter properties rather than heated humidifiers. Each ventilator should have two filters—one between the inspiratory port and ventilator circuit and the other between the expiratory port and ventilator circuit—to provide additional protection from exhaust gases and minimize ventilator contamination [
