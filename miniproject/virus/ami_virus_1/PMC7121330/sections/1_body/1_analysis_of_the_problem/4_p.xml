<p>An observational study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00346">6</xref>] of influenza A and influenza B in exhaled breath showed viral RNA in one-third of infected patients. Also, 99 % of the particles had a diameter &lt;5 Î¼m when sampled during tidal breathing. Although some individuals recover from seasonal or H1N1 influenza after having experienced minimal symptoms, a subgroup of high-risk patients develop complications, including respiratory failure. With the appearance of more pathogenic strains, such as H5N1, respiratory insufficiency may occur in &gt;50 % of those affected. These patients are managed with antiviral therapy and antibiotics for secondary bacterial pneumonia. However, but the mainstay of management is supportive respiratory care, which includes titrated oxygen therapy for hypoxemic patients and ventilatory support for those with respiratory insufficiency [
