<p>Simonds et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003420">20</xref>] evaluated the characteristics of droplet/aerosol dispersion around delivery systems during NIV, O
 <sub>2</sub>, nebulizer treatment, and chest physiotherapy by measuring the droplet size, geographical distribution of droplets, decay in droplets over the time after the intervention was discontinued, and the impact of modifying the NIV circuit in clinical practice. Three groups of patients were studied: normal control subjects; subjects with coryzal symptoms; adults with chronic lung disease who were admitted with an infective exacerbation. Each group received O
 <sub>2</sub>, NIV using a vented mask system, and a modified circuit with a nonvented mask and an exhalation filter. All received nebulized saline and a period of standardized chest physiotherapy. Droplet counts in mean diameter sizes ranging from 0.3 to &gt;10.0 μm were measured with a counter placed adjacent to the face and at 1 m distance from the patient at the height of the nose/mouth of an average HCW. NIV using a vented mask produce large droplets (&gt;10 μm) in patients (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.042) and coryzal subjects (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.044) compared with baseline values but not in normal controls (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.379). This increase in large droplets was not seen using the NIV circuit modification. Chest physiotherapy produced droplets predominantly &gt;10 μm (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), with the droplet count (as in the NIV patients) falling significantly by 1 m. O
 <sub>2</sub> did not increase the droplet count in any size range. Nebulized saline delivered droplets in the small and medium size aerosol/droplet range, in keeping with the specified performance characteristics of the device, but did not increase the large-droplet count. Preliminary analyses suggest that droplet counts fall to within a baseline range within 20–40 min of discontinuing the NIV and chest physiotherapy.
