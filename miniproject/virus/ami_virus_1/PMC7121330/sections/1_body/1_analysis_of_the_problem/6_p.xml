<p>Some medical procedures have been termed aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs) as their most common feature is that they are associated with high or augmented inspiratory and expiratory tidal flows, which may increase viral aerosol dissemination. The list of AGPs [

Certain other procedures, such as delivery of nebulized medication therapy and high-flow O
