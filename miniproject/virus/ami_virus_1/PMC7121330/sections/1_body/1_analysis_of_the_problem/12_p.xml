<p>Tran et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003421">21</xref>] systematically reviewed the literature regarding the risk of transmitting acute respiratory infections to HCWs exposed to patients undergoing an AGP compared with the risk of transmission to HCWs caring for patients not undergoing an AGP. The outcome of interest was the risk of acute respiratory infection. They identified five case–control and five retrospective cohort studies that evaluated transmission of SARS to HCWs. The procedures reported to present an increased risk of transmission included tracheal intubation [
 <italic>n</italic> = 4, cohort: odds ratio (OR) 6.6 (2.3–18.9); 
 <italic>n</italic> = 4, case–control study: OR 6.6 (4.1–10.6)] and NIV [
 <italic>n</italic> = 2, cohort: OR 3.1 (1.4–6.8)]; tracheotomy [
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, case-control: OR 4.2 (1.5–11.5)]; and manual ventilation before intubation [
 <italic>n</italic> = 1, cohort: OR 2.8 (1.3–6.4)]. Other intubation-associated procedures, endotracheal aspiration, suction of body fluids, bronchoscopy, nebulizer treatment, administration of O
 <sub>2</sub>, high-flow O
 <sub>2</sub>, manipulation of O
 <sub>2</sub> masks or bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi-PAP) masks, defibrillation, chest compression, insertion of a nasogastric tube, and collection of sputum were not significant. These findings suggest that some procedures potentially capable of generating aerosols have been associated with increased risk of SARS transmission to HCWs or were a risk factor for transmission. The most consistent association across multiple studies was tracheal intubation. The results of this report should not be generalized to all acute respiratory infections because the evidence available is strictly limited to SARS.
