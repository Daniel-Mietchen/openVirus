<p>There is additional evidence concerning AGPs and the risk they present to HCWs. Experimental studies that have investigated airflows around oxygen masks and during NIV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003416">16</xref>] examined smoke particle dispersion from the lungs of a human simulation model receiving oxygen therapy, frequently used in the treatment of patients with respiratory failure. The authors found that a jet plume of smoke could be generated from exhaust holes up to 0.45 m from the mask. Although this model provides a visual image of smoke aerosol behavior, and the possible zone of transmission risk, it is not necessarily representative of the behavior of a respiratory aerosol and infectious particles contained therein.
