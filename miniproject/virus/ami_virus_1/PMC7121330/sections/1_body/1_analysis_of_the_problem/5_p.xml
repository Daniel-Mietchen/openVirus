<p>In contrast to the situation regarding severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or tuberculosis prevention in HCWs, little attention has been given to the importance of HCWs personal protective equipment (PPE) (gowns, gloves, masks) for prevention and management of influenza. This situation has arisen because vaccination of HCWs has been shown to reduce or prevent nosocomial transmission. It seems prudent for nonvaccinated workers to wear N-95 masks, particularly during high-risk procedures or with very ill patients. There is limited evidence that upper-air ultraviolet light is effective in reducing influenza transmission rates.</p>
