<p>Noninvasive ventilation and continuous positive airway pressure are likely to play a minor role in the management of moderate to severe acute lung injury caused by influenza or secondary bacterial pneumonia, or in patients with multisystem failure. However, NIV was used successfully in some SARS cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003422">22</xref>]. There is also potential for NIV to reduce the need for intubation in patients with influenza pneumonia or chronic respiratory disease, facilitate extubation, and widen the provision of ventilator support outside the intensive care unit (ICU). It may also be used as ventilator care in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive cardiac failure, and other serious co-morbidities. NIV is sometimes used to palliate symptoms in those with end-stage disease in whom ICU admission is not indicated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003423">23</xref>]. These indications should be set against the risk of droplet dissemination during the delivery of NIV. Despite the study of Simonds et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003420">20</xref>], which indicated that NIV generates large droplets adjacent to the patient that fall significantly at 1 m from the patient, and that adding a circuit using a nonvented mask plus a filtered exhalate reduces the number of large droplets produced, there is still concern about dispersion of infectious particles. Nevertheless, in a Hong Kong hospital where more than 20 patients were placed on noninvasive positive ventilation, all HCWs on the ward performed meticulous infection-control procedures and used PPE. Despite the intense exposure, none became infected with SARS [
