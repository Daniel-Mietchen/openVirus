<p>Much of the evidence for the link between AGPs and increased transmission of respiratory viral infection was generated during the SARS epidemic. In Toronto, China, and Singapore, HCWs constituted approximately 20 % of the critical care cases. Infection rates were higher in doctors and nurses carrying out endotracheal intubation [relative risk (RR) 13.29, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 2.99–54.04, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.03], and nurses caring for SARS patients receiving NIV may have been at increased risk (RR 2.23), but these findings did not reach significance [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.25–21.76, 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.5] [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR00349">9</xref>] showed an increased risk associated with the index patient requiring oxygen or bilevel NIV. Case reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003411">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR003412">12</xref>] have also linked transmission of infection to nebulizer use in the index patient. However, patient variables are also important factors to consider: Sicker patients have a higher viral load and are more likely to require oxygen and ventilator support, and those with underlying asthma require nebulizer therapy and cough more because of airway hyperreactivity. Both settings increase the risk of aerosol transmission.
