<p>In [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], the authors have considered the model (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">9.5</xref>) with 
 <italic>α =</italic> 1.5 and 
 <italic>β =</italic> 50 (these numbers are chosen so that the probabilities 
 <italic>x</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> stay positive and less than or equal to 1) and performed some numerical calculations. Since the true equation of state for the H5N1 virus is unknown, it is assumed that the hygienic stress coefficient is a monotone function of the infection rate 
 <italic>a</italic>. Further model (
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">9.5</xref>) reduces to (
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">9.4</xref>) when 
 <italic>y</italic> vanishes. Computer experiments have revealed that the infection probability is reduced by the hygienic stress and the onset of chaos is earlier as without any hygienic stress. The bifurcation diagrams that explain the spread of avian influenza H5N1 in respect of three specifically chosen stress functions, (
 <italic>y =</italic> 0.0
 <italic>, y =</italic> 0.07
 <italic>,</italic> and 
 <italic>y =</italic> 0.1, 1.0) are presented in Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">9.3</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">9.4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">9.5</xref>, and 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">9.6</xref> (Bifurcation diagrams for the spread of avian influenza). For a detailed discussion on these numerics we refer the readers to Eifert et al. [
