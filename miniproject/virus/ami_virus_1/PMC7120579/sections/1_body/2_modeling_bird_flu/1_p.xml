<p>During the last decade, various mathematical models have been used for infectious diseases in general and for influenza in particular. In case of avian influenza, deterministic models were used for comparing interventions aimed at preventing and controlling influenza pandemics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and stochastic model were proposed to model and predict the worldwide spread of pandemic influenza [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] and (3) the statistical transmission model of bird flu taking into account the factors that affect the epidemic transmission such as source of infection, social and natural factors [
