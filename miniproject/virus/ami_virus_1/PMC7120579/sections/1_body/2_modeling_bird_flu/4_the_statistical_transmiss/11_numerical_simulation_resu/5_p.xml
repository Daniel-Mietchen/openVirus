<p>Simulation results are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">9.1</xref>. It is clear from the table that the probability of new outbreak to occur decreases with the increase of distance from the source countries. The probability of occurrence of outbreak in India is very low because the flu virus reaches on the sixth day and also the country is far from the source country. The probability of occurrence of outbreak in Indonesia is also very low even on the second day. This is due to very large distance from the source country and also due to some other factors (like temperature). Figures 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">9.7</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">9.8</xref> show the pattern that the probability of outbreak to take place follows, depending upon the distance and number of days. These graphs show that the probability of outbreak is inversely proportional to the distance from the source country as well as the day on which the flu virus reaches the country.
