<p>In our model, there are six parameters 
 <italic>β</italic>, 
 <italic>A</italic>, 
 <italic>b</italic>,  
 <italic>B</italic>,  
 <italic>C</italic>,  
 <italic>S</italic> which are all adjustable. So one may argue that too many adjustable parameters may not be an advantage for a “good” model. However, we must analyze independence of these parameters. Here 
 <italic>S</italic> is not an independent parameter, rather dependent on 
 <italic>f</italic>(
 <italic>r</italic>), hence on 
 <italic>β</italic>. Parameter 
 <italic>A</italic> controls the initial possible number of outbreaks the epidemic may abort if 
 <italic>A</italic> is too small and overflow if 
 <italic>A</italic> is large. So there shall be a proper intermediate value for 
 <italic>A</italic>. The parameter 
 <italic>b</italic> denotes the general trend of the outbreaks, the total number of outbreaks will grow too rapidly to be practical if 
 <italic>b</italic> is a big number and may be too flat if 
 <italic>b</italic> is too small. 
 <italic>B</italic> determines the ultimate resistibility, which reflects the final degree of stringency of artificial interventions; the greater 
 <italic>B</italic> is the more stringent the interventions are. As of 
 <italic>C</italic>, it reflects the average degree of stringency throughout the epidemics; the smaller 
 <italic>C</italic> is the more stringent the control measures are. In other words, 
 <italic>B</italic> determines the final height of the curve 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>n</italic>) and 
 <italic>C</italic> controls the shape or the process of 
 <italic>I</italic>(
 <italic>n</italic>). Therefore each parameter has a definite meaning and a specific role and has little overlap regarding the role, so the model is reasonable. For conducting simulations we have assumed distances &lt;500 miles as 10 units, &lt;500–1000 miles as 11 units, &lt;1000–1500 miles as 12 units, and &lt;1500–2000 miles as 13 units and so on.
