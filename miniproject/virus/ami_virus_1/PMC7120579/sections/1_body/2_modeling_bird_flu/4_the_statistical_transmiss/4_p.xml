<p>How do these factors affect the transmission? The infected animals are the source of the infection, higher air temperature can drastically cut down the lifetime of the virus, and transportation of infected poultry is the route of transmission. Control measures such as active and effective actions play important role in preventing and destroying the epidemics, which can effectively block the route of transmission of the infection, diminish the source of infection and promote the resistibility of susceptible poultry. So we must take all the major factors into account in the formulation of our transmission model.</p>
