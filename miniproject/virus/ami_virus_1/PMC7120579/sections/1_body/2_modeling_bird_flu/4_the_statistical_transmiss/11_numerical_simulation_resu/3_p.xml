<p>It is easy to see that the simulation is roughly in accordance with the actual situation. The parameters related to the artificial interventions include 
 <italic>B</italic> and 
 <italic>C</italic>. If 
 <italic>B</italic> is big enough, few times can the epidemic take place in most simulations; if 
 <italic>B</italic> is very small, the epidemic can always happen and most times the overflow can happen. As for 
 <italic>C</italic>, if it is small enough, the epidemic hardly occurs, otherwise it can almost happen. Therefore the effective, powerful, and stringent control measures are the key to stop the epidemics.
