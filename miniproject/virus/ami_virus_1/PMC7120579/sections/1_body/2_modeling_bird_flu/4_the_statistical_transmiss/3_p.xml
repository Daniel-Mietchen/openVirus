<p>We know the major factors that play an important role in the transmission of bird flu are the way the infected poultry products are transported, air temperature, the control measures (for example, culling the poultry in the infected form, introducing compulsory vaccination to enhance the resistibility of poultry in the noninfected farms forbidding live birds being sold under crowded and unsanitary conditions), migratory birds, and other infected transportation vehicles (which means the vehicles carry infected poultry or bird dropping or contaminated soil, etc.). Also there are some other factors not considered in our model viz. bird flu transmitting to human beings and virus of low pathogenicity mutating into high pathogenicity after some time, since these elements will not contribute much to the usual transmission of bird flu.</p>
