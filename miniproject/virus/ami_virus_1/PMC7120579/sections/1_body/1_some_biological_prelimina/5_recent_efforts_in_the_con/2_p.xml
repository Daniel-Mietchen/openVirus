<p>There has been a surge of interest in sensitive specific and rapid detection of avian Influenza virus in recent years and this helps one to find effective diagnosis and disease surveillance. Studies that aim at the detection of viruses by fluorescent DNA barcode-based immunoassay are available in the literature. It has been established that sensitivity of detection is comparable to conventional RT-PCR. For details we refer the readers to Cao et al. ([
