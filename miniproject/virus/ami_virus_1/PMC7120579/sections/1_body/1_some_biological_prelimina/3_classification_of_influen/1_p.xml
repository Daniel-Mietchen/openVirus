<p>In general the influenza virus or flu virus can be classified into three categories: types A, B, and C which are distinguished by differences in two major internal proteins. Influenza virus type A is the most significant epidemiologically and the most interesting from an ecological and evolutionary stand point, because it is found in a wide variety of bird and mammal species [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>] and can undergo major shifts in immunological properties. Type B is largely confined to humans and very little is known about type C. Type A virus is responsible for causing Bird Flu, which was first found in Italy in 1878. Type A virus is further divided into subtypes based on differences in membrane proteins HA and NA, which are the most important targets for the immune system. The notation HhNn is used to refer to the subtype comprising the hth discovered HA proteins and the nth discovered NA protein. The subtype H5N1 virus of type A virus is the main cause of the bird flu [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. Subtype is further divided into strains; each genetically distinct virus isolated is usually considered to be a separate strain [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. There are 16 types of HA surface proteins (which are named H1, H2, H3,…,H16) and nine types of NA surface proteins (which are named N1, N2,…,N9). An influenza virus always has one type of HA surface protein and one NA surface protein and it could be of any combination of H and N, e.g., H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, H5N2, H5N8, and so on [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Within these subtypes, some viruses with slightly different nucleotide sequences are present and are classified into strains. The most virulent form so far reported is H5N1 of Influenza virus.
