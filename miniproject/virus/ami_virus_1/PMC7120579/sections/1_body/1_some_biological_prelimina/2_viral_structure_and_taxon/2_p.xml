<p>The Avian influenza virus (AIV) contains negative (−) sense RNA as genetic material enters the host cell by attachment to the cell surface. Its hemagglutinin binds with the sialic acid present on glycoprotein receptors of the host. After adsorption, it is internalized as an endosome due to the acidic environment of the host cell. Influenza viruses are pleomorphic, mostly spherical or ovoid and filamentous, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) enveloped viruses with a helical symmetry. They are covered over by lipid/lipoprotein envelope. The viral envelope has lipoprotein membranes that enclose nucleocapsids and nucleoproteins. It is endowed with an inherent capacity for genetic variation and is based on two important features: (1) the presence of a segmented genome, with 8 RNA segments that are genetically independent of each other and (2) a high rate of mutation, especially in the surface hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins. The diameter of each enveloped virus ranges from 50–120 nm and filamentous virions are 20 nm in diameter and 200–300 nm long. The genome is in the form of eight negative sense ssRNA fragments. The genome entire length is 12,000–15,000 nucleotides, the largest segment being 23–25 and the smallest being 800–900 nt. The longest RNA strand is closely associated with the nucleoprotein to form helical symmetry (see Fig.
