<p>There are some 500 distinct spike-like surface proteins of the viral envelope, each projecting 10–14 nm from the surface. There are mainly four types of glycoproteins/antigens:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>Hemagglutinin (HA) There are 16 types of HA reported.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Neuraminidase (NA) There are nine types have been reported. The ratio of HA to NA is about 4–5 to 1.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Nucleocapsid protein (NP) It coats the RNA strands.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Matrix protein (M) The inner side of the viral envelope is lined by the matrix protein.</p>
  </list-item>
