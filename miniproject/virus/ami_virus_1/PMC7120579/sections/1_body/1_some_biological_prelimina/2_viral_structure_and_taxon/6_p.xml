<p>The virus loses its envelope in the cytoplasm, and the remaining core moves to the nucleus. Viral proteins are made in the cytoplasm using the host cell’s ribosome. In the cell cytoplasm the virus releases its nucleocapsids that further are transported into the nucleus, where mRNA synthesis and replication occurs. Once it enters the nucleus, viral endonuclease snips off. This snipped part of the host mRNA is used as a primer by the virus to synthesize its own mRNA. Next, viral RNA polymerase further extends the primer and makes a complementary (mirror image) plus (+) strand mRNA. Transcription results in eight primary transcripts/pre-mRNA that are further translated in the cytoplasm. The cells treat the viral mRNA like their normal mRNA and use them to make copies of viral proteins. The virus RNA is transcribed to messenger RNA in the nucleus. RNA replication occurs in the nucleus with the help of viral RNA polymerase that was also involved in transcription (see Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">9.2</xref>). In the same manner, the (+) strand of RNA (e.g., cRNA) is synthesized, and is coated with nucleocapsid proteins soon after it is made. This plus strand is then used as a template to synthesize a new negative RNA strand followed by coating with nucleocapsid proteins. These can further serve as templates for replication, mRNA synthesis, or packaging into virion particles. The (−) strand RNA (e.g., vRNA) are transported into the cytoplasm, where other viral proteins assemble together and are packed into virion particles and, on maturity, buds off from the outer cell membrane and infect new cells.
