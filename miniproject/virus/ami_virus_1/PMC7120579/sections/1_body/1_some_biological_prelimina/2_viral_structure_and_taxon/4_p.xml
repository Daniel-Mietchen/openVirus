<p>In Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">9.1</xref>, eight ribonucleoprotein segments (RNP) are surrounded by layer of matrix (M1) protein and lipid bilayer taken from host cell at budding. NS2 (NEP) protein is associated with M1. Three viral proteins are incorporated into the lipid bilayer: HA, NA, and M2 protein. HA trimers and NA tetramers form spikes on the surface of the virion. RNP segments contain viral RNA surrounded by nucleoprotein and associated with the polymerase complex [
