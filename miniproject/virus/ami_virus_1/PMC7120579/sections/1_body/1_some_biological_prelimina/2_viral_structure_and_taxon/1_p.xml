<p>A virus, (an infectious agent that has DNA or RNA and protective covering) is a submicroscopic acellular particle that cannot survive in the absence of a living host cell. It relies on the host cell to replicate and cannot reproduce on its own. Since an antibiotic do not harm a virus, treatment for viral diseases such as flu mainly helps ease the symptoms rather than to kill the viruses. Most viruses cause generally mild diseases like the common cold and some even do not cause any symptom and may go unnoticed, but some cause diseases that can be severe and deadly like Avian influenza, AIDS, SARS, and some form of cancer [
