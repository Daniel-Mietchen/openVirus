<p>Infection with bird flu viruses in domestic poultry causes two main forms of disease that are distinguished by low and high extremes of virulence. The “
 <italic>low pathogenic</italic>” form may go undetected and usually causes only mild symptoms (such as ruffled feathers). However, the highly pathogenic form spreads more rapidly through flocks of poultry. This form may cause diseases that affect multiple internal organs and has a mortality rate that reaches 90–100 % often within 48 h [
