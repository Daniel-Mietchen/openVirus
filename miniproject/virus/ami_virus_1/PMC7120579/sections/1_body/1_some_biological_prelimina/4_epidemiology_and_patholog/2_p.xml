<p>The Avian Influenza virus (AIV) refers to Influenza A, found chiefly in birds. Infected birds show clinical symptoms like a sudden drop in egg production, brittle or soft-shelled and even shell-less eggs, congestion, swollen wattles and combs, and swollen skin under the eyes. The risk of human infection from birds is through coming in close contact with bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces. Infection can be transmitted from infected bird droppings, saliva, nasal secretions, feces, or blood. These viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature or a month at 32 °F, and can survive at very low temperatures indefinitely. Symptoms of avian influenza in infected humans are mild fever, myalgia, myositis, and myoglobinuria. However, sore throat, cough, conjunctivitis; some people develop life-threatening complications like respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and multiorgan failure.</p>
