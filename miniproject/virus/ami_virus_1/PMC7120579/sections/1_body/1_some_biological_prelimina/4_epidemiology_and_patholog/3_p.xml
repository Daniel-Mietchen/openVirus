<p>In 1997, the first documented infection of humans with an avian influenza virus occurred in Hong Kong. At the same time, the poultry population in Hong Kong was also found to be infected with avian influenza caused by the same pathogenic strain. Studies determined that the infection occurred when the virus jumped directly from birds to humans due to close contact with infected poultry. A pandemic was averted by rapid mass killing/burning of over a million birds—the entire poultry population of Hong Kong [

Between April and June 2005, a large number of wild water birds at Qinghai Lake in western China perished after being infected by the virus. During, July–August 2005, outbreaks involving virus were reported from Mongolia, Siberia, and Kazakhstan. The virus reached Turkey, Croatia, Romania, and Greece by October 2005. Ukraine reported outbreaks in November 2005. RnH5N1 viruses also have been isolated from ducks in Southern China [

In early February 2006 Nigeria became the first African nation to report the bird flu virus, with an outbreak at a large commercial poultry farm. In February 2006, many European countries, Egypt, and Iran found wild birds infected with H5N1 virus [

People are not immune to these different strains. Generally speaking, an individual has immunity to only those microbes or viruses to which they are earlier exposed. The possibility of dreadful new strains is thus worrying, as people either have no immunity or extremely delayed immunity depending upon the individual’s health and age. However, many new harmless strains causing symptomless infections go unnoticed. It was noticed that Spanish flu was most lethal in young adults, who generally are most able to fight off severe infections. One theory why Spanish flu preferentially killed young people is because they are the one with robust and reactive immune systems and therefore were most likely to mount a self-destructive response.
