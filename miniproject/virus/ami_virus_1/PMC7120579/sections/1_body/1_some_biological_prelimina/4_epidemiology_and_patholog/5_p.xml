<p>Generally, the virus resides in bird droppings, contaminated soil, and airborne virus. Contaminated equipments, vehicles, food, cages, and clothing like shoes can carry the viruses from farm to farm. Some evidence suggests that flies can also act as mechanical vectors [

 <italic>.</italic> Wet markets where live birds are sold under crowded and sometimes unsanitary conditions can be another source of spread. These constitute the main cause of the former transmission. Export and import of poultry products are the main cause of the latter transmission, since they can carry the viruses for long distances freely when artificial factors are prevented. Migratory birds can also be a cause of transmission among the countries [

Efforts have been made on the study of avian influenza and most of the recent papers focus on topics such as the route of transmission and physiological and biological properties. The bird flu virus of low pathogenicity can mutate into highly pathogenic one after a short time; the virus is sensitive to temperature change (it was found that the virus survives for shorter time at a higher temperature). This kind of influenza is able to transmit to humans under some circumstances; however no sufficient and clear evidences of human-to-human transmission are be found up to now [
