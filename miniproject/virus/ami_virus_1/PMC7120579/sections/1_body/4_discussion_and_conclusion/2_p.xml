<p>Our ongoing investigations relate to the question as how to assess the actual control measures and assign the parameters in the model with proper numerical values. There is a need to strengthen the design of data collection and for advanced experimental facilities to understand the virus spread with respect to all seasons and food consumption patterns. Given the present situation, it is not easy for any government to predict accurately the timing and location of future avian influenza attacks; there is a vide scope to strengthen the databanks and to train relief teams to minimize economic loss, in the event that an outbreak occurs [

To complement these issues with public health side of research activities, the government could consider launching large-scale experimental projects to estimate various rates of spread of H5N1 in different geographical regions, and to come up with a comprehensive approach for effective control of an outbreak. Further modeling work is needed in order to explore the epidemiological dynamics and persistence of avian influenza viruses, with a view to understanding the respective roles of environmental transmission and demographic stochasticity.
