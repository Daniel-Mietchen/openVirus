<p>Bird flu is a highly pathogenic epidemic that can result in serious disaster in many areas. Immediate and effective control measures are of great importance in preventing the transmission of avian influenza. So it is challenging to study the problem from various angles, and develop deterministic, discrete and statistical-mathematical transmission models. Using mathematical modeling, Breban et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have investigated the role of environmental transmission for the pattern and persistence of avian influenza in wild waterfowl and demonstrated that indeed environmental transmission is a fundamental ingredient for the modeling of this epidemic. The persistence mechanism induced by environmental transmission raises novel problems of epidemic control since traditional strategies may prove ineffective in the presence of an environmental viral reservoir [

For a global outbreak of influenza to occur, three conditions must be met: a new virus subtype must arise, this subtype must be able to cause serious illness in the human, and it must spread easily from person to person- and continue to do so. The first two conditions have been met with H5N1 human infections. Scientists are working for better understanding of different influenza A strains with the hope of preventing the spread of this virus. One of the reasons for the difficulty in predicting outbreaks is that migratory wild birds, not virus infected human carry the H5N1 virus long distance [
