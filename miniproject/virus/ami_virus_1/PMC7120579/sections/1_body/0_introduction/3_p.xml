<p>Influenza A in humans is mainly a respiratory virus that typically infects cells of the nose and throat, but it can infect lung cells. It spreads when an uninfected person touches contaminated surfaces or inhales viruses coughed or sneezed out by an infected person. The recent avian strain that has been infecting humans is called H5N1 (named for its surface glycoproteins). H5N1 kills a high percentage of people who become infected, but thus far, the virus does not seem to spread well from person to person. Scientists fear that a person already infected with a human influenza A virus may become infected with the avian influenza A. If infected with both viruses, a hybrid avianâ€“human influenza A virus may be generated that has two features making it particularly dangerous for human: avian H and N glycoproteins, to which humans have never been exposed (thus the immune system cannot quickly recognize and control the virus), and RNA from the human virus (enabling the hybrid to spread easily from person to person).</p>
