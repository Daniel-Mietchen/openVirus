<p>In this chapter, we investigate the spread and outbreak dynamics of low pathogenic avian influenza virus. Avian Influenza, commonly known as Bird Flu, is an epidemic caused by H5N1 Virus, that primarily affects birds such as chickens, wild water birds, ducks, and swans etc. On rare occasions, pigs and humans will also be affected with this virus. Migratory aquatic birds, most notably wild ducks, are the natural reservoir of avian influenza viruses that inhabit the intestines of these birds. Infection in domestic poultry is thought to occur due to contact with these aquatic/wild birds. Fifteen subtypes of influenza virus are known to infect birds, providing a large pool of influenza viruses potentially circulating in bird populations. Avian Influenza is an infection caused by a virus known as 
 <italic>orthomyxoviridae</italic> in virus classification. Influenza virus has only one species in it, which is called influenza A virus. Influenza A infects humans and animals such as birds, pigs, horses, and seals. When it infects birds, it is called avian influenza; when it infects pigs, it is called swine influenza, and so on. Typically, avian influenza viruses occur naturally among birds. But occasionally, avian influenza infects humans who have been in close contact with birds, with a rich pool of genetic and antigenic diversity that often leads to cross-species transmission. Wild birds worldwide carry these viruses in their intestine but usually do not get sick from them. However avian influenza is very contagious among birds and can make some domesticated birds including chickens, ducks, and turkeys very sick and kill them. Infected birds shed influenza viruses in their saliva, nasal secretions, etc. Susceptible birds become infected when they come in contact with the contaminated surfaces. Domesticated birds may become infected with avian influenza viruses through direct contact with infected waterfowl or other infected poultry or through contact with surfaces (such as dirt or cages) or materials (such as water or food) that have been contaminated with the virus [
