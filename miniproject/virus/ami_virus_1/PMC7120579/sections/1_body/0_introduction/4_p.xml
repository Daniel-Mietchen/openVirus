<p>An outbreak of influenza A (H5N1) has been reported in several countries throughout Asia. Cases of Avian influenza A in birds have been confirmed in Cambodia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Laos, Pakistan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Human cases of avian influenza have been reported in Thailand and Vietnam. During this outbreak investigation, it has been determined that avian influenza is spread from person to person. The current outbreak of avian influenza has prompted the killing of more than 25 million birds in Asia. In general the outbreak of an infectious disease is dependent upon three necessary conditions as the source of an infection, the route of transmission, and the herd susceptibility [

Other social and natural factors also play an important role in the transmission of infection, for example the control measures and the change in temperature. The source of infection that led to the outbreak is not clear. In some researcher’s view migratory birds are thought to be carrying the virus [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. If migratory birds had brought the virus one would have expected outbreaks well before February as bird migrations were over by around November. So we consider in our problem the source of outbreaks of bird flu to be the transportation of infected poultry as globalization has turned the chicken into the world’s number one migratory bird species. We have assumed that it is mainly due to the human activities of commerce and trade that spread this epidemic. We acquired some important information about bird flu such as the virus H5N1 is sensitive to temperature changes and the virus survives for shorter time at a high temperature. Also there are many effective control measures to block the virus transmission such as compulsory vaccination, culling of all infected or exposed birds [
