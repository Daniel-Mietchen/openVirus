<p>In the new millennium, the world has seen the emergence of three novel human respiratory viruses: SARS virus (a novel corona virus) in 2003, Avian Influenza virus (H5N1) in 2004 and an international outbreak caused by a new strain of influenza virus 2009 A (H1N1). This novel influenza 2009 A/H1N1 virus contains a combination of swine, avian, and human influenza virus genes. In sharp contrast to H5N1 and SARS viruses which emerged from the Asian continent, H1N1 virus emerged from North America (Mexico). Many important infectious diseases persist on a knife-edge: rapid rates of transmission coupled with brief infectious periods generate boom-and-bust epidemic that court extinction [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>], and pertussis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>], among others. Several distinct mechanisms have been proposed to explain the spread and outbreak dynamics of avian influenza virus. These examples illustrate the need for understanding alternative spread and reinvasion mechanisms of infectious diseases for effective management and control.
