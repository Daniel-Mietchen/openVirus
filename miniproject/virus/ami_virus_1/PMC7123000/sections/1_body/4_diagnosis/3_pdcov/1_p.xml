<p id="Par57">Selective laboratory assays must be opted to distinguish PDCoV infection from related PEDV, TGEV and RV infections. The methodologies discussed for TGEV and PEDV apply to PDCoV diagnosis. The confirmatory finding of PDCoV infection incorporates detection of PDCoV RNA or antigens in the faeces or intestinal substance/tissues. Diagnosis can also be made utilising RT-PCR assays that target a conserved region of PDCoV M or N genes (Marthaler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">2014b</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">2014c</xref>), IF or IHC using virus-specific MAbs or polyclonal antibodies (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>; Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>), and in situ hybridisation (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>). A duplex real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of PDCoV and/or differentiation from PEDV in intestines and faeces was developed (Zhang et al.
