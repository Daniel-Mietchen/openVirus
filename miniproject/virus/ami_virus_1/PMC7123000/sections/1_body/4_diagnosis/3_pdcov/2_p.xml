<p id="Par58">Direct EM can be used to display PDCoV viral particles in faeces from diarrhoeic pigs. However, IEM use must distinguish PDCoV from PEDV or TGEV (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2015a</xref>) using hyperimmune or convalescent sera. However isolation of PDCoV has been attempted with limited success in LLC-PK or ST cells, except in few strains (OH-FD22) (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2015</xref>). The other serologic assays in use for the diagnosis of PDCoV are IF, VN and ELISA. Serum and milk PDCoV antibodies of different isotypes have been quantified using ELISA based on cell culture virus antigen (Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2016</xref>) or S1 and N viral proteins (Thachil et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2015</xref>; Okda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">2016</xref>; Su et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2016</xref>).
