<p id="Par52">As for TGEV, diagnosis of PEDV must be based on clinical signs and lab identification of viral RNA, viral antigens or increased PEDV-species antibodies. For the location of PEDV RNA, the most broadly utilised lab technique is conventional PCR (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2001</xref>; Ishikawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1997</xref>) or real-time RT-PCR (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2007</xref>), which is sensitive, specific and rapid for the detection of viral RNA in different clinical samples. Although loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays (Ren and Li 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">2011</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">2015</xref>) are recognised more recently as highly sensitive in detecting PEDV RNA, they have still not reached diagnostic labs. In situ hybridisation can be utilised to recognise PEDV RNA in fixed tissues (Stadler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2015</xref>).
