<p id="Par56">Overall, use of a laboratory test is suggested which must differentiate PEDV infections from TGEV, SeCoV and PDCoV. Especially for SeCoV that is a recombinant of TGEV (backbone) and PEDV (S protein), a selective assay based on detecting TGEV (any gene aside from S gene) and PEDV (S gene) would be preferred.</p>
