<p id="Par53">Direct display of PEDV and additionally its antigens is done utilising IF or IHC tests on the small intestinal tissues of piglets euthanised close to the onset of diarrhoea and before the desquamation of enterocytes. The virus particles can be shown in direct EM or IEM on diarrhoeic pig faeces. However, IEM must be used to distinguish PEDV from other CoVs, viz. TGEV and PDCoV, as all CoVs possess indistinguishable morphology.</p>
