<p id="Par55">Paired serum samples are requisite for serologic diagnosis of endemic PEDV. Recently, IgG and IgA antibodies to PEDV are observed in oral fluids, suggesting that they may be appropriate to monitor prior herd exposure to PEDV (Bjustrom-Kraft et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2016</xref>). PEDV antibodies have been demonstrated using indirect ELISAs based on the whole cell-culture-adapted virus antigens (Carvajal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>; Hofmann and Wyler 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1990</xref>; Kweon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">1994</xref>; Thomas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2015</xref>), S/N viral proteins extracted from infected Vero cells (Knuchel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">1992</xref>; Oh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2005</xref>) or bacteria or mammalian expression systems (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2015</xref>; Gerber et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2014</xref>; Gerber and Opriessnig 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2015</xref>; Okda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2015</xref>; Paudel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2014</xref>). Blocking and competitive ELISAs have additionally been used for the detection of PEDV antibodies utilising MAbs or polyclonal antibodies (Carvajal et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1995</xref>; Okda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2015</xref>; van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">1991</xref>). Serum IgG antibodies against the N proteins of PEDV can be detected by 9â€“14 dpi; they peak around 21 dpi and then decline gradually (Okda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2015</xref>). The VN test in Vero cell culture is used to assess VN antibodies to PEDV (Thomas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2015</xref>; Okda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2015</xref>; Paudel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2014</xref>). These serological assays have generally been employed to screen prior exposure to the virus and to assess the viability of vaccines.
