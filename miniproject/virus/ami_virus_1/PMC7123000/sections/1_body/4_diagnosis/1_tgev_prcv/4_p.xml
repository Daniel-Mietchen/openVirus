<p id="Par47">A mono- or polyclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is utilised to recognise TGEV antigens in cell cultures, intestinal contents and faeces (Lanza et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">1996</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">1999a</xref>; van Nieuwstadt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">1988</xref>) or PRCV antigen in nasal swabs or lung homogenates (Lanza et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">1995</xref>); however, the sensitivity of available ELISA tests is generally lower than that of RT-PCR assays. RT-PCR or real-time qPCR is now more commonly used for detection of TGEV and distinguishing TGEV, PRCV, PDCoV and PEDV (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">2000</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2001</xref>; Masuda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2016</xref>; Costantini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2004</xref>; Ogawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2009</xref>). PRCV/TGEV distinction is usually performed through PCR assay based on the S gene deletion region in PRCV strains. Multiplex RT-PCR and real-time qPCR have been used for the concurrent identification of major porcine viruses related to diarrhoea including RV, TGEV, PDCoV and PEDV (Masuda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2016</xref>; Ogawa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2009</xref>). Also, multiplex microarray hybridisation assay was used for quick differential identification of eight CoVs, including TGEV (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2005</xref>).
