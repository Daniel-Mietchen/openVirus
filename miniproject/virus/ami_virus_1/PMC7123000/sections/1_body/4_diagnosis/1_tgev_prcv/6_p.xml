 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1965</xref>) or cell lines (Laude et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1981</xref>), porcine thyroid cells (Witte 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">1971</xref>) and McClurkin swine testicle (ST) cell line (McClurkin and Norman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">1966</xref>) are advocated for TGEV isolation from infected pig faeces or intestinal contents. Typical cytopathic effects (CPE) might be negligible upon primary isolation of field strains and require additional blind passages. The CPE observed comprises swollen, round cells with a balloon-like appearance (Bohl and Kumagai 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1965</xref>). For observing viral CPE or plaques, the addition of pancreatin or trypsin to the ST cell culture media as well as using older cells can improve detection of viral CPE and plaques (Bohl 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1979</xref>).
