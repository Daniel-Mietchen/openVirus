<p id="Par51">TGEV antibodies can be identified by several serological tests. However, TGEV serology is complex, as both TGEV and PRCV prompt VN antibodies that are quantitatively and qualitatively similar (Pensaert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">1989</xref>). A blocking ELISA that uses MAbs to TGEV differentiates easily from PRCV (Garwes et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1988</xref>; Bernard et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">1989</xref>; Callebaut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1989</xref>). However, blocking ELISA works better on a group basis since certain pigs with low antibody titres to TGEV or PRCV may not show positivity (Callebaut et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1989</xref>; Sestak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">1999b</xref>; Simkins et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">1993</xref>). Further, the accuracy of commercial ELISAs for distinguishing US strains of PRCV and TGEV is low (Sestak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">1999a</xref>).
