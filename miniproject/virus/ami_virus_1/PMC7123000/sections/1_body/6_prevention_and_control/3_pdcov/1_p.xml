<p id="Par75">The disease-preventive measures adopted for TGEV and PEDV control and prevention can be useful for PDCoV infection too. In the absence of any suitable vaccines or antivirals to control PDCoV disease, reliable regime includes symptomatic action giving bicarbonate liquids and ad lib water to alleviate acidosis and dehydration in suckling pigs. Antibiotics administration may be beneficial in the case complicated by concurrent/secondary bacterial infection. In the event of heavy mortality, feedback techniques must be opted to stimulate lactogenic immunity and reduce mortality. Additionally, during PDCoV epidemics, a strict biosecurity plan must be implemented to lessen PDCoV spread via infected fomites. The systems all in/all out and thorough disinfection (using phenolic disinfectants, bleach, peroxides, aldehydes or iodophors) can break the disease cycle.</p>
