<p id="Par68">Many methods for immunising sows to induce lactogenic immunity and consequent protection of neonatal piglets have been attempted (Chattha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>; Saif and Jackwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">1990</xref>; Bohl and Saif 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1975</xref>). Several viral vaccines (virulent, attenuated, inactivated and recombinant subunit) with different routes of administration (oral, intra-nasal, subcutaneous, intramuscular and intra-mammary) (Saif and Sestak 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2006</xref>; Moxley and Olson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">1989</xref>) have been evaluated in the past. To note, intramuscular, parenteral or intra-mammary administration of pregnant sows with live attenuated, inactivated or subunit vaccines did not offer complete protection but were found to be effective to reduce piglet mortality rates (Brim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1994</xref>). Unlike natural intestinal infection with the virulent virus, attenuated viruses do not stimulate the gut-MG-sIgA axis sufficiently for the induction of immunity similar to that observed following this. There are two commercial vaccines based on a live-modified TGEV strain for combined oral-intramuscular administration produced by Merck Animal Health: PROSYSTEM
 <sup>®</sup> TGE/Rota and PROSYSTEM
 <sup>®</sup> TREC. These vaccines can effectively stimulate a response in previously exposed pigs, but do not protect the naïve population.
