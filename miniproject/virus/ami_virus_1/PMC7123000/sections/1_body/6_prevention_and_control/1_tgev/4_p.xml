<p id="Par69">Herd immunity can be enhanced by exposing all the sows to virulent TGEV (using intestinal contents or gut tissues of affected pigs) to boost lactogenic (milk) immunity (Bohl and Saif 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1975</xref>; Bohl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1972</xref>). This practice is called feedback and results in the rapid development of immunity in pregnant sows (particularly in those due to farrow 2 weeks or more after the start of the outbreak) and reduces losses in newborn piglets. However, it may also result in dissemination of other pathogens (potentially present in TGEV-containing faeces/intestinal contents) to adjacent herds. On small-scale farms, herd immunity is accomplished, and TGEV infection is self-limiting. In contrast, in larger farms (≤200 sows) with a continuous farrowing system and continual influx of susceptible animals, TGEV infection frequently becomes endemic after the primary outbreak (Saif and Sestak 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2006</xref>). Elimination of endemic TGE in a herd can be attempted using the feedback method. After this is done, no weaning of piglets should occur during the following 3–4 weeks so that there remains no susceptible host in the herd while TGEV is circulating on the farm.
