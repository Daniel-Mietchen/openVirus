<p id="Par74">Since the outbreaks of 2013, the USA has conditionally licensed two PEDV vaccines targeting emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains: alphavirus-based vaccine (Harris vaccinesâ„¢, now Merck Animal Health) and an inactivated vaccine (Zoetis) (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2014</xref>). The first vaccine was developed in June 2014 using a replication-deficient Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) virus packaging system expressing the S protein of an emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain (Crawford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). The second vaccine developed in September 2015 was an inactivated whole-virus (non-S INDEL PEDV) vaccine plus an adjuvant (Crawford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2016</xref>). In October 2016, an inactivated vaccine based on non-S INDEL PEDV strain AJ1102 was licensed in China (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2016b</xref>). In South Korea, an inactivated vaccine candidate based on non-S INDEL strain KNU-141112 was demonstrated to be protective in sows and their suckling piglets (Baek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2016</xref>). However, the efficacy of these vaccines/vaccine candidates in the field is not assessed. To date, reverse genetics platforms have been generated for both classical and emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains using different approaches (Beall et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>; Jengarn et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2015</xref>; Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">2013</xref>) and can be used for the future rational design of safe and effective PEDV vaccines.
