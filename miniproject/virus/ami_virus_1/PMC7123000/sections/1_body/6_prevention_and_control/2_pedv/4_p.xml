<p id="Par73">The deliberate exposure of pregnant sows (feedback method) to PEDV promotes the rapid development of lactogenic immunity and thus shortens the course and the severity of the disease on the farm (Chattha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). However, as mentioned in the TGEV section, this method may contribute to the spread of other infectious agents throughout the farm. We have recently demonstrated that high dose of virulent PEDV administered to sows can substantially increase their piglet survival rate as compared to low-dose and mock-infected sows (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">4.3</xref>) (Langel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2016</xref>). This novel finding suggests that the current feedback-based control strategies can be improved by ensuring the uniform administration of high-dose PEDV to pregnant sows.
