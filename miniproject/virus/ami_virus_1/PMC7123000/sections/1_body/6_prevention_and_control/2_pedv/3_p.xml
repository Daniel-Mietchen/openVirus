<p id="Par72">In contrast to the present situation in Asia, in Europe, PEDV infection (with mostly mild S INDEL strains in circulation) is considered to be of marginal economic importance and therefore does not warrant the development of a vaccine (Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2015</xref>). However, severe classical PEDV outbreaks in Asia have necessitated the development of PEDV vaccines to prevent and control the infection. In China, the CV777-based inactivated and attenuated PEDV vaccines were approved in 1995 and 1998, respectively (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2016b</xref>). Soon after, attenuated vaccines based on classical PEDV strains KPEDV-9 and DR13 were commercialised in 1999 and 2004, respectively, in Korea (Kweon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">1999</xref>; Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">2007</xref>). Since 1997 a commercial attenuated PEDV vaccine based on cell culture-adapted classical PEDV P-5V strain (Nisseiken Co. Ltd., Japan) is administered to sows in Japan (Sato et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">2011</xref>). These vaccines based on classical PEDV strains appeared to satisfactorily control PED in Asia until the highly virulent non-S INDEL PEDV strains have emerged (Lee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">2015</xref>). As demonstrated in the field, the classical PEDV vaccines have failed to protect pigs from severe diarrhoeal disease associated with the emerging highly virulent non-S INDEL PEDV strains (Lee
