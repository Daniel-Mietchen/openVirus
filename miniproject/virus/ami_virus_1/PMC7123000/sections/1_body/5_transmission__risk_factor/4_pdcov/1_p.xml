<p id="Par65">The main method of PDCoV transmission is the faecal–oral route. Faeces, vomit and other contaminated fomites are the major sources of the virus. Experimentally induced PDCoV diarrhoea lasted for ~5–10 days, with faecal virus RNA shedding lasting for up to 19 days (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>; Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>). Pigs generally continue shedding PDCoV RNA in the faeces after recovery from disease; therefore, another possible reservoir for PDCoV may be subclinically infected or convalescent carriers.
