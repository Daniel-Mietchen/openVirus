<p id="Par63">As for other enteric viral infections, in PEDV also direct or indirect faecal-oral transmission is the main route of virus transmission. Acute outbreaks in non-immune farms often occur within 4–5 days after newly purchased pig arrival. The virus enters farms mostly via infected pigs, but also by contaminated feed, trucks, boots or other fomites. Farm workers may also act as a vehicle for virus transmission to naïve pigs (Dee et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2016</xref>; Schumacher et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">2016</xref>). Evidence of PEDV aerosol transmission is reported in some (Alonso et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2014</xref>) but not other studies (Niederwerder et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2016</xref>). In four-week-old pigs infected with emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strain, infectious virus excretion lasted for 14–16 days (Crawford et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2015</xref>). Nevertheless, a few pigs shed PEDV RNA, at 42 days post-initial oral exposure, but non-infectious virus particles were seen in faeces.
