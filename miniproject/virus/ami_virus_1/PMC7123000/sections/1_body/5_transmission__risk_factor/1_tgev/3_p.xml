<p id="Par61">The increased concentration of wintering starlings (
 <italic>Sturnus vulgaris</italic>) in feedlots was suggested to contribute to the mechanical spread of TGEV between farms during the cold season. In a study, TGEV was seen in the droppings of starlings for as long as 32 h after feeding TGEV (Pilchard

 <italic>Musca domestica</italic>) is also proposed as a mechanical vector for TGEV (Pilchard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">1965</xref>). TGEV antigen is seen in flies on a swine herd and TGEV shedding up to 3 days from experimentally feeding flies (Gough and Jorgenson 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">1983</xref>). Notably, surveys done in Central Europe confirmed the presence of TGEV antibodies in nearly 30% of the feral pigs (Sedlak et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR162">2008</xref>). Although TGEV shedding is detectable for up to 104 dpi (Underdahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1975</xref>), it is undefined yet whether infectious virus particles are shed or transmitted at that time. Adding of sentinel pigs to a herd at 3, 4 and 5 months after a past TGE outbreak resulted in no new disease in the introduced pigs (Derbyshire et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">1969</xref>).
