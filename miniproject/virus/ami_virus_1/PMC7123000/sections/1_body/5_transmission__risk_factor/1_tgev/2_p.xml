<p id="Par60">In temperate climates, TGE is a seasonal disease with most outbreaks occurring in the winter months. It is assumed that this could be due to the virus stability in frozen form, and frailty to heat or sunlight (Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1962</xref>), permitting easy virus spread among herds in winter on fomites or animals. Three potential reservoirs for TGEV between seasonal epidemics proposed are (1) herds with enzootic TGE; (2) hosts other than swine and (3) carrier pigs. Dogs, cats and foxes could be the possible carriers, facilitating its spread on farms, as the shedding of the virus occurs for variable periods (Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1962</xref>; McClurkin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">1970</xref>) with the excreted virus (by dogs) remaining infectious for pigs (Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1962</xref>; Reynolds et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">1980</xref>).
