<p id="Par59">TGEV is more stable in frozen conditions, but becomes fragile at room or higher temperatures. In an experimental study, the virus infectivity was maintained for more than 8 weeks at 5 °C, 2 weeks at 20 °C and 24 h at 35 °C in liquid manure slurry (Haas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1995</xref>). Further, the virus is highly photosensitive and gets inactivated less than 6 h in the exposure of sunlight or ultraviolet light (Cartwright et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">1965</xref>; Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">1962</xref>). It also gets inactivated to 1% Lysovet (phenol and aldehyde), 0.03% formalin, 0.01% beta-propiolactone, 1 mM binary ethylenamine, sodium hypochlorite, NaOH, iodines, quaternary ammonium compounds, ether and chloroform (VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1993</xref>; Brown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1981</xref>). TGEV field strains are resistant to trypsin and relatively stable in pig bile, and at pH 3 (Laude et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">1981</xref>), letting the virus survive in the stomach and small intestine.
