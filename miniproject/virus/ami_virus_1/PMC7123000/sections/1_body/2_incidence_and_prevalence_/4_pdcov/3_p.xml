<p id="Par34">PDCoV has also been documented in Canada (March 2014), Korea (April 2014), mainland China (2015), Thailand (2015) and Vietnam and Lao PDR. A Korean study described that of 691 faecal samples from 59 farms collected from diarrhoeic pigs from 2014 to 2015, only 2 samples originating from a single farm were PDCoV RNA positive (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2016a</xref>). The two Korean PDCoV strains, SL2 and SL5, were genetically closely related to the US PDCoV strains but differed from the older Korean strain KNU14-04. Following the first PDCoV identification in Hong Kong in 2012 (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2012</xref>), it was confirmed in diarrhoeic pigs in mainland China (Dong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2015</xref>; Song et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">2015</xref>). PDCoV high prevalence (&gt;30%) and frequent co-infections with PEDV (51%) were reported. All Chinese PDCoV strains shared high nt identities (≥98.9%) with the global PDCoV strains. The Thai PDCoV strains shared the highest nt identities (≥98.4%) with the Chinese strain CHN-AH-2004 (Janetanakit et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2016</xref>), forming, however, a cluster separate from Chinese and US strains (Zhang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">2016</xref>). Strains genetically close to the Thai PDCoV lineage were found in Lao PDR, whereas strains of the US PDCoV lineage were detected in Vietnam (Saeng-Chuto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">2017</xref>).
