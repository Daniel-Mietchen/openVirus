<p id="Par33">In early 2014, the first outbreak of PDCoV-associated diarrhoea was documented in swine, in Ohio. Among intestinal or faecal samples obtained from diarrhoeic pigs from 5 Ohio farms, 92.9% were found to be positive for PDCoV by RT-PCR (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR194">2014b</xref>). The PDCoV sequences shared high nucleotide similarity with the two Chinese prototype PDCoV strains, HKU15-44 and HKU15-155, identified in 2012. Other two genetically similar PDCoV strains, USA/IA/2014/8734 and SDCV/USA/Illinois121/2014, were detected in US states during the same time period (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2014</xref>; Marthaler et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2014a</xref>). After this PDCoV has been confirmed in 19 US states (

PDCoV origin in US swine is unknown; however, serologic evidence suggests that it was circulating in US swine before its recognition in 2014 (Sinha et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2015</xref>).
