<p id="Par32">The initial surveys in China and Hong Kong during 2007–2011 identified DCoVs in pigs and wild birds (Woo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">2012</xref>). Nonetheless, the DCoV presence was previously confirmed at Chinese live-animal markets in 2005–2006 in small mammals, including Chinese ferret badgers and Asian leopard cats (Dong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>). Because their helicase and S genes are closely related with PDCoV, interspecies transmission of DCoVs among Asian carnivores, porcine and avian species is suggested. The origin of PDCoV remains unclear, but considering its recent emergence, its adaptation to pigs may be incomplete.
