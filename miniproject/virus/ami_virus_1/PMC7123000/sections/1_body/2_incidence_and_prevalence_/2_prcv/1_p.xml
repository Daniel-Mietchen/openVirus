<p id="Par25">PRCV infects the respiratory tract with limited or no shedding in faeces (Pensaert 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">1989</xref>). The first isolation of PRCV was from Belgium in 1984 (Pensaert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1986</xref>) and 1989. PRCV was detected in the USA in the herds without a prior history of TGEV infection or vaccination (Hill et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">1990</xref>; Wesley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">1990</xref>). Antibodies produced in PRCV-infected pigs neutralise the TGEV.
