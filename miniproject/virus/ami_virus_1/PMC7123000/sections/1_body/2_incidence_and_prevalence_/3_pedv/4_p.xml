<p id="Par30">In 2013, the emerging PEDV strains started spreading to other countries outside China. At the same period, outbreak due to highly virulent non-S INDEL PEDV strains started in US swine farms (Stevenson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2013</xref>), which was followed by outbreaks associated with milder S-INDEL PEDV strains in January 2014 (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR193">2014a</xref>). However, S INDEL strains were retrospectively found in pig samples collected as early as June 2013 (Vlasova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2014</xref>). In 2013â€“2014, PEDV led to the loss of nearly 10% of the US swine stock (7 million pigs) and the associated profits. By 2018, PEDV had reportedly spread to 39 US states and Puerto Rico (

In the USA, the last big outbreak of PEDV occurred in the spring of 2014, and the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains have reportedly spread to the neighbouring countries, including Canada and Mexico (Lin et al.
