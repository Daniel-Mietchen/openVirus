<p id="Par27">The classical PEDV strains were the cause of several epidemics with heavy mortality in Europe from 1971 until the late 1980s. However, after 2000, reports are very rare. In Italy, an epidemic involving 63 herds occurred in 2005 and 2006 where pigs of all ages were found affected, but mortality was mainly limited to suckling piglets (Martelli et al.

Because of the low clinical importance of the disease, no surveillance studies were conducted until the emergence of new PEDV variants in Europe in 2014. Note that the historical prevalence of classical PEDV in the European swine population is unknown. An emerging non-S INDEL strain led to an outbreak in Ukraine in 2014; while outbreaks in European countries (Germany, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Slovenia) were confirmed as of S INDEL strains (Lin et al.
