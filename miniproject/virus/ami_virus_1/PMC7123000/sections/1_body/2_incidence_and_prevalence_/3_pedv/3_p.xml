<p id="Par29">In October 2010, a massive series of PEDV outbreaks occurred in China, resulting in tremendous economic losses (Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">2012</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">2016</xref>). These outbreaks were caused by the emerging extremely virulent non-S INDEL strains, and the mortality in neonatal piglets reached 50â€“100% (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2016b</xref>). Subsequently, emerging S INDEL strains were also identified in China (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">2016b</xref>), demonstrating that classical and emerging (non-S INDEL and S-INDEL PEDV) strains are co-circulating in China.
