<p id="Par28">Infections associated with classical PEDV strains were originally reported in China in the late 1970s. Since then, PED has spread among swine farms and became leading cause of viral diarrhoea, despite the use of vaccines (targeting the prototype PEDV strain CV777) (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">2016a</xref>; Xuan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">1984</xref>). In Japan PEDV was first detected in 1982 (Takahashi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">1983</xref>) and outbreaks continued during the 1990s with mortality between 30% and 100% in suckling pigs (Sueyoshi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">1995</xref>; Kuwahara et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">1988</xref>). PEDV was first recognised in Korea in 1993 (Kweon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">1993</xref>) and became prevalent accounting for more than 50% of the enteric viral infections diagnosed in suckling piglets in the 1990s (Chae et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2000</xref>; Hwang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1994</xref>). In India, 21.2% of 528 serum samples from pigs (2–6 months old) were confirmed positive for PEDV antibodies (Barman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2003</xref>). In Thailand, between 2007 and 2008, PED occurred in eight provinces (Puranaveja et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR148">2009</xref>) affecting all age-group pigs but mortality reached 100% in newborn piglets.
