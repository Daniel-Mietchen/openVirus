<p id="Par31">In 2013, the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains were identified in Japan (Masuda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2015</xref>) and then reportedly spread to South Korea (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2015</xref>), Vietnam (Vui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">2014</xref>), Thailand (Cheun-Arom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2015</xref>), Taiwan (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2014</xref>) and the Philippines (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2016</xref>). The S-INDEL PEDV strains were detected in Japanese (Suzuki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2015</xref>) and Korean (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2014</xref>) farms in 2013 and 2014, respectively. To date, other PEDV variants that carry a large deletion in the NTD of the S protein were detected exclusively in pigs in Japan. Besides the avirulent TTR-2 strain (Suzuki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2016</xref>), 15 novel field PEDV mutants with large deletions in the NTD of S gene ranging from 582 to 648Â nt were detected from diarrhoeic pig faecal or intestinal samples collected between December 2013 and June 2015 (Diep et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>). Interestingly, all of these samples contained at least two PEDV strains with distinct large genomic deletions, and the majority of these PEDV strains were confirmed to contain an intact S gene. These variants with large deletions in the S gene were found in both primary and recurring PED outbreaks. In summary, classical, emerging non-S INDEL and S-INDEL PEDV strains exist in Asia and Europe, but only emerging non-S INDEL and S-INDEL PEDV strains are currently confirmed to circulate in the Americas. No PEDV infections have been reported in the African and Australian continents so far.
