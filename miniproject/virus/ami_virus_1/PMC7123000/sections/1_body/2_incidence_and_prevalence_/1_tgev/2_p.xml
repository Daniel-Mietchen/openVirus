<p id="Par23">Two epidemiologic forms of TGE are apparent: epidemic and endemic. Epidemic TGE noticed transcendently in seronegative flocks. After entry, the illness transmits quickly to swine of any age, particularly in winters, with inappetence, vomition or diarrhoea in affected animals. Suckling pigs exhibit prominent clinical signs and get quickly dehydrated. Lactating sows usually show anorexia and agalactia, with reduced milk production, which further adds to piglet mortality.</p>
