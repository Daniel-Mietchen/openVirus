<p id="Par22">TGEV was first detected in the USA in 1946 from outbreaks of acute diarrhoea with high mortality in piglets (Doyle and Hutchings 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">1946</xref>). Since then the disease has been reported in several pig-rearing countries practicing intensive pig farming system, including Europe, Asia (Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Taiwan), the Americas (North, Central and South) and Africa (Zaïre, Ghana). Despite the widespread application of vaccines, TGEV infections were a prime reason for enteric disease and mortality in piglets in the USA and globally in the 1960s–1980s. The presence and extensive prevalence of PRCV, a deletion mutant of TGEV, narrowed the clinical impact of TGE (Laude et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">2002</xref>). Currently, sporadic outbreaks of profuse diarrhoea in piglets due to TGEV in TGEV/PRCV seronegative herds are yet to be confirmed in North America, Europe and Asia. However, careful differentiation between TGEV and emerging TGEV/ PEDV recombinants may be needed.
