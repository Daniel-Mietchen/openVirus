<p id="Par24">Endemic TGE indicates the persistence of the virus and disease in a group perpetuated by the continuous influx of susceptible swine. It is a classic sequel to a primary outbreak and occurs in seropositive animals that regularly have farrowing (Stepanek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">1979</xref>), additions of the herd or mixing of susceptible pig population. In endemic groups, TGEV spreads slowly among grown-up pigs (Pritchard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1987</xref>). Sows are most of the time resistant and asymptomatic and will transfer a variable level of passive lactogenic immunity to their offspring. In these groups, mild TGEV diarrhoea is seen with mortality under 10–20% in pigs from ~6 days of age until ~2 weeks post-weaning.
