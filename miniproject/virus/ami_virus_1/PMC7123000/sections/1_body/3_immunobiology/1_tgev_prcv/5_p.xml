<p id="Par39">Circulating passive antibodies (primarily IgG), acquired with colostrum, protect the neonate against systemic, however not the intestinal, infection (Hooper and Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1966a</xref>; Saif and Sestak 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2006</xref>). Between the first 7Â days of lactation, IgA prevails in milk and IgG reduces. Researchers have reviewed the mechanisms of passive immunity to TGEV infection (Saif and Sestak 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2006</xref>; Chattha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>; Saif and Jackwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">1990</xref>; Saif and Bohl 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">1979</xref>). Swine recovered from TGE spread passive immunity to their suckling pigs with colostrum or milk (lactogenic immunity) containing TGEV virus-neutralising antibodies (Hooper and Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1966a</xref>) that nullify the ingested TGEV in the intestinal lumen. This is accomplished naturally when piglets feed on immune mother regularly or experimentally by constant feeding of antiserum.
