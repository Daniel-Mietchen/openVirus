<p id="Par38">Subsequently to extensive decrease in epidemic outbreaks of TGE in Europe following the widespread distribution of PRCV, the research suggested that PRCV infections induce partial immunity against TGEV, as proven by a reduced length and duration of virus shedding and diarrhoea in most of the pigs examined (Brim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1995</xref>; VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">1994</xref>; Cox et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1993</xref>; Wesley and Woods 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">1996</xref>). This partial immunity is associated with rapid increases in TGEV-VN antibodies (Cox et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1993</xref>; Wesley and Woods 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">1996</xref>) and numbers of IgG and IgA ASCs in the intestines (Saif et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1994</xref>; VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">1994</xref>). Movement of PRCV IgG and IgA ASCs from the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissues (BALT) to the gut of the PRCV-exposed pigs after TGEV challenge may clarify the quick anamnestic response and induces the partial protection (VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">1994</xref>). However, neonatal pigs needed a week after PRCV encounter to develop partial immunity to subsequent TGEV challenge (Wesley and Woods 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">1996</xref>).
