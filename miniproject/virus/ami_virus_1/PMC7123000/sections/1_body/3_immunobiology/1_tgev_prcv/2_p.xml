<p id="Par36">Protective immunity depends on the secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies produced by intestinal plasma cells (Saif et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1994</xref>; VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1993</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">1994</xref>). Intestinal and serum IgA TGEV antibodies and antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) have been detected in pigs after oral, but not after parenteral, administration with TGEV (Saif et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1994</xref>; VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1993</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">1994</xref>; Kodama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1980</xref>). Presence of IgA antibody (likely of intestinal origin) in the serum is considered to be an indicator of active immunity to TGE (Kodama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1980</xref>; Saif 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">1999</xref>). Besides local antibody responses, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is also important in protection against TGEV infections (Brim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1995</xref>; Frederick et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">1976</xref>; Shimizu and Shimizu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">1979</xref>). Retinoic acid may enhance CMI after immunisation of piglets with an inactivated TGEV vaccine by increasing the trafficking of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells to lymph nodes and small intestine (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2016b</xref>). It was conceived that a low natural killer (NK) cell activity might associate with the higher susceptibility of piglets and parturient sows to TGEV infection (Cepica and Derbyshire 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1984</xref>). A virulent (SHXB) however not attenuated (STC3) TGEV strain impeded the capacity of porcine intestinal DCs or monocyte-derived DCs to sample antigen, migrate and incite T-cell expansion in vivo and in vitro (Zhao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">2014</xref>), suggestive of the immune-suppressive potential of TGEV.
