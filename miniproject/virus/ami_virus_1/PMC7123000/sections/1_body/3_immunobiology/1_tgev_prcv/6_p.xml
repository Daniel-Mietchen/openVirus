<p id="Par40">IgA TGEV antibodies in milk are stable in the gut and give the best protection, but IgG antibodies are likewise protective if high titres are restored in milk after parenteral or systemic vaccination (Bohl and Saif 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1975</xref>) or by ingestion of colostral IgG antibodies (Stone et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">1977</xref>). Following TGEV infection and antigenic stimulation in the gut, IgA immunocytes move to the mammary gland where they confine and produce IgA antibodies into colostrum and milk that play a major role in passive protection of suckling pigs (Saif and Sestak

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1975</xref>). This “gut-mammary” immunologic axis was first proposed concerning TGEV infections in swine (Bohl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1972</xref>; Saif et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">1972</xref>), providing the first concept for a common mucosal immune system.
