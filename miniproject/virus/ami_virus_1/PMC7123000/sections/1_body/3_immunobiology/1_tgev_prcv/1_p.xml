<p id="Par35">Infection of adult swine results in noticeable serum antibodies that could persist for 6Â months to several years (Stepanek et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR173">1979</xref>). Serum antibody presence confirms serological evidence for TGEV or PRCV infection; their association with protection against TGEV is not established. Swine that recover from TGEV infection show protection from subsequent short-term challenge, as of intestinal mucosal immunity (Brim et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">1994</xref>; VanCott et al.
