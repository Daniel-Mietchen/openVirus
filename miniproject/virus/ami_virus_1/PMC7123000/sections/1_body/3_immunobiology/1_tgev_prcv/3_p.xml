<p id="Par37">PRCV-inoculated pigs developed potent systemic and bronchus-associated but not gut-associated antibody, ASC and T-cell responses (VanCott et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">1993</xref>; Brim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1994</xref>). Other than quantitative differences in the count of IgA antibodies in the sow milk induced by TGEV or PRCV exposure, putative divergences in virus epitopes observed by the milk IgA antibodies were recommended (De Diego et al.
