<p id="Par43">The immune response to PDCoV infection in pigs is still unclear but presumed to be similar to that mentioned for TGEV and PEDV. Gnotobiotic pigs orally inoculated with the original or tissue-culture-developed PDCoV strain (OH-FD22) exhibited serum IgG, IgA and VN antibodies by 14 dpi that shows a peak at 24 dpi when the pigs had recouped from the clinical form and faecal virus shedding (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>). Similar to TGEV and PEDV, the supply of maternal antibodies with colostrum and milk from immune sows, especially IgA and VN antibodies, should neutralise PDCoV in the gut protecting young piglets (Bohl et al.
