<p id="Par41">Even though all age pigs are susceptible to PED, highest mortality is seen in 1-week piglets and younger, and their survival is dependent on the transfer of maternal antibodies, especially VN and sIgA (via colostrum and milk from immunised or previously exposed sows). The components of lactogenic security depicted for TGEV infection apply to PEDV also (described previously in TGEV section) (Chattha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>; Langel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2016</xref>). Pigs lose lactogenic protection at weaning becoming susceptible to PEDV infection. Humoral immune response to PEDV infection is quite the same as seen for TGEV (described in TGEV section) (Saif and Sestak 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">2006</xref>; Chattha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>). VN antibodies appear in the serum but do not play any significant role in protection against the clinical disease since protection basically relies on the presence of slgA antibodies in the intestinal mucosa (Chattha et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2015</xref>; Langel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2016</xref>). Immunity may not persist long, yet a fast anamnestic response upon re-exposure may decrease the severity of reoccurring disease or even prevent it.
