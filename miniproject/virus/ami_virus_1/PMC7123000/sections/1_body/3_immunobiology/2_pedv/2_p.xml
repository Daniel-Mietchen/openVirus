<p id="Par42">At least 11 proteins [ORF1ab-encoded NS proteins (nsp1, nsp3, nsp5, nsp7, nsp14â€“16), structural proteins (E, M, N) and accessory protein ORF3s] have been recognised as IFN antagonists allowing PEDV to evade host interferon (IFN) responses (Ding et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">2015</xref>; Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">2016a</xref>). Decreased innate immune responses (specifically frequencies and function of NK cells) (Annamalai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2015</xref>) likely contribute to the increased severity of PEDV infection in suckling vs. older (weaned, finisher, adult) pigs, as observed for TGEV infections (Derbyshire et al.
