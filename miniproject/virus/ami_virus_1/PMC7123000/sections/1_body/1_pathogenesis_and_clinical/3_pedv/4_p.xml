<p id="Par17">The severity of lesions and the virus replication levels in naturally and experimentally infected suckling piglets vary for classical PEDV, emerging non-S INDEL and S INDEL PEDV strains (Jung et al.

Microscopic examination shows syncytia, vacuolation and shedding of small intestinal enterocytes primarily on the proximal villi. Similar to TGEV, PEDV infection results in degeneration of enterocytes that reduces the villous height:crypt depth (VH: CD) ratios and the enzymatic activity. Although PEDV antigens were detected in colonic epithelial cells, no associated histopathologic changes have been observed (Debouck et al.
