<p id="Par15">Morbidity is nearly 100% in piglets and variable in sows. Neonates below 1 week of age often die due to severe dehydration, and mortality touches 50–100%, whereas mortality is low in older pigs and they recover within a week. In sows, severity of diarrhoea is constant and frequently shows only depression and anorexia. Similarly, fattening pigs may develop watery faeces and can become anorexic and depressed within a week. As with TGEV, slower enterocyte turnover and immature innate immune system may add to the more extreme clinical signs, higher mortality and slower recuperation in PEDV-tainted piglets in contrast to weaned pigs (Jung et al.
