<p id="Par10">TGE gross lesions are limited to the gastrointestinal tract. The distension of the stomach and the small intestine are seen to be filled up with curdled milk and sometimes petechial haemorrhages are visualised (Hooper and Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1966a</xref>). The small intestinal wall is thin and transparent. The villous atrophy in the jejunum and lesser in the ileum regions are the major TGE lesions and are more pronounced in neonatal pigs than in ≥3-week-old piglets (Moon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1978</xref>; Hooper and Haelterman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1966b</xref>). The increased severity of TGEV infection results in higher mortality (often 100%) in piglets less than 2 weeks of age that decreases in older pigs (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">4.1</xref>). Although swine of any age is susceptible to TGEV, the mortality in TGEV seropositive groups and swine more than 5 weeks of age is usually low. Mechanisms that represent age-dependent susceptibility to clinical ailment comprise the slower substitution of tainted villous epithelial cells with newly differentiated enterocytes migrating from crypts in newborn pigs (Moon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1978</xref>). These lesions are similar to PEDV/PDCoV (Debouck et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1981</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2015a</xref>) lesions, but more severe than those caused by rotavirus (RV) (Bohl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1978</xref>). Pathologic observations and degree of villous atrophy are exceptionally variable in pigs from endemic herds (Pritchard 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">1987</xref>).
