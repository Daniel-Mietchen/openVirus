<p id="Par11">Lungs (alveolar macrophages) and mammary gland tissues are recognised extra-intestinal sites for TGEV replication (Kemeny et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1975</xref>). Hitherto report shows pneumonia due to oronasal infection of pigs with TGEV (Underdahl et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">1975</xref>), and the clinical significance of mammary gland infection is imprecise. However, agalactia is frequently observed in TGEV-affected sows, and TGEV spreads quickly among the population.
