<p id="Par12">PRCV replicates efficiently in porcine type 1 and 2 pneumocytes and is seen in epithelial cells of the nares, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles, and alveoli, and on occasion in alveolar macrophages (Atanasova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>; Pensaert et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">1986</xref>; O’Toole et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">1989</xref>). It can be noticed in blood and tracheobronchial lymph nodes. After experimental infection, nasal PRCV shedding usually lasts for 4–6 days. Pulmonary lesions and clinical signs subside consequently with an increase in the virus-neutralising (VN) antibody titres (Atanasova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>). Although PRCV is sometimes found in enterocytes, it does not spread efficiently to adjacent epithelial cells (Cox et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1990</xref>), and faecal shedding is low or undetectable.
