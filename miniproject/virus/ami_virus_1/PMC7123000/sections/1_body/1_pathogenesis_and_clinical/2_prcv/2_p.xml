<p id="Par13">PRCV predominantly causes upper and lower respiratory tract disease. The lesions appear to include lung and bronchointerstitial pneumonia, with regular peribronchiolar and perivascular lymphohistiocytic handcuffing (Atanasova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2008</xref>; Cox et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1990</xref>; Halbur et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">1993</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2007</xref>). The PRCV-induced bronchointerstitial pneumonia results in (1) thickened alveolar septa due to macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration, (2) hypertrophy and hyperplasia of type 2 pneumocytes, (3) aggregation of cell debris and inflammatory leukocytes in alveolar and bronchiolar lumina because of airway epithelial necrosis and (4) peribronchiolar or perivascular lymphohistiocytic inflammation.
