<p id="Par19">The clinical signs are observed within 1–3 days after PDCoV infection in suckling and older pigs. Although clinical symptoms are similar (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">4.1</xref>), they are less pronounced compared to PEDV and TGEV infections (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>; Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>). They include acute, watery diarrhoea due to malabsorption induced by the massive loss of absorptive enterocytes. Additional signs may include vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, lethargy and death. Vacuolation of the infected colonic epithelial cells may inhibit water and electrolyte reabsorption. The seronegative pigs are susceptible to PDCoV infection at any age, with high morbidity that can reach 100% in piglets. Evaluation of filed cases in the USA, China and Thailand in 2014 shows that PDCoV infection is associated with up to 40–80% mortality among suckling pigs (Anon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2014</xref>). The infection on breeding establishments remains self-limiting and stops when pregnant sows develop lactogenic immunity adequate to secure their offspring.
