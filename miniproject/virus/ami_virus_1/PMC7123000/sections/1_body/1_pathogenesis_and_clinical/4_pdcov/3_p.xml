<p id="Par21">PDCoV replicates in the epithelial cell of the large and small intestine. Lesions look like those seen in TGEV and PEDV infections but are mild (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>; Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>). Histological findings are intense, multifocal to diffuse, mild to extreme atrophic enteritis of jejunum and ileum, at some point joined by mild vacuolation of caecal and colonic epithelial cells (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>). Amid acute infection, PDCoV antigens are available in the villous epithelium of the mid-jejunum to the ileum and a lesser degree, in the duodenum, and caecum/colon (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2016a</xref>). PDCoV antigens may also be noticed in immune cells of the intestinal lamina propria, Peyerâ€™s patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>). Inflammatory cell (macrophage, lymphocyte and neutrophil) infiltration can be observed in the lamina propria. Acute necrosis of PDCoV-infected enterocytes (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2016a</xref>) results in marked villous atrophy in jejunum and ileum, but not duodenum or large intestine, which coincides with fewer PDCoV antigen-positive duodenal, caecal or colonic epithelial cells (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>). Acute-phase viremia with low PDCoV RNA titres in serum is observed (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>). After recovery of pigs from clinical disease, huge amount of PDCoV antigens are found in the gut lymphatic tissues (Hu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2016</xref>). Additionally, low or moderate quantities of PDCoV RNA, but not antigens, are detected in multiple organs, feasibly as of viremia (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>; Ma et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2015</xref>; Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">2016b</xref>). Decreased levels of PDCoV shedding (compared with PEDV and TGEV) in the faeces may be indicative of its incomplete adaptation to pigs and can contribute to its slower spread among swine herds and the lower mortality of nursing pigs (Jung et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2015b</xref>).
