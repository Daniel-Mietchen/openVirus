<p id="Par3">TGEV and PEDV have been reportedly co-circulating in Eurasia and the USA. Recently in Europe, a pathogenic recombinant TGEV/PEDV variant (swine enteric coronavirus, SeCoV) was recognised and described (Akimkin et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2016</xref>; Boniotti et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2016</xref>). SeCoV that contains PEDV S protein on a TGEV backbone apparently leads to disease clinically indistinct from the TGEV- and PEDV-produced ones (Table
