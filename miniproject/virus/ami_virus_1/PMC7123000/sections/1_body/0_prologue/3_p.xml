<p id="Par4">Currently, PHEV, the only porcine betacoronavirus, has a worldwide prevalence (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">2016</xref>). In neonatal piglets devoid of maternal antibodies (generally in those purchased from infection-free herds), PHEV causes either encephalomyelitis or a condition characterised by vomiting and wasting. Generally, maternal immunity protects piglets which have taken colostrum for up to 15 weeks, while in pigs older than 3–4 weeks and adult swine the infection is mostly subclinical. Therefore, it is seldom considered to be of economic importance. However, a recent report of an uncommon respiratory (influenza-like) presentation and increasing prevalence of PHEV in adult exhibition swine in the USA (Lorbach et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2017</xref>) may indicate a potential tropism shift that could lead to a substantial change in its epidemiology. To clear this complex epidemiological position, continuing monitoring and development of state-of-the-art rapid and reliable tools and techniques are needed to confirm and provide a clear differential diagnosis (Kim et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2001</xref>; Masuda et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2016</xref>).
