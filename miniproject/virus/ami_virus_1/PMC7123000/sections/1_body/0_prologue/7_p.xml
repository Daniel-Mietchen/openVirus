<p id="Par8">Swine enteric CoVs (TGEV, PEDV and PDCoV) are highly contagious and are associated with severe disease forms such as diarrhoea and vomition, and increased mortality in young ones (often 100%). They can cause sporadic outbreaks (endemic) or large-scale epidemics in swine-producing countries (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">4.2</xref>). No specific treatments are available for any of the swine enteric CoVs that so far have resisted eradication efforts in different geographic regions. In this chapter, we have reviewed the diseases due to CoVs that continue evolving in domestic and wild swine, as well as another possible reservoir (avian or bat species) or secondary hosts including carnivores, or via the interspecies spread, recombination and generation of deletion escape variants. We also review PRCV that has lost its enteric tropism but is capable of inducing protective immune responses against TGEV that altered its global epidemiology.
