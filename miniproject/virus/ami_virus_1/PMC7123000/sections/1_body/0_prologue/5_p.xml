<p id="Par6">An overall nt and amino acid sequence similarity of 96–98% among TGEV and PRCV proposes that PRCV evolved from TGEV. Two characteristic features of the PRCV genome that may account for its altered tissue tropism include a large omission (621–681 nt) in the N-termini of the S gene resulting in a reduced S protein size and variable sequence changes in the ORF3 (Ballesteros et al.
