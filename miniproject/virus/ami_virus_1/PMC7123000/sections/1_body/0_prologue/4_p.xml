<p id="Par5">CoVs are enveloped and pleomorphic, 60–160 nm in diameter. Swine CoV shaves single-stranded, polyadenylated, large genomic RNA (25–30 kDa) of positive-sense polarity that is infectious. The genome profile, replication strategies as well as protein expression match to other human and animal CoVs (Enjuanes and Van der Zeijst

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1993</xref>). Most porcine CoVs have four basic structural proteins: a large surface glycoprotein (S, spike protein that forms a monolayer of club-shaped spikes defined as the corona); a small membrane protein (E); an integral membrane glycoprotein (M); and a nucleocapsid protein (N). However, PHEV contains a haemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein that forms a second shorter layer of surface spikes (de Groot et al.
