<p id="Par7">While there is no evidence of the existence of different PEDV serotypes (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2015a</xref>), genetically, PEDV strains are classified into two groups: (1) classical (isolates from Eurasia that are genetically similar to the prototype CV777 strain) and (2) emerging PEDV strains (Lin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2016</xref>; Vlasova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2014</xref>). All classical PEDV strains contain inserts and omissions in the spike gene (S INDEL) that are not present in the majority of the highly virulent emerging PEDV strains (Vlasova et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">2014</xref>). Thus, these highly virulent strains that originally emerged in China in 2010 and transmitted to the USA, Europe and other Asian parts are referred to as emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains. Recombinants between these two major groups of PEDV contain a set of deletions-insertions in their spike gene identical to those of the classical strains. They are called S INDEL strains and circulate in Asia, Europe and the USA. Additionally, a few reports described other uncommon PEDV variants that bear large deletions (194â€“216 aa) in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein and designated as S1 NTD-del type of PEDV (Diep et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2017</xref>; Oka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">2014</xref>; Suzuki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">2015</xref>). Unlike the altered tissue tropism from enteric TGEV to respiratory PRCV, these (S INDEL and S1 NTF have been reported-del) PEDV strains have kept their enteric predilection, but with lower virulence (Suzuki et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2016</xref>; Hou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2017</xref>).
