<p id="Par4">Some emerging infections clearly impact blood safety. The first of these was AIDS. HIV, the causative agent, originated in primates in Africa and was likely transmitted to humans as a result of preparation of meat from such primates. Subsequent human to human transmission probably occurred horizontally via the sexual route and perhaps vertically to infants. Large-scale emergence of the disease was attributable to travel and extensive sexual networks, particularly among men having sex with other men. Infection is almost invariably chronic, and there is a very long asymptomatic period during which the virus is present in the circulation. This long incubation period was not appreciated at first and resulted in the silent spread of the virus including its transmission by blood transfusion. Ultimately, although HIV/AIDS had a serious negative impact on blood safety and on public confidence, it did stimulate a proactive response to recipient protection.</p>
