<p id="Par6">In 1999, West Nile virus (WNV) was identified for the first time in North America, with a few cases in New York City. In the next few years, it expanded across the continent. In 2002, a total of 23 cases of transfusion transmission were reported in the United States, and there were estimates that hundreds of thousands of individuals had been naturally infected by mosquitoes [

WNV is an arbovirus, transmitted by culicine mosquitoes, and the primary amplifying hosts are birds. Human-to-human transmission does not occur (other than by transfusion), and the human is an accidental, dead-end host. The appearance and scope of the outbreak were completely unexpected. Initially, there was little concern about blood safety, as the previous focus had been on chronic infections. In the case of WNV, the size of the outbreak was such that there was a significant chance of collecting blood from an individual during the short (7–10 day) viremic phase of early infection. The virus now appears to be endemic in the United States with annual periods of human infection and disease.
