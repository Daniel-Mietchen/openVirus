<p id="Par10">Probably the best source of primary information is ProMed-mail, a simple list server that provides frequent bulletins about infectious disease events worldwide (

It is possible to receive documented alerts on human, animal, and plant diseases or to select one or two of these categories. The information is carefully curated for reliability, and, in many cases, brief commentary is appended to the news item. All postings are also maintained in a web-based searchable database. In normal use, one or two posts are received each day via e-mail and each report may have up to four or five different items. High profile outbreaks may be followed, as updates are posted as appropriate.
