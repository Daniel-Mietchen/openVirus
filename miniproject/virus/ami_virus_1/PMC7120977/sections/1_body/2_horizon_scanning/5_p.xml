<p id="Par13"> Horizon scanning using these tools, however, only identifies and perhaps describes the extent of an outbreak but does not usually provide any information about its implications for blood safety. As a broad generalization, to be transfusion-transmissible, an infectious agent must have an asymptomatic phase during which the agent is present in the blood. This requirement reduces concern about many respiratory and enteric infections. Even so, precautions may be appropriate if the transmission route is not clearly known, and the epidemiology of the infection involves rapid and extensive spread, as was the case for SARS. In this case, WHO rapidly recommended precautions to protect blood safety.</p>
