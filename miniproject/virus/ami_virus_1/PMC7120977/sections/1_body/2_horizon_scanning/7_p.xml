<p id="Par15">An interesting, but rare event would be the recognition of a transfusion-transmitted infection before an outbreak of the disease had been established. It could be argued that this is possible in special circumstances, and, indeed, some viruses have been identified in the context of searches for otherwise unknown hepatitis viruses. However, the viruses identified this way do not appear to be pathogenic. On the other hand, it is true that astute physicians reported the earliest (unexpected) evidence of transfusion transmission of some known agents. West Nile virus is good example of this situation.</p>
