<p id="Par40">The WHO considers that the minimum requirement for blood safety is to test for syphilis, HBV, HCV, and HIV. This expectation has largely been met, but this is an incomplete approach to minimizing transfusion-transmitted infections, particularly if only a single test is used. However, not every country or blood system has the resources to go beyond the minimum requirement. It is unrealistic to expect that all countries should meet the same standard, no matter how desirable that is. Another issue is that risks do vary geographically, as exemplified by Chagas disease and HTLV, so additional local measures may be appropriate. An obvious question is the role of pathogen reduction in the developing world. Clearly, it would be desirable to use this technology to displace the need for other interventions, but this is offset by concerns about costs and appropriate infrastructure. Some methods have been evaluated in thisenvironment, but it is probably too early to assess their true potential and benefit.</p>
