<p id="Par18">This latter experience suggests that, in some circumstances, it may be possible to predict outbreaks of certain diseases. Indeed, there have been organized efforts to do exactly this for some arboviral diseases in Europe. More specifically, careful analysis of environmental, meteorological, and human movement parameters can identify likely areas for the presence of particular mosquito vectors. Evaluation of population travel patterns can be used to indicate the risk of introduction of a given agent into these areas and thus to target areas of potential risk for an outbreak. These methods have been successfully implemented for malaria, WNV, and dengue [
