<p id="Par16">Given the available information, is it possible to predict an outbreak of a transfusion-transmitted infection and thus be fully prepared when the outbreak occurs? The simple answer is “sometimes,” but the inherent problem is that emerging infections are themselves not predictable. The situation is made more complex by the fact that, currently, in most cases the best intervention is to develop and implement a sensitive test for donated blood. Industry is understandably not usually willing to commit to test development until the market need is apparent, a situation usually linked to demonstrated transfusion transmissions of the emerging agent. However, it is clear that the extent and urgency of the eventual intervention are associated with the severity of the disease.</p>
