<p id="Par17">Recently, tropical arboviruses have been a matter of particular concern in the Americas, and they illustrate different circumstances. The appearance of West Nile virus in the United States in 1999 could not have been predicted. In contrast, the appearance of Zika virus in the United States led to rapid and perhaps overzealous implementation of universal testing [

In this case, however, there was an immediate history of the rapid spread of other tropical arboviruses (most notably chikungunya virus) throughout the Caribbean and South America and subsequently into Puerto Rico and to other mainland areas in the United States with a high density of vector competent mosquitoes. This, in addition to the association of the virus with the severe impact of Zika virus on the fetus, encouraged manufacturers to research the development of appropriate test systems, and testing was in place at essentially the same time as the appearance of autochthonous infections on the US mainland.
