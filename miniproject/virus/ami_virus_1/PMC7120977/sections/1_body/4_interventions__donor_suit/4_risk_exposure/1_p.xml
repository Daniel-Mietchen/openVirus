<p id="Par24">Donors may be asked q uestions about circumstances that are known, or thought, to offer increased risk of infection with specific agents. This is again a long-standing practice, which should be open to review and change as more effective and accurate measures become available. The risks that are generally considered relate to contact with known cases of a specific disease, exposure to environments where transmission risk is increased (such as a prison) or travel from an area known or thought to offer risk. Most recently, this approach has been invoked in the United States for travel to areas affected by outbreaks of Zika virus, although the questioning stopped once universal donor testing was put in place. Residence in areas with ongoing risk of vCJD is another example. Conversely, a number of countries ask questions designed to avoid collecting blood from people who have recently traveled from the United States, as a measure to reduce risk of West Nile virus infection. This approach is potentially sensitive but has very poor specificity. It has the advantage that it can be i mplemented (and abandoned) relatively quickly. This type of questioning can have a significant effect on blood supplies, as a broadly based travel question, for example, can impact 3% or more of all donors.</p>
