<p id="Par25">The third class of questions ask the presenting donor whether or not he or she has engaged in activities or behaviors known to be associated with infection, usually by a specific known agent or group of agents. These questions tend to be intrusive and may, in many cases, require self-reporting of behaviors that may be socially challenging, such as improper injecting drug use. In other cases, the donor may well feel that the questions are discriminatory to a given lifestyle or sexual affinity; this is particularly the case with questions intended to elicit risk for HIV infection. This situation is not readily ameliorated, particularly when specific questions are required by the regulator. There have been attempts to avoid this situation through educational activities designed to encourage self-deferral prior to interview or to give donors the opportunity to indicate that his or her donation should not be used for transfusion (confidential unit exclusion, or CUE). In the United States, CUE has been essentially abandoned as evaluative studies suggested that it was of little benefit. There is published evidence that donors do not always respond accurately to some of these risk behavior questions. A number of studies indicate that around 2% of accepted donors will acknowledge in post-donation studies that they had risk behaviors that should have disqualified them from donation [

There is interest and discussion about development of risk questions that do not lead to a sense of discrimination among some donors, but this is not necessarily easy. However, as we develop increasingly sensitive tests and pathogen inactivation, it is to be hoped that such donor questioning could be eliminated.
