<p id="Par21">It is not always recognized that the process for identifying donor populations has a significant impact on the infectious risk profile, as demonstrated by the decreased prevalence of infection markers among first-time donors compared to the population at large; however, this issue will not be discussed here. Neither will routine donor evaluations of self-reported health and vital signs be discussed, although some of these measures undoubtedly eliminate a number of donors in the early acute phase of infections. Of more relevance to this chapter are strategies that are implemented in order to reduce the risk of specific infections. These generally reflect specific questioning of potential donors in order to determine medical history, exposure risk, or behavioral risk for given infections.</p>
