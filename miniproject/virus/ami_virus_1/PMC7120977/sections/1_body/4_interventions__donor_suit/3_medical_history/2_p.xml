In most blood systems, donors are encouraged, after donation, to inform the blood center of any illness or symptoms occurring during the few days following their donation. This implies that an infectious agent could have been circulating in the donorâ€™s blood and allows the blood center to recover the donation prior to its release or use. This approach is known as passive PDI. However, in situations where there is a known risk, such as the presence of an ongoing outbreak, an active form of PDI has, on occasion, been used [

In this case, the blood product is quarantined, and its donor is contacted within a few days, and the product is released only after the donor has affirmed that there were no symptoms post-donation. This approach is difficult to employ for platelets, because of their short shelf life.
