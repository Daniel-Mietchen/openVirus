<p id="Par22">This approach is frequently used when a novel infection occurs but prior to the recognition of its cause and the development of appropriate tests. Perhaps the most obvious example of this approach was questioning presenting donors about a history of viral hepatitis, which was implemented long before the etiology of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis was understood. Arguably, the question likely did prevent some transmissions because of the chronic nature of infection by at least some hepatitis viruses, but would have been ineffective in the face of asymptomatic infection. This intervention has mostly been abandoned in the face of effective testing protocols. Asking prospective donors about symptoms of given infections has continued and was an important component of early efforts to impact the risk of transmission of HIV. More recently, questions about the symptoms of tropical arbovirus infections have also been introduced, at least pending the availability of suitable screening tests. In general, however, this approach is neither sensitive nor specific. There have been some instances where such questioning has been eliminated when shown to be ineffective.</p>
