<p id="Par2">The safety of the blood supply has been a matter of concern from the outset with the successive recognition of transfusion-transmitted syphilis, closely followed by hepatitis outbreaks. Indeed, hepatitis was, for many years, regarded as an accepted and intractable outcome of transfusion, particularly in the United States. In the late 1950s and the 1960s, there were concerted efforts to understand and to minimize this problem, culminating in the recognition of causative agents and implementation of specific donor tests. However, it was not until the AIDS crisis in the 1980s that safety became an overriding priority. In retrospect, AIDS was a harbinger of the global dissemination of a transfusion-transmissible, epidemic infection. This set the scene for aggressive attention to blood safety but also established the expectation that there might be other transfusion-transmissible disease outbreaks in the future, but the fear was focused on chronic, parenterally transmitted agents. Agents with the potential for transfusion transmission must have an asymptomatic phase with circulation in the blood, must survive the processes inherent in collection and storage of blood, and must be infectious by the intravenous route. The advent of West Nile fever in the United Sates was yet another unexpected threat to blood safety, but it has been followed by a cascade of other global outbreaks of tropical arboviruses with actual or theoretical implications to the blood supply. The issue is whether or not there are means to foresee and defend against such events.</p>
