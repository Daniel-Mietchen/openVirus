<p id="Par29">The most obvious direct testing method is by microscopic observation, as performed, for example, for malaria. However, this approach is very insensitive, and it is confined to agents that are visible by light microscopy. Thus it is restricted to parasites and bacteria and cannot be used for viral infections. Because only a very small volume of sample can be observed, there is also a serious constraint in the sensitivity of testing: for malaria, for example, 50 to 100 parasites per microliter are routinely identified although a highly skilled operator may be able to recognize as few as 5 per microliter.</p>
