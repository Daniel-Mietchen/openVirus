<p id="Par30">In many countries, platelet concentrates are routinely evaluated for the presence of bacteria, which may readily proliferate during room-temperature storage of the component. In most cases, a sample of the platelet product is used to inoculate a culture bottle, which is then incubated in an automated device, routinely used for diagnostic blood cultures in the hospital environment [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The device monitors the products of bacterial growth in the bottles. If the platelet sample contains viable bacteria, then growth is detected, in most cases, within 24Â h, a time at which the parent product is released. Mounting evidence, however, indicates that this method may detect only about 50% of contaminated platelets, most often because the relatively small sample taken for testing did not capture one or more of the contaminating bacteria, which are initially at very low concentration in the component. Despite these issues, bacterial culture has resulted in a measureable decrease in the incidence of patient septic reactions attributable to bacterial contamination in platelets.
