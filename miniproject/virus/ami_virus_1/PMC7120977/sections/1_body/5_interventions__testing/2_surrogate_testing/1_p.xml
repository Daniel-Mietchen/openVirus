<p id="Par27">A definition of surrogate is “substitute,” and this is a useful definition: in the absence of a specific test for the infectious agent itself, a different analyte or characteristic is used. In the case of surrogate tests for viral hepatitis, tests that are commonly used to detect liver damage (most often blood tests for alanine aminotransferase [ALT]) were used. Clearly, there is a rationale behind this approach, but it was eventually shown to be neither sensitive nor specific. It was, however, in general use until the implementation of a specific test for hepatitis C antibodies. More controversial was the use of a test for antibodies to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) in order to reduce the risk of transmission of HIV, prior to the actual recognition of that virus. This approach was based upon epidemiologic data showing that many AIDS patients also had anti-HBc. This was because the hepatitis B virus shared some of the same transmission routes as HIV, although this was, of course, not clear until the virus had been characterized. Ironically, testing for anti-HBc was eventually mandated in the United States, as an additional measure to reduce the transmission of hepatitis B virus by transfusion. A number of other surrogate tests have been used, but generally only on a small scale, and mostly in the context of AIDS, prior to the availability of tests for antibodies to HIV. As noted above, surrogate tests usually lack both specificity and sensitivity, and it is difficult to explain the meaning of an abnormal test result to the donor.</p>
