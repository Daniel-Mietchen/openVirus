<p id="Par28">The presence of pathogens in blood can be identified by a number of different methods. Conceptually, direct observation of the pathogen is simplest but generally insensitive and dependent on the nature of the agent itself. For many years, testing has been based upon serologic approaches. The apparent prototype was testing for HBV, based upon detection of a viral antigen circulating in the blood, but subsequent to this, almost all chronic transfusion-transmissible infections were detected by tests for antibodies to the agents. Subsequently, in a return to testing directly for the pathogen, nucleic acid testing was implemented for HBV, HCV, and HIV. This approach has proved effective for acute infections such as West Nile fever and Zika.</p>
