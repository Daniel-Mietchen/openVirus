<p id="Par37">As pointed out above, even the most sensitive serologic tests demonstrably fail to detect donor infectivity during the window period. This failure led directly to the adoption of tests for viral nucleic acids as a further supplement to serologic tests. It is of some interest to note that the practice actually originated in parts of Europe and that the initial objective was to reduce the prolonged window period for HCV. In the United States, however, the major driver for adoption was the further reduction of risk of transmission of HIV. Many blood systems now routinely test all donations for HBV, HCV, and HIV using multiplex NAT, either singly or in mini pools [

The analytic sensitivity of these methods is in the range of a few copies per mL, and their use has reduced the residual risk of transfusion transmission to less than one per million in the United States. Additionally, NAT is used as the sole approach to detection of WNV and Zika virus, both of which are arboviruses causing acute infection. For these (and similar viruses), serologic tests are of little use, as infectivity appears to be absent once antibodies are detectable.
