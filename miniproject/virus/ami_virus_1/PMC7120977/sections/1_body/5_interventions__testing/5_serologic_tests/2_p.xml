<p id="Par32">The test for HBV was based upon an unusual characteristic of the virus, that is, the production of excess viral coat material (HBsAg), which circulates in the blood stream. The levels of HBsAg are often enough to be detected by simple test methods, such as agar gel diffusion. Indeed, when routine testing was introduced in the early 1970s, tests were based upon some form of passive or active gel diffusion. Those tests were soon supplanted by radioimmunoassay, which was itself replaced by enzyme immunoassays. Subsequently, other detector systems, such as chemiluminescence, have been introduced, but the principle is the same. In some countries, including the United States and Japan, additional testing is now performed for the HBV antibody to core antigen (anti-HBc), in order to identify donors with occult HBV infection (OBI), which is defined as HBV infection without detectable HBsAg.</p>
