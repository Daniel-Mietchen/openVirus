<p id="Par35">A further development for HCV and HIV testing has been the development of the so-called fourth-generation serologic tests. These tests detect antibodies but also simultaneously may detect viral antigens, which are detectable during the latter part of the window period. The level of viral antigens is low and not comparable to the high levels of HBsAg. Nevertheless, this approach adds some additional level of safety in circumstances where NAT is not available.</p>
