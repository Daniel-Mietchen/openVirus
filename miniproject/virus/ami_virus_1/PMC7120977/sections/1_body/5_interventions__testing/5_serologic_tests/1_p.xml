<p id="Par31">At least until the end of the twentieth century, transfusion-transmissible agents of most concern were all responsible for chronic infections: syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV, HTLV, and malaria. A common feature of all of these infections is the ability of the infectious agent to persist in the face of the immune response. Consequently, the presence of circulating antibodies is frequently an indication that the infectious agent is present. Because antibody is usually present at much greater level than the agent itself, serologic testing is more sensitive than direct detection. Of the pathogens listed immediately above, all but HBV were detected in donations (at least initially) solely by tests for the corresponding antibodies.</p>
