<p id="Par36">A number of rapid tests for keymarkers for HBV, HCV, and HIV are available. They are usually based upon lateral flow technology and generate a result in around 15 min. Although logistically attractive, they are not generally recommended for blood donor testing as they are less sensitive than standard tests. However, they are definitely better than not testing at all and may be of value in locations without available resources for full-scale testing. In China and some other locations, rapid tests for HBsAg are used for first-pass testing to avoid collection of blood from donors with positivefindings, thus saving resources [
