<p id="Par26">Although the interventions noted above likely eliminate the majority of donors and donations offering the risk of infection, those methods are neither sensitive nor specific and may be unreliable. There is little question that testing methods are currently perceived as the most significant blood safety intervention. Conceptually, this approach was initiated at some level as a result of cases of transmission of syphilis by transfusion, but the origins of current technology came from attempts to manage the transmission of viral hepatitis by transfusion. These efforts started before the causative agents of hepatitis were characterized or isolated, so the original focus was on the use of liver function tests – an approach known as surrogate testing . The recognition the association of what we now know as hepatitis B surface antigen with one form of transfusion-transmissible hepatitis in the late 1960s led directly to testing that is still in place. Posttransfusion hepatitis continued to occur, however, and it took another 20 years to isolate the hepatitis C virus. In the interim, AIDS and its agent HIV appeared, and testing started in 1985 in the United States. It became apparent that these early tests were not able to identify all infectious donations, and, staring in 1999, additional testing for viral nucleic acids was initiated.</p>
