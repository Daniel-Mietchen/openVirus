<p id="Par39">Pathogen reduction , based upon pathogen inactivation technology, offers considerable promise in the context of blood safety. At the time of writing, methods to treat plasma and platelet concentrates are commercially available and in use in a number of countries. Methods for treatment of whole blood and red cell concentrates are in development, and some are in clinical trials. The most promising methods have been shown to inactivate 5 or more log
 <sub>10</sub> of infectivity of many viruses and bacteria, in the absence of significant impact on blood components. There is documented evidence that a method used on platelet concentrates has essentially eliminated the risk of bacterial sepsis after implementation in France, Belgium, and Switzerland [

This system has also been approved in place of bacterial culture. Currently, however, it is unclear whether use of pathogen reduction will entirely supplant all other tests in current use.
