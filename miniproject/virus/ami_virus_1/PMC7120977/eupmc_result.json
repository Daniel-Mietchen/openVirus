    "The transmission of infectious disease by blood transfusion has been a major problem since the middle of the twentieth century. Since about 1960, there has been a concerted and prolonged effort to reduce or eliminate this outcome; the efforts have been successful, but new challenges continue to appear, mostly in the form of emerging infectious diseases. This chapter reviews two relevant issues: the possibility of predicting microbial threats to blood safety and the interventions that may be used to reduce the risks of transfusion transmission. While there are only limited opportunities to predict relevant infections, there are effective measures to enhance blood safety. These involve appropriate selection of donors, implementation of effective tests, and development and implementation of pathogen reduction."
