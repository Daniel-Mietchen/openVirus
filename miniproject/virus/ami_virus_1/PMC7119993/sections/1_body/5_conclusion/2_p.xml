<p>Viral and pollutant triggers demonstrate that the highly complex inflammatory asthmatic response is called forth on many more occasions than simply by the contact of pollen grains and other allergens with the respiratory tract. Since so much of immune inflammation seems to have arisen from the need to combat infection, the interaction between asthmatic inflammation and viral infection is a natural topic for further investigation. Some of the most significant advances in medical care have come through the treatment and prevention of viral illnesses, and furthering the understanding of respiratory viruses is a worthy priority for the future study of asthma prevention and treatment. In addition to natural harmful infectious particles, humans in recent decades have added many substances of their own creation, including the molecules and particles that constitute indoor and outdoor air pollution. Control of this problem is very important for overall respiratory health.</p>
