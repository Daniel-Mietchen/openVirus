<p>This chapter has examined some of the most significant initiating and exacerbating causes of asthma. Viral respiratory infections, and to a lesser extent air pollution, are common triggers of exacerbations and may interact with individuals to affect the development of some forms of asthma. These causal factors do not exist in isolation but rather interact with the personal attributes of each patient, including his or her genetic and environmental background. The role of viruses and pollutants in asthma is important knowledge that has consequences for prevention, treatment, and avoidance of Â­illness. Helpful education may be given to patients and appropriate treatments selected, and health care providers can avoid the considerable human effort and resources wasted on interventions that are useless or harmful.</p>
