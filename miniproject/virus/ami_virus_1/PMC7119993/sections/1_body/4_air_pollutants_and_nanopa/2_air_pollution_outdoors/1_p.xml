<p>Unwanted and/or unhealthy gases and particles make up the components of air pollution. Outdoor air quality issues vary to great extent by specific location and depend on weather and climate, the level of vehicle traffic, and the type of fuel used for energy and manufacture. In the United States, the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS) has established the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) for each of the several pollutants. Carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen dioxide (NO
 <sub>2</sub>), ozone, sulfur dioxide (SO
 <sub>2</sub>), and particulate matter in the air have maximum exposure standards (Fig.
