<p>Acute wheezing may be triggered by exposure to high levels of pollutant gases including nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. Burning of fossil fuels is the main source of these pollutants in most locations. Nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide gases diffuse rapidly and impact upon the wet respiratory tract to produce highly irritating acids. Sulfur dioxide can cause respiratory constriction in asthmatic patients at concentrations of 0.1 ppm when exercising (

 <sub>2</sub>, are also irritating to the upper and lower respiratory tracts at low levels, and patients with asthma are more susceptible to these adverse effects. Higher concentrations of outdoor NO
 <sub>2</sub> were associated with more asthma symptoms in a study of inner city children (
