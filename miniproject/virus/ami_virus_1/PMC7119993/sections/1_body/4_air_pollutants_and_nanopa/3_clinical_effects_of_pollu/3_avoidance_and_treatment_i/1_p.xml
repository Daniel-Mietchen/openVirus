<p>Advice on how to avoid high concentrations of air pollutants is important for asthma patients. Air pollution, like pollens and viruses, follows a seasonal pattern, and knowledge of the local pattern can help the primary physician with diagnosis and treatment. In the United States, a daily Air Quality Index (AQI) is computed and distributed for most large population areas. The AQI, which is determined on the basis of the highest pollutant of the day, may be considered safe for patients with chronic respiratory disease if less than 50 (green zone). On days with poor air quality, asthma sufferers should come inside where pollutant levels are typically much lower. Indoor ozone levels vary from 10 to 80% of outdoor concentrations, depending on the size of outdoor air flows into a building (
