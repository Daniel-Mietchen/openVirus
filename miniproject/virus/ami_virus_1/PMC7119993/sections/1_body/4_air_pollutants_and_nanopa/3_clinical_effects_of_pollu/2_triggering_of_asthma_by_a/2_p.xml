<p>Ozone, while of critical importance to global health in the upper atmosphere, is an especially noxious chemical when generated at or near ground level. Ozone (O
 <sub>3</sub>) is not produced directly by traffic or by hydrocarbon burning. Instead, the combination of NO
 <sub>2</sub> and hydrocarbons with air and sunlight form the secondary pollutant ozone. High average ozone and airborne particulate matter were associated with more frequent asthma symptoms and ED visits and hospital stays in a study of asthma sufferers in the San Joaquin Valley in California (
