<p>The study of particulate matter in the air is quite complex, since the exact composition varies geographically. In general, high levels of particulate matter have long been associated in epidemiological studies with increased levels of respiratory disease. Ongoing research is examining the importance of particle size, fine versus more coarse, in asthma and chronic respiratory illness. One study in Turkey showed an 18% rise in asthma admissions when air contained high levels of coarse particles (
