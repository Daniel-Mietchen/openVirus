<p>Since the time of Albert Einstein, scientists have known to be wary of “spooky action at distance.” Particles that affect the respiratory tract must first be dispersed into the air and enter and contact the respiratory tissue to have an effect. These particles vary in size from molecules in the angstrom range (1  ×  10
 <sup>−10</sup> m), to so-called nanoparticles (1–100  ×  10
 <sup>−9</sup> m), to large pollen grains (50  ×  10
 <sup>−6</sup> m), on up to the largest dust particles that can remain suspended in air (about 100  ×  10
 <sup>−6</sup> m).
