<p>In Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, the path taken by system A illustrates how one factor, for example a simple rhinovirus infection, may have very little long-term effect on mucosal inflammation in an individual with no atopic stressors and no genetic propensity toward asthma. This individual will return quickly to equilibrium and a low inflammatory state. The path of system B illustrates how multiple stressors, including genetic factors and atopic immune development, may interact with a viral infection to cause a long lasting or perhaps permanent change in the level of mucosal inflammation. Some details of risk factors will be outlined and discussed in this chapter, but systems biology or systems medicine cannot yet specify each feature of the set of interactions in a way that leads to firm predictions about asthma. Out of the complexity of the systems approach, though, some simple and compact principles do emerge, so that every precondition does not have to be known to predict the outcome of intervention or treatment.
