<p>Viruses that affect asthma are acting on a complex and varied phenotype, and therefore the outcome of each infection can be quite varied. A simple linear cause-and-effect relationship between a viral infection and an asthmatic episode usually does not exist. Kochâ€™s modified postulates for infection-caused disease are: 
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>The microorganism must be present in every case of the disease.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The microorganism must be isolated from a diseased organism and grown in pure culture.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The cultured microorganism should cause disease when introduced into a healthy organism.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The microorganism must be recovered from an inoculated, diseased experimental host.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
