<p>Viral species influence asthma in the various age groups in different ways. Age is a marker for the development and maturation of the immune system, which diversifies greatly over time. As the human body ages, the immune system molds itself to the environment to become a mirror image of specific, usually protein, molecules in the external local surroundings. Age also has an important effect on the physics of scaling in the respiratory system. Airway resistance is inversely proportional to the fourth power of diameter, which enlarges with age until young adulthood and then slowly declines. Small increases in airway diameter therefore lead to huge reductions in airway resistance and give more “breathing room.”</p>
