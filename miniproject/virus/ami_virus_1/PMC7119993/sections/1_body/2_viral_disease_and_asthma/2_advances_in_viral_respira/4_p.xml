<p>The three main types of viruses that are known to affect asthma are HRV, RSV, and influenza.

Many communities can monitor the progress of these annual epidemics with viral culture and molecular diagnostics, thereby giving physicians a higher probability of knowing in advance what virus a patient may have. A molecular diagnostic panel is commercially available for identifying acute viral respiratory infection, though the cost-effectiveness of this type of testing for routine clinical use is yet to be determined.
