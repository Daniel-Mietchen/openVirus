<p>Two thirds or more of acute respiratory tract infections (RTIs) occurring in the community can be identified as viral. Traditionally, these have been divided into upper and lower RTI, but the difference between upper and lower infection seems to be more indistinct than previously believed. Human rhinovirus (HRV), for example, replicates initially in the upper respiratory tract yet may cause extensive lower respiratory tract illness. The frequently used term viral upper RTI (URTI) is somewhat of a misnomer.</p>
