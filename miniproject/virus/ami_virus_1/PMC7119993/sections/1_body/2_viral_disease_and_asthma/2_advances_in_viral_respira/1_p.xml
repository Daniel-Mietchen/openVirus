<p>In most of the twentieth century, the office or hospital diagnosis of viral respiratory infection was most often a good guess, a probability statement. Common and more affordable viral molecular diagnostics, especially reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), and viral culture can now improve the accuracy of the guess when precision is needed. Viruses may be detected in symptomatic or in asymptomatic patients.</p>
