<p>This chapter will look at how viral infections, air pollution, and possibly nanoparticles may act as causal agents of asthma. The concept of causal agent, though, has a variety of different interpretations. In general, agents may act on the respiratory tract to initiate asthma or to exacerbate it. Initiation (or inception or development) of asthma refers to the start of asthma in a patient who was previously entirely free of this problem. An exacerbation (or trigger or precipitating event) means the significant and often sudden worsening of an established chronic asthmatic condition. Avoidance of a proven initiating factor, if possible, could permit the primary prevention of asthma. In contrast, avoidance of triggering events will not halt the disease but only decrease the number of exacerbations in someone who already has chronic illness. In studying and treating asthma, identification of a specific trigger is usually much easier than trying to prove an initiating cause.</p>
