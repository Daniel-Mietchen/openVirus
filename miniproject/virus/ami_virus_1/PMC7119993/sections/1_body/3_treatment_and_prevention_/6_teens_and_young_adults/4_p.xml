<p>Chronic adult diseases of previously unknown cause have occasionally been found, in whole or in part, to have an infectious etiology. These include peptic ulcer disease (

 <italic>Shigella</italic> and 
 <italic>Chlamydia</italic>), and Lyme arthritis (
 <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic>). A survey of asthma patients, of mean age 38, suggested that 45% of initial attacks started after an illness suggestive of a respiratory infection (

Viral and nonviral initiating infectious agents have been proposed for adult “infectious asthma,” including mycoplasma, chlamydia, adenovirus, and adult RSV, but reasonable proof of an infectious mechanism is still pending.
