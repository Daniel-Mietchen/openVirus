<p>Inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) are well known to control the number of wheezing exacerbations in school-age children with chronic persistent asthma, an effect that appears to encompass those episodes caused by viral illness. A survey of school children in Ontario found that children presenting in September to the emergency department for asthma exacerbations, presumably mostly viral triggered, were less likely to have used preventive anti-inflammatory medications than their counterparts who did not have such severe exacerbations (

A preventive effect, though, has not been consistently shown in clinical trials. A study conducted in school-aged children without persistent disease but with a history of viral-triggered wheezing demonÂ­strated that inhaled beclomethasone diproponate was not superior to placebo in reducing future episodes. The inhaled steroid failed to reduce days with symptoms, or the frequency, severity, or duration of episodes of upper or lower respiratory illness (
