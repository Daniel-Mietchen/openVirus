<p>There are several competing classification systems for the wheezing preschool child that aim to help with prognosis and treatment (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). As a conceptual model, one can create two opposing poles. At one pole is the small child who experiences rare mild wheezing with acute viral illness, has no wheezing or cough between episodes, and has no atopy or parental asthma. These children appear to benefit very little or not at all from acute or chronic corticosteroid therapy for viral-triggered wheezing illness (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>). At the other pole are children who wheeze daily or weekly, have an atopic history, have a parental history of asthma, and may be on chronic controller therapy. A viral infection in these children appears to be a trigger that requires a step up in asthma therapy, perhaps to a burst of oral corticosteroids. Between these poles of severity are many children whose therapy must be individualized. The criteria from the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program help select preschool children who may benefit from acute and/or chronic corticosteroids. These guidelines use the Asthma Predictive Index (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>) to specify which wheezy small children have or likely will have chronic asthma and could benefit from various forms of inhaled and oral corticosteroid therapy.
