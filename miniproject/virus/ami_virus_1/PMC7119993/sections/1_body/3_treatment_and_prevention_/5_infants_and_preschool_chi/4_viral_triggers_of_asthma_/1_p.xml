<p>While the factors that contribute to the development of asthma are still unclear, there is little doubt that viral infections act as potent triggers of asthma in preschool children. As noted, HRV is the most potent of triggers, though all HRVs do not seem to be alike. Pathogenicity of HRV appears to vary among groups A, B, and C. HRV-C was found in a study of hospitalized preschool children to be associated with asthma more often than HRV-A (
