One analysis showed that infants reaching 4 months of age at the winter virus peak had a 29% increased risk of developing later asthma compared with those reaching age 1 year at the winter peak (

Nonatopic infants who had received palivizumab (a humanized MAb against RSV) for prevention of RSV infection showed an 80% reduction in risk of recurrent wheezing from ages 2 to 5 (
