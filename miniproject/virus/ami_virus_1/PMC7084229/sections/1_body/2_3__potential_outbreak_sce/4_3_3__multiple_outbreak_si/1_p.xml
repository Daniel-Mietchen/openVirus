<p>Many observations have shown the outbreak of SARS-2 actually started from multiple sites, instead of just a single site, as originally reported [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,
 <xref rid="B52-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,
 <xref rid="B53-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In evaluating the epidemiological patterns of SARS-2 within Wuhan, surrounding Wuhan, and remote from Wuhan, it appears that the incidences of SARS-2 have some distinct patterns. Although the remotely occurring SARS-2 usually have a humanâ€“human linkage and can be traced to a single source of infection, some Wuhan cases and the surrounding cases in Hubei Province still lack reliable sources of infection. Amazingly, most of the SARS-2 patients can be traced to a single unique etiological agent, SARS-CoV-2. How could this likely single source of virus quickly infect so many people in such large geographic area? This is a question that is difficult to answer now, but must be answered in future.
