<p>Currently, some intermediate hosts have been suspected for SARS-COV-2. A study showed that SARS-COV-2 has the same codon usage bias as shown for snakes. Therefore, snake may be the intermediate host for SARS-COV-2 [

However, David Robertson, a virologist from the University of Glasgow, United Kingdom, stated, “Nothing supports the invasion of snakes.” At the same time, Paulo Eduardo Brandão, a virologist from the University of St. Paul, also said, “There is no evidence that snakes can be infected by this new coronavirus and act as hosts” [
