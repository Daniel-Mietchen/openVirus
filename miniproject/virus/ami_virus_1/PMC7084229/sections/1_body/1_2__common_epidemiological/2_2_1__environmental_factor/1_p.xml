<p>SARS-1 broke out in Foshan, Guangdong Province, in November 2002 [
 <xref rid="B6-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. SARS-2 started in Wuhan in Hubei Province no later than early December 2019 [
 <xref rid="B7-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. In China, November and December are winter months, and are the coldest months of the year in these two locations [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Cold temperature usually provides a conducive environmental condition for virus survival. In addition to this, we also noticed that severe drought occurred in both locations at the times of the outbreaks. The annual rainfall in Foshan in December 2002 nearly reached 0 mm [
 <xref rid="B10-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In fact, drought occurred in the whole of Guangdong Province that year, causing more than 1300 reservoirs drying up and 286,000 hectares of farmland suffering drought [
 <xref rid="B11-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Coincidentally, Wuhan also suffered its worst drought in nearly 40 years, with precipitation of only 5.5 mm in December 2019 [

 <xref rid="B13-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These drought conditions were rare for both locations as their average annual precipitations are greater than 1100 mm [
 <xref rid="B8-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], which are higher than the global average annual rainfall of 990 mm, of which 715 mm is over land [
 <xref rid="B14-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Cold, dry conditions are more conducive than cold conditions alone for virus survival [
 <xref rid="B15-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B16-ijerph-17-01633" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. During the cold winter, air-dried virus particles are a dangerous form of virus, which survives for a long period of time in airflows [
