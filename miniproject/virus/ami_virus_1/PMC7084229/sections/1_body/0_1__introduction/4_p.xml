<p>The recent outbreak of “Wuhan pneumonia” in late 2019 in central China has been linked with a new CoV formally identified as SARS-CoV-2. SARS-CoV-2 is not only phylogenetically closely related with SARS-CoV, an etiological agent of SARS, but also uses a same receptor, ACE2, as SARS-CoV does. Thus, even though “Wuhan pneumonia” has been called with various other disease names such as “new coronavirus pneumonia (NCP)” and now as “coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)”, we feel that it may be more appropriate to refer to “Wuhan pneumonia” as “SARS-2” and the previous SARS as “SARS-1” if necessary. The etiological agent for “Wuhan pneumonia” has been changed from “2019-nCoV” to “SARS-CoV-2”. A further change of “COVID-19” into “SARS-2” is logical and reasonable for streamlining taxonomy between disease agent and disease. In this mini-review, we evaluate natural and social factors influencing both 2002 and 2019 SARSs in order to understand some common epidemiological features that may be beneficial for controlling the ongoing epidemic and also for preventing future outbreak. This comprehensive knowledge is also helpful for searching the origin(s) of the viruses and for elucidating their initial occurrence(s).</p>
