  <p>Potential transmission routes for SARS-CoV-2 to humans. Bats carrying SARS-CoV-2 were attracted by green or red lights and settled into insect-rich areas. SARS-CoV-2 transmitted to humans directly or spread to intermediate hosts such as bamboo rats, snakes, and pangolins through batsâ€™ saliva, urine, and feces. Intermediate hosts transmitted SARS-CoV-2 to humans.</p>
