<p id="Par37">CHIKV was circulating in Machala, Ecuador in 2015 (Additional file 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>), and the genomes from this outbreak were found in two separate monophyletic clusters in the Asian genotype MCC tree, indicating two independent introductions of CHIKV into Ecuador (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). Both introductions originated from the Caribbean/USA and were found to have occurred in an interval of 5–6 months, with the first introduction in early 2014 (2014.1; HPD: 2013.7–2014.5) and the second one in mid-2014 (2014.6; HPD: 2014.4–2015.0). Even though the surveillance site was active in 2014, the first CHIKV was sampled in March 2015, indicating a period of silent CHIKV transmission in this region of 8 months (second introduction) to 1.2 years (first introduction). Viruses from the two introductions did not make distinct geographic clusters in the city of Machala, rather, they were dispersed across the city, indicating simultaneous circulation of the two CHIKV strains across the same area (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Interestingly, CHIKV in Colombia was not closely related to either of the Ecuadorian clusters. The virus was disseminated into Colombia from Martinique in mid-2014 (2014.4; HPD: 2014.2–2014.6).
