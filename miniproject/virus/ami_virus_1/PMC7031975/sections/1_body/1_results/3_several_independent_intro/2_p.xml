<p id="Par38">CHIKV genomes from Ecuador were screened for reported mutations that have previously been associated with virus phenotype change in the vector, such as enhanced viral fitness, transmission and infection of the mosquito. As all Asian lineage CHIKV strains, the viruses from Ecuador had the E1:A98T residue change and the E1:K211E change (TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). E1:A98T restricts positive selection of the 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>-adaptive E1:A226V substitution [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. E1:K211E, in combination with E1:V264A and in the presence of E1:A226 wild type, has been described to enhance fitness of the virus in 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti,</italic> and has recently been observed in CHIKV outbreaks in several regions of the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. These results show that CHIKV from Ecuador had not acquired all the mutations that could possibly increase its fitness to the main vector in Ecuador, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>.
