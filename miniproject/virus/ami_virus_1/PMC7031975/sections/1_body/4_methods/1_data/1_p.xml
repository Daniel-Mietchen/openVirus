 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Briefly, subjects (&gt; 6 months age) who were clinically diagnosed with dengue fever at MoH (Ministry of Health) clinic sentinel sites were eligible for participation in this study (index case). Subjects completed an informed consent or assent, as applicable, and research staff collected a blood specimen. Field teams visited the homes of index cases and recruited household members into the study, as well as household members from 4 homes located within 200 m of the index case home. Blood samples were tested at SUNY Upstate Medical University using qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase RT-PCR assays for DENV1–4, CHIKV, and ZIKV (diagnostic protocol described previously) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. RNA extracted from samples that were DENV and CHIKV positive by RT-PCR were sent to WRAIR, Viral Diseases Branch, for full-length sequencing. Samples from 2014 have been sequenced in a previous publication [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Samples from 2015 were sequenced in this study.
