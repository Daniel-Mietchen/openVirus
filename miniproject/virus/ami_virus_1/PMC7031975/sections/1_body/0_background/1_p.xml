<p id="Par29">Arboviruses, especially dengue and yellow fever, are thought to have a long history of presence in the Americas, where numerous suspected outbreaks have been recorded since the 1600s [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Upon discovery of the 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>) mosquito as the main vector for transmission of yellow fever by Walter Reed in year 1900, attempts to eliminate the vector and the diseases it carried were undertaken in the Americas [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Initially the campaigns were highly successful, achieving elimination of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> by 1962 in many Latin American countries, including South American countries of Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Colombia and Paraguay [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, the arboviral vector was not eliminated in other countries such as Venezuela and Cuba, and this, in combination with the steady deterioration of the vector elimination programs over time, resulted in re-expansion of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. As the vector returned, so did the arboviral diseases.
