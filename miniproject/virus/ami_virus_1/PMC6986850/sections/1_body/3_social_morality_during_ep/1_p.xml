<p>Many films dealing with epidemics have tended to see panic as an inevitable social response; their main focus has been the process of authorities withholding information to guard against chaos or the circulation of misinformation by the media. For example, in 
 <italic>Panic on the Streets</italic> (1950, directed by Elia Kazan), to avoid mass panic across the city of New Orleans, the US Public Health Service and the police agree to not notify the press of a death resulting from pneumonic plague. Appearing in the same year, 
 <italic>The Killer That Stalked New York</italic> (1950, Earl McEvoy) was based on an actual threat of smallpox that occurred in New York in 1947. In the film, public health officials develop a widespread vaccination program, but after the necessary serum runs out, the city descends into mass panic—after the authorities tried to cover up this information. In the UK film 
 <italic>80,000 Suspects</italic> (1963, Val Guest), the doctor tackling an outbreak of smallpox uses a quarantining process with the explicitly mentioned goal of reducing the chances of public panic. In 
 <italic>Morte a Venezia</italic> (1971, Luchino Visconti), a film based on the 1912 novel by German author Thomas Mann, 
 <italic>Der Tod in Venedig</italic> [
 <italic>Death in Venice</italic>], the city authorities do not inform those on vacation of cholera problems within the city for fear they will frantically leave—an approach also taken by town officials in John Ford’s depiction of a community during a typhoid epidemic, 
 <italic>Dr. Bull</italic> (1933). Another common feature is defiance of the film’s protagonists against a perceived lack of official information. For example, in 
 <italic>Quiet Killer </italic>(1992, Sheldon Larry), when the doctor realizes that her patient has succumbed to plague, she tries to push authorities to warn the citizens of New York, against considerable reluctance from the mayor, who envisages widespread panic.
