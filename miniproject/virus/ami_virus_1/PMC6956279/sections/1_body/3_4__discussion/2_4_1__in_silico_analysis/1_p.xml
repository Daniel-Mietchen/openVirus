<p>Of the three assays that were selected to be investigated, the Gibb et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] assays were chosen to develop the Duo RT-qPCR assay. Because of the identification of a mismatch at the 3â€² end of the sense primer in the Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="B10-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] assay, an additional primer was designed and included in the subsequent testing, not only in the Duo assay but also in the single-plex assay for comparative analysis. The Gibb et al. [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-07-00652" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] assay was used unchanged (

From 2015 to now, EBOV has caused new epidemics in DRC and Uganda, totaling at least 3606 cases with 2156 deaths; sequences of these recent strains were also theoretically almost perfectly detected based on the in silico analysis (
