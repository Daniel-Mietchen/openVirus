<p>Assays repeatability was assessed by calculating the standard deviation (SD) for the Ct variance, presented in 
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00652-t005" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>. Globally, observed SD are low, which is suggest that repeatability is acceptable, although this merits assessment by specific experiments with a larger number of replicates.
