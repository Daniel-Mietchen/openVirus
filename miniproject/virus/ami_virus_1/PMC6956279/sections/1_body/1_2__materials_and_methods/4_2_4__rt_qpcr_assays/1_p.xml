 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00652-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. RT-qPCR assays were performed on Bio-Rad CFX96™ cyclers. All assays were done by using the standard protocol (
 <xref rid="microorganisms-07-00652-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) with GoTaq Probe 1-Step RT-qPCR (Promega), in a 25 µL total reaction volume including 5 µL Mekambo EBOV RNA or 30 µL total reaction volume including 10 µL of EBOV synthetic RNA. The three home-made RT-qPCR assays were compared with the RealStar
 <sup>®</sup> Filovirus Screen RT-PCR kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics, Hamburg, Germany). Tests using Mekambo EBOV RNA were performed with a ten-fold serial dilution ranging from 10
 <sup>5</sup> to 1 copy per microliter. Tests using the synthetic RNA standard were performed with 5-fold serial dilution ranging from 1 to 0.02 copy per microliter. Seven replicates were tested for each dilution with the three home-made single-target assays and 23 replicates per dilution for the Duo Gibb + Huang RT-qPCR (Gibb/Huang) assay. EBOV synthetic RNA was used to determine the limit of detection (LoD). The LoD is defined as the lowest concentration or amount of analyte required to produce a positive assay in at least 95% of the replicates. LoD was calculated using the IBM SPSS statistic 21 software.
