<p>The combination of % positive tests to Influenza A &amp; B, RSV, paraInfluenza and adenovirus to the daily rates ED visits and hospitalizations with COPD explained 41.4% of the daily variance in ED visits with COPD and explained 39.2% of the daily variance in COPD hospitalizations over the total 11 years (period A). Influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus explained 52.5% of the daily variance in ED visits with COPD and 48.2% of the daily variance in hospitalizations over the final 3 years (period B). The relative influence of individual viruses contributing to the variability is shown in Figs

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228544.g004">4B</xref> for the 5 viruses over the 11-year period (period A) and the 8 viruses over 3 years (period B). Similar to RTIs, most of the variance explained was due to influenza A, RSV, and hRV.
