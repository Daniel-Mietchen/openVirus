<p>The combination of % positive tests to influenza A &amp; B, RSV, paraInfluenza and adenovirus to the daily rates ED visits and hospitalizations with asthma explained 1.5% of the daily variance in ED visits with Asthma and explained 2.7% of the daily variance in asthma hospitalizations over the 11 years. Influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus explained 13.3% of the daily variance in ED visits with asthma and 10.4% of the daily variance in hospital hospitalizations over the final 3 years. The relative influence of individual viruses contributing to the variability is shown in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228544.g003">3C</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228544.g004">4C</xref> for the 5 viruses over the 11-year period and the 8 viruses over3 years. Most of the variance remained unexplained by the prevalence of viruses in the community, except for a modest contribution from hRV and hMPV.
