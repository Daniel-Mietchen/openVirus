<p>The daily % positive response of each virus was correlated with ED visits and hospitalizations for 5 viruses over 11 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>) and 8 viruses over 3 years (
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs and COPD were strongly and similarly influenced by influenza A, followed by RSV, coronavirus, hMPV and then influenza B. ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma were not influenced by any of the viruses with a minor contribution from hRV (r = 0.21, and r = 0.14 respectively).
