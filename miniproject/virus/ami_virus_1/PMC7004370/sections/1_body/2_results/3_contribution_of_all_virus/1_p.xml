<p>The combination of % positive tests to influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza and adenovirus to the daily rates of ED visits and hospitalizations with RTI explained 57.4% of the daily variance in ED visits with RTI and explained 63.8% of the daily variance in RTI hospitalizations in period A. Influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus explained 66.7% of the daily variance in ED visits with RTI and 74.4% of the daily variance in hospital hospitalizations over the final 3 years, period B. The relative influence of individual viruses contributing to the variability is shown in Figs 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228544.g003">3A</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0228544.g004">4A</xref> for the 5 viruses over the 11-year period and the 8 viruses over 3 years, respectively. Most of the variance in RTIs was explained by Influenza A, RSV, and hRV.
