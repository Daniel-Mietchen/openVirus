<p>Viruses cause respiratory tract infections (RTIs), which if severe, can lead to a visit to the Emergency Department (ED) and hospitalization. This places a large burden on healthcare services in primary and secondary care but also puts patients with chronic lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)[
