<p>The Canadian Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance program consists of a network of laboratories, hospitals, physician offices and provincial and territorial ministries of health. The aim of the program is to detect and respond to outbreaks, use data on viruses to improve and inform health programs and policies, and to ensure information gathered in Canada supports international monitoring and is ready in case of any global threats and outbreaks. The surveillance system was setup in 2003 using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect 5 viruses: Influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza and adenovirus and 3 viruses were added in 2010: human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (hRV) and coronavirus. Data is available to the public on a weekly basis up until the present time.</p>
