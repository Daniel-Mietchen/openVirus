<p>Possible explanations for the low rates of ED visits and hospitalizations for asthma and the 45% fall over 11 years is that i) treatment for asthma with inhaled corticosteroids with or without long acting β2 agonists has improved or ii) the prevalence of asthma has decreased or iii) active cases have decreased across Canada. The Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System (OASIS) estimated the actual prevalence of asthma at 12.6% in 2003 and 15.3% in 2013, an increase of 22%[

This is calculated using a health administrative data case definition of ≥ 2 outpatient claims in 2 consecutive years or ≥ 1 hospitalization(s) for asthma. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) estimates that the age-standardized prevalence rates of ‘active’ cases, defined as at least one physician claim or ≥ 1 hospitalizations(s) among Canadian in 2003 was 3.3% and this decreased to 2.8%, representing a fall in incidence rates from 723 per 10
