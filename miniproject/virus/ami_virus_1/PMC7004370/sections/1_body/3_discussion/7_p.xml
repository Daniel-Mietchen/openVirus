<p>There are some important limitations worth noting. First, this analysis was done on 2 separate databases which are unlinked and hence a positive virus detection is not linked with the individual attending the ED. However, the accuracy and validity of the database can be corroborated by the peak in ED visits and hospitalizations with RTIs but not COPD seen in 2009 due to the H1N1 epidemic. Second, the database is based on coding performed by physicians and administrators in the healthcare system, hence there is a potential for miss-classification. Third, the study was not designed to investigate co-infection with multiple viruses. Fourth, as this is a population-based database, we do not have access to additional potentially confounding variables such as medical co-morbidities, allergy status, and medication usage, however, we are currently in the process of acquiring the data for age and gender. Fifth, we do not have information about the day the clinical sample for virus testing was taken in relation to the start of the symptoms. It is possible that virus detection rates may be able altered depending on the day the test was done. Sixth, we do have quantitative PCR data for viral loads, which may be useful at investigating the strength of relationship between virus, severity of illness and hospitalizations. Seventh, each hospital performs nasopharyngeal swabs on the individual patients at their respective sites and different multiplex PCR panels and assays are used for virus testing as universal use of a single multiplex panel is unlikely to be achieved. Each laboratory is licensed in Ontario and are required to undergo quality assurance, auditing and proficiency testing conducted by The Institute for Quality Management in Healthcare.</p>
