<p>The case for a causative role for viral respiratory infections in causing exacerbations of COPD and RTIs is strong and explains the concordant temporal relationship with the prevalence of the common respiratory viruses in the community. Our data is in keeping with other studies demonstrating COPD exacerbations coincide with the prevalence of respiratory viruses[

The higher proportion of patients hospitalized with COPD compared to with RTIs in our study is likely due to a number of disease processes and risk factors such as the presence of chronic airflow limitation, emphysema, smoking, ageing, and associated co-morbidities such as heart failure.
