<p>Our finding that hRV is the dominant virus in asthma is in keeping with previous data that showed hRV is detected in 33% of adults with exacerbations[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] and two-thirds of children presenting to the ED with an asthma attack were due to hRV[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. A recent pooled meta-analysis of 60 studies across all ages and continents found the prevalence of respiratory viruses associated with asthma exacerbations was &lt;15%, except hRV which was 42%[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although hRV had the highest prevalence in both children and adults, there were some notable difference: children were more positive for RSV and hRV, whilst adults were more positive for influenza, coronavirus and parainfluenza. These age-related changes in viral detection rates was also evident during the yearly cycle, where children &lt;3 month were mainly positive between the months of Jan-March, whilst those aged between 3–18 were positive in Sept-Nov[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Human rhinovirus also occurs in seasonal epidemics in our data, particularly in seasons where influenza and RSV epidemics are much lower. Previously 20% of all hospital admissions of school aged children in Canada were shown to occur in September, attributed predominantly to hRV[

 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Importantly, hRV has recently also been linked with mortality in asthmatics, elderly and in those in long term care facilities [

 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. It is likely that factors related to hRV species and type [
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], along with age, host risk factors determine the severity of symptoms on presentation to the ED may explain the lack of overall relationship to viral epidemics in our data. Data relating to the effects of age and gender in our dataset is not yet to be fully available but will add an important dimension to the current data.
