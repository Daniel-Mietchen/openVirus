<p>Numerous studies have previously shown 50–85% of asthma exacerbations are reported to coincide with the detection of respiratory viruses[

 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], however they were mainly in cohort studies of children with asthma and often with intensive community monitoring longitudinally[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The average detection rates of viruses in incidental studies during exacerbations of asthma were much lower at 24%, with 32% in children and only 13% in adults[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Furthermore, virus detection was more prevalent when asthmatics were more symptomatic with wheeze, likely due to a more severe acute illness[
 <xref rid="pone.0228544.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Therefore, the low rates of % positive viruses in our study could be explained by the fact that this was an unselected population of the whole of Ontario with children and adults, ED visits likely represent less severe illness in asthma compared with COPD.
