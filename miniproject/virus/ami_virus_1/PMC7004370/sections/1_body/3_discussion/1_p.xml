<p>The approach adopted in this study is novel in that we begin with the prevalence of positive tests for a particular respiratory virus (or viruses) in the community on any given day and its contribution to ED visits and hospitalizations with RTI, COPD and asthma over an 11-year period using a multiplex PCR technique. The key findings of this study were: i) ED visits and hospitalizations were highest for RTIs and COPD and follow similar daily patterns, ii) between 41% and 74% of RTIs and COPD related ED visits and hospitalizations can be attributed to respiratory viruses, iii) asthma related visits and hospitalizations were the lowest, with a 45% reduction over the 11 year period and, iv) only human rhinovirus had a minor contribution to asthma.</p>
