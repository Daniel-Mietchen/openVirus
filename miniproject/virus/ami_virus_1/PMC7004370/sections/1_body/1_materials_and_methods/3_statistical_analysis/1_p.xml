<p>The population of Ontario increased from 12,251,405 in 2003 to 13,606,541 in 2013. The daily ED visits and hospitalizations were expressed per 10
 <sup>5</sup> of the population. The daily rates for ED visits and hospitalizations with RTI, COPD and Asthma were transformed using the natural log (e) of the rates to achieve normal distribution and subsequently used in all analyses. Influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus was studied over 11 years (Period A) and Influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus over the final 3 years (Period B). The contribution of individual viruses was performed using the Pearson correlation co-efficient. The collective contribution of influenza A &amp; B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human rhinovirus (hRV) and coronavirus was addressed using multiple regression analysis and the relative strength of each virus to the total variability as the standardized beta value. All analyses were performed in TIBCO Statistica (Academic Package v13.2).
