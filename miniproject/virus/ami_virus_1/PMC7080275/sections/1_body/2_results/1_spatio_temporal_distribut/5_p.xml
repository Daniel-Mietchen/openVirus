<p>The probability of DENV establishing itself for at least two consecutive dengue incident months was assessed as a function of island population size, the number of cases in the first month and DENV serotype. We first assumed that at least two consecutive months with dengue cases was evidence of within-island transmission and not simply importation. The probability of consecutive dengue incident months increased with both population size and number of cases in Month 1, reaching an asymptote at a population size in excess of 10 000 individuals and 30 dengue cases (Multivariate logistic regression, Log(10) population size: Odds Ratio (OR) for unit increase in log (10) population size = 3.36, 95% CI 2.68–4.22, P&lt;0.001; Log(10) cases: OR for unit increase in log (10) case number = 21.7, 95% CI 13.6–34.4, P&lt;0.001) (

This suggests that the number of cases in month 1 has a strong impact on the probability of subsequent incident months up to a relatively low number of cases, beyond which there is no increased probability. This increased risk is also observable with population size, but to a lesser extent (lower OR). DENV serotype (DENV-1, -2, -3, -4, or mixed -1 and -3) was not found to be associated with the probability of DENV transmission during two consecutive months (Wald χ

 <sub>4</sub> = 7.62, P = 0.17). Re-analysis excluding Tahiti revealed the same asymptote for dengue cases but no asymptote whatever the population size, with increase in probability up to the maximum population size of approximately 17 000 in Moorea. Increasing the duration requirement to three consecutive months across all islands yielded an increased OR for log (10) population size (OR = 4.76, 95%CI 3.80–5.96) and for log (10) cases (OR = 36.56, 95%CI 21.35–62.65). No population size asymptote was attained, but again an asymptote in the probability of having three consecutive months of transmission was observed at approximately 30 cases in the first month.
