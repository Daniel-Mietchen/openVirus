<p>Wavelet power spectrum of time series data from 12 of the most populated islands of French Polynesia are displayed in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008110.s008">S7</xref> Figs. These 12 time series were chosen because they had enough dengue cases. In general, periodicities were detected in the 1-year, 2-year, 2–3-year and 6-year bands emphasizing that the seasonality is not marked and that each epidemic wave can last longer than 1 year. However, dengue dynamics varied across the 12 time series. To analyze these differences between time series wavelet cluster analysis [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008110.g005">Fig 5</xref> shows the dendrogram obtained from wavelet clustering. Except for the time series from Hiva Oa, all others time series group by subdivision. Taking into account this subdivision arrangement for dengue dynamics, we applied WMF to quantify the synchrony inside each subdivision. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008110.g006">Fig 6</xref> displays the results from WMF showing, for each subdivision, the common significant periodic components for which time series are synchronized highlighting each epidemic wave. This analysis demonstrates the differences among subdivisions in dengue periodicity, notably over the 1-year, 2-year, 2–3-year and 6-year periods. However, it is notable that the 2009–2010 DENV-4 epidemic is synchronous in three subdivisions (Leeward, Windward and Marquesas islands), with a significant periodicity spreading over the 1–3 year band highlighting again the absence of seasonality of this epidemic.
