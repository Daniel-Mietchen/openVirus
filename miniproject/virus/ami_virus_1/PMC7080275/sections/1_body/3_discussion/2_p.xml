<p>More generally across the entirety of French Polynesia, three of the eight epidemics fizzled out after a relatively short period without any apparent change in climatic conditions and the virus continued circulating at a low level for an extended time before finally dying out. These three epidemics are: the DENV-4 1979 epidemic that lasted for 6 months but then persisted at a low level for another 113 months; the DENV-2 1996/7 epidemic that lasted for 9 months, before persisting for another 42 months; and the DENV-4 2009 epidemic that lasted for 8 months, before persisting for additional 15 months at sub-epidemic levels (

However, it is unclear whether DENV-2 died out alone as the last DENV-2 case was reported in December 2000 and the first DENV-1 case was reported the following month. Interestingly, two of the situations, where self-extinction occurred several months before the detection of a new serotype, involved DENV-4.
