<p id="Par37">RVFV is remarkably distributed in the eastern region of the DRC starting from the South to the North extremity. This region constitutes long borders with Zambia, Tanzania, Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda and South Sudan. Most of these countries are known to be endemic of Rift Valley fever [

Considering the largest cattle population in eastern DRC, the situation represents a real health threat that needs more attention. The role of population movement in the emergence and spread of mosquito-borne viruses have been illustrated in a recent study of a yellow fever outbreak which started in Angola and was imported to the DRC through trans-boundary trade between the two countries [

Environmental and climate factors, human activities and population movement are likely contributing enormously to the emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne viruses. An exponential demographic growth of Kinshasa with poor environmental hygiene and low urbanisation level is likely to have favoured
