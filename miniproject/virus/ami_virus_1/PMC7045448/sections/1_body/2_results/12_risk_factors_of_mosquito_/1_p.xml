<p id="Par33">Numerous factors might have contributed to the emergence and re-emergence of mosquito-borne viral infections in DRC. These driving factors range from demographic, socioeconomic, environmental to climatic factors. Moreover, evidence of population movement as key driving factor of spreading yellow fever has been documented [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. For instance, the WNV outbreak in Kisangani started at army camps where immigrated soldiers from different locations across the whole country were concentrated before it spread to another area [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In Gemena city, the yellow fever outbreaks have been observed during large deforestation activities [

The overall geographical distribution of both mosquito-borne viruses and their potential vectors species seemed to be influenced by climate distribution pattern in DRC. The majority of outbreaks or positive cases occurred during the rainy seasons. The West Nile outbreak was preceded by heavy rainfall in Kisangani in 1998 [
