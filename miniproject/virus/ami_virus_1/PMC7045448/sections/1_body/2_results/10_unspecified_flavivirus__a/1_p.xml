<p id="Par31">Significantly high rates of neutralizing antibodies against flaviviruses and alphaviruses have been reported in buffaloes, elephants, gorillas and duikers from the Congo River basin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In Kinshasa, alphavirus and flavivirus RNA in mosquito pools have been amplified with the primers targeting a conserved region of these genera, but none of these mosquito pools have been amplified with specific primers for CHIKV, ONNV, YFV, WNV or DENV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. All these observations are likely to indicate the presence of several unidentified mosquito-borne viruses circulating in DRC. Therefore, further studies are needed to extend investigations about other mosquito-borne virus species instead of focusing only on well-known MBVs.
