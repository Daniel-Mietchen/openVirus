<p id="Par29">In the DRC, antibodies against WNV in humans have been detected by virus neutralization tests, first in 1942 in Buta, Ango and Bondo from Bas-Uélé Province located in the north-eastern part, and later in 1963 from Gemena in Sud-Ubangi in the north-western part [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. The seroprevalence in these areas varied greatly from 2% to 45%. In 1998, a high seroprevalence of WVN (66%) was reported, during a febrile illness outbreak following heavy rainfall in Kisangani [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], in buffalo and elephant in the Garamba National Park [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In a survey carried out in Kinshasa in 2004, nine (30%) out of 20 horses were WNV seropositive using ELISA and western blot analysis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Afterwards, a 12.5% seroprevalence of WNV was reported in Kinshasa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. These observations provide evidence of an animal role in the enzootic circulation of WNV in the DRC.
