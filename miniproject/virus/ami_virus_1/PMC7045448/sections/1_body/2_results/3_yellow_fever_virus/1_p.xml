<p id="Par23">The first yellow fever outbreak in DRC was reported among ship passengers from Europe in 1912 at Matadi Beach [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Later in 1928, another YFV outbreak occurred in the same area. This was the first autochthonous YFV outbreak in the DRC and it caused a mortality rate as high as 63.4% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. From 1948 to 1957, yellow fever cases were regularly recorded in DRC. In 1958, the country experienced two major outbreaks: first in Gemena township of the Sud-Ubangi Province (case fatality rate of 36.5%) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and another outbreak (co-infection with chikungunya) in the Territory of Dungu from Haut-Uelé Province [

From 2001 to 2004, a nationwide surveillance reported about 400 yellow fever suspected cases annually without a biological confirmation and a lethality rate of 3% in 2004 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Despite the implementation of a yellow fever vaccination programme (involving children 9 months-old) in DRC since 2003, most vaccinated children failed to demonstrate sufficient proof of seroconversion [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The 2016 outbreak was the largest with causing a total of 393 deaths. While, initially the majority of recorded yellow fever cases were imported from neighbouring Angola, 90% of deaths in 2016 were recorded in a single Province of Kongo-Centrale [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The autochthonous cases of YFV have also been documented in the provinces of Bas-Uele, Equateur, Kasai-Central, Kinshasa, Kwango, Lualaba, Tshuapa and Kongo-Central [
