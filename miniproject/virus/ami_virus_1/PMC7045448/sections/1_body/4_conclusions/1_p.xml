<p id="Par38">Despite the limited information on mosquito-borne viruses and their vectors in DRC, available evidence indicates the wide-range of mosquito-borne virus species, potential hosts and vector species occurring in the country. The diversity of mosquito-borne viruses is underestimated, as well the current mosquito-borne viral disease burden and its driving factors. The tendency is that the continuous geographical expansion of mosquito-borne viruses leads to fears that multiple epidemic outbreaks are likely to arise in the DRC. There is a dearth of information on mosquitoes, in particular 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, which is known to be the main vector of major mosquito-borne viruses. The lack of information is a barrier to appropriate knowledge on the ecology and epidemiology of mosquito-borne viruses, which is crucial in the design of appropriate interventions. Evidence for circulation of mosquito-borne viruses in livestock and domestic animals from the DRC, and the increasing mosquito-borne virus distribution over time and space, call for robust holistic mosquito-borne virus surveillance systems, including One Health approaches with emphasis on integrated vector control.
