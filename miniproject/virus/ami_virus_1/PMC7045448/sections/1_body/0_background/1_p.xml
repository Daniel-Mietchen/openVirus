<p id="Par15">Arthropod-borne viruses are referred to as viruses transmitted either to animals or humans by blood-sucking arthropods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. There are over 700 known arthropod-borne viruses and at least 80 immunologically distinct types that cause diseases in humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Most of the arthropod-borne viral infections are transmitted by mosquitoes. Transmission of these viruses to humans involves complex processes influenced by the mosquito and viral genetics, environmental factors and human activities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Mosquitoes belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> are the major vectors of Chikungunya (CHIKV), Dengue (DENV), Rift Valley fever (RVFV), Yellow fever (YFV) and Zika (ZIKV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. These mosquito-borne viral diseases are often misdiagnosed with other febrile illnesses, such as malaria due to lack of differential diagnostic tools [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The geographical distribution patterns of these mosquito-borne viruses are related to the presence of their mosquito vectors; and overlap as they share common vectors. Therefore, co-infection or co-occurrence of more than one mosquito-borne virus species in a certain geographical location is common [
