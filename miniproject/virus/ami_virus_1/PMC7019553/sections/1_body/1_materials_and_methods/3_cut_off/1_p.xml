<p>Determination of cut-off values was based on (a) Cohen's 
 <italic>κ</italic> statistics, as an index of agreement between our assay and commercially available kits, (b) Area Under the Curve Receiver Operating Characteristics (AUROC) analysis (combined with Youden's 
 <italic>J</italic> equation) – which in this case was used for comparing the performance of diagnostic tests [
 <xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and (c) the ‘
 <italic>experimental approach</italic>’. The latter one was based on the mean OD and IU-transformed values yielded by our tests, belonging to selected serum samples that had been previously found negative by validated commercial kits. For assay testing, optimisation and comparisons, the following validated kits were used: measles IgG: Novalisa, Immunolab, Euroimmun, Sekisui-Virotech, Serion, Siemens Enzygnost; mumps IgG: Novalisa, Immunolab, Euroimmun, Sekisui-Virotech, Vircell; rubella IgG: Novatec, Immunolab, Euroimmun, DiaPro, Vircell.
