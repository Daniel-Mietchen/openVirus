The recommended age for vaccination was 10 months until 1978, when it was changed to 14 months. After the 1980–1981 epidemics, persons born between 1973 and 1977, who would have received vaccine when the recommended age was 10 months, were revaccinated. After 1989, children were re-vaccinated at the age of 11 years with monovalent measles vaccine in a scheduled manner. Consequently, the first individuals who received a reminder vaccine at the age of 11 were born in 1978. Thus, the cluster of 1969–1977 was the last that did not receive a reminder vaccine at the age of 11 as a part of the official vaccine schedule</td>
