<p id="par0080">In 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, however, the 2b protein must be prevented from inducing antibiosis. Aphids confined on transgenic 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> plants constitutively expressing the CMV 2b protein grew and reproduced poorly and did not recover when moved to healthy, non-transgenic plants (Watt L.G, unpublished data; 
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2013</xref>). The antibiosis-inducing effect of the 2b protein is thought to be due to its ability to bind to and inhibit the RNA slicing activity of Argonaute 1 (AGO1), a key component of both the antiviral RNA silencing and the microRNA pathways of the host. In 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic>, AGO1 negatively regulates antibiosis against aphids (
 <xref rid="bib0135" ref-type="bibr">Kettles et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2013</xref>) and the interaction of AGO1 with the CMV 2b protein allows this form of insect resistance to become active (Watt, L.G., unpublished data). The 1a protein somehow inhibits the interaction of 2b with AGO1 and ongoing work is investigating if this is due to an effect of the 1a protein on AGO1, on another host factor, or on the 2b protein (Watt L.G., unpublished data; 
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2013</xref>). However, although the 1a protein blocks induction of antibiosis, CMV still induces a mild resistance to aphids based on feeding deterrence (antixenosis). This is elicited by the CMV 2a protein (the CMV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase), which activates an immune signalling pathway (pathogen-associated molecular pattern-triggered immunity) that in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> results in, among other things, increased biosynthesis of the feeding deterrent compound 4MI3M in the phloem tissue (see Section 
 <xref rid="sec0010" ref-type="sec">2</xref>). Specific amino acid residues in the 2a protein are responsible for antixenosis induction are currently being characterized (Rhee, S.J., unpublished data).
