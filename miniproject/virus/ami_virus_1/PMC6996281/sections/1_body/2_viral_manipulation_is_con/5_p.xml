<p id="par0075">In contrast, the distinct extended phenotypes that CMV imposes on tobacco and 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> arise from the activity of more than one viral protein. 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> confined on tobacco plants infected with CMV consume more phloem sap, show increased survival and produce more offspring than on mock-inoculated plants (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>). However, when the aphids were confined on tobacco plants infected with the mutant CMVΔ2b, which is unable to express the 2b protein, the aphids ingested less phloem sap, reproduced poorly and exhibited increased mortality (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>). CMV encodes five proteins including the 2b protein, which is a counter-defence factor that acts as a suppressor of RNA silencing and other resistance phenomena (
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>). It appears that in tobacco, another CMV-derived factor can trigger strong antibiosis against aphids that results in decreased survival and reproduction of the insects, and which would be deleterious to virus transmission. But during an infection with wild-type CMV the 2b protein counteracts induction of antibiosis, which is induced by the 1a protein or, less likely, by the CMV RNA 1 sequence. The 1a protein is a component of the viral replicase complex but here is acting as a stimulator of resistance to aphids (

 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>). The metabolite(s) responsible for the antibiosis induced by CMVΔ2b remain unknown but levels of the insecticidal alkaloid nicotine were not increased by infection with this mutant virus, suggesting that it is not the virus-inducible antibiotic factor (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>).
