<p id="par0060">Several viral genes have been identified that cause changes in the host, resulting in extended phenotypes affecting host-vector interactions and likely to enhance virus transmission. These include genes of geminiviruses (DNA viruses transmitted in the persistent manner by whitefly vectors) and their satellite DNA molecules, several of which encode factors that suppress signalling by, or responses to, the phytohormone jasmonic acid (JA) (

Thus, suppression of JA-regulated plant genes increases plant susceptibility to whitefly infestation, encourages prolonged phloem sap feeding by these vectors, and consequently increases the likelihood that they will acquire viral inoculum (reviewed in
