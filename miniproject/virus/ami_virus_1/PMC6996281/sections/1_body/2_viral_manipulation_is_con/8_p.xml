<p id="par0090">In CMV-infected tobacco, which exhibits a ‘retain’ virally-induced phenotype (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2019</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>), the virus infection induces a significant increase in the emission of VOCs overall and significant increases and decreases in the proportions of specific VOCs emitted by the host (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Tungadi et al., 2017</xref>). However, in free-choice assays aphids (
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>) showed no indication of bias towards settling on either CMV-infected or mock-inoculated tobacco plants (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Tungadi et al., 2017</xref>). This shows that although there were extensive qualitative alterations to the VOC blend as well as an increase in the amounts of specific VOCs emitted, there was no behavioural response from the aphids. 
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Tungadi et al. (2017)</xref> suggested that by making tobacco plants better quality hosts for aphids (as shown previously by 
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>) but by not making them overly attractive, the net effect will not completely inhibit movement of CMV-bearing aphids between plants and consequent virus transmission. The work also supports the observations of 
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Webster et al. (2010)</xref>, who found that the precise proportions of insect-perceivable VOCs in a blend determined whether aphids would be attracted, repelled or oblivious. Since a significant remodelling of the VOC blend occurs following CMV infection, but does not influence vector behaviour, we can speculate that this effect has evolved for some other purpose. For example, to influence other insect types such as predators, but at this point we cannot exclude the possibility that this is an incidental effect of infection.
