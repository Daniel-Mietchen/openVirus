<p id="par0085">As observed by 
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Mauck et al. (2010)</xref>, aphids can be attracted to infected plants by insect-perceivable VOCs (semiochemicals) that ‘deceive’ the vectors into attempting to feed and settle on an unpalatable host. Similar effects (emission of attractive but deceptive semiochemicals) have been observed in 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (Bravo-Cazar, A., unpublished data; 
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), legumes (Wamonje, F.O, and Mutuku, J.M., unpublished data) and solanaceous plants (Arinaitwe W., unpublished) infected with non-persistently transmitted viruses. In CMV-infected plants, the 2b protein is the major viral factor that induces quantitative and qualitative changes in VOC blends emitted by these plants (

 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Tungadi et al., 2017</xref>). The mechanism by which the 2b protein influences VOC metabolism may depend upon its ability to disrupt microRNA metabolism (
