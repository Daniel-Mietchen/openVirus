<p id="par0070">Perhaps the least ambiguous viral manipulation system studied to date for a non-persistently transmitted virus is the interaction between the potyvirus TuMV, 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>. TuMV infection increases the susceptibility of this host to aphid infestation; an apparent example of a ‘retain’ virally modified plant phenotype. The key TuMV gene product conditioning aphid susceptibility (in part by improving the plant’s nutritional properties) is the nuclear inclusion-a protein, which appears to operate via interference with ethene (ethylene)-mediated plant signalling, rather than through interference with JA-regulated signalling (
