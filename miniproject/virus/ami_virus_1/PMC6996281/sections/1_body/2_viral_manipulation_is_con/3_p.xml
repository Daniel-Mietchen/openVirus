<p id="par0065">Certain gene products of viruses that are transmitted non-persistently by aphids inhibit JA-regulated signalling and gene expression. Initial studies on viral suppression of JA-dependent phenomena focused on viral proteins that were suppressors of the host’s RNA silencing systems, such as the potyviral HC-Pro or the CMV 2b protein. Expression of CMV 
 <italic>2b</italic> genes in transgenic 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> or 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> suppressed the induction of gene expression following spraying with methyl-JA (

 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2014</xref>). The potyviral protein HC-Pro and the P6 trans-activator protein of cauliflower mosaic virus also suppress JA-induced changes in gene expression (

 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2014</xref>). However, the relationship between suppression of responses to JA by some of these viral factors and their ability to modify plant-aphid interactions is not straightforward and is complicated by direct or indirect interactions with other viral gene products. For example, when the PVY HC-Pro protein was expressed constitutively from a transgene in 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> it suppressed JA-responsive gene expression and increased the susceptibility of these plants to infestation by 
 <italic>M. persicae</italic> (
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2014</xref>). However, although suppression of JA-responsive gene expression occurred in PVY-infected non-transgenic 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants, aphids confined on these plants showed a significant decrease in fecundity (

The 126 kDa protein of tobacco mosaic virus and the p25 protein of potato virus X, both of which are viral RNA silencing suppressors, also suppressed plant transcriptional responses to methyl-JA. However, neither virus is insect-transmitted (
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2014</xref>). The work suggests that the ability of viruses to suppress responses to JA has evolved in many cases for reasons other than (or in addition to) the modification of host-vector interactions. The work also shows that the influence of viruses on insect–plant interactions can emerge from the combinatorial effects of multiple virally encoded factors.
