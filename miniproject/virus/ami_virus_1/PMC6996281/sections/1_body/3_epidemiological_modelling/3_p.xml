<p id="par0100">The second, and perhaps surprising, conclusion drawn from the model is that induction of a ‘retain’ phenotype can contribute to epidemic development by fostering longer-distance dissemination of viral inoculum (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2019</xref>). Those authors incorporated the effect of crowding on aphid phenology into their epidemiological model. Specifically, crowding encourages a developmental switch to an increase in emergence of alate versus non-winged (apterous) aphids (

Simulation results from the model showed that if a virus fosters host susceptibility to aphid infestation, the increase in local density of apterous aphids leads to a switch from production of apterous to alate aphids that are capable of carrying inoculum over greater distances than apterous, crawling aphids (
