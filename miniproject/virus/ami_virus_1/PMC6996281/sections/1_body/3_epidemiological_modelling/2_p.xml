 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al. (2019)</xref> developed a Markov chain-based model for non-persistent transmission that incorporates viral manipulation of host-vector interactions and key aspects of aphid biology; in particular, feeding behaviour, mortality and crowding-induced production of winged (alate) aphids. Their analyses support the hypothesis that local plant-to-plant virus transmission between plants is accelerated if a virus induces the host to exhibit the ‘attract and deter’ phenotype (introduced in Section 
 <xref rid="sec0010" ref-type="sec">2</xref>) (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). A consequence of this is that while this extended phenotype increases the number of plants visited between feeds, the aphids face the disadvantage of being unable to settle long enough to grow and reproduce, as well as increased risks of not finding another suitable host upon which to alight and also increased odds of encountering predators while transiting between hosts (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al., 2019</xref>). At this point it may also be worth noting that aphids (
 <italic>M. persicae</italic>) on CMV-infected squash plants (which exhibit the ‘attract and deter’ virally-induced phenotype) are more vulnerable to attack by parasitoid wasps (
 <italic>Aphidius colemani</italic>) (
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Mauck et al., 2015</xref>), which provides another disincentive to settle. This means that ‘attract and deter’ virally-induced phenotypes drive decreases in overall aphid density and ultimately to the self-limitation of spread of non-persistently transmitted viruses (
