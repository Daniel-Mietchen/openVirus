<p id="par0105">An additional effect flowing from the virally-induced ‘retain’ phenotype may be that vectors also benefit. It has been suggested that the changes in whitefly-host interactions induced by persistently transmitted geminiviruses provides an example of mutualism where the virus is ‘paying back’ its insect vector by providing host plants on which vector growth and fecundity are improved (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Luan et al., 2013</xref>). Mutualism has also been suggested as an outcome of virus-induced susceptibility to aphids caused by non-persistently transmitted viruses (
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Westwood et al., 2013</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>). Virus-infected host plants that foster improved aphid reproduction also provide refuges that allow aphids to survive adverse conditions. Interestingly, several viruses engender improved cold and drought resilience in their hosts (reviewed in 
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Carr, 2017</xref> and 
 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Roossinck, 2019</xref>) and this can also benefit the performance of vectors on virus-infected plants (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Davis et al., 2015</xref>). It is possible to envisage virus-infected plants exhibiting two virally-induced phenotypes (increased aphid susceptibility plus improved resilience to environmental stress). These plants may then act as progenitors for subsequent generations of virus susceptible plants, as well as starting points for the spread of virus-bearing aphids to launch new epidemics.
