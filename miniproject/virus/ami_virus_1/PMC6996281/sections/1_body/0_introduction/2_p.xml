 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Jones, 2014</xref>). The vectors most frequently encountered are hemipteran insects i.e., aphids, whiteflies, planthoppers, leafhoppers and related insects that possess probing mouthparts called stylets (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Hull, 2014</xref>). Virus transmission by hemipteran insects takes several forms. In persistent (circulative) transmission, viruses are ingested by the vector and circulate within the insect having passed from the gut to the hemocoel. Eventually the virions reach the salivary glands and the insect becomes competent to inoculate plants during feeding. In many cases of persistent transmission of viruses there is no actual replication of the virus in insect cells. Whether or not the virus is capable of replication in insect cells, vectors typically have to ingest the phloem sap of infected plants over a prolonged period since virus acquisition can take hours (

 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Ng and Falk, 2006</xref>). For viruses that are transmitted by vectors in a non-persistent or semi-persistent manner, particles are carried in the insect mouthparts for shorter times (non-persistent, minutes to hours and semi-persistent, hours to days). This contrasts with persistently transmitted viruses, which may be carried for the remainder of the vectorâ€™s lifespan and in some cases can be passed on the next generation (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Hull, 2014</xref>). Acquisition of non-persistently or semi-persistently transmitted viruses does not require prolonged feeding from the phloem of infected plants (
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Hull, 2014</xref>). Semi-persistently transmitted virus particles bind to receptors in the insect foregut and virions of non-persistently transmitted viruses bind to receptors located in the common duct of the stylet near the tip of the maxillary stylet in a region called the acrostyle (
