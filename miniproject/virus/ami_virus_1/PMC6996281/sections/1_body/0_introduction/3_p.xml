<p id="par0035">Because virions of non-persistently transmitted viruses bind very loosely to the acrostyle receptors, these viruses are acquired rapidly during initial probes of an infected plant’s epidermal cells and also are lost rapidly when an aphid ejects saliva through its stylet (

Work employing the electrical penetration graph method, an electrophysiological technique used to monitor insect feeding activity, showed that acquisition of non-persistently transmitted viruses by aphids requires stylet penetrations of epidermal cells of infected plants that last as little as 3–5 seconds (

More recent work with a genetically engineered strain of cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) that expresses a fusion between the viral 2b protein and the green fluorescent protein showed that virus replication occurred first in epidermal cells following inoculation by aphid vectors (
