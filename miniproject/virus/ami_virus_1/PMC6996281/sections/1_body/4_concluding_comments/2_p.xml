<p id="par0110">Recent years have witnessed significant advances in our understanding of how semiochemicals and other plant metabolites assist aphid vectors to locate plants and subsequently choose or reject them as hosts, and how viruses manipulate synthesis of these host cues to promote their own transmission. Additionally, we are beginning to understand at the molecular level how specific viral gene products, often working in concert, reprogram host genetic and biosynthetic networks to modify host-vector interactions. At larger scales, we are modeling the consequences of viral manipulation of host phenotypes on the development of viral epidemics.</p>
