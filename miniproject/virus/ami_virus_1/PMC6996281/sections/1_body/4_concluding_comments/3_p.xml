<p id="par0115">These insights are timely. Current approaches to control of insect-vectored plant viruses in agriculture depend largely on the application of pesticides (
 <xref rid="bib0280" ref-type="bibr">Westwood and Stevens, 2010</xref>). However, insecticide efficacy is declining due to evolution of resistance in target insects and off-target effects of insecticides on beneficial insects are leading to restrictions on their use (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Godfray et al., 2015</xref>). Meanwhile, global warming threatens to extend the geographic ranges and increase the populations of insect vectors (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Canto et al., 2009</xref>). Developing new means of combating vectored transmission of plant viruses is thus a matter of urgency. A deeper understanding of how VOCs and other cues affect virus transmission by insects and how these can be manipulated or subverted (taking lessons from the viruses that have evolved to exploit plant-insect communication) could inform new methods to minimise disease spread. Similar insights into how plants and insects communicate via chemical signals have led to successful mixed cropping systems that inhibit spread of lepidopteran pests (
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Pickett and Khan, 2016</xref>) and we believe that similar approaches could be devised to disrupt vector-mediated virus transmission.
