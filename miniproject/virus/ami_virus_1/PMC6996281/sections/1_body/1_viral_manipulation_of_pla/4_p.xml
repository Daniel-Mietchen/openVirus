 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Mauck et al. (2012)</xref> examined the available literature on viral manipulation of host-vector interactions and found that the majority of examples of apparent viral manipulation of vector-plant interactions by non-persistently transmitted viruses are of the ‘attract-and-deter’ type. However, in some instances, infection with a non-persistently transmitted virus renders plants more susceptible to aphid infestation by making plants more nutritious and/or less resistant to aphids; a virally-modified plant phenotype called ‘retain’ by 
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly et al. (2019)</xref>. Examples of virus-induced ‘retain’ phenotypes include: potato plants infected by potato virus Y (PVY) (

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Castle and Berger, 1993</xref>); squash plants infected with zucchini yellow mosaic virus or papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) (

 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Ziebell et al., 2011</xref>). The beneficial effects on insects can be selective and appear to reflect the interests of the virus. For example, aphid (
 <italic>A. gossypii</italic>) survival and reproduction is enhanced on PRSV-infected squash plants but there is no benefit for the whitefly species, 
 <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic>, which does not vector PRSV (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Gadhave et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of CMV, this one virus appears to be able to induce contrasting virally-induced phenotypes in different hosts i.e., ‘attract and deter’ in cucurbits and 
 <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and ‘retain’ in tobacco. In Section 
 <xref rid="sec0020" ref-type="sec">4</xref> we discuss the reasons why the ‘retain’ phenotype or why pleiotropy in the effects of a virus on different hosts might ultimately enhance transmission, or benefit the vector.
