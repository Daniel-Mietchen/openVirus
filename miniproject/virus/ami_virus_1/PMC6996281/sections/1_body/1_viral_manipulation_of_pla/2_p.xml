<p id="par0045">There is compelling evidence that certain genes of plant viruses exert extended phenotypes i.e., these parasite genes influence the expression of host genes in ways that ultimately benefit the virus (
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Dawkins, 1982</xref>). Among the host genes altered in expression by infection are those involved in the biosynthesis of insect-attracting and insect-repelling secondary metabolites and genes involved in defence against insect infestation (see Section 
 <xref rid="sec0015" ref-type="sec">3</xref>). The resulting changes in plant biochemistry and defence alter the interactions of infected host plants with vectors and may have profound effects on epidemiological processes that benefit the virus (see Section 
 <xref rid="sec0020" ref-type="sec">4</xref>). Although changes in plant biochemistry and defence status that favour transmission were previously assumed to be only incidental effects of virus infection, this assumption has become less tenable as more evidence accumulates of virus-host-vector co-evolution (
