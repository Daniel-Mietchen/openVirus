<p id="Par10">Perhaps the one virus that has gained global notoriety in history for global epidemics has been the influenza virus. Despite widespread vaccination, the potential for antigenic shift and drift exists, a situation that could contribute to worldwide pandemics. Influenza A and B are RNA viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory tract disease. Like RSV, the progression to lower respiratory tract disease is more prevalent in immunocompromised patients and disease peaks in the winter. Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, are effective treatments, especially when begun early in the viral course. These treatments are augmented by amantadine and rimantadine. Vaccination is available, but it may not cover all strains of the virus.</p>
