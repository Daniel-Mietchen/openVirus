<p id="Par9">Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza are part of the paramyxovirus family that is a frequent cause of both upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. Peak seasonal appearance occurs in the winter, similar to influenza. Immunocompromised patients, such as posttransplant and lymphopenic patients, are more likely to have progression of the infection into the lower respiratory tract with significantly higher mortality rates. The paramyxoviruses have been associated with posttransplant complications, including post-viral obliterative bronchiolitis, a cause of chronic rejection. While vaccination is not available, RSV prophylaxis can be effectively managed with immunoglobulin and monoclonal antibodies. Treatment centers on the use of ribavirin, RSV antibodies, and supportive measures. In comparison, there are no proven preventative or treatment measures for parainfluenza.</p>
