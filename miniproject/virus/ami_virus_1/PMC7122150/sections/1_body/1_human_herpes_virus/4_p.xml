 <italic>Cytomegalovirus</italic> (CMV, HHV-5) is a common infection with a prolonged latency period. Estimates of seropositivity rates range from 40 % in young adults to above 90 % in the elderly population. While most infections occur asymptomatically in the healthy population, immunocompromised patients are at risk for disseminated disease. In particular, post-lung transplant patients are at risk for CMV pneumonitis, a common cause of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. Valganciclovir has been shown to be an effective prophylactic measure in these high-risk patients.
