<p id="Par3">The human herpes family viruses (HHV) consist of eight separate viruses, all with potential of causing human disease. The prevalence of 
 <italic>HSV-1</italic> (
 <italic>HHV-1</italic>) 
 <italic>and HSV-2</italic> (
 <italic>HHV-2</italic>) in the general population is 65 % and 29 %, respectively. HSV-1 is mostly transmitted through nonsexual contact and is most frequently associated with oral mucosal lesions, while HSV-2 is mostly transmitted through sexual contact and commonly infects urogenital mucosa. Shortly after primary infection, the virus can be found in a dormant state in sensory neurons. Reactivation may occur at a later time. Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for reactivation with subsequent disseminated disease. HSV reactivation in posttransplant patients can cause pneumonia, hepatitis, encephalitis, and disseminated disease. Oral acyclovir has been shown to be an effective prophylactic and treatment agent for HSV-1 and HSV-2.
