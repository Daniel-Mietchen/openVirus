 <italic>HHV-8</italic> gained attention as an opportunistic disease of AIDS patients, referred to as Kaposi sarcoma. In addition, HHV-8 is a causative agent in primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman disease in immunocompromised patients. While only 1.5 % of Americans are seropositive, up to 50 % of the sub-Saharan population is infected. Treatment of these diseases appears to be a reduction in the degree of immunosuppression, chemotherapy, radiation therapy and also resection of localized tumors, and treatment of other coinfections.
