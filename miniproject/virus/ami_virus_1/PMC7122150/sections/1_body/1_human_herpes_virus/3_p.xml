 <italic>Epstein-Barr virus</italic> (EBV, HHV-4) is the causative virus associated with infectious mononucleosis and the more serious (but rare) Burkittâ€™s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). About 90 % of the general population has been found to be seropositive for EBV. While patients generally demonstrate flu-like symptoms, more significant symptoms may occur. These include encephalitis, optic neuritis, and hepatosplenomegaly with increased risk of splenic rupture. Like VZV, EBV is generally transmitted through respiratory secretions and saliva. Shortly after primary infection, EBV can be found in a dormant state in B cells of the immune system. No vaccination currently exists for EBV, although some studies have shown the effectiveness of antiviral medications for treatment.
