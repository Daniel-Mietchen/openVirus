 <italic>Varicella zoster virus</italic> (VZV, HHV-3) is responsible for chickenpox and shingles in the healthy, immunocompetent population. However, it may cause significant, life-threatening disease in the immunocompromised population, such as posttransplant patients. Primary infection (chickenpox) or reactivation (shingles) in healthy patients with intact immune systems will manifest with a vesicular rash in a dermatomal pattern. Shortly after primary infection, VZV remains dormant in neurons of dorsal root ganglia. However, reactivation in posttransplant patients may manifest with cutaneous infection, encephalitis, myelitis, and pneumonia. Many studies have documented the efficacy of acyclovir and ganciclovir for the prophylaxis of VZV. Vaccination is available for patients and their close contacts and has shown to be effective in preventing disease.
