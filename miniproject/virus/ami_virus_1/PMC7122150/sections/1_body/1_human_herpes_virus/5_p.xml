 <italic>HHV-6</italic>, a common infection that occurs in over 90 % of the population, causes roseola infantum which is manifested by high fevers and a viral exanthem rash. After primary infection, it remains dormant in CD4 lymphocytes. Reactivation in immunocompromised patients may lead to neurologic symptoms, gastroenteritis, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and myelosuppression. While no vaccine currently exists, antiviral agents are an effective treatment.
