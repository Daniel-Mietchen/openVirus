<p id="Par25">Prion disease may be transmitted through familial, sporadic, or iatrogenic spread. In particular, the iatrogenic form is concerning for infection control precautions, as more than 400 patients have been exposed to prion-contaminated surgical equipment. Certain surgical operations such as ophthalmologic and neurosurgical procedures are considered high risk for prion transmission. Historically, EEG electrodes, human pituitary hormone, cornea transplant, and dura mater grafts have also been implicated. A few case reports have found transmission through blood transfusion from an infected donor. These mutated prions have been shown to be less susceptible to standard methods of sterilization. WHO has made specific recommendations regarding the sterilization of surgical instruments that have come into contact with tissues that carry a risk of high infectivity or patients with suspected or confirmed prion disease. Moreover, some experts recommend the use of disposable surgical instruments in these situations.</p>
