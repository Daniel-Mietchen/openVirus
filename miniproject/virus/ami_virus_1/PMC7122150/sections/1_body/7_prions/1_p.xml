<p id="Par24">Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a family of neurodegenerative disorders, has become a surgical concern over the past couple decades. The infectious entity of this disease has been found to be mutated prions that are protease resistant. Mean incubation period until appearance of symptoms has averaged over 10 years with subacute progression of neurologic disease. However, average survival after the appearance of symptoms is only a few months. Diagnosis can only be made through biopsy of infected tissue.</p>
