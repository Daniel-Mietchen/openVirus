 <italic>Tuberculosis</italic> (TB) is currently the eighth leading cause of death worldwide, and an estimated 1/3 of the worldâ€™s population is infected. The highest concentration is focused in the less developed areas of sub-Saharan Africa, India, Southeast and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and Micronesia. Tuberculosis is spread through respiratory droplets by individuals with active pulmonary disease. While most healthy patients exposed will have an asymptomatic and localized course, this infection may remain dormant in pulmonary tissue for years, referred to as latent tuberculosis infection. Reactivation may occur years later in normal healthy patients. However, reactivation is more likely to occur in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with malignancies, HIV, end-stage renal disease, diabetes, and patients on immunosuppressive medications.
