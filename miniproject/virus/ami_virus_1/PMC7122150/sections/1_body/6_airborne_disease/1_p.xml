<p id="Par20">Droplet transmission is limited by distance spread from host to less than 1 m due to particle size. The size of the particle is a source of controversy, but the World Health Organization (WHO) employs a particle size of &gt;5 μm. In comparison, particles that undergo airborne transmission are usually &lt;5 μm, may remain suspended in air for an extended amount of time, and may be spread to greater distances. In addition, smaller infectious particles are more likely to penetrate the lower respiratory tract, while larger particles generally settle in the upper respiratory tract. Proper precautions should be followed in the operating room. Laminar airflow systems with HEPA filters are effective in removing the majority of airborne particles. These systems can be ceiling or wall mounted, with frequent air changes that limit colony-forming units. Other measures to prevent infection transmission in the operating room include sterile surgical gowns and drapes, face masks, antiseptic hand scrub, and the timing of opening surgical instruments prior to performing a procedure.</p>
