 <italic>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome</italic> (
 <italic>SARS</italic>) In 2003, SARS, a form of 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic>, was responsible for a major pandemic that affected many healthcare providers. This virus was spread through respiratory droplets and was found to have a high level of infectivity. There has been some debate on whether this virus was also spread to greater distances from the host through airborne transmission. Flu-like symptoms were associated with mild acute infection and symptoms of serious infection included reactive hepatitis, a severe acute neurologic syndrome, and pulmonary involvement with pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Healthcare providers were found to be at significant risk for contraction of the virus, especially when caring for patients that required oxygen therapy, positive-pressure ventilation, and resuscitation. Recommendations for healthcare providers caring for these patients involve strict contact and droplet precautions. However, airborne precautions, such as the use of N95 fitted mask, must also be observed when performing procedures that may generate aerosols, such as bronchoscopy.
