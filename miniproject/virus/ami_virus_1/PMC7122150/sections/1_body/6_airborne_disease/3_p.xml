<p id="Par22">Active tuberculosis is characterized by chest X-ray findings of infiltrates found in the apical-posterior segments of the upper lobes and may include cavitations. Symptoms most frequently associated with TB infection include the constitutional symptoms of fevers, night sweats, cough, and unintended weight loss. Diagnosis of latent TB infection is made by tuberculin skin testing (TST), with interpretation of test results based on prevalence and risk of the patient. Active disease is diagnosed through a combination of chest X-ray findings, culture results, and acid-fast bacilli detection from either sputum testing or bronchoalveolar lavage. Treatment is usually accomplished through direct observational therapy (DOT) with at least 6 months of treatment. While latent TB can be effectively treated with one agent, the danger of multidrug-resistant organisms necessitates the use of multiple medications. Patients found to have active tuberculosis infection should be kept in a negative-pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour until clinical resolution of symptoms is achieved with three consecutive negative results of sputum testing. Healthcare providers should wear N95 masks that have been individually fit-tested when caring for patients with active disease.</p>
