<p id="Par15">Infectious bacterial organisms are a major concern when considering infection control measures to prevent patient-patient transmission. Nosocomial infections are a major source of morbidity and mortality, including vancomycin-resistant 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic> (VRE), methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), quinolone-resistant 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>. Many interventions have been proposed to eradicate or control the spread of nosocomial infections. Infection control measures include proper hand washing techniques, implementation of contact precautions, active surveillance cultures from patients, staff education, and effective environmental cleaning. All of these interventions, especially when combined, have been shown to reduce the incidence of multidrug-resistant organisms and its spread.
