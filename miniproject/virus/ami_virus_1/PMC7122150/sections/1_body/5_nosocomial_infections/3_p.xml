 <italic>MRSA</italic> In addition to its nosocomial origin, MRSA is now being found in the community and is an important source of skin and soft tissue infections presenting in the outpatient setting. In the inpatient setting, it is a leading cause of pneumonia, surgical site infections, and disseminated infections. Risk factors for contracting MRSA include advanced age, prior antibiotic use, previous surgery, and extended hospitalization. MRSA colonization occurs in asymptomatic patients on normal skin flora and in the nares. Furthermore, colonization in the nares has been shown to be a risk factor for development of surgical site infections. For this reason, many advocate MRSA screening with eradication therapy through antiseptic decontamination prior to surgery. Screening of asymptomatic patients also allows for more effective prevention of cross-contamination of other patients through implementation of isolation and barrier precautions. Despite these measures, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) recommends against routine active surveillance screening of all patients.
