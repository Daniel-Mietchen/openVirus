 <italic>VRE</italic> Up to 9 % of nosocomial-acquired bloodstream bacterial infections are attributed to 
 <italic>Enterococcus</italic>, with a significant percentage as VRE. Unlike MRSA, VRE has a low rate of asymptomatic carriers. When colonization occurs, it is most likely on the skin and in the gastrointestinal tract. A higher prevalence of VRE has been found in intensive care, dialysis, and oncology units. The most common mechanism of transfer among patients appears to be ineffective hand hygiene among healthcare workers. Contact precautions typically are not implemented until after a diagnosis or history of VRE is known.
