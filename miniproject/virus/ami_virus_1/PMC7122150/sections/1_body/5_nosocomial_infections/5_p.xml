 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> is considered a part of the normal intestinal flora in 1â€“3 % of healthy patients. When 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> overgrows and dominates the intestinal flora secondary to eradication of the other normal gut flora, clinical symptoms can occur, which can range from mild diarrhea to the more severe pseudomembranous colitis and toxic megacolon. The toxins released from the bacteria are implicated in causing mucosal damage and inflammation. Measures to control the spread of this infection include proper hand washing to remove the 
 <italic>C. difficile</italic> spores, disinfection of the physical environment, implementation of contact precautions, and proper selection of antibiotics when necessary. Some experts have recommended that contact precautions be maintained until 48 h after resolution of diarrhea. Environmental cleaning after physical exposure by an infected patient can be accomplished with chlorine-containing agents or hydrogen peroxide.
