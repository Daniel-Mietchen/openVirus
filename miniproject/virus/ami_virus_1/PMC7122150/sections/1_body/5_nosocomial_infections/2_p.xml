<p id="Par16">The duration of patient isolation is an area of high debate. Some advocate that once a patient is labeled as a carrier, they should always be isolated as if they were a carrier and that any testing indicating that they have been cleared of their infection is a result of poor culturing, poor sensitivity, or removal of antibiotic selection pressure. However, the Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC) recommends removal of isolation precaution after three negative cultures, at least 1 week apart. This duration of colonization of these antibiotic-resistant organisms is highly variable and currently unknown.</p>
