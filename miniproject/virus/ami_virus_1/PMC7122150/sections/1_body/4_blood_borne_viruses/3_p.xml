 <italic>Hepatitis B</italic> is mainly transmitted through intravenous drug abuse, blood transfusions, and sexual contact. Viral replication of the virus occurs in hepatocytes. After exposure, 25 % of patients demonstrate clinical symptoms of hepatitis. About 95 % of patients exposed will have spontaneous clinical resolution, while 5 % will be antigen positive for life with potential for progression to chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma. The state of exposure for hepatitis can be determined through antibody testing. The presence of the core antibody indicates previous exposure, and the presence of core antigen indicates persistent disease. The presence of the “e” antigen indicates active viral replication, a marker of higher infectivity. If the surface antibody is the only antibody present, this signifies previous vaccination against hepatitis B. Despite the high transmission of hepatitis B through percutaneous injury, vaccination effectively eliminates transmission. However, those with unreactive antibody testing or no prior vaccination history are at risk and should receive postexposure prophylaxis. These individuals should receive the HBV immunoglobulin and either a booster dose of the vaccine or the full vaccination series.
