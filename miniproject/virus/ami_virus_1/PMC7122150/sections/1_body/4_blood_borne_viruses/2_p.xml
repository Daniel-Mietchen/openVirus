 <italic>HIV</italic> is an RNA retrovirus that produces reverse transcriptase, which allows the creation of complimentary DNA that is substituted into the host cell. The virus attacks the host and causes cell lysis, with subsequent loss of helper CD4 T cells. Although mandatory preoperative HIV screening has been advocated by many, ethical concerns in addition to financial concerns are barriers to this screening. Furthermore, consent must be obtained before performing testing. Instead, a more accepted practice among many practitioners seems to be testing either high-risk patients or those undergoing higher risk procedures. Regardless of the patientâ€™s infection status, universal precautions are standard practice. Upon receiving a percutaneous or mucosal injury from a patient with unknown HIV status, prophylactic treatment is begun and consent for HIV testing is obtained from the patient. If the host was determined to have asymptomatic disease, a two-drug regimen is recommended. However, if the patient was symptomatic at the time of exposure, a three-drug regimen is commenced for at least 4 weeks.
