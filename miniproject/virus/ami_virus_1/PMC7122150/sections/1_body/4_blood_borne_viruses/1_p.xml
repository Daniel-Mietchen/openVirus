<p id="Par11">Blood-borne viruses are a major concern in the hospital for both the patient and healthcare providers. Virus transmission from an infected host during percutaneous or mucosal penetration is reported to be 0.3 % for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 3 % for hepatitis C, and 30 % for hepatitis B. In order to calculate risk of transmission from percutaneous or mucous membrane injury, several factors must be considered, including method of transmission (needle penetration versus blood splash to mucous membrane), needle type (hollow-bore needle such as an IV needle versus solid-bore needle such as suture needle), needle gauge, penetration of needle into patient and healthcare worker, presence of blood on needle, access of the needle to the patientâ€™s bloodstream, or whether the needle has passed through gloves or other barriers prior to entering the skin. Personal protective equipment and situational awareness remain the mainstays of prevention. Effective protection methods to minimize risk of transmission of blood-borne diseases include gloves, double gloving if needed, face shields or other eye protection, sleeve reinforcements, knee-high trauma boots, plastic aprons under surgical gowns, and avoidance of blind suturing techniques.</p>
