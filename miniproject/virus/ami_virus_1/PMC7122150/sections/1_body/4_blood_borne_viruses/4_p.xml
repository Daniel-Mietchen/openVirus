 <italic>Hepatitis C</italic> is estimated that over four million people in the United States have been exposed to hepatitis C. Transmission occurs through intravenous drug abuse, sexual contact, and transfusions. Like hepatitis B, about 25 % of people exposed demonstrate clinical symptoms. However, unlike hepatitis B, 50â€“80 % of those patients with hepatitis C will go on to develop chronic disease. About 20 % of those with chronic disease will progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Antibody testing after exposure may yield a positive result for up to a year. Unfortunately, no effective vaccination or prophylaxis after exposure is available at this time.
