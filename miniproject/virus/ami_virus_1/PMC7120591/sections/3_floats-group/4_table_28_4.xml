     <p>Transmission</p>
     <p> Directly from person to person</p>
     <p> Through big droplets (&gt;5 μm in size) deposited in the environment (secretions on hands, clothes, furniture, toys) and small droplets (&lt;5 μm in size) that form aerosols</p>
     <p> Potential animal sources of influenza virus (birds, pigs, and others) and hantavirus</p>

     <p>Portal of entry = target organ</p>
     <p> Short incubation time, from hours to a few days</p>
     <p> High infection rate in the community</p>
    </td>

   <tr>
    <td>
     <p>Localized infection = local defense mechanisms prevail</p>
     <p> Innate immunity: epithelial barrier (cilia, coughing, associated lymphatic tissue) and inflammatory response (leukocytes, macrophages, fever, cytokines)</p>
     <p> Acquired immunity: local (immunoglobulin A) and general (immunoglobulin G), T lymphocytes CD8–CD4 (type 1 and type 2 helper T cells); short-duration immunity with frequent reinfections</p>

    <td>
     <p>Propagation by proximity</p>
     <p> In individuals, it simultaneously compromises many levels of the respiratory system in a bilateral way</p>
     <p> In the community, it affects various members with close contact within the family, at school, or at work; it is hard to contain with isolation measures or physical barriers</p>
