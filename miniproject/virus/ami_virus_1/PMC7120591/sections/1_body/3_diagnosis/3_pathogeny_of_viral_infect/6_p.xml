<p id="Par25">The following pathogenic facts explain five basic clinical and epidemiological concepts shared by respiratory viruses:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par26">The incubation time is very short, from hours to 5 days.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par27">There is abundant production of the virus at the portal of entry, which facilitates viral shedding and high infectivity.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par28">Viral diffusion via mucosal proximity causes simultaneous and bilateral compromise of more than one segment of the respiratory airways and their annexes—for example, the paranasal sinuses and the middle ear.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p id="Par29">The defense mechanisms in play—both innate and specifically acquired (immunoglobulin A)—are mainly of a local character.</p>

   <p id="Par30">Specific immunity is temporary and lasts only for some months (Table
