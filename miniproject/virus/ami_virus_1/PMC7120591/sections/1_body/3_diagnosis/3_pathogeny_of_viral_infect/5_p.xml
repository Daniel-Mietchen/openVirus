<p id="Par24">The upper respiratory mucosa is the portal of entry (including the ocular conjunctiva for some viruses) and also represents the target organ of these viral infections. Dissemination within the organism happens because of the contiguity of the mucosa, contaminated secretions, or virus diffusion due to the proximity of infected cells and healthy cells. Even though the virus can escape into the blood and other territories, this phase of viremia is not essential to the pathogeny of the infection, and this is why respiratory virus are considered localized infections.</p>
