<p id="Par23">The infection mechanism works through respiratory secretions that are eliminated as big particles (&gt;5 μm in size), which remain both on the hands and in the environment (on aprons, toys, medical instruments, and furniture), or small particles (&lt;5 μm in size: Flügge droplets), which can form aerosols and stay suspended in the environment. A sneeze or a cough can expel secretions at 65 km/h over a distance of 9 meters. For some viruses, such as rhinovirus or RSV, contact with contaminated hands represents the main form of transmission.</p>
