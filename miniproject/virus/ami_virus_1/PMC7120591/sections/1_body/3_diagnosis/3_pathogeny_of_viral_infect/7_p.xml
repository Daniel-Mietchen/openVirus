<p id="Par31"> Prevention of viral respiratory infections is difficult because high infectivity is favored by the presence of subclinical infections, human sociability, and unavailability of vaccines, except for influenza virus vaccines. Treatment is fundamentally symptomatic and essentially consists of maintenance of the permeable airway, oxygen administration, and assisted mechanical ventilation in extreme cases. Use of antiallergics, anti-inflammatories, steroids, bronchodilators, and prophylactic antibiotics is very controversial, and this is discussed in other chapters in this book. Antivirals are available just for influenza viruses and, if they are administrated early, they shorten the symptomatic period but seemingly do not prevent development of serious illness in high-risk patients.</p>
