<p id="Par21">The source of infection is usually another human carrier of the virus with or without an evident clinical infection. Even though viral shedding is greater in symptomatic cases, the relative isolation that viruses suffer when the host is resting in bed makes viral dissemination less efficient; in contrast, in slight or subclinical cases, despite eliminating smaller amounts of the virus in secretions, patients continue doing their normal activities, actively contributing to viral diffusion. In many respiratory infections, preschool children and schoolchildren are the main disseminators of the virus because they satisfy the following two conditions: shedding of high virus concentrations through secretions, and regular and close contact with their schoolmates and relatives.</p>
