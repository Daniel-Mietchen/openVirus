<p id="Par19">Among respiratory viruses, very good examples of “viral emergencies” are found, the most classic being the occurrence of global epidemics of influenza A virus derived from birds or pigs in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 2009; on these occasions, the virus broke through the species barrier and, thanks to multiple mutations, was able to transmit itself efficiently and establish itself as a “ human virus.” A pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) due to a coronavirus is another example of a phenomenon that has threatened the world and was able to be controlled. During August 2014, an outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections in children, associated with enterovirus D68, started in the USA, and its evolution is ongoing. Likewise, an emergency involving the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) started in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Probably of animal origin (camels and bats) and transmissible through air, it has caused over 900 cases (30% lethal); luckily, it has not expanded efficiently in other territories.</p>
