<p id="Par18">Specific diagnosis of respiratory viruses is quite attainable nowadays because there are several immunodiagnostic techniques (immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), immunochromatography) available at public and private centers. They are easy to implement, with reasonably acceptable sensitivity and specificity, allowing appropriate study of cases that need it. Nowadays, molecular techniques (polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and reverse transcription PCR) are also available in many laboratories; they have high sensitivity and specificity, and provide results in less than 24Â hours. The great sensitivity of these techniques enables detection of many agents, even in the same sample, raising questions about their interpretation. In severe cases or in deceased patients, they should always be implemented to establish the causes.</p>
