<p id="Par3">Epidemiology is the study of health at a human population scale, including transmissible and nontransmissible diseases. It also considers diseases that affect animals. It analyses factors depending on the agent, host, and environment that come into play in the population’s health. Its contribution to the health field can be summarized as the following goals:

       <italic>Impact</italic>: Epidemiology describes mortality, morbidity, life-years lost through death or disability, and other parameters to measure the impact of different agents; it also predicts the appearance tendencies of infectious and noninfectious diseases.
