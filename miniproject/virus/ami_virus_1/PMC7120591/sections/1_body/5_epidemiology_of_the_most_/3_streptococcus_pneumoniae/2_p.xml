Nevertheless, the great majority of pneumococcal pneumonias are not bacteremic, which is why the incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia is unknown; there are just data extrapolated from monitoring of pneumonia in hospitalized patients, assuming that pneumococcus is the primary cause of bacterial pneumonia at any age.</p>
