<p id="Par46"> Pneumococcus is the main cause of bacterial pneumonia in all age groups across the globe. Its incidence varies according to the age group, the development status of the country, and employment of specific vaccines. It is now by far the most frequent causal agent of pneumonia since the incidence of pneumonia caused by 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> type B was reduced by introduction of a specific vaccine, which practically made infections with that causal agent disappear. The most relevant risk groups are infants &lt;2 years old, adults over 60 years old, and immunosuppressed patients. The WHO estimates that this agent causes the deaths of 700,000 to one million people every year.
