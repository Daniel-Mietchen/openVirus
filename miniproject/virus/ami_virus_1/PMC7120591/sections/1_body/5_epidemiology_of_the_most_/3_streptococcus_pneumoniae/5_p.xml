<p id="Par50">The most prevalent serotypes prior to the use of vaccines were 5, 14, and 1. In the last postvaccination period they were serotypes 15, 1, and 7F, followed by serotypes 3, 19A, 6A, and 6B, although there were reductions in serotypes 15, 1, 5, and 6B. Since the introduction of vaccines, the proportions of serotypes 3, 19A, and 6A have increased in all age groups; those serotypes are not contained in the 10-valent vaccine but are included in the 13-valent one.</p>
