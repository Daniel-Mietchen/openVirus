<p id="Par51">Susceptibility to penicillin in pneumococcal infection is an emergent topic that greatly worries clinicians, although management of pneumonias is not as important as management of pneumococcal meningitis. Since changes in the cut-off points in the definition of resistance to infections outside the central nervous system, susceptibility to penicillin has remained low. Resistance to penicillin is greater in patients under 5Â years old than in other age groups, which is why this topic is more relevant to pediatric populations.</p>
