<p id="Par52">The most recent report of the Chilean Public Health Institute showed that the rates of intermediate sensitivity to penicillin and cefotaxime were 1–3% in the preceding 2 years, and the rate of resistance was 0%. When analyzed by age group, it was observed that for patients under 5 years old, the rate of intermediate sensitivity was 4% for penicillin and 5% for cefotaxime between 2007 and 2014, with a 0% rate of resistance to these antibiotics. The rate of resistance to macrolides in the same age group reached 47%, while the rate of susceptibility to levofloxacin and vancomycin remained at 100%.</p>
