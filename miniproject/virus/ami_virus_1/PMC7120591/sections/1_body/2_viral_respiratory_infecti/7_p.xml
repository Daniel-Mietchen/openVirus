<p id="Par17">Viral respiratory infections are a very good example of a model of acute viral infection, in which viruses affect the individual, with or without symptoms, and then they leave him or her within a period of days or weeks. The course of infection depends on the interaction of various factors depending on: (1) the human host: age, immune status (based on previous infections and vaccinations), activity, tobacco use, etc.; (2) the virus: infecting dose, type, serotype, and viral strain; and (3) the environment: season, weather, humidity, contamination, geographical location, rural/urban setting, hospital/community, etc. From the host standpoint, acute respiratory infections are more frequent in childhood, particularly in infants and children under 2 years old, who represent the group with the biggest serious risk.</p>
