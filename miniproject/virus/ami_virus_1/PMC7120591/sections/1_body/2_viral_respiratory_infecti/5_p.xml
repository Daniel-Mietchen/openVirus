<p id="Par15">These characteristics allow us to suspect specific causes of outbreaks or epidemics with reasonable certainty, considering associated clinical cases and detection of viruses at sentinel sites. Thus, a winter outbreak that involves infants under 1Â year old and causes cases of obstructive bronchial illness will be due to RSV. A characteristic trait of influenza is an epidemic of disease that is marked by fever, cough, headache, and musculoskeletal aches, and that compromises preschool children, schoolchildren, and young adults. Parainfluenza virus outbreaks are associated with symptoms of hoarseness, gruffness, and cough, besides lower respiratory tract infections, in infants. Adenoviruses are feared because they sometimes cause intense feverish conditions and severe nosocomial infections.</p>
