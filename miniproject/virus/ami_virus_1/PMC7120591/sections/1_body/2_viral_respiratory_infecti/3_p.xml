<p id="Par13">Several viruses are included in the group of “respiratory viruses” because they have the respiratory system as a target organ. Nevertheless, other viruses can also compromise the respiratory system while a systemic infection takes place (measles, chickenpox, enterovirus, hantavirus), especially in immunocompromised individuals (cytomegalovirus, herpesvirus, shingles). Furthermore, studies always show an important group of cases without a proven etiology, although the number of such cases has diminished with the application of molecular diagnosis techniques because many potentially pathogenic agents are now being detected or discovered (Table
