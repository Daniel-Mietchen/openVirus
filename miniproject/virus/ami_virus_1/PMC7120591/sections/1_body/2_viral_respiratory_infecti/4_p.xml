<p id="Par14">The clinical manifestations of viral respiratory diseases vary from asymptomatic cases to fatal infections, with several intermediate scenarios. Some viruses tend to produce infections mainly in the upper respiratory tract (rhinovirus, coronavirus, adenovirus), while others can similarly compromise the lower respiratory airways, with variable severity (adenovirus, RSV, metapneumovirus, influenza, and parainfluenza). In general, it is an accepted fact that any respiratory virus can compromise one or several levels of the respiratory system and cause clinical and subclinical infections, but there is a certain preference of viruses for compromising specific levels of the respiratory system (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">28.2</xref>). In this way, during an epidemic of a virus such as RSV or influenza, the major proportion of upper and lower respiratory tract infections will be caused by the prevalent virus. In addition, there will be an important incidence of subclinical infections, which act as efficient sources of transmission. As a result of herd immunity, important epidemics of multiple different viruses do not usually coexist in a community; instead, they alternate in terms of their presence in the community. For example, in Chile, the most commonly observed pattern involves parainfluenza outbreaks, followed by influenza outbreaks, and then RSV outbreaks; later, during winter–spring, metapneumovirus appears. Thus, the apexes of the epidemics follow one another and rarely overlap unless they affect populations of different ages. This phenomenon of viral interference may be explained by generation of interferon in infected patients, which “interferes” with the development of an infection of other viruses circulating at the same time.
