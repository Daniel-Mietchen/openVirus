<p id="Par12">Many regional or global estimates have identified acute respiratory infections as a primary cause of ambulatory consultations, hospitalizations, and deaths. In Chile, they take second place and third place in the leading causes of death in children and adults, respectively. Furthermore, several studies point toward them as the main causes of ambulatory consultations and absenteeism from both school and work. Their seasonal form of appearance and high infectivity place viruses as being responsible for the majority of acute respiratory infections . According to postneonatal mortality estimates, lower respiratory tract infections cause 20% of deaths, with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus being most common (9.5%). Advances in viral diagnosis have confirmed the participation of viruses in respiratory pediatric pathology, with frequencies that go from more than 50% (if they compromise the lower respiratory tract) to 90% (if they affect the upper respiratory tract). In adults, the scenario of upper respiratory tract infections is similar, but in lower respiratory tract infections a predominance of bacterial etiologies has been described. However, application of molecular viral diagnosis shows significant participation of respiratory viruses in lower respiratory tract infections. This fact acquires more relevance when considering the aging of a population.</p>
