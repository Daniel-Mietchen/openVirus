 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">28.1</xref>). The high infectivity of viruses makes epidemiological information vitally important in etiological clinical diagnosis, especially in terms of contact between sick patients and their relatives or close people in the community. The two kinds of respiratory virus that have the greatest impact on global health are RSV, which affects infants and elderly patients, and influenzas A and B, which compromise all of the population. Vaccines and antivirals have been developed just for influenza virus.
