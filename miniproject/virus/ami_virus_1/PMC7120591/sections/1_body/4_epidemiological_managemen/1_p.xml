<p id="Par32">In countries with temperate weather, the incidence of acute respiratory infections increases in cold seasons because of the appearance of viral epidemics. RSV is the virus most responsible for this and usually coincides with influenza outbreaks. In addition, respiratory adenoviruses appear endemically, with unpredictable increases that can acquire relevance because of their clinical seriousness and propensity to cause inpatient infections at times of overload in hospitals. Despite prevention not being efficient and the fact that there is no specific treatment for respiratory viruses, health care (both public and private) can be organized for prevention of severe cases and deaths.</p>
