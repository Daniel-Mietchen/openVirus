<p id="Par33">RSV appears “all winter” and its outbreak lasts for 3–5 months. It has been estimated that 60% of children who are born are infected during the first year of life, and all children have had contact with it by their second year; 25–40% of primary infections evolve as acute lower respiratory tract infections, and 2% of them require hospitalization. Influenza viruses usually appear in autumn in epidemics that last for 6–8 weeks. Accordingly, the demand for pediatric care increases during every winter; the emergence of RSV dominates bed availability for infants in hospitals and increases the need for ambulatory care, while influenza viruses dominate consultations for preschool children, schoolchildren, and adults.</p>
