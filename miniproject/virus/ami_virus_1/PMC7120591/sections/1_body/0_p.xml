<p id="Par2">The relationship between living disease agents—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—and their human or animal hosts can be studied at different levels. Biologists and biochemists analyze this relationship at the molecular and cellular levels, and are constantly making advances in knowledge about the pathogenesis of infections, as well as diagnosis and control through use of vaccines and medicines. Clinicians play the leading roles in the study and application of advances in individual curative medicine.</p>
