<p id="p0105">The limited capacity of MEAM1 and MED whiteflies to transmit SLCMV suggests that in regions where these invasive whitefly species dominate, e.g., South China, whitefly-borne SLCMV epidemic will hopefully not occur following the recent SLCMV introduction due to the lack of efficient vectors (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2011</xref>). Indeed, the same situation was found for CLCuMuV, which was found in South China in 2006 but no major epidemic has been reported, probably due to the limited distribution of its only known efficient whitefly vector, Asia II 1 (

Therefore, for the control of SLCMV, in regions where MED and MEAM1 are predominant, thorough implementation of phytosanitary and roguing may be enough to limit the spread of SLCMV. However, in other Asian cassava cultivation areas such as southern Vietnam, multiple indigenous whitefly species including Asia 1, Asia II 1, Asia II 6 have been reported (
