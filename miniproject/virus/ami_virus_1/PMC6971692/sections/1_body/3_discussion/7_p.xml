<p id="p0125">Taken together, here we show that indigenous Asia II 1 whiteflies were able to readily transmit SLCMV and invasive MEAM1 and MED whiteflies can only transmit this virus with very low efficiency. Further analysis revealed that the differential transmission might be due to the differential capacity of SLCMV to be retained by different whiteflies and to transport across the midgut of different species of whiteflies. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to explore the detailed whitefly transmission profile of an Asian CMBs. Our findings identified Asia II 1 whiteflies, but not MEAM1 or MED whiteflies as efficient vectors for SLCMV, which will help to evaluate the potential threat of SLCMV to cassava production in many regions and to facilitate the prediction of virus epidemics.</p>
