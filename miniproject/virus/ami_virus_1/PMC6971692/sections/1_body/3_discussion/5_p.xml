<p id="p0115">For the role of whitefly vectors in CMD epidemics, while it has been well established in the African context, much more remains to be explored in Asia (

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Uke et al., 2018</xref>). These findings provide valuable insight into the role of whitefly in Asian CMD. However, more studies, which should include detailed comparison of whitefly distribution and abundance in Africa and Asia, and comparative transmission of more different whitefly species-CMB combinations, are necessary to further illustrate the reasons for the differential role of whitefly in the outbreak of CMDs in the two continents.
