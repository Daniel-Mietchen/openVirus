<p id="p0100">In the present study, we compared the transmission efficiency of SLCMV by three whitefly species, and found that while Asia II 1 whiteflies were able to readily transmit the virus, MEAM1 and MED whiteflies poorly transmit SLCMV to test plants to induce symptoms (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Furthermore, the capacity of Asia II 1 whiteflies to transmit SLCMV to cassava plants was verified (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Notably, when tobacco plants were used as test plants, the transmission efficiency of SLCMV by MED whiteflies as indicated by PCR was much higher than that as indicated by symptom (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The possible reasons are: 1) at the time point of examination, the quantity of SLCMV in some MED whiteflies-inoculated plants was not sufficient to induce symptoms but enough to be detected by PCR; 2) MED whiteflies only transferred DNA-A of SLCMV to some test plants. For SLCMV, its transmission by whiteflies has to date only been outlined briefly in two reports, the first of which (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Duraisamy et al., 2013</xref>) failed to state the species of whitefly successful in transmitting SLCMV. Another study, wherein only a few test plants were used, showed that MEAM1 whiteflies were able to transmit SLCMV from symptomatic cassava plants to tomato and 
 <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> plants (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Considering the fact that the study by 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2019)</xref> is a disease note reporting the presence of SLCMV, we believe it is reasonable to state that MEAM1 poorly transmit SLCMV as judged from our data.
