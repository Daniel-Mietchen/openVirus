<p id="p0085">In order to monitor the transport of SLCMV within whiteflies, samples of whitefly whole body and organs were prepared and analyzed after whiteflies were allowed various AAPs (24, 48, 72 and 96 h). As shown in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref> for Asia II 1, after 24 h virus acquisition, SLCMV DNA was detected in all whitefly whole body samples and half of midgut samples. With the increase of AAPs, more midgut samples were found to contain detectable amount of SLCMV DNA and viral DNA starts to be detected in haemolymph and primary salivary glands samples after 48 h and 72 h AAPs. Likewise, for MED, SLCMV DNA was detected in all of whitefly whole body samples and some of midgut samples after a 24 h AAP, and viral DNA can be detected in haemolymph after a 72 h AAP. For primary salivary glands, however, no viral DNA was detected in any samples even after a 96 h AAP. For MEAM1, the virus was not found in any samples except in one whitefly whole body sample after a 72 h AAP and one midgut sample after a 96 h AAP.
