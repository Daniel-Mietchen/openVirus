<p id="p0080">The copy number of virus in whitefly whole body and honeydew was analyzed by qPCR. While the copy number of virus in the body of Asia II 1 and MED whiteflies seemed to increase with the increase of AAPs, copy number of virus in MEAM1 whiteflies remained at a stable and low level. Furthermore, significant difference of the copy number of SLCMV was found among the three whitefly species except at two points (Kruskal-Wallis tests, χ

Next, the copy number of virus in whitefly honeydew after whiteflies have been feeding on infected plants for 48 and 96 h was analyzed and the results showed that the highest copy number of virus seemed to be present in honeydew from MEAM1, followed by MED and the lowest in Asia II 1 (Kruskal-Wallis tests, χ
