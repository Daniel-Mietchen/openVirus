<p id="p0095">Immunofluorescence was used to detect the viral signals in whitefly midguts and primary salivary glands after various AAPs (12, 24, 48, 96 and 168 h). For midguts, while SLCMV signals were detected in the midguts of Asia II 1 and MED whiteflies after 48 and 96 h AAPs, respectively, no viral signal was detected in the midguts of MEAM1 whiteflies even after a 168 h AAP; and in the midguts of Asia II 1 and MED whiteflies, viral signals, mostly found in the filter chamber, became stronger as AAP increased; notably, stronger viral signals were found in midguts from Asia II 1 than those from MEAM1 after whiteflies were given 96 h and 168 h AAPs (
