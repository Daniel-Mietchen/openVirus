<p id="p0075">The transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by three species of the 
 <italic>B. tabaci</italic> complex, namely Asia II 1, MEAM1 and MED were compared. The average transmission efficiencies were 87.2% for Asia II 1, 3.3% for MEAM1 and 16.7% for MED as indicated by symptom (Kruskal-Wallis test, χ

Likewise, the percentages of tobacco plants with detectable SLCMV DNA in all plants tested, differed significantly among the three whitefly species, with the highest transmission (90.5%) by Asia II 1, followed by MED (63.3%) and with only a very low transmission efficiency (6.7%) by MEAM1 (Kruskal-Wallis test, χ

 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B). Furthermore, to verify the capacity of Asia II 1 whiteflies to transmit SLCMV to cassava plants, we performed virus transmission experiment using two cassava varieties, HLS11 and SC8. As shown in 
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, Asia II 1 whitefly inoculation of cassava plants cv. HLS11 and SC8 resulted in successful transmission of SLCMV, and the transmission rate is 50% and 100% for HLS11 and SC8, respectively.
