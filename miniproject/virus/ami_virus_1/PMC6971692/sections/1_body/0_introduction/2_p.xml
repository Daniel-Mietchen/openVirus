<p id="p0010">Cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> Crantz), normally grown for its starchy roots, is a staple food for nearly one billion people in 105 countries (

Thanks to its inherent tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and infertile soils, cassava is now being widely grown in tropical Africa, Asia and Latin America, making it one of the most important crops in the world (

In recent decades, however, cassava mosaic diseases (CMDs) caused by cassava mosaic begomoviruses (CMBs), have emerged as a serious threat to the production of cassava. While significant yield losses have been documented due to CMD outbreaks, spread continues as evidenced by recent CMD emergence in Cambodia, Vietnam and China (
