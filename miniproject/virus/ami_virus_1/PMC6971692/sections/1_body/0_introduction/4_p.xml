<p id="p0020">Due to the fact that cassava plants are normally vegetatively propagated, inter-regional spread of CMBs entails the transport of infected cuttings (

 <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Indeed, field surveys conducted in India and Vietnam have both shown that cutting-borne infections constitute a large proportion of CMD incidences in the field, followed by less frequent whitefly-borne infections (

 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Minato et al., 2019</xref>). More importantly, transmission by whitefly will render some control strategies such as roguing and phytosanitary measures less effective, as epidemics are able to establish from a limited source of infection with the aid of whitefly vectors. Therefore, sustainable control of CMBs, including SLCMV, can only be achieved when a detailed understanding of whitefly transmission of CMBs, as well as alternative hosts is gained.
