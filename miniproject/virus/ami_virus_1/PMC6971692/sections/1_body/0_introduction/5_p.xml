<p id="p0025">Begomoviruses are known to be vectored by the whitefly

Therefore, a detailed exploration on the transmission of begomoviruses by different whitefly species will lead to an improved understanding of the identity of vector species of the corresponding plant viral diseases, which will in turn facilitate the prediction of virus epidemics. This is exemplified by the case of cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV), wherein it was established that disease associated with this virus is primarily spread by Asia II 1, an indigenous whitefly species (
