<p id="p0030">In the present study, we characterized the transmission of SLCMV by three whitefly species of the

 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>), namely Asia II 1, Mediterranean (MED) and Middle East-Asia Minor (MEAM1), and examined the factors involved. Firstly, we compared the transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by the three whiteflies species. Next, quantification of virus in whitefly whole body and honeydew was performed. Further, virus movement within whitefly body after virus acquisition was examined. These findings provide the first detailed whitefly transmission profile of a cassava mosaic begomovirus in Asia, based on which further implications are discussed.
