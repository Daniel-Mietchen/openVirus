<p id="p0045">For agro-inoculation, agrobacteria containing pBINPLUS-1.9A and pBINPLUS-1.9B were cultured separately until the OD600 reached 1.0–1.5. Then bacterial culture was centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, and the obtained cell pellet was resuspended in resuspension buffer (10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM MES and 150 ɥM acetosyringone). Then equal amount (OD) of agrobacteria containing pBINPLUS-1.9A and pBINPLUS-1.9B were mixed. Agro-inoculation was performed with 1 mL syringe when tobacco plants reached 3–4 true leaf stage. Approximately one month later, infection of tobacco plants was examined by inspection of symptoms (
