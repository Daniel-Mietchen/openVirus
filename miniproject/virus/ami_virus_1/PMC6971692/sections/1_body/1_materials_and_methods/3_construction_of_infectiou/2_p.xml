<p id="p0040">SLCMV DNA A and DNA B were amplified from cassava samples collected from Cambodia (
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2016</xref>) and were used to construct the infectious clones. The sequences of DNA A and DNA B of the isolate used for the construction of infectious clones have 3 point mutations compared to the original sequences (GenBank accession codes: KT861468 for DNA-A and KT861469 for DNA-B). We have presented the DNA sequence of SLCMV DNA A and DNA B in supplementary information. For DNA-A, full-length genome were amplified with primers SLCMV-A-FL-F and SLCMV-A-FL-R (HindIII restriction sites at both ends), and ligated into pGEM-T vectors (Promega, USA). Then 0.9 unit of DNA-A was amplified using the recombinant plasmids as template with SLCMV-A-0.9U-F (an AscI restriction site was introduced) and SLCMV-A-FL-R, and after digestion by HindIII and AscI, the fragments were inserted into the binary vector pBinPLUS to produce pBINPLUS-0.9A. Then the full-length genome of DNA-A was excised from T vectors by HindIII digestion and ligated into pBINPLUS-0.9A to produce pBinPLUS-1.9A. Similarly, the full-length genome of DNA-B was amplified with primers SLCMV-B-FL-F and SLCMV-B-FL-R (BamHI restriction sites at both ends), and ligated into pGEM-T vectors (Promega, USA). Then 0.9 unit of DNA-B was excised from the recombinant plasmids by digestion of BamHI and KpnI, and inserted into the binary vector pBINPLUS to produce pBINPLUS-0.9B. The full-length genome of DNA-B was excised from T vectors by BamHI digestion and ligated into pBinPLUS-0.9B to produce pBinPLUS-1.9B. The pBINPLUS-1.9A and pBINPLUS-1.9B plasmids were mobilized into the 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> strain EHA105 to obtain the infectious clones of SLCMV DNA-A and DNA-B. All primers were listed in
