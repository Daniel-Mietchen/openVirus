<p id="p0035">In the present study, three kinds of plants, namely cotton (
 <italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> L. cv. Zhemian 1793), tobacco (
 <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> L. cv. NC89) and cassava (
 <italic>Manihot esculenta</italic> cv. HLS11 and SC8) were used. All cotton and tobacco plants were grown in a greenhouses under natural lighting supplemented with artificial lighting at controlled temperatures of 25 ± 3 °C, 14 L: 10 D. For insects, three whitefly cryptic species, of which two are invasive worldwide including MED and MEAM1, one is indigenous species in Asia, namely Asia II 1, were used. These three whitefly species were chosen as they exhibit abundant distribution in regions where SLCMV occurred, including Vietnam, Cambodia and South China (

 <italic>COI</italic>) GenBank accession codes are GQ371165 (MED), KM821540 (MEAM1) and DQ309077 (Asia II 1). Whiteflies of all three species were maintained on cotton plants in separate insect-proof cages in artificial climate chambers at 26 ± 1 °C, 14 h light/10 h darkness and 60–80% relative humidity. The purity of each whitefly culture was monitored every three generations using the mt
 <italic>COI</italic> PCR-RFLP technique and sequencing as described before (
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2013</xref>). In all experiments described in the present study, only female whiteflies with an age of 0–7 days post emergence were used.
