<p id="p0050">For virus acquisition, whitefly adults were collected and released onto SLCMV-infected tobacco for a 96 h virus acquisition. When tobacco plants were used as test plants, groups of 10 whiteflies (Asia II 1, MED and MEAM1) were collected and released onto each test plants to feed for 96 h. Three replicates, each containing 10 plants were conducted for each whitefly species. When cassava plants were used as test plants, groups of 30 whiteflies (Asia II 1 only) were collected and released onto each plant to feed for 120 h. Two test plants were used for each of the two cassava varieties used. Leaf-clip cages were used to enclose the whiteflies on the test plants (

The test plants were sprayed with imidacloprid at a concentration of 20 mg/L to kill all the eggs. Four weeks post virus transmission, infection of test plants was examined by inspection of symptoms and detection of viral DNAs as mentioned above.
