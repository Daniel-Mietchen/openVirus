<p id="p0055">For quantification of SLCMV DNA in whitefly whole body after various virus access periods (AAPs), whitefly adults were collected in groups of 15 and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris, 0.45% Tween 20, 0.2% gelatin, 0.45% NP40, 60 mg/mL Proteinase K with pH at 8.4) followed by 1.5 h incubation at 65 °C and 10 min at 100 °C to obtain the template for the subsequent virus quantification. Sample preparation of whitefly honeydew after whiteflies have been feeding on infected plants for 48 h and 96 h were conducted as described before (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018b</xref>). For organs, post dissection, four midguts or primary salivary glands were collected as one sample, respectively. Haemolymph from four whiteflies was collected as one sample using the method described before (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2018b</xref>). DNA was then extracted using the lysis buffer as mentioned above. Real time PCR was performed using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa, Japan) and CFX96™ Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) with primers SLCMV-RT-F and SLCMV-RT-R for SLCMV, and primers WF-Actin-F and WF-Actin-R to target whitefly
