<p id="p0060">For PCR detection of SLCMV in whitefly whole body, whiteflies were collected individually after various AAPs. For organs, midguts were dissected and collected individually, and haemolymph from one whitefly was collected as one sample. For primary salivary glands, a pair of them was dissected from the same whitefly and analyzed as one sample. All the samples were then subjected to DNA extraction using lysis buffer as mentioned above and PCR with primers SLCMV-A-PCR-F and SLCMV-A-PCR-R (
