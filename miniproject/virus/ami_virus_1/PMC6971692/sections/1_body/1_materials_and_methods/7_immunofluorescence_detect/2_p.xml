<p id="p0065">Immunofluorescence was performed as per the protocol described by 
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Wei et al. (2014)</xref> with minor modifications. Midguts and primary salivary glands were first dissected in PBS and fixed for 1 h with 4% paraformaldehyde. Next, the samples were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 30 min, followed by three washes with PBS and a 1 h fixation in 1% BSA dissolved in TBS-Tween 20 (TBST). Organs were incubated overnight with anti-tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) monoclonal antibodies (a kind gift from Professor Xueping Zhou, Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University) at a 1:400 dilution at 4 °C. Then the organs were washed and incubated with 549-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:400) (Earthox, China) for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing, organs were covered with DAPI (Abcam, USA) and examined under a Zeiss LSM 780 confocal microscope (ZEISS, Germany).
