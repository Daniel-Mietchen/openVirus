  <p>Copy number of SLCMV in whitefly whole body and honeydew. Whiteflies were allowed to feed on SLCMV infected plants, and then at each designated time point, whiteflies were collected and subjected to quantification of SLCMV (A). The honeydew was also collected after whiteflies had been feeding on SLCMV infected plants for 48 h (B) and 96 h (C), and subjected to virus quantification. The number of samples analyzed for each combination of time point and whitefly species is four, and the number of samples analyzed in B or C is eight for each whitefly species. The values represent the mean ± SEM of copy number of virus, and different letters above the bars indicate significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis test, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
