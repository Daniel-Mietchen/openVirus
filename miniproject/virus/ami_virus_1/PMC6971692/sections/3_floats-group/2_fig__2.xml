  <p>Transmission of SLCMV to cassava (cv. HLS11 and SC8) by Asia II 1 whiteflies. Whiteflies were allowed to acquire SLCMV from SLCMV-infected tobacco plants for 4 days, and then they were collected and released onto cassava seedlings for virus transmission. The number of whiteflies per cassava seedling was 30. Five days later, whiteflies were removed and cassava seedlings were further cultured for another 4 weeks. As for negative control (âˆ’), cassava seedlings were kept in a whitefly-free insect-proof cage. Results of PCR detection of SLCMV in cassava plants inoculated by whiteflies were presented in A, and + stands for positive control in PCR analysis. Picture of control and SLCMV-infected HLS11 and SC8 cassava plants were presented in B and C, respectively. As compared to un-infected cassava plants, SLCMV-infected plants exhibited leaf curl and mosaic in young leaves (B and C).</p>
