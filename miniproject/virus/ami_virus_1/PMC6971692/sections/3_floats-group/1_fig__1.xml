  <p>Transmission efficiency of SLCMV to tobacco by three species of the 
   <italic>B. tabaci</italic> complex (Asia II 1, MEAM1 and MED). Whiteflies were allowed a 96 h virus AAP, and then transferred onto tobacco seedlings to transmit the virus for another 96 h. The number of whiteflies per test plant was 10, and for each whitefly species, three replicates were conducted with each consisting of 10 plants. The values represent mean ± SEM of the percentage of PCR positive test plants (A) and percentage of test plants that showed typical symptoms (B) in all plants tested. Different letters above the bars indicate significant differences (Kruskal-Wallis test, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
