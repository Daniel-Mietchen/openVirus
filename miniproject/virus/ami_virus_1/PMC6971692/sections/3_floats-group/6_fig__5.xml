  <p>Immunofluorescence detection of SLCMV in whitefly midguts. Whiteflies were allowed to feed on SLCMV infected plants, and then at each designated time point, whitefly midguts were dissected and subjected to immunofluorescence detection of SLCMV. SLCMV was detected using mouse anti-TYLCV antibodies and goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 549 (red), and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Images with typical SLCMV signals at each time point are presented.</p>
