    "In recent years, Sri Lankan cassava mosaic virus (SLCMV), a begomovirus (genus Begmovirus, family Geminiviridae) causing cassava mosaic disease in Asia, poses serious threats to cassava cultivation in Asia. However, the transmission of SLCMV in the areas into which it has recently been introduced remain largely unexplored. Here we have compared the transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by three widely distributed whitefly species in Asia, and found that only Asia II 1 whiteflies were able to transmit this virus efficiently. The transmission efficiencies of SLCMV by different whitefly species were found to correlate positively with quantity of virus in whitefly whole body. Further, the viral transmission efficiency was found to be associated with varied ability of virus movement within different species of whiteflies. These findings provide detailed information regarding whitefly transmission of SLCMV, which will help to understand the spread of SLCMV in the field, and facilitate the prediction of virus epidemics."
