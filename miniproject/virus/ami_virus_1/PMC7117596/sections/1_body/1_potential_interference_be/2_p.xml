<p>The first seems to be represented by the potential overlap between the coronavirus-related interstitial pneumonia and the possible pneumological toxicity from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 agents. Even if lung toxicity is not the most frequent adverse event of ICI, it can be life threatening. The overall incidence rate of ICI-related pneumonitis ranges from 2.5–5% with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 monotherapy to 7–10% with anti-CTLA-4/anti-PD-1 combination therapy [

 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Despite being rarer than other irAEs, pneumonitis is the most fatal AE associated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy, accounting for 35% of treatment-related toxic deaths [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Considering that underlying lung disease, particularly including interstitial pneumopathy, is considered a risk factor for ICI-related pneumonitis, it could be reasonable taking into account the risk of treating patients while they are developing an initial form of COVID-19. The synergy between the two lung injuries, despite only hypothetical, cannot be surely ruled out. Nevertheless, such an epidemiological coincidence should not prevent the oncologist from offering a potentially effective and often well-tolerated treatment even in the middle of the COVID-19 outbreak, since the duration of the pandemic is still currently unpredictable. This is true in particular considering the potentially curative aim of ICI treatment in the context of highly responsive diseases, such as melanoma and renal cell carcinoma and in the adjuvant setting even more than in the advanced disease.
