<p>COVID-19 morbidity and mortality have been linked to elderly age and comorbidities, leading to a poorer outcome to the viral infection for frail patients and more often resulting in hospitalization, intensive care unit admittance and need for invasive tracheal intubation [

A recent nationwide analysis in China demonstrated that, of 1590 COVID-19 cases from 575 hospitals, 18 had a history of cancer (1 vs 0.29% of cancer incidence in the overall Chinese population, respectively), with lung cancer as the most frequent diagnosis [

Moreover, cancer patients who underwent recent chemotherapy or surgery had a higher risk of clinically severe events than did those not receiving treatment. With the limit of a small sample size, the authors concluded that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19, and poorer outcomes, than individuals without cancer. As a consequence, they recommended to consider an intentional postponing of adjuvant chemotherapy or elective surgery for stable cancer in endemic areas [
