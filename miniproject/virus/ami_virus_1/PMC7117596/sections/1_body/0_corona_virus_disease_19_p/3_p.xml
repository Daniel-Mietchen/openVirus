<p>Nevertheless, as subsequently highlighted by other authors, the true incidence of COVID-19 in patients with cancer would be more informative in assessing whether such patients have an increased risk (and morbidity) from this viral illness [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, the limited cancer patient population described in this first report from the literature, was curiously characterized by the lack of individuals receiving anticancer immunotherapy. Indeed, only chemotherapy and surgery were cited among treatments received by patients in the month prior to developing COVID-19. Maybe, this could simply be due to the casualty of a small sample, or otherwise, it could suggest that cancer patients receiving immunotherapy are less prone to develop COVID-19 or to be admitted in hospital due to severe coronavirus symptoms. Currently, we are aware of the probably higher incidence of misdiagnosed coronavirus infections compared with that reported and updated every day; it is likely that a great portion of healthy and young population develop COVID-19 with mild symptoms, not requiring hospital admittance and thus escaping the laboratory confirmation of the disease [

Cancer patients undergoing treatment with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI)Â currently used in everyday practice to treat solid tumors such as melanoma, lung cancer, renal carcinoma, urothelial cancers and head and neck carcinoma constitute a growing oncological population [
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Their specific susceptibility to bacterial or viral infections has not been investigated. Considering that immunotherapy with ICI is able to restore the cellular immunocompetence, as we previously suggested in the context of influenza infection, the patient undergoing immune checkpoint blockade could be more immunocompetent than cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy [
