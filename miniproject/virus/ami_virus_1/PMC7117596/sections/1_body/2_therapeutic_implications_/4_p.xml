<p>Second, it is probably a matter of patient. Patients more prone to developing immune hyperactivation are probably those more likely to respond to ICI [
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. There is a possibility that such patients would be also more prone to fall in the cytokine storm in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, these patients do not correspond to the average advanced cancer patient, who is supposed to be immunosuppressed, with a blunted immune status [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The epidemiology of the COVID-19 observed up today suggests that SARS-CoV-2 tends to infect more frequently the frail patient populations, such as the elderly and cancer patients [
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Cancer is usually associated with overexpression of immunosuppressive cytokines, suppression of proinflammatory danger signals, impaired dendritic cell maturation, and enhanced immunosuppressive leukocyte populations [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Since ICI can restore the immune-competence, if on one hand it can be paradoxically needed to develop the cytokine storm characterizing the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) phase, on the other hand the epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 infection lay for a lower probability to affect these patients compared with their chemo-treated immune-suppressed counterpart.
