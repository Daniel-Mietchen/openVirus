Then, several randomized clinical trials were initiated in China and more recently in Italy, investigating different treatment options, varying from classical antiviral drugs as lopinavir/ritonavir, to newer antiviral as remdesivir, to unconventional agents such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine [
