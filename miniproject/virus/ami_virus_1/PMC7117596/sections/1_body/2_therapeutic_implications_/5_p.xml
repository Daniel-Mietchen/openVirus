<p>Third, the efficacy of tocilizumab for COVID-19 is still under investigation, with still unexplored backstage and with uncomfortable upstream evidence coming from the setting of influenza infection. Despite clinical studies associating IL-6 with high disease severity in influenza-infected patients and its levels correlated directly with symptom occurrence in human influenza virus infection, the role of this cytokine is still ambiguous [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. It was demonstrated in mice models that IL-6 is essential for preventing virus-induced neutrophil cell death and H1N1-associated mortality, limiting influenza-induced cytokine storm and protecting against fatal lung pathology [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Furthermore, IL-6 is crucial in secondary infections to recall virus-specific memory CD4 T cells, favoring virus clearance and host survival, as supported by the inability of IL-6 deficient mice to control influenza viral titers in the lung [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Such preclinical evidence suggests that, despite probably being harmful in the ARDS phase, IL-6 role could be crucial, in the early phase of the viral infection, to defuse the pathogenesis of severe and lethal forms of influenza.Â Thus, hoping for positive results from tocilizumab randomized clinical trial on COVID-19 patients, we could only argue about the evident diversity of this viral infection from previous SARS outbreaks and even more from influenza epidemics, probably both in terms of clinical features and of pathogenetic implications.
