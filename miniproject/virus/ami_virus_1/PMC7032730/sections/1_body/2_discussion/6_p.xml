<p>The application to a dataset of HA sequences of the pH1N1 virus demonstrates how the parsimonious reconstruction using effective distances can be used in case of new outbreaks, as long as viral sequences and precise geographic information for the isolates are available. This approach offers a powerful tool to rapidly analyze sequence data, find the place of origin and propose possible spread routes to the resolution of single airports. This information would be helpful to implement control measures like increased surveillance or restricted travel to contain or slow down the global spread of a new infection.</p>
