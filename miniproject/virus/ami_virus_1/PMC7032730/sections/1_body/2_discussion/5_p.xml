<p>However, the advantages of Bayesian methods to previous parsimonious methods still hold. Bayesian methods allow to integrate over uncertainties in the phylogeny and migration process, while parsimony methods assume a fixed tree topology that was previously inferred from the data and usually differs from the true tree topology. Parsimony methods further donâ€™t infer posterior probabilities, therefore giving no indication about the certainty of the results, and do not consider branch lengths. When using the Sankoff algorithm, we assume prior knowledge about the mode of transportation, which might not always be available. Instead, Bayesian methods include the possibility to infer potential modes of transportation by testing predictors of spatial spread. In the future, both methods could be used in a complementary way depending on the data, the desired analysis as well as time and computing resources. To enable others to apply this approach to new datasets, all software is provided in a Github repository [
