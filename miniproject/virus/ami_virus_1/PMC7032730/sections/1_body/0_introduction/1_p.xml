<p>Influenza A viruses continue to impose high mortality and morbidity worldwide [

In addition to seasonal epidemics every winter, pandemics can occur when an antigenically novel virus, usually of zoonotic origin, establishes human-to-human transmission. The latest pandemic occurred in 2009, when a novel H1N1 influenza A virus emerged in March and quickly spread around the globe, with 177,000 confirmed infections in over 170 countries until early August [
