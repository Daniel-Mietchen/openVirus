<p>For nearly all datasets and analyses, the root was placed either in Mexico or the US, with effective distances inferring Mexico more often (70% of the cases using the inferred tree topology and 96% on the simulated one) than geographic distances (34% and 62%, respectively) and equal distances (56% and 84%). Bayesian analyses inferred Mexico as the origin in 46% of the datasets when using symmetric rates, in 66% when using asymmetric rates, in 68% when using the GLM while estimating the predictors and in 84% when using the GLM with effective distances as fixed predictors. When the simulated tree was fixed in the GLM analysis, Mexico was inferred as the root location in all datasets.</p>
