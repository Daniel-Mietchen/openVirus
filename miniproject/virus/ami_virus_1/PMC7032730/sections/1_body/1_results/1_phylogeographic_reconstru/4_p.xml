<p>For both the inferred and the simulated trees, the reconstruction using effective distances resulted in a lower distance compared to the reconstruction using geographic and equal distances (P-values of paired t-test: 7.6×10
 <sup>−10</sup> and 1.4×10
 <sup>−10</sup> for the comparison to geographic distances (for inferred and reconstructed trees, respectively), and 7.1×10
 <sup>−5</sup> and 0.0004 for the comparison to equal distances). However, both reconstructions with effective distances showed a small number of outliers with distances as high as in the analysis with geographic distances. In comparison, the reconstructions with equal distances showed extremely high variation compared to the other distance measures. When using geographic distances, the phylogeographic reconstruction using the inferred tree resulted in higher distances compared to the analysis on the simulated tree (P-value of paired t-test: 3.7×10
 <sup>−9</sup>), indicating that errors introduced by the tree inference influenced the results. When using effective and equal distances, no significant difference was observed between reconstructions using the inferred and simulated tree (P-value of paired t-test: 0.1197 for effective distances, 0.0622 for equal distances). However, using the simulated tree resulted into a lower variance.
