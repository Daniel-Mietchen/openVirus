<p>To ensure that these results are independent of the transitions between locations, which have been simulated only once using GLEAMviz and can vary between different runs, we performed the same analyses on four additional GLEAMviz simulations, with 50 simulations of the sampling, the tree and the sequences each. While there are some slight variations in the distributions of Fréchet tree distances across the five GLEAMviz simulations, the overall conclusions remained the same, with the reconstructions using effective distances consistently showing the smallest Fréchet tree distances (
