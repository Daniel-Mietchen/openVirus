<p>Tracer version 1.7.1 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007101.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was used to confirm adequate effective sample sizes (ESS), indicating good estimates of the posterior distributions of the parameters. TreeAnnotator was then used to summarize the sampled trees into a maximum clade credibility tree using a burn-in of 10%. For the evaluation of the phylogeographic reconstruction, we assigned the location with the highest posterior probability to each node.
