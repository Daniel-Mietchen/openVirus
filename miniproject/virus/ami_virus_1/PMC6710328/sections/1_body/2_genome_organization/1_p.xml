<p>Picornaviruses have single-stranded RNA positive-sense genomes (~7–9 kb) that serve as mRNA for viral protein synthesis (Baltimore, 
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1971</xref>) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1A</xref>). Their RNA holds a single ORF encoding a polyprotein precursor for all viral proteins. Importantly, the 5′-end of the genome is covalently bound to the Viral-Protein-genome (VPg) (Crawford and Baltimore, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1983</xref>), the primer for viral RNA synthesis (Nomoto et al., 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">1977</xref>). Two untranslated regions (UTR), 5′UTR and 3′UTR, flank the ORF and contain virus-specific RNA secondary structural elements implicated in replication and providing host specificity (Kloc et al., 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The 5′UTR bears an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and polypyrimidine tract (PPT) that elicit host ribosomes and PPT-binding protein for translation (Martinez-Salas et al., 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>). The 3′UTR finishes in a poly(A) tail that mimics host mRNA tail conferring genome stability.
