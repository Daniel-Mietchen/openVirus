<p>Picornavirus cell infection starts with its attachment to cell receptors (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, virus-receptor usage is critical for tropism and its evolution can change virus targets at the level of cells to host ranges. The capsid binding sites of picornavirus receptors can be used to classify them into canyon binders and non-canyon binders.
