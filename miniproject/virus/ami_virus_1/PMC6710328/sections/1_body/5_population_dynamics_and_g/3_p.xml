<p>In addition to the classical view of single virus infectious unit of picornaviruses, structures containing many viral genomes support the existence of collective infectious units (Sanjuán, 
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). Lipid vesicles have been observed in HAV and EV infections (Feng et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Chen et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>; Kirkegaard, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). This current evidence incorporates the vesicle release and transmission to the standard lytic release and transmission of free virions, opening the debate on the “social evolution” of picornaviruses. Social evolution has been proposed to reduce detrimental mutations and negative interactions among the individuals within the population with direct implications for viral evolution, genetic diversity, and viral fitness (Bordería et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
