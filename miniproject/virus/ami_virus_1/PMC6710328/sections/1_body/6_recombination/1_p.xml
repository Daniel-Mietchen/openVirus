<p>During infection, RNA virus genomes can interchange nucleotide sequences resulting in genetic variation by recombination resulting in unpredictable advantages (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). This phenomenon was discovered in cells co-infected with PV escape mutants, resistant to antisera and guanidine, resulting in recombinant infectious PV (Ledinko, 
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1963</xref>). Recombination is widespread at intra-typic and inter-typic levels (Lukashev, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), often preceding the emergence of novel evolutionary lineages of picornaviruses (McWilliam Leitch et al., 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Meijer et al., 
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). For instance, there is evidence about recombinants of Sabin-related polioviruses harboring homologous sequences of other species of enteroviruses (Arita et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Combelas et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Bessaud et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
