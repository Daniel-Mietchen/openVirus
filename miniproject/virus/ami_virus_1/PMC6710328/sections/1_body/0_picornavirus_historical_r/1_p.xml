<p>Picornaviruses have been pivotal in the foundations of virology. Original research on “ultra-filterable infectious agents” such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and poliovirus (PV) began the era of animal virology (Loeffler and Frosch, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">1898</xref>; Eggers, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>). The development of cell cultures for PV replication led to Salk's inactivated and Sabin's attenuated vaccines (Enders et al., 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1949</xref>). The first animal virus engineered into an infectious clone (Racaniello and Baltimore, 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">1981</xref>) and the first virus synthesized outside the cell was PV (Molla et al., 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>).
