<p>The control and eradication of pathogenic picornaviruses is an ongoing problem. Picornavirus evolution, ruled by high mutation rates and recombination, has made this viral group genetically and antigenically highly variable. Moreover, changes in virulence represent an unpredictable threat. Important lessons drawn from the polio eradication battle indicate the necessity of a new generation of vaccines (Agol et al., 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). A holistic approach based on big data and mathematical modeling combining views from structural and evolutionary biology, cellular, and molecular immunology will allow a better understanding of picornavirusâ€“host interactions. This knowledge could have the potential to foresee possible outbreaks and changes on viral virulence. Furthermore, these models may redefine the way new vaccines and antiviral therapies will be designed.
