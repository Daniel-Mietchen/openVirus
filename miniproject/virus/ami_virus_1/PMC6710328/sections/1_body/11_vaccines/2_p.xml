<p>New ideas for picornavirus vaccines, currently under development, exploit evolutionary concepts including (i) codon usage, (ii) mutational robustness, (iii) modification of translational efficiency, and (iv) RdRp fidelity manipulation (Burns et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Mueller et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Coleman et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Le NouÃ«n et al., 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; McDonald et al., 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). In this regard, synonymous codon deoptimization was first applied for PV (Burns et al., 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Mueller et al., 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) and other picornaviruses such as FMDV (Diaz-San Segundo et al., 
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Interestingly, increasing the CpG and UpA dinucleotide frequencies using synonymous codon substitutions leads to increased activation of the immune system (Tulloch et al., 
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). The maintenance of phenotype despite changing the genotype (mutations), or mutational robustness, can be altered by codon substitutions, correlating less robust viruses with attenuation in mice (Lauring et al., 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This approach was further extended using synonymous codons that upon mutation became stop codons (Moratorio et al., 
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>). The increase in stop codon mutations in codon-engineered CVB3 during replication led to a loss of infectivity 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and attenuation 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. These new methods can improve the safety of already existing live-attenuated vaccines and can be broadly applied by re-coding any viral genome (Jorge et al., 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).
