<p>The aim of this study is to determine the population susceptibility to influenza viruses that are newly emerging in the interepidemic period. We used a human serum panel consisting of individuals from all age groups as we described previously [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. We hypothesise that the influenza subtype with a greater reduction in the antibody titer would signify an increased susceptibility of the population to that subtype.
