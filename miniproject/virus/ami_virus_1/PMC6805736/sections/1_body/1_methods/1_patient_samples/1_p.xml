 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The serum samples consisted of 50 samples of each 10-year age cohort from 10–19 year-old to ⩾80 year-old cohorts. For the 0–9 year-old cohort, 45 serum samples were retrieved. These serum samples were collected from April to June 2018, which is after the 2017/2018 winter influenza season. This study was approved by the HKU/HA HKW Institutional Review Board (UW 18–141).
