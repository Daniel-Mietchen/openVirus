<p>A microneutralisation (MN) assay was performed and interpreted according to the 2-day enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay protocol of the World Health Organisation [
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Serum samples were serially diluted by two-fold from 1:20 to 1:2560. Viral antigen was detected using anti-nucleoprotein antibody [
 <xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. All viruses used in the MN assay were cultured in Madin Darby canine kidney cells as we described previously [
 <xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], to avoid mutations that may arise during egg passage. The haemagglutinin (HA) gene of the virus stocks used for the MN assay was sequenced.
