<p>An extremely important element affecting the biological safety of the farm is designation of clean and dirty areas for personnel, including changing rooms and showers. If a visit is necessary, it should be recorded in the register of visitors. In addition, if visitors enter the pig area, they should follow biosecurity measures for footwear and clothing (

The pig house should be fenced in appropriately so as to ensure that there is no direct contact with wild boars or pigs coming from other buildings. Outdoor farms should be doubly fenced off with a margin in order to minimise contact between pigs and wild boars. The regular disinfection of agricultural equipment and vehicles located at the farm is also an essential measure (
