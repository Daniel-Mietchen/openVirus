<p>Besides 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic>, several other flies also feed on the blood of animals, including 
 <italic>Stomoxys niger</italic>, 
 <italic>Stomoxys sitiens</italic>, and 
 <italic>Stomoxys indicus</italic>. There are 18 species named within the 
 <italic>Stomoxys</italic> genus. Flies belonging to the genus are mechanical vectors of pathogens present in the blood of animals, especially farm animals. They can also be mechanical vectors of human pathogens. The viruses transmitted by 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic> may include equine infectious anaemia virus (EIAV), West Nile fever virus (WNFV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), lumpy skin disease virus (LSDV), bovine herpes virus (BHV), bovine leukosis virus (BLV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). In addition, 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic> can carry bacteria such as 
 <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, 
 <italic>Pasteurella multocida</italic>, 
 <italic>Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae</italic>, 
 <italic>Francisella tularensis</italic>, and 
 <italic>Enterobacter sakazakii</italic>. There are also indications that 
 <italic>S. calcitrans</italic> may be a mechanical vector for ASFV (
