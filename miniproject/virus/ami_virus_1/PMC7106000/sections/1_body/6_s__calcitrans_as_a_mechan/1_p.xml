<p>Many outbreaks of ASF have been detected on farms with high biosecurity standards. One of the possible reasons was the straw obtained from areas inhabited by wild boars. In addition to this source, insects as ASFV vectors may be a cause, possibly in certain seasons particularly, because the biology of various groups of insects may be associated with strong seasonality in the occurrence of ASF outbreaks on pig farms. The highest number of outbreaks is observed in June, July, and August.</p>
