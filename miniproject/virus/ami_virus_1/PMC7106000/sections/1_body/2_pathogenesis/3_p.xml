<p>The degree of damage to organs in the course of infection with ASFV depends on the form of the disease. ASF may have an acute, subacute, chronic, or subclinical course. The acute form of the disease is characterised by high mortality. Virus strains with moderate and weakened virulence are responsible for the subacute form of the disease, and these strains are observed in countries where the virus is endemic. The subacute form is characterised by moderate mortality and lesions are less typical (

These infections can lead to animals becoming carriers of the virus, which contributes to the constant occurrence of the virus in the environment and an increased risk of the disease spreading to further areas where the disease has not been present (
