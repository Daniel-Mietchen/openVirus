 <bold>Ticks</bold>. ASFV was originally associated with the ecological niche of soft ticks of the 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> genus and warthogs (
 <italic>Phacochoerus africanus</italic>) in sub-Saharan Africa. The warthogs have natural resistance to ASFV and they usually do not develop the full-blown disease but rather become asymptomatic carriers. It has been shown that ASFV can replicate in these ticks and can survive up to five years in the absence of transmission to a sensitive host. This contributes to an increase in the population of infected ticks, and thus to an increased risk of infection of domestic pigs and wild boars (

 <italic>Ornithodoros moubata</italic> in Africa and 
 <italic>Ornithodoros erraticus</italic> in Europe (

 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> genus can participate in virus transmission. These species include 
 <italic>O. porcinus, O. coriaceus, O. turicata</italic>, and 
 <italic>O. savignyi</italic> (
