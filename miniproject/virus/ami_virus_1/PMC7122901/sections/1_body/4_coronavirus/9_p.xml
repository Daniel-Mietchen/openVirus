<p id="Par17">Whereas coronaviruses made world headlines with the SARS epidemic in 2002â€“2004 and the MERS-CoV emergence in 2012, coronaviruses OC43 (group 1) and 229E (group 2) have been known for decades to cause upper respiratory tract infections during the fall and winter months. Coronavirus NL63 (group 1) has been reported to cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent hosts in the Netherlands, and coronavirus HKU1 (group 2) has been reported to cause pneumonia in Hong Kong and France [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Pancytopenia may be present. Radiographic infiltrates are most commonly interstitial, although 28% are alveolar. Pleural effusions may be present, and pneumothorax has been noted in a minority of patients. Diagnosis may be made by culture in human hepatoma HUH7 cell line, or by RT-PCR [
