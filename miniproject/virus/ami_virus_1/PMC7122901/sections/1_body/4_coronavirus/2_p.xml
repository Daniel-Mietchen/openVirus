Lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, mild elevation of transaminases, prolonged prothrombin time with elevated D-dimers, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK), and hyponatremia were common lab findings [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Pleural effusions and mediastinal lymphadenopathy were generally absent. Histopathologic findings in lung biopsies and at autopsy included diffuse alveolar damage consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with significant alveolar edema, minimal inflammation, and no viral inclusions.
