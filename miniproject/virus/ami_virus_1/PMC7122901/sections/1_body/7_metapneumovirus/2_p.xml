<p id="Par28">Infection has been described following lung and heart–lung transplantation, resulting in acute pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage and hyaline membrane formation [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">92</xref>]. Lung transplant recipients with metapneumovirus pneumonia have a 14% mortality rate and are at higher risk for acute and chronic rejection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. In renal transplant recipients, pneumonitis due to metapneumovirus has been reported 3 years posttransplant [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. In one study of HSCT recipients, human metapneumovirus was isolated via RT-PCR in 26% of symptomatic patients undergoing bronchoscopy and carried a mortality rate of 80% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. Infection occurred within the first few weeks following transplant, and was characterized by fever, nasal congestion, and cough, with rapid development of hypoxia, hypotension, and progressive pneumonia, with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage in three of five patients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. Pleural effusions and nodular infiltrates may be seen, which may help differentiate infection from RSV. Coinfection with RSV, rhinovirus, and CMV has been described following lung transplantation [
