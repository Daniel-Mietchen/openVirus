<p id="Par19"> Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus with four major genotypes with presumed reservoirs in pigs, wild boars, deer, and mollusks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Seroprevalence surveys indicate that infection in blood donors, even in France and the USA, is significant; in some areas, hepatitis E is more prevalent than hepatitis A [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Epidemics of infection have been described from ingestion of contaminated water, mollusks, and undercooked deer, boar, or pig meat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Blood transfusion-transmitted infection has also been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>]. After an incubation period of two to nine weeks, patients develop jaundice, abdominal pain, anorexia, and nausea. Fever and chills may occur as well, although rash is unusual. Diagnosis can be made by RT-PCR detection of HEV RNA, which is present between 2 and 6 weeks after infection, as symptoms occur [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>]. IgM antibodies develop as symptoms resolve, approximately 4 weeks after infection. Elevated transaminases occur, peaking approximately 6 weeks after infection. While viremia resolves within 6 weeks of infection, virus remains detectable in stool for several weeks after viremia resolves and IgG appears. Serum IgG antibodies persist for years after acute infection.
