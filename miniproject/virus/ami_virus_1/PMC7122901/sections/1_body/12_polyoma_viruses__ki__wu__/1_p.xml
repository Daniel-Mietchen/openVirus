<p id="Par42">Human polyoma viruses such as BK virus and JC virus are well known pathogens in transplantation and are discussed elsewhere. In recent years three additional polyoma viruses have been described as potential pathogens in immunocompromised hosts. Like BK and JC, these viruses frequently cause asymptomatic primary infection in healthy patients and are capable of establishing latent infection which can be reactivated in the setting of immune suppression. KI and WU viruses (named for the institutions in which they were discovered, Karolinska Institutet and Washington University) have been isolated in children with acute respiratory symptoms including wheezing as well as in the setting of pneumonia [
