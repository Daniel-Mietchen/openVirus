<p id="Par43">KI and WU polyomaviruses have been isolated in nasopharyngeal, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage specimens in hematopoietic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">174</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR175">175</xref>]. These viruses have also been detected in transbronchial biopsy specimens in lung transplant recipients, who in many cases were asymptomatic. Coinfection with other viral and bacterial pathogens has been reported. RT-PCR results should be interpreted with caution in transplant recipients, in whom severe infection has not been described to date. There are no available data on the role of decreasing immunosuppressive therapy or the use of antiviral agents in the development or treatment of infection with KI and WU polyomaviruses.
