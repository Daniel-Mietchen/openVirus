<p id="Par24"> LCMV is a rodent-borne Old World arenavirus that causes asymptomatic or mild, self-limited illness in the immunocompetent host. Rodents, especially common house mice, laboratory mice, and hamsters, often acquire infection congenitally, resulting in lifelong, asymptomatic excretion of virus in urine, saliva, and feces [

Symptoms described in immunocompetent humans include fever, headache, and myalgias, with CSF findings consistent with aseptic meningitis (e.g., lymphocytic pleocytosis). In the normal host, infection is self-limited and carries a mortality rate of less than 1% [
