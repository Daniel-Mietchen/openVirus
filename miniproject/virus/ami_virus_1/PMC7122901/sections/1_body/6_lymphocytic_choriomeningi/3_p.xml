<p id="Par25">In the transplant clusters, infection with LCMV has been fatal in more than 80% of cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. Patients have presented within the first month posttransplant with fever, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and dyspnea. Rash, headache, lethargy, hypotension, and the presence of pulmonary infiltrates are variable. Thrombocytopenia and anemia have been present, with variable peripheral leukocyte and lymphocyte counts. Acute hepatitis with elevated transaminases has been noted, as well as coagulopathy with prolonged protimes. Patients have developed rapidly progressive multisystem failure with encephalopathy prior to death. In one cluster, while the donor had no evidence of infection in multiple tissues tested, a pet hamster present in the donorâ€™s home for several weeks prior to donation was found to have LCMV in multiple tissues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Virus isolated from the hamster was identical to that isolated from the infected transplant recipients. The survivor in that cluster, a kidney recipient, was treated with discontinuation of all immune suppression except corticosteroids and with intravenous ribavirin. Similar approaches have been used in more recent cases [
