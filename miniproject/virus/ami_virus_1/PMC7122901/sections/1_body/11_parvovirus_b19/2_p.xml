<p id="Par39">In transplant recipients, anemia is the most common presentation of infection. Fever occurs in 25% of patients and arthralgia or rash occurs in less than 10% of those affected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. Pancytopenia may be present. Other manifestations described in the transplant population include hepatitis, myocarditis, pneumonitis, encephalitis, meningitis, peripheral neuritis, and collapsing glomerulopathy [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. Those with CNS infection may develop sequelae including seizures, cognitive deficits, stroke, and muscle wasting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. Donor-transmitted infection has been described, presenting with allograft dysfunction, fever, arthralgia, and pancytopenia, often without a rash [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. Chronic or recurrent anemia may be seen posttransplant, as well as pure red cell aplasia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">166</xref>]. Parvovirus B19 infection has also been associated with the subsequent development of thrombotic microangiopathy in kidney transplant recipients, including a cluster of cases in Iran; hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis has also been described in this population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>]. The significance of the frequent finding of parvovirus DNA in renal allografts pre- and posttransplant is under investigation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. In other transplant populations, parvovirus may be associated with chronic cellular allograft rejection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>].
