<p id="Par2">Viral infections are common following solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as detailed in other chapters. While cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most prominent virus in transplantation, and the clinical manifestations and complications of infection with other herpesviruses (e.g., herpes simplex virus, Epsteinâ€“Barr virus, and human herpesviruses 6 and 8) are well described, improvements in diagnostic techniques have led to the recognition of a number of additional viruses with potential pathogenicity in the immunocompromised host. Outbreaks of emerging viruses, the resurgence of vaccine-preventable viral infections, and the identification of viruses which cause self-limited infection in immunocompetent children but significant disease in transplant recipients have highlighted the breadth of pathogens in this patient population. Some of these emerging and unusual viral pathogens are discussed in alphabetical order below.</p>
