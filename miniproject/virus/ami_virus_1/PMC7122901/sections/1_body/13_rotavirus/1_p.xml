<p id="Par45"> Rotavirus, the most common cause of enteritis worldwide and a common pathogen in healthy children under the age of 3, has become increasingly recognized as a pathogen in pediatric and adult recipients of solid organ transplants [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. Epidemics have occurred through fecalâ€“oral transmission, primarily in the winter and spring. Affected patients present with watery diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and, in some cases, gastrointestinal bleeding from colonic ulcers. Infection may be diagnosed by antigen detection in stool specimens using ELISA, latex agglutination, or quantitative PCR. Infection is generally self-limited with weaning immunosuppression during the acute phase of illness. There are no published data on antiviral activity against rotavirus; treatment remains symptomatic.
