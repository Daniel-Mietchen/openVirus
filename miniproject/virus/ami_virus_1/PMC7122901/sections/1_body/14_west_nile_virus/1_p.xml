<p id="Par49"> West Nile virus (WNV) was initially isolated from a febrile patient in the West Nile Province in Uganda in the 1930s and has been enzootic in Africa, Asia, the Middle East, and parts of the Mediterranean and Europe, causing asymptomatic disease or a self-limited febrile flu-like illness [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. Birds are the primary reservoir of infection. Mosquitoes acquire lifelong infection after biting viremic birds, spreading infection from their salivary glands to other species, including humans, with a subsequent bite. In human infection, the incubation period is 2â€“14 days [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. One in 150 symptomatic patients develops meningitis and/or encephalitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. Meningitis presents with photophobia, phonophobia, meningismus, and hyperreflexia; CSF analysis reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis (&lt;500 leukocytes/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, glucose usually normal). Patients with encephalitis develop altered mental status, cranial nerve palsies, seizures, and movement disorders. A minority of patients develop rapid asymmetric weakness that may progress to flaccid paralysis mimicking poliomyelitis, associated with hyporeflexia or areflexia [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>]. Acute neuromuscular respiratory failure may develop, which carries a mortality rate of more than 50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. Hemorrhagic fever characteristic of other flaviviruses has also been described [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>]. The presence of severe weakness and hyporeflexia in a patient with meningoencephalitis should raise the suspicion of WNV infection. MRI may demonstrate meningeal or periventricular enhancement, sometimes mimicking ischemic changes [
