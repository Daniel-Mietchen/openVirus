<p id="Par52"> Diagnosisof WNV infection in immunocompetent hosts may be made serologically or via RT-PCR. An IgM antibody capture assay is available and becomes positive in CSF 3â€“5 days after onset of symptoms in nonimmunosuppressed hosts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>], before serum antibody develops; CSF IgG appears approximately 5 days later. Antibody presence may be confirmed with viral neutralization studies. IgM antibodies may persist in serum for up to 12 months after infection resolution, and IgG may persist for years. As in the hematopoietic stem cell recipients noted above, immunocompromised patients demonstrate delayed seroconversion, making diagnosis of acute infection difficult at times. Nucleic acid testing in plasma and/or CSF is the most useful diagnostic test in this setting [
