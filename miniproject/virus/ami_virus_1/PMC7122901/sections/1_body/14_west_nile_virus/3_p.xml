<p id="Par51">Several cases of WNVinfection have been reported in HSCT recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>]. Infection occurred 3–5 months posttransplant in the most well-described cases, after engraftment but while on calcineurin inhibitor-based prophylaxis or treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease. Fever, lethargy, progressive bilateral extremity weakness, and hyporeflexia or areflexia were present. CSF contained 0–6 white blood cells/μL; IgG and IgM were negative in CSF and blood in most cases. Diagnosis of WNV infection was made by PCR performed on serum and CSF. All of the described patients died.
