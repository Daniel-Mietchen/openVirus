<p id="Par3"> Astrovirus is a common cause of viral gastroenteritis throughout the world and has been a cause of outbreaks of diarrheal disease in schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and military bases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Several recent reports have highlighted the impact of this RNA virus on immunocompromised hosts. In addition to its role in gastroenteritis in these patients, one astrovirus subgroup (VA1/HMO-C) has been reported to cause encephalitis in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients and children with X-linked agammaglobulinemia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Molecular techniques including reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RNA sequencing, and next-generation sequencing have demonstrated the presence of this subgroup in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain tissue of infected patients. Immunohistochemical staining on biopsy tissue has confirmed the presence of invasive infection. There are no known antiviral treatments available, and central nervous system (CNS) infection has been fatal in the cases reported to date. Additional study is needed to determine the prevalence of astrovirus infection in transplanted patients.
