<p id="Par55">Viruses remain the most significant and elusive pathogens infecting patients following solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The days of “it’s just a virus” are clearly behind us, as immunosuppression has changed, posttransplant longevity is increasing, and molecular diagnostic methods have dramatically improved [

Serology may be of limited value in immunocompromised hosts in the diagnosis of acute infection as well as in detecting reactivation of latent infections. Multiplex, quantitative real-time PCR assays are now available to detect multiple viruses, including panels of PCRs for detection of respiratory viruses and CNS pathogens [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR217">217</xref>]. These sensitive techniques are being evaluated carefully in transplant populations for their specificity and for their potential utility as markers of early infection with surveillance monitoring. The impact of community-acquired respiratory viral infections on the development of acute rejection and bronchiolitis obliterans in lung transplantation appears to be significant and warrants further study [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. Continued vigilance in detecting emerging viral infections and continued study of potential antiviral therapies in the transplant population will likely improve patient survival.
