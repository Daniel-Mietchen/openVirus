<p id="Par6">After an incubation period of 2–4 days, infection presents with high fever, headache, myalgias, and arthralgias, and can resemble dengue. Arthralgias are typically symmetric and involve large joints, particularly in the legs and arms. Frank arthritis may also occur in the interphalangeal joints, wrists, and ankles. Half of patients also develop a rash, which can be maculopapular, petechial, or bullous and is most commonly located on the trunk, with occasional involvement of the face, extremities, palms, and soles. Ocular pain has also been reported. Rarely, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, or hepatitis can occur. Symptoms resolve in 7–10 days, although arthralgias and joint stiffness may persist for weeks to months after fever resolves. Severe manifestations of infection with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with underlying diabetes, lung disease, or chronic neurologic conditions.</p>
