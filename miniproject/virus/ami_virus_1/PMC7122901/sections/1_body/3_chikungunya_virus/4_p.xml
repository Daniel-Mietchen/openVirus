<p id="Par8">During a widespread outbreak of infection on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, organ and tissue donors were screened for the presence of chikungunya infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Corneal donors were found to have serologic and PCR evidence of infection in serum and corneal tissue. Transmission of infection with corneal transplantation is presumed to occur. There have been no reports of transmission of chikungunya in solid organ or stem cell transplantation to date although with reports of infection in Asia, Europe, and North America in travelers from endemic areas, the risk of transmission and the clinical course of infection in these patients require further study.
