<p id="Par4"> Bocavirus is a human parvovirus that causes upper and lower respiratory tract infection, gastroenteritis, and encephalitis in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Infection is most common in the late fall and winter, and most commonly presents with rhinorrhea, fever, cough, wheezing, or diarrhea. Thirty percent of children develop hypoxia, and a variety of radiographic findings have been reported, including peribronchial cuffing, lobar infiltrates, and pleural effusions. Nosocomial infection has occurred [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Bocavirus infection has been reported in the first few weeks following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, presenting with fever, rhinorrhea, cough, diarrhea, and hypoxia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Virus has been detected in high quantities in plasma, nasopharyngeal aspirates, and stool. Fecal shedding occurs for several weeks to months after clinical resolution of infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Severe and prolonged diarrhea has been described in liver transplant and hematopoietic stem cell recipients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It has been suggested that bocavirus, like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza, may play a role in the development of bronchiolitis obliterans, a manifestation of chronic rejection in lung transplantation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To date, there are no data on antiviral efficacy against bocavirus.
