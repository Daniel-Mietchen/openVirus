<p id="Par36">Norovirus infection in solid organ transplant recipients is common, and marked by risk for chronic and relapsing infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">150</xref>]. Infection presents with watery diarrhea, which can cause volume depletion and acute renal failure in renal transplant recipients [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR151">151</xref>]. Patients may be symptomatic for months and may shed virus in stool for years. Hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients have been reported to develop acute and chronic diarrheal disease from norovirus infection, which has been associated with the subsequent development of chronic GVHD [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR152">152</xref>]. Receipt of cord blood, induction with fludarabine, and receipt of alemtuzumab have been reported to be risk factors for norovirus infection in this setting. Nosocomial outbreaks of infection in HSCT units have resulted in infection of staff and patients, with sepsis from bacterial translocation complicating several cases [
