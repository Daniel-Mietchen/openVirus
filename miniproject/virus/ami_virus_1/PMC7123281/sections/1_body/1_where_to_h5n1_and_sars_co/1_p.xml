<p>While H5N1 and SARS are both respiratory tract infections transmitted by air, their transmissions and infections are different. H5N1 belongs to a group of avian influenzas, which can typically emerge in either low- or high-pathogenic forms.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> H5N1 is designated as highly infectious. SARS is a coronavirus. Coronaviruses in general cause “mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illnesses.”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> SARS, however, is not typical. It, also, is highly infectious. Neither, as of yet, is particularly effective in transmitting itself from person to person.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> Tuberculosis, by contrast, is. If and when either does become so efficient and effective, a global pandemic is almost certain. Here it is worth noting that risk—of eventual human-to-human transmission, or an airborne mutation—is not the same thing as the existent threat of the same as is.
