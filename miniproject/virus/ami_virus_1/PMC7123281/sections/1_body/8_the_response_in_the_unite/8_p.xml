The largest concentrations of chickens in the United States—Georgia, which raises 1.3 billion broilers a year, and the Delmarva Peninsula, where the broiler business began in the 1920s—lie under another migration route that ducks take over the Americas. If the flu were to land in those areas and spread the way it did in the Midwest, much of the US poultry industry would be in jeopardy: almost nine billion birds, 90 billion eggs, more than US$40 billion in earnings, 1.3 million jobs. As Roth notes, “there was almost no federal money invested in biosecurity for livestock. Basically, it is the responsibility of the producer.”
