<p>The National Strategy for Pandemic Influenza Implementation Plan worked as intended when avian flu arrived in the US in December 2014. The virus was detected as it jumped the Canadian border from small farms in British Columbia and landed in wild birds in Washington State before spreading through poultry farms on the west coast. Avian flu usually comes from wild birds—mostly ducks, geese and shorebirds—which shed the virus in their bodily waste and secretions as they migrate. To watch for its arrival, federal and state agencies collaborate on surveillance systems, taking samples of lakes where birds roost, wild birds as they are banded (ringed) and wild turkeys and ducks shot by hunters. But those systems cannot test more than a tiny proportion of the millions of birds that cross the United States every season. The first signal of the flu’s arrival can be when domesticated birds die.</p>
