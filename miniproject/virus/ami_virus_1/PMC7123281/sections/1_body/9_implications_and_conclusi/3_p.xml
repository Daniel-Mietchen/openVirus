<p>SARS is detected by a combination of symptom-identification and laboratory test.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn70">70</xref> As in the cases of H5N1, described above, or H1N1 (also called “swine flu,” and currently circulating in Germany, particularly in the eastern provinces),
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn71">71</xref> identifying the symptoms hardly pinpoints the exact cause of disease. The symptoms of many upper- and lower-respiratory tract illnesses are similar. This makes laboratory tests vital. Such tests are complex and expensive, take time, and are not always available at the local or community level. Indeed, the WHO recommends that states identify national laboratories designated to perform such tests: such laboratories are meant to exist in every country. In reality, many lack such facilities. Hence it is all the more important that the local and national levels of response be linked to the international level. This is especially true when and where epidemics or pandemics have the potential to emerge. H5N1, and SARS, present just such a threat. Yet clusters identified by GOARN (see also above), or in Germany, through the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) can flag emerging outbreaks and prompt informative, proactive, and failing, that, reactive, responses.
