<p>As noted in the above, identification of the infectious agent is the first step in any response. Within the EU, the 2003 Avian Influenza Initiative,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn57">57</xref> which follows the H5N1 outbreak, but pre-dates that of SARS, orders surveillance. Under it, EU member states must carry out surveillance programs for avian influenza to detect and identify both low- and high-pathogenic avian influenzas in poultry and wild birds. Furthermore, the states are required to determine whether any of the low-pathogenic variants have the potential to mutate into high-pathogenic versions.
