<p>The EU directives are legally binding. They regulate the identification, in designated laboratories, of avian influenza. They order the reporting of the contamination, and the eradication of infected animals; they regulate the disposal and disinfection of both the carcasses and the affected land; finally, they stipulate the measures necessary for affected agricultural production to be allowed to resume. Assuming all of the rules are followed, these directives represent a state-of-the-art, best practice response to an avian influenza outbreak. The policy trajectory also affirms the national nature of the primary response, even within the EU.</p>
