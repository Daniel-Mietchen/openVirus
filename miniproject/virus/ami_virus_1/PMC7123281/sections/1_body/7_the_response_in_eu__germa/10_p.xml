<p>Her act followed the actions of a Dutch laboratory to which Indonesiaâ€™s H5N1 samples had been sent for viral confirmation. The laboratory, instead of merely sequencing the virus and making it available to the WHO and partner organizations to develop an anti-viral agent, such as for use in a vaccine, patented the viral sequence in anticipation of selling it towards vaccine or treatment development. The treatment or vaccine would then presumably be sold back to Indonesia at a high price. The Indonesian Government viewed the transaction as giving away its DNA in return for having to purchase its (product) back. In invoking viral sovereignty, the minister cited the fact that Indonesia was unlikely to benefit from any treatments or vaccines created from H5N1 or other samples, since the country did not have its own testing laboratories or the capacity to develop and then sell resulting medical treatments. So instead, it opted to keep control over its viral strain.</p>
