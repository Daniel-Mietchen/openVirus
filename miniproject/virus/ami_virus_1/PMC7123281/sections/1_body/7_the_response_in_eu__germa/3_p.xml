<p>Surveillance is the first step. The second response step obliges member states to report their results to the European Commission (EC). Unlike the IHRs, or the WHO recommendations, Council Directive 2005/94/EC
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn58">58</xref> renders both surveillance and reporting within the EU compulsory. In its wake, the EC proposed, passed, and published additional directives. Listed and described in the timeline above, they include: decisions 2006/415/EU; 2007/118/EC; 2007/598/EC; and 2010/367/EC. Within the frame of the policy cycle outlined in the introduction, these directives and their publication represent the policy decision-making and dissemination steps.
