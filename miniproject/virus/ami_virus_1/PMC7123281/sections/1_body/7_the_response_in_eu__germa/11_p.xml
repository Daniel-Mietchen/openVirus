<p>The notion of viral sovereignty conjures up centuries of sovereign prerogative. On the one hand, it resurrects the walls within which a sovereign state is meant to protect and provide for the human—and health—security of its populace. Doing so, however, endangers those beyond the wall who come into contact with an infectious agent that cannot be contained. As such, the episode illustrates two key points—also made in this book. First, that states remain responsible for the health of their populations, regardless of their ability to do so. Second, that global health coordination, if there is to be such a thing, is reliant on those same states. In order for such coordination to have a modicum of success, the informational exchange and the coordination of interventions must be bidirectional. Viral sovereignty has an important lesson to teach.</p>
