<p>Indonesia’s maiden foray into “viral sovereignty” would be followed by China in the SARS outbreak. Since then, and with the arrival of the revised IHRs, the topic has largely been abandoned in the public arena. Yet the sentiments expressed have returned—as seen in the case of Ebola, and as anticipated with regard to other infectious agents as well. On the one hand the cordoning off of viral material in the name of viral sovereignty represents a real threat to epidemic /pandemic preparedness. It does so by denying science access to study the infectious agent and thereby to develop appropriate vaccines or treatments. On the other hand the justice claim of the idea of viral sovereignty raises an equally resonant issue. It invokes for an entire (national) population the individual human rights’ claims put forward in the HIV and AIDS treatment access dispute. This is surely not the last of this resonant argument.</p>
