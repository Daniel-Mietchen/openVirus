While demanding especially prompt reporting—within 24 hours—compliance with the new IHRs, these included, as a reward, leniency on sanctions such as travel advisories and travel warnings. As the latter send signals that can influence the continuation or the cessation of tourism and investment, they can be a powerful tool in prompting compliance. Otherwise, however, the IHRs lack real enforcement mechanisms beyond “naming and shaming,” as per China and its initial response to SARS.
