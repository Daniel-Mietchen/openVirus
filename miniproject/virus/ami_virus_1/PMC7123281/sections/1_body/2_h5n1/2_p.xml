<p>As human-to-human transmission of H5N1 is not (yet) very efficient. Nonetheless, it is the human and climate-change-induced shifts in the migratory patterns and paths of wild fowl that are affecting the spread of H5N1, among other illnesses. These birds are expanding both the breadth of their nesting and the amount of time they spend in/over any particular place. Doing so, they increase the possibility of fowl-to-fowl transmission and mutation of H5N1, and of fowl-to-human transmission.
