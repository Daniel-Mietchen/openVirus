<p>HPAI (highly pathogenic avian influenza) H5N1 is transmitted from infected poultry to humans. Once wild poultry (particularly migratory geese) are infected, it is only a matter of time before humans are exposed and then infected by H5N1, as well. The increase in the number of intensively-raised poultry, in response to rising incomes across much of Asia, most especially China, in response to demand for meat, exacerbates this risk. Most exposure and infection occurs through the inhalation of viral particles in feces. Ingesting cooked fowl is not a cause of infection.</p>
