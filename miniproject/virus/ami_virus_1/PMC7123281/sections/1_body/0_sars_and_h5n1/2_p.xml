<p>H5N1, Highly Pathogenic Asian Avian Influenza A, and SARS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> represent two further emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Like HIV and Ebola, H5N1
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> and SARS are zoonoses. As their nomenclatures indicate, both are serious. Both are airborne, making them potentially more dangerous than either HIV and AIDS or Ebola Virus Disease (EVD, see above). Yet arguably because neither is especially efficient in its human-to-human transmission, clusters of cases of each are often referred to as outbreaks as opposed to epidemics or pandemics. However, these clusters do appear within countries, causing epidemics; each epidemic of infectious disease then has the ability to spread globally to become a pandemic. Both H5N1 and SARS emerged in localized outbreaks and quickly spread to become epidemics and pandemics. The emerging pattern is increasingly familiar.
