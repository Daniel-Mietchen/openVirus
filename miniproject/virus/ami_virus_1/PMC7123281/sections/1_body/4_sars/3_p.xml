<p>The first human SARS case was “a male, traveling on business, who arrived in Foshan, Guangdong Province, China, on November 16, 2002, exhibiting symptoms of atypical pneumonia.”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn36">36</xref> Following that index case, “four of the hospital staff that cared for that man later began to display similar symptoms, leading some to suspect that they had contracted the same illness.”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn37">37</xref> By the end of the SARS outbreak of 2003, which was declared “contained” on 5 July 2003,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn38">38</xref> the virus had spread to Asia, Europe and North America. The virus had infected ca. 8,000 people, mostly previously healthy individuals between the ages of 25 and 70.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn39">39</xref> Though not a reason to celebrate, it is worth noting that SARS’s fatality rate is far lower than that of H5N1: only 3 percent of those infected died. Yet the fact that SARS is transmissible between humans—efficiently or not (yet)—is a significant cause for concern.
