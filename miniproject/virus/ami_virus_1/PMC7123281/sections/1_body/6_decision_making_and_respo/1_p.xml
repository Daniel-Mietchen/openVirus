<p>Containing any outbreak of an airborne infectious disease involves implementing measures to limit face-to-face contact with the virus. This means that hospital staff and community members should wear surgical masks and take special precautions to maintain hand hygiene. It also means that they need to take particular precautions when removing gear (mask and gloves and medical equipment). Furthermore, effective containment of any viral outbreak includes the treatment of patients in isolation (wards), and (home) quarantine.
