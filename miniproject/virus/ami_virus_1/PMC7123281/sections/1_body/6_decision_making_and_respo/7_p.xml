<p>While the WHO is busy issuing recommendations and alerts, or, in the case of epidemics /pandemics, declaring a PHEIC, as well as travel advisories or warnings, national states have much more to do. The onus of response remains at the national level, and for H5N1 and SARS, national responses varied considerably. This had much to do with the shifting international expectations of how a state should respond to a health threat arising in its territory that had the potential to become an international pandemic.</p>
