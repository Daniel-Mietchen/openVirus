<p>H5N1 and, notably, SARS emerged at the same time as updated International Health Regulations (IHRs)
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn53">53</xref> were being discussed, but had not yet been adopted. The revised IHRs came into force—with binding but largely unenforceable legal obligations— on June 15, 2007. (The “original IHRs,” the International Sanitary Regulations (ISRs), were adopted in 1951 (superseded by IHRs in 1969).) The original ISRs listed particular diseases which were to be reported, and against which specific measures, notably quarantine, were to be implemented. These were: cholera, plague and yellow fever.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn54">54</xref> However, since there is now a vaccine against yellow fever, and, as this book as shown, new diseases are continually emerging, the list of specific diseases has been abandoned. The aim of the IHRs is to “prevent, protect against, control and provide a public heath response to the international spread of disease,” without unduly interfering with international movement, such as maritime and flight traffic, and trade.
