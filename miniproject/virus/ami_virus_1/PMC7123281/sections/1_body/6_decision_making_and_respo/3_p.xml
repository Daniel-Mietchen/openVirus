<p>The WHO recommends, as it cannot require, nor can it enforce its recommendations, that states nominate national laboratories designated to perform tests which can isolate and identify the infectious agent in question. These tests use virus- and antibody-rich serum obtained from suspected patients to confirm, via PCR,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn49">49</xref> ELISA,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn50">50</xref> or IFA
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn51">51</xref> tests, or through virus isolation, the presence of the virus. Such tests are complex and expensive, take time, and are not always available at the local or community level. Resourced laboratories are meant to exist in every country. In reality, many states lack such facilities.
