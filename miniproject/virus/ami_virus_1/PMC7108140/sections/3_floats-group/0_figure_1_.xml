  <p>Temporal changes in environmental and ecological parameters at sampling sites from October 2016 to June 2018. Air sampling was conducted weekly except during the summer holiday in 2017 (weeks 19â€“35). The recorded mean (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide [CO
   <sub>2</sub>] concentration) or absolute (numbers of occupants on site) values at different sampling sites are shown in dots of different colors. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing regression fitted 95% confidence interval ranges are shown in gray. Temporal changes in indoor temperature (
   <italic>A</italic>), indoor relative humidity (
   <italic>B</italic>), indoor absolute humidity (
   <italic>C</italic>), numbers of occupants on site (
   <italic>D</italic>), and ventilation rate (
   <italic>E</italic>), are shown. Abbreviation: UHS, University Health Service.
