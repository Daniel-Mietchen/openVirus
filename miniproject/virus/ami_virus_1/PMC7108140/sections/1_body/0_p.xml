<p>Respiratory viruses are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. A substantial global disease burden is attributed to influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which cause lower respiratory infections and cardiopulmonary complications [
 <xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1–4</xref>]. While most infections are associated with acute respiratory illnesses, respiratory viruses can also infect without causing symptoms [
 <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5–7</xref>], although the infectivity of asymptomatic cases is uncertain. A common feature of respiratory viruses is their ability to spread via multiple non–mutually exclusive modes, by direct contact or indirectly via large droplets, fine droplet nuclei, or fomites [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>]. The predominant transmission mode may vary between viruses and be influenced by environmental conditions; however, such information remains a major knowledge gap [
 <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8–11</xref>]. Airborne transmission via fine droplet nuclei is less confined by the spatiotemporal restriction posed by gravity and has been the most challenging transmission mode for infection control considerations [
