<p>Our study is limited by the specific demographic features of the study population and their behavior, which may limit the extrapolation of the results to other public locations. A small volume of 105 L of air sampled in 30 minutes may have limited our ability to detect respiratory viruses more frequently. Our data argue for the need to extend such investigations to other venues where humans congregate, such as transport systems. Studies would also be strengthened if respiratory samples of individuals at the sampling locations can be collected to link with detections of viral RNA in air. Characterizing the host immune response and the viruses circulating among mildly or subclinically infected individuals prior to epidemics may provide insights on the emergence of influenza epidemics.</p>
