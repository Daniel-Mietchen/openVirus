<p>The majority of IAV (73.5% [86/117]) or IBV (64.5% [20/31]) virus–laden particles were ≤4 µm, which is comparable to those detected in air sampled at healthcare facilities [
 <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Notably, limited infectious influenza-laden particles were &lt;1 µm. The results support the airborne transmission potential of influenza viruses via particles within respirable fraction. Higher copies of influenza viral genome were detected from airborne particles &gt;4 μm in spring and &lt;1 μm in autumn, with higher indoor temperatures recorded in autumn than spring. Further studies are needed to understand the effect of environmental parameters on airborne particles in indoor environments.
