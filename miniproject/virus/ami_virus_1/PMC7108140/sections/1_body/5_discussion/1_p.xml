<p>Transmission of respiratory viruses may be mediated by symptomatic as well as presymptomatic, mildly infected, or subclinically infected people who are capable of continuing their daily activities. We report temporal detection frequency for common respiratory viruses in air sampled from a university campus in Hong Kong, where 28 000 undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as 7000 staff interact daily. IAVs and IBVs were detected at higher frequencies than other respiratory viruses. A recent study that collected nasopharyngeal swabs of 2685 tourists in New York City reported a higher detection frequency for HRV and HCoV than IAV at 3.2%, 2.4%, and 0.2%, respectively [
