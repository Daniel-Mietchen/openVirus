<p>Influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses that caused epidemics in Hong Kong during the study period were detected in air sampled on campus prior to the peak influenza activity in the community but not afterwards, which may reflect changes in susceptibility of the population to the epidemic strain. However, the detection frequency during the epidemics may be underestimated as no or limited samples were collected during the period, which coincided with the university holidays. A previous study reporting data from bioaerosol sampling at a Barcelona subway also reported a higher detection frequency for influenza-laden aerosols prior to the peak of symptomatic cases in 2013â€“2014 winter [
