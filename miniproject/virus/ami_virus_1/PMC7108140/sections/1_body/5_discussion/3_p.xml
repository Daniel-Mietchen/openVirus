<p>Increased crowdedness was a significant risk factor for detection of influenza airborne particles on campus. Overcrowding plays a critical role in shaping the indoor air microbiome [
 <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and has been speculated to contribute to influenza outbreaks [
 <xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Increased indoor temperature and indoor CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration were significant risk factors that may also be affected by crowdedness. Although humidity may modulate influenza virus survival and affect transmission [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], the competing models showed a null effect for indoor or outdoor AH in the detection of influenza airborne particles. Collectively, the identified risk factors may provide insights for improving environmental interventions to reduce the airborne transmission risk of influenza.
