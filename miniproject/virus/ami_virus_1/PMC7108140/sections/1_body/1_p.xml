<p>Previous studies have reported detection of influenza and other respiratory virus–laden particles in the exhaled breath of symptomatic patients [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12–15</xref>] or in air sampled at healthcare facilities [
 <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16–19</xref>]. It is currently unknown if people with mild or subclinical respiratory infections, who are capable to continue their daily activities in the community without substantial impediment, may also release virus-laden particles with airborne transmission potential. A recent study reported molecular detection of respiratory viruses in nasal swabs among 6.2% of adult tourists in New York City, of which &gt;65% of positive cases were asymptomatic [
 <xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Public locations where infected and susceptible hosts converge may serve as hotspots within a transmission network during epidemics. However, the temporal detection frequency of common respiratory viruses at public locations has not been systematically assessed and correlated with surveillance data obtained by conventional methods.
