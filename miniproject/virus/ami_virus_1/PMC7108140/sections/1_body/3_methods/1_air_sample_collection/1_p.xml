<p>Air was sampled weekly from a university campus in Hong Kong from October 2016 to June 2018 except during the summer holidays in 2017 (weeks 19–35) and on public holidays. Samples were collected from canteens, lecture halls, shuttle buses, and the University Health Service (UHS) during peak hours of human flow, using 6–13 air samplers per week. Air was sampled for 30 minutes using the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) bioaerosol sampler (BC251) that separates particles into &gt;4 μm, 1–4 μm, and &lt;1 μm size fractions [
