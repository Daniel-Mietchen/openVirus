<p>Sampled airborne particles were resuspended with 1 mL of minimal essential medium containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) [

Respiratory viruses were detected using quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-qPCR) by the ViiA 7 Real-time PCR System (ThermoFisher) using 5 μL eluent, AgPath-IDTM One-step RT-PCR Reagents (Life Technology), and specific primers and probes (

Quantification of influenza viruses was based on standard curves constructed using 10-fold serial-diluted plasmids; the minimum linear range of quantification (LoQ) was 2 genome copies per reaction (8163 copies/m
