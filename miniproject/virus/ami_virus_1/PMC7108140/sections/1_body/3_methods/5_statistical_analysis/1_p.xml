<p>Statistical analyses and graphic production were performed using Microsoft Excel and R version 3.3.1 software programs. Absolute humidity (AH; kg/m
 <sup>3</sup>), as a better predictor than RH for influenza infectivity [

 <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Fisher exact and Ï‡
 <sup>2</sup> tests were used to determine the difference of categorical data, and Kruskal-Wallis test was used for numeric data. Factors associated with detection of influenza airborne particles were analyzed by logistic regression. Numbers of occupants on site, ventilation rate, and indoor CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration were categorized as high (upper 33%), intermediate (middle 33%), and low (lower 33%) based on the numeric data distribution (
