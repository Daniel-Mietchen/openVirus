<p>To test if rRT-qPCR–positive samples contain infectious viruses, 250 μL of resuspended airborne particles was inoculated on Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK; influenza-positive samples), human epithelial (Hep)-2 cells (RSV-positive samples), or human lung fibroblasts Medical Research Council cell strain 5 cells (MRC-5; HRV/HCoV-positive samples) in 24-well plates. Air samples were incubated with (
 <italic>i</italic>) MDCK/Hep-2/MRC-5 cells with media, and (
 <italic>ii</italic>) with media only. After 48 hours, 250 μL of the supernatant from (
 <italic>i</italic>) and (
 <italic>ii</italic>) was blindly transferred and incubated with and without fresh cells, respectively, for another 48 hours. Subsequently, viral copy numbers were determined using rRT-qPCR. A sample was considered infectious if a higher viral genome copy was detected after 2 blind passages in cells when compared to the control wells without cells.
