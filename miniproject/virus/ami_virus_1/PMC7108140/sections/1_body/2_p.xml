<p>To evaluate the airborne transmission potential of respiratory viruses at public locations, we performed weekly surveillance from October 2016 to June 2018 to determine the quantity and airborne particle size distribution of influenza A viruses (IAVs), influenza B viruses (IBVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), RSV, and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E and OC43 in ambient air sampled from a university campus in Hong Kong. Parameters including relative humidity (RH), temperature, crowdedness, and ventilation that may be associated with detection of airborne virus particles were recorded and analyzed by logistic regression. We compared the temporal relationship between the detection of influenza airborne particles at the university campus and the detection of symptomatic influenza infections in the community under conventional surveillance.</p>
