<p>Among samples positive for IAV by rRT-qPCR, increased IAV RNA copies were detected in 5.1% (6/117) samples after 2 serial passages in MDCK cells (mean ∆Ct = 1.8 [standard deviation, 1.2]). Among samples positive for IBV by rRT-qPCR, increased IBV RNA copies were detected in 3.2% (1/31) samples after 2 passages (∆Ct = 1.5;
