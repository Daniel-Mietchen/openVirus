<p>The detection frequencies of IAV vRNA from &gt;4 μm, 1–4 μm, and &lt;1 μm size fractions were 6.8% (47/694), 5.8% (40/694), and 7.5% (52/694), respectively (χ
 <sup>2</sup> test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .432). The detection frequencies of IBV were also comparable among &gt;4 μm, 1–4 μm, and &lt;1 μm size fractions at 1.9% (13/694), 1.7% (12/694), and 1.2% (8/694), respectively (χ
 <sup>2</sup> test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .524). Higher copies of influenza viral genome were detected from airborne particles &gt;4 μm in the spring weeks (weeks 7–18) and &lt;1 μm in the autumn weeks (weeks 36–45) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, 62.5% (10/16) of quantifiable samples detected in spring were from particles &gt;4 μm, whereas 70.0% (7/10) of quantifiable samples detected in autumn were from particles &lt;1 μm (Fisher exact test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .039). The RH levels were comparable in spring and autumn (Kruskal-Wallis test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .645), whereas indoor temperature and AH were significantly higher in autumn than in spring (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). There was no difference in crowdedness (
 <italic>P</italic> = .091) or CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration (
 <italic>P</italic> = .070) between spring and autumn.
