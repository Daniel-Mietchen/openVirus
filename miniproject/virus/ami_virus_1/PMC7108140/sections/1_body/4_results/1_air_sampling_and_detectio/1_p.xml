<p>A total of 334 sampling events were conducted at canteens (n = 135), lecture halls (n = 61), shuttle buses (n = 68), and UHS (n = 70). A total of 1028 air samples were collected by NIOSH samplers; 694 were with functional samplers and 334 with negative control samplers. Environmental factors including indoor temperatures (range, 16.0°C
 <italic>–</italic>31.8°C) and AH (4.2
 <italic>–</italic>22.9 g/m
 <sup>3</sup>) were influenced by outdoor temperatures and followed seasonal changes (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Relative humidity varied across sampling months and locations (27.1%–98.3%; 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1C</xref>). The numbers of occupants on site, indoor CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, and the derived ventilation rate varied significantly across different sampling locations (Kruskal-Wallis test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). More occupants were recorded at canteens (50
 <italic>–</italic>450) than at UHS (2
 <italic>–</italic>30) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1D</xref>). Higher ventilation was recorded at canteens (4.4
 <italic>–</italic>90.9 L/second/person) than at shuttle buses (1.1
 <italic>–</italic>6.4 L/second/person) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1E</xref>), with the highest CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentrations recorded in shuttle buses (1234
 <italic>–</italic>4837 ppm) and the lowest at UHS (559
 <italic>–</italic>948 ppm) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1F</xref>). The numbers of occupants and ventilation rate on site were highly dependent on the teaching activity and the university academic calendar (χ
 <sup>2</sup> test, 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001).
