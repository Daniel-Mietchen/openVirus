<p>Influenza vRNA was detected from 20.6% (143/694) functional NIOSH samplers. Specifically, IAV, IBV, and both IAV and IBV RNA were detected from 16.9% (117/694), 4.5% (31/694), and 0.7% (5/694) NIOSH samplers, respectively (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The false-positive rate for IAV detection from negative control NIOSH samplers was 3.3% (11/334) (χ

 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .001). The majority of the IAV-positive samples (75.2% [88/117]) were not subtypable because of low viral load, whereas H1, H3, or both H1 and H3 vRNA was detected from 6.8% (8/117), 16.2% (19/117), and 1.7% (2/117) IAV-positive samples, respectively. Low copies of vRNA (below LoQ) were detected from 80.7% (71/88) of the nonsubtypable samples and from 65.5% (19/29) of the H1 or H3 subtypable samples by rRT-qPCR (χ
 <sup>2</sup> test, 
 <italic>P</italic> = .154). Similarly, most IBV-positive samples (80.6% [25/31]) contained low copies of viral genome that were below the LoQ.
