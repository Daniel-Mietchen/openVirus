<p>Detection of HRV, RSV, and HCoV in air was limited. Among 270 NIOSH samplers applied from week 41 of 2016 to week 18 of 2017, vRNA of HRV, RSV, and HCoV was detected in 2.2% (6/270; cycle threshold [Ct] &gt;37.4), 0.4% (1/270; Ct = 39.3), and 0% (0/270). During the same period, IAV, IBV, or both were detected at 20.7% (56/270), 3.0% (8/270), and 1.1% (3/270), respectively. Although the detection frequency for HRV, RSV, and HCoV were significantly lower than that of IAV in air (Ï‡

Detection of multiple respiratory viruses per air sampler was rare, with 0.7% (2/270) samplers testing positive for both IAV and HRV. Taken together, the results suggest that low concentrations of influenza, HRV, and RSV vRNA can be detected from air sampled at the university campus. Influenza vRNA was detected in air at a higher frequency than other respiratory viruses.
