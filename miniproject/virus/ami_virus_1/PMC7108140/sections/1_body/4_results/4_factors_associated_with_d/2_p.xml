<p>The best-fit multivariable logistic regression model (AIC, 687.1) suggested that increased crowdedness and higher indoor temperatures were independent risk factors for the detection of influenza airborne particles on campus (
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref> and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sup1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). AH as a predictor for influenza infectivity [
 <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and seasonal influenza epidemics [
 <xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] was not included in the best-fit multivariable model; therefore, competing models were built to separately examine the effect of indoor AH (AIC, 687.6), outdoor AH (AIC, 688.6), or indoor-outdoor AH difference (AIC, 687.3). However, none of the AH parameters was significantly associated with detection of influenza airborne particles (
