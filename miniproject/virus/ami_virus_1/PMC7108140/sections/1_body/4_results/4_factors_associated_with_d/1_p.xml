<p>Univariate logistic regression was used to examine if environmental parameters (temperature, RH, AH, CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration), ecological factors (holiday vs teaching days, sampling locations, numbers of occupants, ventilation), or influenza activities in the community (weekly laboratory-based influenza surveillance data in Hong Kong from the Centre for Health Protection [CHP]) [
 <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] were associated with the detection of influenza airborne particles at the university campus. Increased risk of detecting influenza airborne particles was associated with sampling on teaching days (vs holiday), greater number of occupants on site (crowdedness), lower ventilation rate, higher indoor CO
 <sub>2</sub> concentration, higher indoor temperature, negative difference in indoor-outdoor temperature, and negative difference in indoor-outdoor AH. Influenza activity by conventional surveillance was negatively associated with detection of influenza airborne particles in the university campus (
