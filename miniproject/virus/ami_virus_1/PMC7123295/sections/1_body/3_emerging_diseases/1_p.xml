<p id="Par32">One of the goals of this chapter is to speculate on the likely burden of disease up to 2050. Obviously, we cannot know what new diseases may emerge. However, we envisage that they will be zoonotic , crossing the species barrier from vertebrate animals to humans, as seen with new strains of influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
