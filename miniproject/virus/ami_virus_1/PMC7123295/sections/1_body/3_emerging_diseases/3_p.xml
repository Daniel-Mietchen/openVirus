<p id="Par36">The key global health response must be to contain outbreaks locally and then regionally. This was well illustrated by the reaction to the 2014 Ebola epidemic. The first stage was to understand the disease: transmission and epidemiology. The second stage was to put in place the public health measures needed to stop transmission. While new diseases will emerge, experience and scientific advances, especially with AIDS and Ebola, mean that we can expect that they will be contained relatively quickly. It is unlikely that new emerging diseases will have a significant impact on African population dynamics although there are serious economic and social consequences. Compared to HIV, new epidemics may be quick to spread, but they can also be quick to control.</p>
