<p id="Par20">Being HIV positive reduces the chance of a woman falling pregnant (by about 30%), carrying the fetus to term, and delivering (Chen and Walker 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2010</xref>). HIV infected women experience higher maternal mortality. Even if a woman is on treatment, she is less likely to conceive, or complete the pregnancy, and still faces a higher (albeit reduced) risk of death. An infected mother can pass HIV to her child during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. Use of anti- retroviral drugs reduces this risk from about 30% to less than 5%. The current advice is that HIV positive pregnant women remain on treatment for the rest of their lives. Infected children fail to thrive and, in the absence of treatment, most die before their fifth birthdays. Even if children are not infected, infant and child mortality rates are slightly higher among those born to infected mothers.
