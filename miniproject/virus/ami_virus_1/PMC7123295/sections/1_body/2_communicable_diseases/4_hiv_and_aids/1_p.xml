<p id="Par16">The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus that destroys the cells of the immune system. As the infection progresses, the immune system becomes weaker and the person is susceptible to opportunistic infections. Incidents of illness increase in frequency, duration, and severity. This can take 10â€“15 years, during which time the person is infected and can transmit HIV. The most advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). If the individual is not put on treatment they will die.</p>
