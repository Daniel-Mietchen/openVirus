<p id="Par17">The first cases were identified in 1981 among gay men in the United States. HIV was isolated and recognized as the cause of AIDS in French laboratories in 1983. The virus originated in non-human primates in Africa and was transferred to humans in the early twentieth century. The HIV-1 strain of the virus was transmitted from chimpanzees in Central Africa, while at around the same time the less virulent HIV-2 strain crossed the species barrier from sooty mangabey monkeys in West Africa. The mode of transmission is unknown. Speculation is that either hunters or people butchering the animals were first infected.</p>
