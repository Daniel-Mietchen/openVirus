<p id="Par28">The WHO estimates that about one-third of the world’s population has latent TB. These people have the TB bacteria, but are not ill, and do not infect others.

Africa has the greatest proportion of new TB cases with 280 falling ill per 100,000 in 2013. In North America, the rate is only 3–4 people per 100,000 annually (WHO
