<p id="Par30">Preventing TB involves inoculation and public health interventions. Currently, the only available vaccine 
 <italic>bacillus Calmette-Gu√©rin</italic> ( BCG) reduces the risk of getting infected by 20% and the risk of infection turning into disease by nearly 60%. It is given to children in much of the resource-poor world, but is no longer routinely used in the rich world. Intense efforts to develop new vaccines are underway. TB is closely linked to poverty, crowding, and lack of properly ventilated accommodation. This means that public health and development interventions are critical.
