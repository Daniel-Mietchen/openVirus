<p id="Par13">The likelihood of transmission depends on factors related to the parasite, the vector (mosquito), the human host, and the environment. Mosquitoes breed in standing water and so transmission patterns are highly dependent on climate, particularly rainfall patterns, temperature, and humidity. The African vector species has shown a particularly long lifespan and higher tendency towards biting humans, a reason why the disease is rampant throughout the continent. People who move into areas with high malarial transmission include migrant workers and refugees ; infants and children are particularly susceptible as their immunity is low.</p>
