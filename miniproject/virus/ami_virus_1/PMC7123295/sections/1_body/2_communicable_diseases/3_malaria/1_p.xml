<p id="Par12">Malaria is vector-borne disease caused by parasites, transmitted to humans through the bites of infected female 
 <italic>anopheles</italic> mosquitoes. The WHO estimates that 3.2 billion people in 96 countries are at risk of malaria infection (1.2 billion are at high risk). In 2013, over 198 million cases of malaria occurred globally, leading to approximately 584,000 deaths. The disease occurs disproportionately in Africa as Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> shows. The continent accounts for 90% of deaths, of which 78% are children under the age of 5 (WHO
