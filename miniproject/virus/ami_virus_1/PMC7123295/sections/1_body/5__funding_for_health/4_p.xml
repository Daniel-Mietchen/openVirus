<p id="Par53">Slow economic growth and the resulting fiscal cutbacks have left many sectors at a loss for funding. In spite of this, however, development assistance for health (DAH) rose from 2012 to 2013 by 3.9%. We predict that DAH will remain steady or decline. There has been a push for countries in the developing world to increase their domestic funding for health. The Abuja Declaration in 2001 was an agreement by the Heads of State of African Union countries to increase government spending for health to at least 15% of their annual budget. However, only three countries have achieved their Abuja Declaration commitments thus far. </p>
