<p id="Par9">Despite these gains, the continent faces serious challenges from infectious diseases. This is put into context in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>, which shows the changing Burden of Disease data globally and for sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), from 1990 to 2013. Globally the main cause of loss of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) is heart disease, which is an NCD. If we were to look at developed countries (not shown), their major burden comes from NCDs, in particular heart disease, stroke, and other lifestyle related illnesses. These are increasing in importance but only sickle cell disease makes it into the top ten ranking in SSA (stroke is number 19 and heart disease number 17 in the 2013 ranking).
