By 2050, around 41% of the world’s births, 40% of under-fives, and 37% of children under 18 will be African (You et al.

The growth of the youthful population threatens to outpace economic development, placing a strain on institutional capacities and the delivery of social services. On the other hand, it means that there is an opportunity for a demographic dividend, as discussed elsewhere in this book. Additionally, and for some time, Africa will not see the same burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), resulting from an aging population, as the rest of the world is facing.
