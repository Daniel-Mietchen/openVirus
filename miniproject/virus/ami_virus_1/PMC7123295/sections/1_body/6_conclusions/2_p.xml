<p id="Par56">This chapter looked at a number of infectious diseases in Africa. Malaria, Tuberculosis, HIV and AIDS, and Ebola all may jeopardize efforts to capture a demographic dividend. High mortality and morbidity decrease the likelihood of a demographic dividend occurring, as dependency ratios worsen. As a result, increased focus must be placed on ways in which the diseases can be effectively combatted and mitigated. This includes finding sustainable funding from both domestic and international sources.</p>
