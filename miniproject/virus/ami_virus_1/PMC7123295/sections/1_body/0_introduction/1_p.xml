<p id="Par2">The great Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder famously wrote 
 <italic>ex Africa semper aliquid novi</italic> [always something new out of Africa]. This quote referred to the variety of wildlife and the seemingly infinite abundance of natural resources which amazed the Romans. However, the quote could be equally applied to the proliferation and spread of infectious diseases. The two most serious epidemics of recent times emerged from African tropical forests, namely AIDS and Ebola. Every region of the world has to deal with the threat and impact of disease, but Africa has been disproportionately impacted.
