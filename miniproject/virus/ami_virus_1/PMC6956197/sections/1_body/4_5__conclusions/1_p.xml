<p>Numerous positive-sense, single-strain RNA viruses have been reported in multiple invasive ant species [

 <xref rid="B33-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] with a wide range of effects on their host ants spanning from the reduction of foraging activity [
 <xref rid="B34-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] and fitness costs [
 <xref rid="B35-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], to colony mortality [

 <xref rid="B37-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], allowing the utilization of these viruses as biocontrol agents to become feasible and promising [
 <xref rid="B38-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. One necessary piece of information to evaluate the biocontrol potential of viruses lies in how these viruses are transmitted between colonies, yet most of the mechanism studies are largely based on a single ant system (i.e., red imported fire ant) and its viruses [
 <xref rid="B39-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. While other factors may have been involved, the current study has demonstrated that aggression levels among colonies may represent one contributor in shaping viral disease transmission in
