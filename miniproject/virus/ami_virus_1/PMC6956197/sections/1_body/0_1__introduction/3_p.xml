<p>Colony organization and interaction network play a critical role in regulating disease transmission dynamics in social insects. A majority of studies, however, focused on an intracolony level, and the potential effects from higher hierarchical levels (e.g., intercolony), are rarely tested (but see [
 <xref rid="B7-insects-10-00436" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). In this study, we hypothesized that viral prevalence is lower (or more variable) in populations of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic> characterized primarily by mutually aggressive colonies than those with colonies displaying none or limited aggression level. If such an association holds, the aggression between colonies is likely correlated with the viral prevalence. We first mapped the viral distribution among the colonies of 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic> in numerous sites on three Asian islands (Okinawa, Japan; Taiwan; Penang, Malaysia) and assayed aggressive interactions between colonies at both within-site and between-site levels. We then examined if a correlation exists between the two variables in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic>. We believe that this is the first study that dissects the interplay between social interactions and viral prevalence in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic>, and offers critical information that would assist in developing an efficient virus-based pest management strategy.
