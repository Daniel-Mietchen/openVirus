<p>To assess the pattern of within-site intercolonial aggression in 
 <italic>A</italic>. 
 <italic>gracilipes</italic>, we randomly selected three colonies from each site and assayed aggression between workers from different colonies within the same site, resulting in 6, 21 and 9 pairwise aggression tests in Okinawa, Taiwan and Penang, respectively (

An individual worker sampled from each of two colonies was placed in a 6 cm diameter petri dish with fluon-coated inner wall surface for 5 min. Each individual was tested only once and discarded. The behavioral interactions between two workers during a 5 min period were observed and scored as follows: 1 for ignoring or touching (antennation); 2 for avoidance; 3 for aggression (lunging, biting, or pulling); 4 for fighting (prolonged aggression) [

For example, the observation was terminated if level 4 had been achieved before the end of the 5 min period. To understand the differences in overall intercolonial aggression levels between the three islands, aggression levels derived from all colony pairs, involving two colonies collected from the same island, were pooled and their significance analyzed using the Kruskalâ€“Wallis rank-sum test, and the pairwise comparison analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test with Bonferroni correction.
