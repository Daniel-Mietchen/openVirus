<p>The sequences were aligned using MUSCLE [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and the substitution model was estimated using bModelTest [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] implemented in BEAST2.5 software [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method implemented in BEAST version 1.8.0 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] using the TN93 model of substitution with 4-category gamma-distributed variation among sites and a proportion of invariant sites. Three molecular clock models (strict, log-normal relaxed and exponential) and three demographic models (constant, exponential and Bayesian skyline) were compared by estimating marginal likelihoods by stepping stone and path sampling methods [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Bayes factors (BFs) were calculated for each pair of models. Both stepping stone and path sampling methods supported a log-normal relaxed clock and an exponential growth demographic model over the other models (BF &gt;60). The analyses were run for 50 million states and sampled every 5000 steps. Posterior probabilities were calculated with a burn-in of 10% and checked for convergence using Tracer version 1.7 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The analyses were carried out on the CSC server (IT Center for Science, Espoo, Finland).
