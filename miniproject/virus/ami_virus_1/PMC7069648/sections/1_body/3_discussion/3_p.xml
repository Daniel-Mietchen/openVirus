<p>The lack of convalescent samples limited the further testing and interpretation of the serological results obtained from single time point samples. The IgG positivity alone without other positive test results was considered old immunity, however this may be due to other past flavivirus exposure than DENV. The serological cross-reactions are common between different flaviviruses, and Kenya is known to be endemic, in addition to DENV, to West Nile virus, yellow fever virus (YFV) and Wesselsbron virus [

As the study was targeted at acute phase febrile patients and the sample volumes were limited, the typing of IgG antibody specificities via neutralization assays was not attempted. Notably, only two DENV seropositive patients were found to be positive also for ZIKV NS1 specific antibodies: one for IgG and one for IgM. Both of these patients reported recent travel to western Kenya where ZIKV neutralizing antibodies have been previously detected [

 <italic>n</italic> = 59) remains unclear and raises questions of the reliability and specificity of this in-house test. However, taking into account the timing of sampling and dengue marker appearance in dengue patients [
