<p>The statistical analyses of questionnaire data was used to investigate associations of demographic data to diagnostic findings. The multivariable modelling of the available data obtained suggested that age (&gt;30 years), female gender and travel (especially among the Taitaâ€“Taveta patient group) were significant risks factors for being positive in the flavivirus diagnostic tests. Notably, the travel history of the patients in this study included only domestic travel. Intriguingly, among younger patients, an association was found between contact with chicken and diagnostic test positivity. Whether this translates to environmental characteristics such as the presence of water containers that could influence vector breeding and abundance remains to be elucidated. However, this effect was not detected in patients over 30 years of age.</p>
