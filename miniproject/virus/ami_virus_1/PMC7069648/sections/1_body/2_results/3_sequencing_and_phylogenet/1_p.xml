<p>Using Sanger sequencing, the pan-flavivirus screening RT-PCR products (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5, ~ 150bp) were identified as DENV-2 with high identity matches in the BLAST search. A total of three complete DENV-2 coding sequences and one E-gene sequence were obtained in this study (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008099.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The attempt to obtain longer viral sequences for analysis were not successful in one sample (number 76). This sequence was 99â€“100% identical to the other sequences obtained in this study.
