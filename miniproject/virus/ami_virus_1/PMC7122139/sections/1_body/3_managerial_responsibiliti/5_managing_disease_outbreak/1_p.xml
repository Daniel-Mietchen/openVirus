<p>There are circumstances, despite the most comprehensive administrative efforts, that a disease outbreak or epidemic will occur in a health care facility. An epidemic is the occurrence of cases of a condition occurring in excess of what would be expected during the same time interval during the same season of the year. A disease outbreak is the occurrence of cases of disease in excess of what would normally be expected in a short-time period in a defined population, community, geographical area, or season. An outbreak may occur in a restricted geographical area, or extend over several countries within the same few days, weeks, or years. According to the World Health Organization (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27_7">2007</xref>), “A single case of a communicable disease long absent from a population, or caused by an agent (e.g., bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated.” The actual number of cases constituting an epidemic depends upon the infectious agent and the circumstances of the case presentation. Two cases of botulism occurring among patrons of a restaurant may be considered an epidemic. An epidemic may arise for several reasons, including: (1) an increase in the number of susceptible persons; (2) the emergence of a new organism; (3) changes in the environment; (4) changes in human behavior; (5) new media for the growth of organisms; (6) the migration of infected persons, animals, birds, or insects into an area; (7) change in the virulence of an organism; (8) inadequate immunization levels in a population; (9) improper sanitation or sanitary practices; or, (10) the intentional introduction of an infectious agent. A clue, if the epidemic is due to the intentional introduction of an infectious agent, is when a case is found to have developed the disease not through usual route of transmission or reservoir. For example, the development of anthrax in the respiratory system is not consistent with the common mode of transmission, namely direct contact with the tissues of animals dying of the disease.
