<p>In the event an outbreak occurs in a health care facility, the role of the health care manager is to initiate an organized strategy for its control. The action steps then taken by the manager would include the deployment of the personnel and resources to: (1) define the case; (2) screen all persons potentially exposed with laboratory studies to define the magnitude of the outbreak; (3) characterize the demographics of the cases, place of onset of disease, and time of onset of signs and symptoms; (4) isolate the infected cases and the source, if known; (5) disinfect portals of exit; (6) break identified chains of entry; (7) defend portals of entry; (8) arrange for the immunization and/or treatment of other susceptible persons, if indicated; (9) promote the investigation of risk factors (optimally using a case-control design); and (10) establish and maintain surveillance that serves to identify the potential for future outbreaks and gauges the efficacy of control measures. Of these steps, rapid detection is probably the most important and a responsibility of all health care professionals in the facility.</p>
