<p>Health care managers in practice should support the use of a combination of control measures, both in terms of organizational structure as well as policies and procedures. The mandated use of “Standard Precautions” in a health care setting is an example of a combination of control measures. Standard precautions emphasize administrative controls and the use of PPE. The epidemiologic principle behind this is twofold. First, excluding sweat, all body fluids, secretions, excretions, mucous membranes, and nonintact skin are presumed to be potentially infectious so that contact with these portals of exit and bodily fluids should be avoided. Second, health care settings often have a high prevalence of patients who are immunocompromised and therefore Standard Precautions should be used in the care of all patients (Table
