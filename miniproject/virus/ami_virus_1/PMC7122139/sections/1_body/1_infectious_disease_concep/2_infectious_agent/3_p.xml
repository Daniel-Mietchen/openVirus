<p>Each infectious agent has a unique incubation period. The incubation period is the time from the introduction of the agent into the host to the onset of the signs and symptoms of the disease. The incubation time is determined from a histogram of the onset of the signs and symptoms of illness by time unit. Commonly, the median or peak of the distribution from the histogram is the referent time unit from which to trace back in time the possible exposure source as ascertained from interviews of ill persons (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1_7" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The incubation period may be hours, days, weeks, months, or even years. For example, microbial agents that cause food poisoning typically have an incubation period of 24–72 h; microbial agents that cause respiratory infections typically have an incubation period of 7–10 days. A group of subacute degenerative diseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy or “mad cow disease,” kuru, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be from 15 months to over 30 years depending upon the route of exposure (Heymann,
