<p>Biological agents relevant to human diseases are classified as viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Most human diseases caused by biological agents are due to bacteria or viruses. Biological agents are classified according to the presence or absence of specific traits. Bacteria are classified based on the mechanism of movement and features of the cell wall. Viruses are classified based on the type of nucleic acid and its size, shape, and mode of replication. Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1_7" ref-type="table">1</xref> illustrates the major categories of microbial agents and their commonly associated disease. To determine whether a biological agent is causative in a disease, it must be isolated and identified in the host.
