<p>Manifestation in the host is described in terms of the agent’s pathogenicity and virulence. Pathogenicity is the ability of the organism to alter normal cellular and physiological processes. Virulence is the invasive ability of an organism to produce clinically manifest disease because of damage to tissues. Virulence is another term used when describing the potential for an agent to cause morbidity and mortality. It can also be epidemiologically characterized in terms of the case-fatality rate (see Boxed Example 
 <xref rid="Sec4_7" ref-type="sec">1</xref>). Noroviruses are highly virulent because they are highly contagious and quickly spread from person to person and “few as 100 virus particles thought to be sufficient to cause infection (
