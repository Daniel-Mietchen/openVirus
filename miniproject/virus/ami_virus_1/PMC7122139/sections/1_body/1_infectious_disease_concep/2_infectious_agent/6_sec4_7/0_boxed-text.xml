 <label>Boxed Example 1 Interpreting the SARS Case Fatality Rate (Source: Karlberg et al., 
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14_7">2004</xref>)*
 </label>
 <p>
  <bold>Problem:</bold> Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a novel coronavirus presenting with high fever (&gt;38°Celsius/100.4°F) and coughing or breathing difficulty. Transmission is from person to person through direct contact with the secretions or droplets of suspect or probable cases with SARS. It is not well-established if susceptibility varies by age, gender or race.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> Cases of SARS were determined by treating physicians according to patient clinical signs, a chest X-ray, and appropriate diagnostic tests or autopsy reports. The case-fatality rate is the number of persons dying from a particular disease in a specific period who were diagnosed with the disease within that same time period multiplied by 100 or 100%. Mortality data were from 42 Hong Kong Government hospitals from the period early March to September 22, 2004.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Data and Results:</bold> The case fatality rate for males was 170/776 × 100% = 21.9%. The case fatality rate for females was 129/979 × 100% = 13.2%. The difference between the two groups was

 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Managerial Epidemiology Interpretation:</bold> Males are more severely affected by SARS than females experience a risk of dying that is 1.66 times greater than females. Health care managers need to understand that some population subgroups may be at higher risk than others. Resource allocation for prevention efforts (e.g., workplace exposures, smoking cessation) or more thorough diagnosis (e.g., symptoms/signs overlooked in females) should be considered.
