<p>The accurate identification of an infectious agent requires the following steps to ensure the integrity of the specimen: select the appropriate body area for collection of the clinical specimen(s) for testing; select an appropriate method of collection (e.g., oral swab, spinal puncture, etc.); a sufficient quantity of material to be tested; preparation of the sample for transport (e.g., icing) including proper labeling for patient identification number; date and time of collection of the specimen; and a timely and safe transport of the specimen to the laboratory. If multiple specimens are to be taken from the same patient or if the same type of specimen is to be obtained from multiple patients, prepare and secure one specimen at a time to avoid cross-contamination, change gloves between samples and patients, avoid splashing, spilling, or aerosolizing samples. Proper frequent disinfection of the work area, immediately cleaning up spills, and ensuring that biosafety cabinets/areas are available for specimen storage while awaiting transport to the laboratory. It is also important for the health care manager to ensure the facilities and equipment for proper specimen collection are readily available and that services are organized in a manner to ensure the timely and safe delivery of the specimen(s) (e.g., tube system, refrigerated transport services).</p>
