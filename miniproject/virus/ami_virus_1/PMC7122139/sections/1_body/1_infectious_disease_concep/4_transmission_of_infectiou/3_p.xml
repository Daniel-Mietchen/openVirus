<p>Indirect transmission is through vehicle-borne or vector-borne methods and is a means for transporting the infectious agent into the susceptible host. Vehicles for infectious disease transmission include but are not limited to inanimate objects or materials such as soiled bedding or clothes, door handles, eating utensils, objects of personal care (toothbrushes, shavers), water, milk, surgical instruments, wound dressings, or biological substances (e.g., transplanted organs, blood transfusion, etc.). Vector-borne transmission may be mechanical or biological. Mechanical transmission is the physical transmission of an infectious agent, which is not an essential element in its life cycle. Flies can transmit 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> on their appendages from contaminated feces to food, representing mechanical transmission. Biological transmission occurs when a vector harbors a pathogen within its body and delivers the pathogen to a host in an interactive manner, such as through propagation, a bite. Malaria is caused by the biological transmission from the bite of a female 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito infected with 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, a protozoan parasite into a susceptible host.
