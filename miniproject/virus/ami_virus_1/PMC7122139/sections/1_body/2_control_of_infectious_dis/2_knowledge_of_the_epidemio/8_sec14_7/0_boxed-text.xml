 <label>Boxed Example 2 Catheter-related Bloodstream Infection:Effectiveness of an Intervention</label>
 <p>
  <bold>Problem:</bold> In intensive care units, catheter-related bloodstream infections are common and potentially lethal.
 </p>
 <p>
  <bold>Methods:</bold> A cohort study compared infection rates before, during, and up to 18 months after implementation of study intervention. The Michigan Health and Hospital Association (MHA) promoted hospital involvement to use interventions (hand washing, full-barrier precautions during the insertion of central venous catheters, cleaning the skin with chlorhexidine, avoiding the femoral site, and removing unnecessary catheters) as part of a statewide safety initiative in ICUs (the MHA Keystone: ICU Project). The National Nosocomial Infections Surveil­­lance System definition of catheter-related blood-stream infection was used which included clinical signs and/or cultures of blood or other infection sites.
