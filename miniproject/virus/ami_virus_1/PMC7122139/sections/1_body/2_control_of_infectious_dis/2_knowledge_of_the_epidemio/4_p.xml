<p>In 
 <italic>hospitals</italic>, there are three areas of concern for transmission risk. Intensive care units (ICU) care for patients with life threatening diseases and trauma who are treated with invasive technology often with extended antibiotic use and long stays. ICU patients are at risk for multidrug resistant organisms and various 
 <italic>Candida</italic> species. Over 20% of hospital-acquired infections are likely to arise in ICUs. Burn unit patients are susceptible to infection in proportion to the amount of total body surface exposed. Prevalent organisms in burn units include methicillin-resistant 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), gram-negative bacteria, and various 
 <italic>Candida and Aspergillus</italic> species. Pediatric unit patients are at risk of transmission of Â­community-acquired infections because these patients do not have fully developed immune systems, are low birthweight, have incomplete immunization series, or because of seasonal epidemics occurring in the community. Organisms common in pediatric units include: 
 <italic>Bordetella pertussis</italic> [pertussis], respiratory viral infections including those caused by respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), influenza viruses, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, rubeola [measles], varicella [chickenpox], and rotaviral enteritis (Boxed Example
