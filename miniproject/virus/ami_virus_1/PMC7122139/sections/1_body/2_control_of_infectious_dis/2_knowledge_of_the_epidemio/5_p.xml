 <italic>Long term care facilities</italic> (LTC) (skilled nursing facilities, in-patient rehabilitation centers, in-patient behavioral health centers, assisted breathing centers, homes for the developmentally disabled, hospices) are a source of risk for transmissible disease because their residents may have limitations in or impaired mobility or cognition, share common areas for extended periods of time, and/or have chronic illnesses. The rate of health care-acquired infections has been reported to range from 3 to 7 per 1,000 resident-care days in the more rigorous studies (Siegel et al., 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24_7">2007</xref>). In LTC facilities, transmissible organisms of concern are: various viruses (e.g., influenza virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus [conjunctivitis], norovirus) and bacteria, including group A streptococcus, 
 <italic>B. pertussis</italic>, nonsusceptible 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, various other multidrug resistant organisms, and 
 <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>.
