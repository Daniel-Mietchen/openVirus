<p>The immature phases were kept viable in a container containing 10 mL of deionized water and sent for laboratory identification, following the dichotomous key of vectors (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). After identification, these immature phases were washed twice by immersion in deionized water and separated in pools, according to the species, evolutionary phase (larva or pupa), and month of collection. Each pool had 1 to 137 specimens. They were then frozen at –80°C, still alive and without any viral additive (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), where they remained until the RNA extraction procedure was performed.
