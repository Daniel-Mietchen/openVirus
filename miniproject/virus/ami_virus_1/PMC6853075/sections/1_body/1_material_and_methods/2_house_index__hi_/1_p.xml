<p>Collection of the immature stages of vectors from the domiciliary deposits was done, with subsequent georeferencing performed using the MECE
 <sup>Â®</sup> system (Add Technologies, Brazil). MECE stands for strategic monitoring for epidemic control, which consists of a mobile device (smartphone) with information from the study area: planned route, route performed, classification of the home (closed, refused, vacant land, or inspected by work team), types of reservoirs/breeding sites of the vectors, and sample collection of the vectors.
