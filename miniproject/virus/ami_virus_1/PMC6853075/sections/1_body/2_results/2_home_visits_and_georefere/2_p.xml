<p>Our data demonstrated that suspected ZIKV cases were concentrated in the urbanized area of Xerem. This area is more densely populated and has a high concentration of vectors (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>). It is noteworthy that in 2015 there were already suspected cases of ZIKV in this region, and the number of cases reached its apex in March 2016, the period when the outbreak was characterized (
