<p>A Brazilian study from an area not distant from ours showed the presence of ZIKV in nature, in the adult insect (mosquitoes). A total of 550 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> (315 females and 235 males, grouped in 198 pools), and 26 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (20 and 6; 21 pools) were studied. Three pools of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were positive for ZIKV, one of which had male mosquitoes; the natural infection of a male mosquito was interesting and strongly suggested vertical transmission, as only female mosquitoes are blood-sucking. These results reinforced ZIKV circulation in this region during this period, indicating the occurrence of the outbreak in the following year. The cycle thresholds of positive pools were similar to our study, and some pools contained very few specimens, which is also similar to our study. The difference between their study and ours is that we identified ZIKV in the immature forms of both 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species, showing that 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> may also be a vector for ZIKV in Brazil (
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> has been found naturally infected with the viruses in Gabon in 2007 (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) and in Mexico in 2016 (
 <xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), and has been shown to be experimentally infected in the laboratory in Florida, although with low efficiency (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). In another study, designed to test whether ZIKV could be vertically transmitted, female 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> were injected with ZIKV, and their F1 adult progeny were tested for ZIKV infection. Six of 69 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pools, comprised of a total of 1738 F1 adults, yielded ZIKV upon culture, giving a minimum filial infection rate of 1:290. In contrast, none of 803 F1 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> adults (32 pools) yielded ZIKV (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). It is important to note that injecting mosquitoes does not replicate what occurs in nature, which is oral contamination via bites. In a study by Ciota et al. (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>), adult insects fed orally with ZIKV in the laboratory had their progeny tested; of 104 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> pools, 6 were ZIKV positive, indicating a filial infection rate (FIR) of 11.9, a ratio of ≅1:84, which is substantially greater than that found in another study (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>) as well as ratios historically measured for flaviviruses (
 <xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>–
 <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and 1 of 17 pools of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> tested positive, which yielded a similar FIR (11.8 [range 1.7–134.8]).
