<p>Previous experimental studies have demonstrated that a number of mosquito-borne flavivirus pathogens are vertically transmitted in their insect vectors, providing a mechanism for these arboviruses to persist during adverse climatic conditions or in the absence of a susceptible vertebrate host. The transovarial transmission of arbovirus was recognized in the 1950s in studies carried out with DENV, being found in male specimens, that is, those that do not carry out hematophagy, in immature stages (larvae and pupae) of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, with a MIR of 1:2067 for DENV-2 (

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes from Thailand were capable of transmitting CHIKV vertically in the laboratory; 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> was more susceptible and had a greater ability to transmit the viruses vertically than 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>. 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes were able to transmit CHIKV vertically to F5 and F6 progenies, respectively (
