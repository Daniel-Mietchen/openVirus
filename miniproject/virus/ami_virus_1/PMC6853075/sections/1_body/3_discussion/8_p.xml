<p>Our findings demonstrated that ZIKV was present in immature stages of vector insects in the study region at least five months prior to the peak of ZIKV associated cases in March 2016. Data from molecular xenomonitoring of immature phases of the vectors may contribute to an early detection of arboviruses helping to plan human and material resources for potential outbreaks.</p>
