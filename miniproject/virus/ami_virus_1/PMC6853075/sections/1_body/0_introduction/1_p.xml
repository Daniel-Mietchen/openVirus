<p>Vector-borne diseases account for about 17% of the total burden of communicable diseases and 700,000 deaths each year (
 <xref rid="B01" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). In Brazil, dengue viruses (DENV) resurged in 1981 and since then, the country has been considered endemic for this arbovirus (
 <xref rid="B02" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). In 2014, Chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses, two exotic arboviruses, were introduced in Brazil causing epidemics with rapid dispersion in different states (
 <xref rid="B03" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). The increasing outbreaks of ZIKV due to vector dispersion and lack of effective control and prevention actions led to a global public health concern (
 <xref rid="B04" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). The most alarming clinical manifestations of ZIKV were cases associated with Guillain-Barr√© syndrome in adults (
 <xref rid="B05" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) and the congenital ZIKV syndrome (
 <xref rid="B06" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Furthermore, reports of outbreaks of CHIKV emphasize the magnitude of its epidemics that accounted for 11,102 probable cases in 2017 and 4,861 cases by the middle of 2018 in the Southeast of Brazil (
 <xref rid="B07" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Adverse outcomes of CHIKV include neurological disease in the acute phase, and longstanding arthritis and myalgia. The acute phase of the three arboviral diseases may be clinically undistinguishable. Therefore, diseases caused by these viruses are of great public health relevance, but the epidemiological features in areas where the three viruses co-circulate are still not fully understood.
