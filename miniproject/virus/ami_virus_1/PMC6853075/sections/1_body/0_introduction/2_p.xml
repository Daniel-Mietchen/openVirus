 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> has competence for the transmission and is the main vector of all three arboviruses (
 <xref rid="B08" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In 2002, in an attempt to eradicate dengue, the Brazilian government created the National Dengue Control Program (PNCD). This program promoted initiatives aimed at surveillance and vector control measures, as well as environmental sanitation actions. The strategies consisted of identifying key areas using the Larval Index Rapid Assessment (LIRA) for 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, and the spray application of the larvicide 
 <italic>Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis</italic> (Bti) (
 <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) in households that contained foci of immature mosquitoes. The LIRA is performed by sampling the vector within the municipalities, since the procedure quickly identifies the vector infestation rates. This method allows for the quick assessment of percentage figures and identifies predominant breeding sites, allowing rapid action for vector control (
