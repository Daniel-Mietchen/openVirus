<p id="Par52">Emerging and vector-borne and neglected viral diseases pose a risk to communities particularly in resource poor settings. While adults are disproportionately affected by some of these as a result of occupational exposure, the burden of rabies and Zika infections is borne by children and the fetus respectively. Treatment options overall are very limited or not possible, so early identification of emergence and prevention of spread, are key strategies. The development of vaccines for a number of emerging diseases show promise but clinical trials are still needed. A “One Health” approach addressing environmental, animal and human aspects of emerging and zoonotic diseases are key in prevention, early detection and control.</p>
