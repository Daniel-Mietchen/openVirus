 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR187">187</xref>]. The disease is caused by viruses belonging to the genus 
 <italic>Lyssavirus</italic> of the family 
 <italic>Rhabdoviridae.</italic> The lyssaviruses represent a diverse group of viruses with the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses recognizing rabies lyssavirus and 13 rabies-related viral species in 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR188">188</xref>]. Additional lyssaviruses have been described but not classified taxonomically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR189">189</xref>]. Not all of the lyssaviruses have been associated with human cases, and by far the public health burden associated with rabies relates to infection with “classic” rabies viruses (previously denoted as genotype 1 viruses) (RABV) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR190">190</xref>]. The RABV circulates in diverse terrestrial mammals which vary by geographical location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR185">185</xref>]. The public health burden associated with rabies however relates to rabies in domestic dogs since these animals serve as the most common vector of the disease to the human population [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR191">191</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR192">192</xref>]. Therefore, most human rabies cases are reported from developing countries where dog rabies control efforts are suboptimal [
