Pre-exposure regimens using cell-derived vaccines either administered intradermally or intramascularly as three doses have been shown to induce good immune responses, which are long lasting and successfully boosted even after many years if there is specific exposure [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Pre-exposure vaccination obviates the need for post exposure rabies immunoglobulin, a generally scarce resource in many areas. The use of pre-exposure vaccines as part of the expanded program for immunization has been used in some areas with high exposure risks and shown to be immunogenic and safe, with persistence of rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies [
