<p id="Par49">As humans are mostly exposed to the RABV through contact with domestic dogs, the vaccination of dogs presents a crucial intervention for prevention of the disease in humans [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>]. The latter should be complimented by promotion of responsible animal ownership and bite prevention programmes. Ensuring the availability and accessibility of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for potentially exposed humans is key in the prevention of human rabies. Rabies PEP is highly effective in preventing rabies in persons exposed to RABV provided timeous administration of biologicals and recommended regimens are followed [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR216">216</xref>]. Modern rabies vaccines are highly purified, cell-derived inactivated vaccines with agreeable safety profiles, very few adverse reactions and are highly immunogenic [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Wound cleaning and PEP, done as soon as possible after suspected contact with a rabid animal can prevent the onset of rabies in virtually 100% of exposures. Intensive wound cleaning is a critical, affordable and manageable component of rabies prevention especially in communities without access to rabies biological prevention and may play some role in some cases in preventing progression to rabies disease. Management of the wound includes cleaning with copious amounts of water (even for small wounds) and soap. The wound should be disinfected with 70% ethanol and iodine. Wound management should also include the use of antibiotics and provision of tetanus vaccination/booster vaccination as clinically required.
