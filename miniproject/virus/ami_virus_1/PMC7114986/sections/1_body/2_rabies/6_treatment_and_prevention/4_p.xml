<p id="Par50">Rabies PEP should start as soon as possible following on an exposure to a suspected rabid animal. Even if there is a delay between exposure and visit to the healthcare facility, there is no cut off point after which it is too late to initiate rabies PEP. The decision to give PEP or not should also be made on the risk of RABV transmission, for example taking into account: the animal species, provoked versus unprovoked attack, animal behavior, animal health and category of exposure and history of rabies vaccination of the animal if possible and reliable. Vaccination is either through the intramuscular or intradermal route in accordance with WHO recommended regimens [

In wounds that drew any amount of blood (including small wounds such as scrapes that broke the skin) (also called category III exposures), rabies immunoglobulin (RIG) is essential. The latter provides passive immunity whilst immunity is mounted against the rabies vaccination. The use of RIG is crucial in prevention of rabies in category III exposures and failure to provide has culminated in prophylaxis failures [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The RIG is infiltrated locally into wound site as much as possible. If injection locally into wound is painful, particularly in children; especially if the wound is on the head, face or neck, consider some sedation provided it can be done safely. The costs of RIG, and limited access and availability in many developing countries, limit the success of PEP in developing countries.
