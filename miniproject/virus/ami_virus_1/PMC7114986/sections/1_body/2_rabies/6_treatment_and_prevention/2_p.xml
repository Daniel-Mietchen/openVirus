 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR210">210</xref>]. The patient, an adolescent girl, was exposed to rabies virus through contact with a bat, and was treated through the induction of coma. Remarkably, the patient mounted a potent natural immune response to the infection, an observation not commonly noted in unvaccinated rabies patients [
