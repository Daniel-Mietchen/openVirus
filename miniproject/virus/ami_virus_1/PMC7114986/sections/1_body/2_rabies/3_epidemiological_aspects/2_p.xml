<p id="Par38">Uniquely, rabies virus is associated with insectivorous bat reservoirs in the Americas—this phenomenon has not been reported elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. In addition to bats, cycles of rabies are also reported in various terrestrial mammals in the Americas, for example in raccoons and skunks in the USA. Domestic dog rabies is reported mostly from developing countries in Asia and Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>], with elimination achieved in the US and various European countries. The role of wildlife rabies varies from region to region. It should however be noted that all mammalian species are susceptible to rabies and may serve as potential vectors of the disease and this should be considered when evaluating possible exposure.
