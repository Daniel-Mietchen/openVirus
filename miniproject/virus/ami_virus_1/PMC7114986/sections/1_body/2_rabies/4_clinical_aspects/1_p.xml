<p id="Par39">The virus is transmitted in the saliva of an infected animal. Bites, but any small nicks or scrapes or scratches that break the skin, may constitute exposures. Mucosal exposures, such as licking over the face with contact with the nose, eyes and mouth are also considered exposures. Incubation periods range from 4 days to several years and tend to be shortest with severe bites on the face, head and neck, especially in children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR200">200</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR201">201</xref>]. There are no diagnostic tests possible during this period to predict the likelihood of rabies disease following on a potential exposure. A wide range of non-specific prodromal features including fever, headache, myalgia, fatigue, and change in mood and itching at the initial rabies exposure site may be reported, and in the absence of a report of possible exposure to rabies the disease is difficult to diagnose clinically [
