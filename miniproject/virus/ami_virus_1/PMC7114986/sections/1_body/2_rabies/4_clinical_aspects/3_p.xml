 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>]. The differential diagnosis of rabies is broad. A detailed history of previous potential animal exposure is very important, but can also be inaccurate as animal contact may have been forgotten or unnoticed especially as often reported where bats have been involved in the exposures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. The differential diagnosis includes other viral causes of encephalitis and bacterial meningitis and cerebral malaria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR186">186</xref>]. Tetanus is important in the differential diagnosis and may also be linked to the same animal source, typically there is a short incubation period and the muscle rigidity is constant, without relaxation between spasms. Paralytic rabies can also be confused with poliomyelitis and Guillian-Barr√© syndrome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR205">205</xref>]. Drug intoxications, psychiatric disorders also form part of the differential diagnosis.
