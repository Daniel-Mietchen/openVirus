<p id="Par35">Rabies is the most fatal viral infection in recorded history, and although controllable in certain animal populations through vaccine programmes and largely preventable in humans through prevention of exposures and post exposure prophylaxis, clinical rabies disease cannot be treated [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>] estimated that 59,000 human cases of rabies occur in dog rabies affected countries annually. Dog rabies is most commonly reported from developing countries and typically affects poor communities where dog rabies control measures are inadequate. In addition, many epidemiological reports have indicated that children are particularly affected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>]. Human cases are underreported in many developing countries due to the lack of specialized diagnostic services to investigate such cases, but also due to the complexities of clinical diagnosis. Consequently, rabies remains an under-recognized and neglected disease in much of the world [
