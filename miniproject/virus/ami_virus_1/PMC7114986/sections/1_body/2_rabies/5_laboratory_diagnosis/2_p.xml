<p id="Par45">Ante-mortem diagnosis of rabies can be confirmed through RT-PCR detection of viral RNA in saliva, nuchal biopsies and cerebrospinal fluid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR206">206</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR207">207</xref>]. Detection of viral RNA in tears, urine and respiratory secretions has also been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR208">208</xref>]. Serological investigations are not always useful to confirm a rabies diagnosis, but the detection of virus neutralizing antibodies in the serum of a previously unvaccinated person or in cerebrospinal fluid are considered confirmatory findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The gold standard for rabies confirmation in humans (and animals) remains examination of brain tissue post mortem by PCR or immunofluorescence [
