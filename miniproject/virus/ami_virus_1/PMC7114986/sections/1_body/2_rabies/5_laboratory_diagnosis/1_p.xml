<p id="Par44">Specialized testing is required to confirm a clinical diagnosis of rabies. Ante-mortem demonstration of virus in saliva or nuchal skin biopsies may be helpful in some cases, but demonstration of virus using molecular or immunofluorescence techniques on post mortem brain tissue remains the gold standard. Most often these tests are provided only by national reference laboratories, but remain unavailable in many countries where human rabies cases still occur. Routine blood screens are not informative for rabies diagnosis and are expected to be within normal ranges [
