<p id="Par9">The initial stage of the clinical course of EVD is non-specific, complicating early diagnosis, and follows an incubation period of 2–21 days [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. The difficulty of clinical diagnosis is compounded by a long list of possible differential diagnoses in the locations where EVD has been described. This includes other VHF such as Lassa fever, but also other infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera and typhoid [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. EVD is characterized by sudden onset of fever (&gt;40 °C (104 °F)), generalized weakness and anorexia, myalgia, headache and sore throat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. These were all common findings in children during the EVD outbreak in West Africa [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Noteworthy, is that all of the EVD cases reported in children during the 2000 Gulu outbreak reported fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Patients infected with EVD rapidly deteriorate and commonly present with gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration. Chertow et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] reported profuse watery diarrhea in EVD patients persisting for a week or more. As with other VHF, and contrary to the naming of the syndrome, most cases do not present with overt bleeding [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. Less than 20% of children diagnosed with EVD presented with bleeding which was reported as hematochezia, hematemesis, bleeding gums, epistaxis and oozing from needle puncture sites [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Patients will then either recover or deteriorate, often displaying neurological signs. Patients typically succumb due to multi-organ failure and hypovolemic shock [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Common findings in EVD patients with a poor prognosis are rapidly developing leukopenia, thrombocytopenia and a decrease in coagulopathy markers [
