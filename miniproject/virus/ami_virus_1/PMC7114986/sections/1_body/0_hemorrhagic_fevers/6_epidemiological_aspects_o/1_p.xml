<p id="Par7">To date, natural outbreaks of EVD have only been recorded in central and west African countries. Before the outbreak of EVD in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia from 2013 to 2015, outbreaks of the disease were limited to secluded and rural locations in central Africa [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This does however not mean that children are not affected. A retrospective study revealed that 20 of the 218 (9%) confirmed EVD cases during the 2000 Gulu, Uganda outbreak were in young children and adolescents [

In communities where children are kept away from the sick the risk should be lower, but in many instances young children are co-admitted to hospital with their sick caregivers increasing the risk of them also being infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. During the Gulu-outbreak, it was noted that the under-five age group was more affected during this outbreak than other children. Here children were typically co-admitted to hospital with their symptomatic parents [
