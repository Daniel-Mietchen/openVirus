<p id="Par8">The natural history of Ebola virus (EBOV) remains an enigma despite intensive research on the topic. Evidence is accumulating that certain forest dwelling fruit bat species (including 
 <italic>Hypsignathus monstrosus</italic>, 
 <italic>Epomops franqueti, Myonycteris torquata</italic> and possibly 
 <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic>) are natural reservoirs of the virus although this occurrence is still not fully understood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The source of EVD outbreaks has often been associated with direct contact with bushmeat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. The latter includes bats, chimpanzee, gorillas and duiker antelope [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. The risk for contact with bushmeat appears to be related to slaughtering and preparation of the raw meat and not necessarily the consumption of cooked meat [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Outbreaks of EVD in the human population are amplified by human-to-human transmission through close and direct contact with infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. These outbreaks are perpetuated in the hospital setting but also in close family and friend circles where caring for the ill and traditional burial practices are the most prominent risk factor for contracting the virus.
