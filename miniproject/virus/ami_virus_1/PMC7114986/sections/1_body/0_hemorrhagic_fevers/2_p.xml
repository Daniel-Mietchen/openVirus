<p id="Par3">All of the HF viruses are naturally harbored in distinct animal or invertebrate reservoirs. Outbreaks of the disease are either associated with exposure to the virus through a vector species (for example ticks for CCHF virus or mosquitoes for yellow fever) and little or no human-to-human spread, or a single spill-over event from the animal reservoir with amplification of the outbreak through human-to-human transmission (for example spill-over of Ebola virus from bats or other infected forest dwelling animals to humans). Since these viruses are associated with an animal or invertebrate reservoirs and vectors, the diseases have a specifically geographical expanse, partly related to the distribution of these reservoir and vector species. Another observation is that historically, outbreaks of VHFs have been occurring in low resource settings with many of the outbreaks associated with health care facilities where poor infection control practices allow for the spread of these viruses. Recent outbreaks of yellow fever have occurred in high density urban areas with intense mosquito breeding. Infection prevention and control measures in hospitals remain the most important measure to contain a VHF outbreak [

Currently, the only VHF for which a licensed vaccine is available is yellow fever. The vaccine is administered to children over 9 months of age of as part of the expanded program of immunization in a number of yellow fever endemic countries, in mass campaigns and in response to reported outbreaks. Documentation of a high rate of yellow fever vaccine-associated neurotropic disease in young infants during the 1960s led to institution of age &lt;6 months as a contraindication for yellow fever vaccination except during epidemics when the risk of yellow fever virus transmission may be very high [
