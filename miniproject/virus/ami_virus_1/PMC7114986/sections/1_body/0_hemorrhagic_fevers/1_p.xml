<p id="Par2">The viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHF) are a specific group of diseases that have in common the propensity for human to human transmission particularly in the hospital setting, have high mortality and require early recognition and a public health response to prevent outbreaks. They are caused by unrelated RNA viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Filovirus</italic>, 
 <italic>Arenavirus, Bunyavirus</italic> and 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic> genera (reviewed in [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">5.1</xref>). Subclinical or mild cases are commonly associated with for example Lassa fever, yellow fever and Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), contrasted by Ebola virus and Marburg virus disease (EVD and MVD) which are more often associated with severe and fatal outcomes and case fatality rates of up to 90% recorded during outbreaks.
