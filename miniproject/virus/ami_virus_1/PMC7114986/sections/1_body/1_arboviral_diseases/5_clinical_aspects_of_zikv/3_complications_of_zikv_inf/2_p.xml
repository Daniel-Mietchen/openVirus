<p id="Par27">A place and time association was noted with the outbreak of ZIKV in Brazil and concomitant rise in number of babies born with microcephaly in 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR153">153</xref>], but studies have subsequently reported significant evidence to support this hypothesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. As such, current opinion is that ZIKV infection during pregnancy can be linked to microcephaly and other congenital neurological and developmental abnormalities, although Koch’s postulates have not been applied to prove causality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR155">155</xref>]. Reports of neonates with microcephaly and other malformations and abnormalities are accumulating since early 2016 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">158</xref>]. In conjunction with microcephaly, small brain size, ventriculomegaly, hypoplasia or agyria, agenesis of the cerebellar vermis, posterior fossa abnormalities and calcifications have been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>]. Other abnormalities have included growth retardation, arthogryposis and ophthalmologic findings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">125</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">157</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">159</xref>]. Fetal losses have also been reported, and a perinatal mortality rate of almost 27% was reported by Oliveira and co-workers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">130</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>] in a small cohort study conducted in Brazil. Continued longitudinal monitoring of the development of the birth cohort affected by the ZIKV outbreak will reveal the breadth of neurological damage possibly caused by the virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">160</xref>]. A retrospective study has indicated cases of microcephaly and other abnormalities in babies born during the ZIKV outbreak in French Polynesia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR161">161</xref>]. The possible link between these cases and ZIKV infection was not made at the time, most likely due to the limited number of cases involved (i.e. the extent of the outbreak in Brazil and South America allowed for the possible correlation to be made).
