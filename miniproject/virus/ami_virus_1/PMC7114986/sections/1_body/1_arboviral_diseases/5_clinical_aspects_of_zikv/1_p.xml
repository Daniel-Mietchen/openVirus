<p id="Par24">Following the bite of an infected mosquito, an incubation period of up to 2 weeks follows, after which some infected individuals will develop the signs and symptoms of ZIKV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. An estimated 80% of humans becoming infected with the virus will not develop any clinical signs of disease. In the remainder, disease is typically acute but mild and self-resolving [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. This is marked by a low-grade fever (typically not above 38.5 °C (101.3 °F)), arthralgia, a maculopapular rash, conjunctivitis, headache and asthenia, much like dengue fever [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>]. Clinical diagnosis of ZIKV infection is complicated due to its non-specific presentation, but also due to the co-circulation of other arboviruses such as dengue and chikungunya viruses which cause clinically indistinguishable disease in most cases. Co-infection of ZIKV and dengue or chikungunya virus has also been reported [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. This is not entirely surprising given that these viruses are spread by the same species of mosquitoes. Additionally, other infectious etiologies may also present with similar clinical syndrome including parvovirus infection, rubella, measles, leptospirosis, malaria and rickettsiosis [
