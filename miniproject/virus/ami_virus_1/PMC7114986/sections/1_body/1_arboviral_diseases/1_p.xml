<p id="Par18">Arboviruses are insect-transmitted viruses belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic> virus families
 <italic>.</italic> Hematophagous vectors such as mosquitos, ticks, midges and sandflies transmit the viruses to humans and other susceptible vertebrate hosts. More than 500 arboviruses have been catalogued worldwide, with a little more than a quarter of them reported to cause human disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. The clinical spectrum of arboviral disease is vast ranging from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening febrile and hemorrhagic fever. Arboviral disease typically falls within one of four groups of clinical presentation, namely non-specific systemic febrile disease, encephalitis, polyarthralgia or hemorrhagic fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>]. Most of the arboviruses are however, not limited to causing only one clinical syndrome. West Nile virus may for example cause unapparent infection in up to 80% of infected individuals but may also cause debilitating encephalitis in others [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. The distribution of specific arboviruses is geographically defined based on insect vector distribution. Several instances of expanding vector distribution, for example, presumptively due to global climate changes, changes in land use patterns and global transportation have been increasingly linked with the emergence of arboviruses worldwide [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>], the emergence of chikungunya in Indian Ocean Islands and the Caribbean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>], and the emergence of Zika virus (ZIKV) in Latin America in 2014 [
