<p id="Par22">The ZIKV was reported for the first time following yellow fever research conducted in the Zika Forest of Uganda in 1947 when it was isolated from a febrile rhesus monkey [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">93</xref>]. It was recognized as a disease causing agent in humans in 1954 when diagnosed in febrile patients in Nigeria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. In the years to follow, ZIKV remained mostly a research curiosity with a handful of studies that described its ecology and sero-prevalence in selected human populations and it caused sporadic cases and limited outbreaks without reported mortality or fetal effects [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>] in a number of countries in Africa and Southeast Asia. In 2007, the first major outbreak of ZIKV was reported from the Yap Islands of Micronesia where more than 70% of the Island’s population was affected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">102</xref>]. This was followed by an outbreak in French Polynesia in 2013 and 2014, also affecting nearly 70% of the population [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">103</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">106</xref>]. The virus continued to spread westward, and was reported in Chile’s Easter Island in February 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">107</xref>]. This was followed by detection of the virus in Brazil in May 2015, although molecular studies have suggested that the virus may have been introduced as early as late 2014 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR108">108</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. By September 2016, ZIKV was reported from more than 47 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. In addition, probably related to increased vigilance for the virus, outbreaks of the disease have been reported from Micronesia, Western Samoa, Figi, Singapore, Tonga, Samoa and the Marshal Islands, with possible endemic transmission reported in a dozen other countries in Southeast Asia and the Pacific since 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. Although, these reports may relate to endemic occurrence of the virus, the possibility of autochthonous outbreaks due to translocation of virus from Latin America is under investigation for some of these outbreaks [
