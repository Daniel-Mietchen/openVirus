<p id="Par23">The ZIKV, a flavivirus, is transmitted to humans primarily through the bite of the female, day-feeding 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquito [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">112</xref>]. The role of other mosquito species in transmission of the virus to humans is disputed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes usually thrive during warm and wet seasons in the tropics and subtropics, with 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> particularly well suited for breeding in urban settings, hence the risk of transmission of the virus from infected mosquitos to humans. Although, direct mosquito transmission is mostly implicated in transmission of the ZIKV to humans, transmission in-utero, intrapartum and through sexual transmission has been reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Transmission in-utero has been most alarming with the probable link to congenital malformations and microcephaly (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec8" ref-type="sec">5.2.2</xref>). Rare cases of transmission through blood transfusion and laboratory exposures have also been reported [
