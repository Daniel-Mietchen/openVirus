<p id="Par30">It is recommended that laboratory tests for ZIKV infection include RT-PCR detection of the viral RNA in whole blood, serum, plasma or urine which are collected during the acute phase of illness (i.e. &lt;7 days after onset of illness) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR163">163</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. The virus has also been detected in saliva, cerebrospinal fluid, female genital tract secretions, semen and breast milk [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">165</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR169">169</xref>]. Detection of viral RNA in secretions such as semen and saliva has been noted for extended periods even after viremia in the blood has been cleared [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR168">168</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR170">170</xref>]. Although viremia in the blood is typically cleared quickly, viral RNA has been detected in blood more than 2 months after onset of illness in a limited number of cases [
