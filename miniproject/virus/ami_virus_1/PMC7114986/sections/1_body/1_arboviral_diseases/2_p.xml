<p id="Par19">Clinical diagnosis of arboviral disease is complicated, and under- or misdiagnosis related to the difficulty of clinical diagnosis in the absence of overt complications is common. In addition, the geographical spread of many arboviruses overlap and have similar clinical manifestations relating to complexity in clinical diagnosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. Specialized diagnostic testing is required to confirm a suspicion of arboviral disease, but is not accessible in many countries where it is probably needed the most. Although RT-PCR detection or virus isolation provide definitive diagnosis, laboratory investigations for arboviral infections mostly rely on serological testing and interpretation due to the typically short viremic period associated with most arboviral infections. Interpretation of serological testing for arboviruses is also challenging and confounded by substantial antigenic cross-reaction between viruses belonging to the same family. The cross-reaction phenomenon particularly applies to flavivirus infections and may be further complicated by possible prior infection with a virus from the same family, or a vaccination for yellow fever or Japanese encephalitis.
