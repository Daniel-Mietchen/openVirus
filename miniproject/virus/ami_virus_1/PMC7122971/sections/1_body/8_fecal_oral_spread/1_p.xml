<p>The most prevalent virus spread by this means is the Norwalk (norovirus). These viruses have been in the news recently due to infections that have occurred on cruise ships. The Norwalk virus was named for Norwalk, Ohio, where there was an outbreak in the 1970s. Since there are many species of norovirus, this is now the officially accepted name. This stomach virus ranks second (behind the common cold) in the occurrence of viral illnesses in the United States. The centers for disease control (CDC) reported over 267 million cases of diarrhea in 2000, and estimates about 5–17 % of these may have been caused by a norovirus. Cruise ships are not the only place where one can pick up this nasty bug; of the 348 outbreaks reported to the CDC between 1996 and 2000, only 10 % were in vacation settings. Restaurants, nursing homes, hospitals, and daycare centers are the most likely places to pick up a norovirus infection. Symptoms of norovirus illness usually begin about 24–48 h after exposure to the virus, but they can appear as early as 12 h after ingestion of contaminated food. People infected with norovirus are contagious from the moment they begin feeling ill until at least 3 days after recovery. Some people may be contagious for as long as 2 weeks. Therefore, it is particularly important for people to practice good hand-washing after having recently recovered from a norovirus. The major source of contamination is leafy greens such as lettuce, fresh fruit and shell fish. The most important precautions against norovirus are hand-washing, laundering of contaminated clothing and blankets, and cooking shellfish to high temperatures.</p>
