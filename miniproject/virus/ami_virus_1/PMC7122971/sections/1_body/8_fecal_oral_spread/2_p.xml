<p>Another virus spread by this means, from diarrhea and vomiting, is rotavirus. This virus occurs predominantly in children, although there have been outbreaks in adults. It also occurs suddenly with an outbreak of fever, vomiting, and stomach cramps, and usually last a few days. At one time it was the leading cause of death of young children in the U.S. Since the advent of a vaccine in 2005, its seriousness has decreased. Prior to 2005, almost all children in the U.S. were infected with rotavirus before their fifth birthday. In the pre-vaccine period, rotavirus was responsible for more than 400,000 doctor visits; more than 200,000 emergency room visits; 55,000–70,000 hospitalizations; and 20–60 deaths in children younger than 5 years of age (CDC). Many other viruses, such as polio, are spread through the fecal-oral route and are discussed separately.</p>
