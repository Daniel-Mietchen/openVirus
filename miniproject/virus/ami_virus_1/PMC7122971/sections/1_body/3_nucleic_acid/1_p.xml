<p>Two types of nucleic acid exist in nature—DNA and RNA. In humans, as in all replicating organisms (
 <italic>archaea</italic>, 
 <italic>bacteria</italic> and 
 <italic>eukaryotes</italic>) the genes that make up the chromosomes are strands of DNA. Viruses contain either RNA or DNA as their genetic material. DNA in most organisms is a double-stranded structure, based on Watson and Crick pairing; however, in viruses, DNA and RNA can be either single-stranded or double-stranded. Since the viral genome is small, consisting in many cases of just a few genes—some of which code for enzymes involved in replication—there is a limited amount of genetic material.
