<p>The single virus is referred to as the “virion.” It consists of an outer shell (protein capsid, or membrane), the function of which is to protect the genetic information from physical, chemical, or enzymatic damage, and a nucleocapsid containing the genetic information and any required replicating enzymes. The outer surface of the virus is also responsible for recognition of and attachment to the host cell. Initially, this takes the form of binding of a virus-attachment protein to a cellular receptor molecule. One can imagine this as a key and lock mechanism. Once the virus attaches to the cell, it is engulfed through the cellular membrane and the viral coat removed in small cellular vesicles, releasing the viral nucleic acid into the cytoplasm for replication (Fig.
