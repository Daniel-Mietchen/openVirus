<p>The reason for the increase in epidemic dengue fever has been the lack of eradication of mosquitoes (
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>). With populations moving from the country to urban areas, there is now a large non-immune population available to the infected mosquitoes. There has been, over time, an increase in the use of plastic containers, which are breeding grounds for mosquito larvae. As has also been shown for yellow fever (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_10), the availability of old tires filled with rainwater is also a locale for breeding. Air travel has helped spread the mosquito from continent to continent and as a carrier of the disease.
