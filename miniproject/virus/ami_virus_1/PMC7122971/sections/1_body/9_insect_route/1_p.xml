<p>Dengue virus is a leading cause of illness and death in the tropics and subtropics. As many as 400 million people are infected annually by dengue virus, which is caused by any one of four related viruses transmitted by mosquitoes. There is no vaccine to prevent infection with dengue virus, and the most effective protective measure is to avoid mosquito bites. When infected, early recognition and prompt supportive treatment can substantially lower the risk of medical complications and death.</p>
