 <bold>West Nile Virus</bold> is among the most common mosquito-borne viruses in the U.S., and there is currently no vaccine for it. Only about 20 % of those bitten by virus-loaded mosquitoes develop fever, body aches, headache, and nausea. Another 1 % develop neurological problems that can be serious.
