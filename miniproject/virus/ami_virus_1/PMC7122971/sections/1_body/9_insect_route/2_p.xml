<p>An estimated 2.5 billion people live in over 100 endemic countries and areas where dengue viruses can be transmitted. Up to 50 million infections occur annually, with 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever and 22,000 deaths—mainly among children. Prior to 1970, only nine countries had experienced cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF); since then, the number has increased more than fourfold and continues to rise (see map in Fig.
