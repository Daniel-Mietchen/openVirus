<p>During the nineteenth century, dengue was considered a disease that sporadically caused epidemics at long intervals, a reflection of the slow pace of transport and limited travel at that time. Dengue has emerged as a worldwide problem since the 1950s, and in the last 50 years, the incidence has increased 30-fold.
