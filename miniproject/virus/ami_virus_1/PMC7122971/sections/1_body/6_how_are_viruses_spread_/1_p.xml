<p>In discussing the mode of viral transmission, one must consider the tissue or organ tropism of the virus. Viruses bind to receptor sites on the cells of specific tissue. It is the presence of these receptor sites that make an animal or cell susceptible to the virus. The virus contains unique proteins, occasionally as surface projectiles that interact specifically with the receptors. Thus some viruses, such as hepatitis virus, attack the liver and no other tissue. Other viruses, such as the common cold virus (rhinovirus), have adapted to cooler body temperatures and infect the lining of the nose, which is cooler than the rest of the body. Mutations in a receptor—or lack thereof—can lead to resistance to virus infection. Individuals lacking specific chemokine receptor sites, such as CXCR4 and CCR5, are resistant to HIV infection due to the inability of the virus to bind to cells lacking these receptors.</p>
