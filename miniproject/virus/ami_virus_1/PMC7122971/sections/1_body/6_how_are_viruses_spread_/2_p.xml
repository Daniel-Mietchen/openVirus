<p>Scientists divide the mode of virus spread into two categoriesâ€”direct contact and indirect contact. Direct contact includes blood-borne transmission, fecal-oral transmission, airborne spread by droplets or aerosol, contact with bedding, clothes, etc. (fomites), and vector (usually mosquitoes or other insects) [

Indirect contact spread includes cases where mucus from a runny nose may get onto the hands, or virus may be left on a surface such as a doorknob, telephone, or countertops, and is picked up by a second individual, who then touches his eyes or nose, resulting in infection. For example, cytomegalovirus (a virus of the herpes class) can be transmitted between children if one child drools on a toy and a second child picks it up and then put his hands in his mouth or eyes. Viruses can be transmitted in droplets; however. the area covered is not very large, usually only a few feet depending on the size of the droplets.
