<p>It was impossible to define a virus in terms of shape or physical characteristics until one could be seen; this had to await the development of the electron microscope. In 1931, two German scientists, Ernst Ruska and Max Knoll, invented the electron microscope (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2.2</xref>). This was a great improvement over the light microscope and allowed one to actually “see” viruses. One major disadvantage, however, is that the preparation for visualizing material by EM may distort the specimen because viable material cannot be used. The EM, as it became, uses electrons speeded up in a vacuum, aimed at the specimen, and gives an outline of the structure on an electron-sensitive photographic plate. Ernst Ruska later moved to the Siemens Company in Germany, where the first commercial electron microscope was developed. He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986.
