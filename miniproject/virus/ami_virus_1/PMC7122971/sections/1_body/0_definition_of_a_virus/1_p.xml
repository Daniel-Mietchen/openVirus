<p>Although viruses tend to be diverse in terms of the diseases they cause and the organs they attack, all viruses have a unity of structure and consist of proteins and nucleic acid. Some viruses are also encased in a lipid membranous envelope (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">2.1</xref>). Their mode of replication is not binary (one divides into two, two divide into four, etc.), as in most other organisms, but occurs as a burst of thousands of virus particles from a single virus over a short time. The number of viruses produced in cell culture or the blood is in the tens of millions per milliliter of media or blood. This mode of replication alone makes viruses unique. All other life forms contain DNA as genetic material and RNA as a message or intermediate for the formation of proteins or other structures. Viruses are also unique in that they contain either RNA or DNA as the genetic material. To date, no virus has been discovered that contains both types of nucleic acid as genetic material, although both types are used during virus replication in the cell. Viruses do not contain ribosomes, mitochondria or other cell-like organelles, and are thus completely parasitic. Since they cannot replicate without the metabolic processes of the host cell, they are genetic parasites. This differentiates viruses from bacteria or other single-cell microorganisms (e.g., protozoa), most of which can replicate in culture on their own, although they can also be parasitic. One other feature distinguishing viruses from other organisms in general is their small size and ability to pass through filters. This was certainly a major criterion in the early days of virology, although large viruses have recently been discovered. Viruses were not retained by filters made from diatomaceous earth (
