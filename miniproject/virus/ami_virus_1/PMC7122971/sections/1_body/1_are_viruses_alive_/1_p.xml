<p>Since the crystallization of viruses in 1935, there has been controversy as to whether viruses are alive or inanimate. The best analogy is to that of a seed. Is a bean seed alive? It has the properties of life under certain circumstances, but can be kept in an inert state for years. As soon as it is planted under appropriate conditions, it becomes “alive.” A virus differs in that it cannot reproduce unless it is in a host cell. Thus, one may think of the virus as the bean and the host cell as the soil. Viruses use the metabolism of the host cell, although there are large viruses, such as smallpox, that carry genes similar to those of the host cell, which code for metabolic enzymes, and some genes mimic those of the host cell and thus disrupt cellular metabolism by acting as decoys. These viral products are termed virokines. However, even such viruses cannot multiply on their own since they need cellular components for their replication and protein synthetic apparatus. Where did those mimicking genes come from? Were these genes derived from the host cell since they mimic host functions and interfere with these functions, or were they acquired by the host eons ago from the virus? (This is a controversial and open question). Thus the virus is at the edge of life, and can exist in two states—an inert state and a living state.</p>
