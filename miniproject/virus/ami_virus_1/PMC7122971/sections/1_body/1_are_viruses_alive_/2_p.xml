<p>In 2004, a large virus (Mimivirus) was discovered in a strain of amoeba, [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. It is considered and called a virus since it cannot replicate outside its host, and although it carries genes for many metabolic functions, it does not code for ribosomal genes, making it dependent on the host cell for protein synthesis. It is as large as many bacteria, but despite this, it seems to be another example of an entity at the boundary between living and inert forms. One has to consider a continuum from the inert chemical (organic chemical) to more complex ones with the ability to reproduce, which then gives life. The definition of life or living is an arbitrary one (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_4 on bacteriophage), and is defined in different ways by different scientists and philosophers. The discovery of the Mimivirus has given rise to the discussion as to whether this is an ancestor of other viruses or is the result of genes breaking away from the host and becoming independent. An electron micrograph of Mimivirus is shown in Fig.
