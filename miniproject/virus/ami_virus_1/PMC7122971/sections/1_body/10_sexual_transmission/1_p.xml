<p>A large number of viruses can be transmitted sexually. These include Herpes simplex 2, HIV, hepatitis B and papilloma viruses. The mode of transmission is the same in all these cases, and depends on the level of promiscuity, irrespective of whether the sex is heterosexual or homosexual. All can be prevented by the use of condoms or by limiting the number of partners. One of the major problems with the sexually transmitted disease is that in many cases the infected individual does not realize that he or she has the infection. Each of these viruses is discussed separately in later chapters.</p>
