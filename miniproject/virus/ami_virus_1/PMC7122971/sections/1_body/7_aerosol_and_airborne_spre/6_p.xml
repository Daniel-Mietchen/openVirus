<p>To avoid the spread of the virus, people should stay away from the sick and stay home if sick. It also is important to wash hands often with soap and water; if not available, use an alcohol-based hand rub. Linens, eating utensils, and dishes belonging to those who are sick should not be shared without thoroughly washing them. Eating utensils can be washed either in a dishwasher or by hand with soap and water, and do not need to be cleaned separately. Furthermore, frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected at home, at work and at school, especially if someone is ill (
