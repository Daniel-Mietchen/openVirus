<p>In studying the spread of respiratory viruses, scientists have concentrated on respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, and rhinoviruses, the three viruses most commonly found in homes, old age homes, institutions and schools. RSV is the most common respiratory infection in children worldwide. Attendance at daycare center ensures that a child will be infected with RSV during the first few years of life, and infection results in 0.05–1 % of children being hospitalized with bronchitis.</p>
