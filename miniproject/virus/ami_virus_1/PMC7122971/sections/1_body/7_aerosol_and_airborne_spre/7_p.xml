<p>Secondary infections with pneumonia often occur during an influenza epidemic. During a normal outbreak, influenza targets the elderly. There have been epidemics in which younger members of society are targeted, and the great pandemic of 1918 attacked mostly 20- to 30-year-olds. Experiments indicate that the influenza virus may remain active on various surfaces for a few days, depending on the type of surface. Influenza virus spread can be inhibited to some extent by the use of surgical masks.</p>
