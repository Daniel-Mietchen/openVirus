<p>In the last few weeks of spring 2009, pictures from around the world appeared in the press and on television of people wearing facemasks to prevent the spread of 
 <italic>influenza</italic> (H1N1). Influenza is predominantly spread by droplets that may travel as far as six feet and from surfaces contaminated from nasal secretions. Adults can spread the virus 1 day before becoming sick and up to 7 days after the infection begins. Children can spread the virus for a longer time.
