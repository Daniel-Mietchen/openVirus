<p>Although it would be expected that transmission of RSV would be by airborne particles, this does not appear to be the case. Transmission takes place by contact, both direct and indirect. In experiments designed by Hall et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] highly symptomatic infants who were producing abundant secretions were placed in cribs. Three categories of nurse volunteers were brought into the room. “Cuddlers” played with the infant, changed his or her diaper and performed other routine care. “Touchers” did not touch the baby but had extensive contact with the child’s environment, which had been heavily contaminated with secretions. “Sitters” sat next to the crib reading a book for 3 h but did not touch anything in the immediate environment. Five of the seven “cuddlers,” four of ten “touchers” and not one of 14 “sitters” developed RSV infection. Thus transmission did not appear to be airborne, since none of the nurses sitting beside the children was infected. The other nurses were infected either by direct contact with the child, or from secretions that were on the crib or other objects handled by the child. Children with RSV secrete large amounts of virus, which can be viable for up to 7 h on tabletops or other surfaces (Fig.
