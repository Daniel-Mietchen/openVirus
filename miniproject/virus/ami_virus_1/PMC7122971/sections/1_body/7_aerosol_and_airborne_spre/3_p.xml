<p>RSV is often spread in hospitals (nosocomial spread) through lack of thorough hand-washing after handling infected children. It is important that all surfaces be washed down with an effective antiviral compound after exposure to children with RSV. Detergents containing alcohol are effective in destroying RSV, and anyone in contact with this infection should wear gloves as a barrier to infection.</p>
