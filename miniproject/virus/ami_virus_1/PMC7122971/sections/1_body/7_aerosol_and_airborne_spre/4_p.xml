 <italic>Rhinoviruses</italic> follow a similar pattern. A 2007 study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] showed that sick people leave cold viruses on the things they touch, such as door handles, pens and light switches. Adults with naturally acquired rhinovirus colds have been found to contaminate 35 % of environmental surfaces in hotel rooms after overnight occupancy, using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) to detect viral RNA. In addition, viral RNA on surfaces (light switch, phone button, and telephone handset) could be transferred to fingertips during activities of daily life. Although RTPCR measures viral RNA contamination, parallel experiments testing for growth of virus in cell culture resulted in similar results. Virus could be found on these objects for as long as 18 h. There are, however, two conflicting sets of data on how rhinoviruses are spread, one maintaining that the virus is predominantly spread by indirect contact through nasal secretions, the other that the major mode of transmission is through aerosol. Studies at the University of Wisconsin have shown that when individuals with a cold are kept in the same room with uninfected individuals, the virus does spread by aerosol, but not as fast as expected. It may take hours of exposure for others to contract the cold. However, in these experiments, virus was not detectable on game chips, suggesting that in the case of contact infection, there is a need for large amounts of fresh secretion [
