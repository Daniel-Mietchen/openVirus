<p>Since viruses utilize the same protein repeatedly for their structure, they require very few genes. In order to replicate, they need genes to code for their coat protein and replication. Thus many viruses, such as poliovirus, may contain only enough nucleic acid for 5–6 genes. In some cases, the same nucleic acid codes for different proteins by starting “read-out” at various locations on the nucleic strand, or using both strands of DNA.</p>
