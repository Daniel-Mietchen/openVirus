<p>In some cases, viruses approach the shape of regular solids. In some of these viruses, 20 replicas of the same proteins make up the capsid. This can be a single protein, or three or many proteins, which interact spontaneously when in contact through template domains at their edges. The bonds between the capsid proteins are angled so that the complete structure acquires the form of a regular icosahedron.</p>
