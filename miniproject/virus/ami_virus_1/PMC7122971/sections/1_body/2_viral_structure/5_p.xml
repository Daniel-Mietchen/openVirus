<p>All mammalian living cells are covered by a membrane—the viability of the cell depends on the integrity of this membrane. Enveloped viruses leaving the cell must, therefore, allow this membrane to remain intact if the cell is to survive, or even if the cell eventually dies. This is achieved by the budding of the viral nucleo-capsid through the membrane, during which the virus becomes coated in a lipid envelope derived from the host cell membrane or modified membrane (see Fig.
