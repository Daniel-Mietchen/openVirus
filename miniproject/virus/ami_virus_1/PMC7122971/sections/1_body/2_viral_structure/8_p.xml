<p>In most cases, viruses undergo self-assembly. Apart from a few bacteriophages in which a scaffolding protein exists, viral proteins interact with each other or with the nucleic acid almost as if they have magnetic properties to spontaneously form a stable structure. The ability to undergo self-assembly is influenced by both pH (acidity or basic conditions) and salt concentrations. Poliovirus capsids will undergo self-assembly in the test tube from sub-viral particles. Classical experiments have shown that mixing RNA of Holmes’ ribgrass virus and the tobacco mosaic virus protein will give rise to a viable virus. The species propagated will depend on the source of the RNA, in this case, RNA from Holmes’ ribgrass virus [
