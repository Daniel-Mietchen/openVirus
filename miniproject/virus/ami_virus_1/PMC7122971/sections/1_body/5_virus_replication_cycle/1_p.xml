<p>At the molecular level, the infection of a single cell with a virus can result in the synthesis of thousands of virus particles. When a virus kills a cell in culture, it is referred to as a lytic infection and in the whole organism, such as a human as an acute infection. Examples of this type of infection are poliovirus, the common cold virus (
 <italic>rhinovirus</italic>), and smallpox. Such viruses either “kill” the host or are eventually controlled by the immune system and are thus self-limiting.
