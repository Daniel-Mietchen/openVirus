<p>The typical virus life cycle is as follows: The virus interacts with its target cell and introduces its nucleic acid into the cell. The interaction occurs through the binding of the virus to a unique receptor domain on the cell membrane (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">2.11</xref>). This receptor is a normal component of the cell and may have other functions. Virus proteins are made and modify the host cell metabolism so that host proteins are no longer made, or the host cell replication cycle is affected. All of this is to allow the virus to produce more of itself, thus diverting cell metabolism to virus production. The viral proteins are produced in one part of the cell, the replicated nucleic acid in another, and somehow they find each other, interact, and form virus particles that are expelled from the cell. These viruses then infect nearby cells. Immediately after infection in vivo, the body reacts by producing interferon and other immune enhancing molecules known as cytokines, which are the first line of defense against the virus; this response is called “innate immunity.” Adaptive immunity, the production of antibodies for a specific virus, will not occur until much later (10–21 days). Symptoms usually occur a few days after infection, although during this asymptomatic period a person may be infectious. This is particularly true in the case of viruses such as HIV, where obvious symptoms may not occur for quite some time (The role of the immune response is discussed in detail in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-07758-1_6).
