<p>Other viruses can integrate into the host genome, resulting in cell transformation or tumor formation. Such viruses interfere with the cell cycle and cell replication. Cervical cancer is caused by a papilloma virus, which alters the cell cycle to its advantage. HIV integrates into the human chromosome, making it impossible to eradicate completely. Other viruses, such as the herpes viruses, establish a long-lasting infection, but they also have an acute phase, the formation of cold sores in or near the mouth, or genital lesions, and a latent stage in which the virus “hides” in neurons, either in the soma or in axons. Chickenpox, also a herpes-like virus, can remain dormant for years, and then erupt as shingles, usually when the immune system is compromised, for example during cancer chemotherapy, or during AIDS infection.</p>
