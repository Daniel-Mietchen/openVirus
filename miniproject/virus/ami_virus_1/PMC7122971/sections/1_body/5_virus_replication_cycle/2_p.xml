<p>Some viruses persist for a long period of time, giving rise to chronic infections. We do not know why this happens, since in many cases the components of the immune system appear to be functioning normally. It is possible that the virus has the ability to “dampen” the activity of the immune system or the first lines of defense against infection, such as interferon. This seems to be the case with a virus such as hepatitis C, which is able to knock out the interferon system (at least in cultured cells) and possibly also interfere with immune cell activity in vivo, thus allowing for the persistence of the virus.</p>
