<p>The common names of viruses are associated in many cases with the place the virus was first isolated (e.g., Ebola is the location in the Congo where the disease was first recognized); the organ from which the virus is isolated (e.g., adenovirus from the adenoids); the symptoms of the virus (pox virus, yellow fever); or, finally, with the names of the persons isolating and identifying the virus (e.g., Epstein-Barr). Using the symptoms caused by a virus can lead to confusion. There are many viruses that cause what we generally call hepatitis. For example, the 
 <italic>picornavirus</italic> hepatitis A causes common jaundice, a self-limiting disease; hepatitis B causes serum hepatitis associated with blood transfusions; and hepatitis C, a 
 <italic>flaviviru</italic>s, transmitted in blood and blood products, eventually causing liver cirrhosis and liver cancer.
