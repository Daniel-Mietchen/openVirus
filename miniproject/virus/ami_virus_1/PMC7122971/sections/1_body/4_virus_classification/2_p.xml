<p>Many attempts have been made to classify viruses, following the classical scheme of Linnaeus, the eminent Swedish botanist. However, since viruses are quite invisible, and we know them from either the diseases they cause or from their shape in electron micrographs, it has been very difficult to relate them to each other. Newer methods of classification depend on the molecular structure of the virus, type of nucleic acid, and mode of replication. More accurate methods in DNA and RNA sequencing allow for virus classification based on sequence homology. The relationship between and among viruses is constantly being revised, based on sequence data.</p>
