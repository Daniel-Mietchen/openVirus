<p>A common childhood disease which is often unrecognized, parvovirus infection causes an influenza-like illness which can be associated with a rash known as erythema infectiosum (fifth disease). Ultrastructurally, the viral agent, a member of the family Parvoviridae, is a small single-stranded DNA virus that uniquely infects human erythroid progenitor cells. The clinical presentations may vary from irritative (upper respiratory infections and rashes) to severe (diffuse alveolar damage with ARDS, arthropathy, cardiomyopathy, fulminant hepatitis, hydrops fetalis, and aplastic crisis). A definitive diagnosis can be made with detection of IgM by serology and specific PVB19 DNA PCR. A previous infection results in lifelong immunity unless the patient is immunocompromised.</p>
