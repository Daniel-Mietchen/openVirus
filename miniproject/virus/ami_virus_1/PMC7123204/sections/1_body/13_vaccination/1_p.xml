<p>Effective vaccines are available for animal strains of PV, but currently, there is no approved vaccine available for humans. There is progress for their development and use in young children. Technology to express viral proteins VP1 and VP2, derived from a copy of the parvovirus B-19 genome (strain Au) obtained from a child with sickle cell disease and transient aplastic crisis, was developed at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Individual viral proteins were expressed in a baculovirus system and, when recombinant vectors are cotransfected into insect cells, VP1 and VP2 spontaneously assemble into empty viral-like particles. The vaccine consists of two viral proteins (VP1 and VP2) in separate baculovirus vectors that are coinfected at the correct multiplicity of infections (MOIs) into Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) cells and that, upon expression, self-assemble into immunogenic viruslike particles. Phase 1 trials have been completed, but mass production is needed for testing (Bernstein et al.
