<p>The most recognized serious disease associated with PVB19 is aplastic crisis which may be life threatening. In patients with increased red blood cell (RBC) turnover from other disorders such as (sickle cell disease, hereditary spherocytosis), PV infection can result in an abrupt cessation of RBC production due to infection of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. This may result in severe anemia with congestive heart failure or stroke. Patients may also develop pancytopenia with thrombocytopenia. With clearance of the virus, the crisis will abate.
