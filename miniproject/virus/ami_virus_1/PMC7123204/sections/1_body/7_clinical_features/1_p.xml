<p>A relatively small percent of patients (25 %) may be infected but remain totally asymptomatic. However, asymptomatic patients are still capable of spreading the disease. In about 75 % of non-immunocompromised patients that exhibit symptoms, there are symptoms of an upper respiratory infection or flu-like illness with fever, runny nose, nausea, and headache (Mandel

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2004</xref>). After several days, the rash may spread and may then appear on the chest, back, buttocks, and extremities. On the soles of the feet, the rash may be especially pruritic (Sharad and Kapur 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2005</xref>). The rash clears in a week or two, and when it begins to resolve, it may appear “lacy” in appearance. The rash may be very “fleeting” (&lt;24 h), but recurrences may be induced by exposure to sunlight, heat, emotion, or strenuous exercise. Older infected children may also have lymphadenopathy and an atypical rash (Broliden et al.
