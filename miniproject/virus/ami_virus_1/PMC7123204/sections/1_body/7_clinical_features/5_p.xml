<p>In rare cases of PV-related fulminant pulmonary failure, patients may present with a sudden onset of respiratory distress (Ferraz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). Bronchoscopy may only reveal mild mucosal erythema with mild increase in secretions. Diffuse bilateral parenchymal opacities with or without effusions can be seen on chest radiography (Berjaoui et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2006</xref>). Other PV symptoms may or may not be seen including rash, arthropathy, and transient anemia symptoms. In patients receiving stem cell transplant, PV B19 pneumonia may be misdiagnosed as another viral or opportunistic infection, and serology screening is imperative in order to avoid missing acute infection.
