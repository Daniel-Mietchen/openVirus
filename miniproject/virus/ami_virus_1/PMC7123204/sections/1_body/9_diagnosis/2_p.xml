<p>In acute lung involvement, the diagnosis may be easily missed and misinterpreted as vasculitis or an autoimmune disease or another etiology. Suspicion is needed to determine if PV is the cause of the respiratory failure using serology and DNA evidence of PV infection. This may be difficult because IgM may be persistent from a previous self-limited infection and PV DNA can persist for months. PV is a very prevalent disease in the general population and has been demonstrated in several types of lung damage patterns thought to possibly be related to the ANCA-positive vasculitic syndromes associated with PV. PV has also been reported in idiopathic interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and may be related to capillary damage. PV has a known affinity for capillary endothelium (Magro et al.
