<p>Treatment is symptomatic in most cases. Other treatments related to the varied clinical symptoms may include blood transfusions for aplastic crisis or intrauterine infections. Intravenous immunoglobulin may be used in immunocompromised patients or in placental exchanges of infected pregnant women with fetal distress (Kurtzman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1989</xref>; Mouthon et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2005</xref>). Antiretroviral therapies are important in HIV patients to prevent aplastic crisis. In patients with lung involvement, early recognition is needed for provided pulmonary support, antiviral therapies, and antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infections which may result in sepsis and demise. Despite these measures, the disease may be fatal, especially if the patient is immunocompromised.
