<p>PVB19 can be misdiagnosed as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). In an initial presentation of a patient, the symptoms of PVB19 may overlap greatly with SLE. Both PVB19 and SLE patients may have cytopenia, anti-DNA antibodies, antinuclear antibodies (ANA), and hypocomplementemia. However, patients with PVB19 will have symptom resolution in several weeks. There may be an increase of infections with PVB19 in patients with known SLE due to intrinsic immunosuppression or immunosuppressive therapies, with lower levels of circulating PV IgM and IgG (Bengtsson et al.

The differential diagnosis includes many entities which may cause acute respiratory distress syndrome. The transient or rapid anemia with or without skin rash can help in recognizing the infection. Because PV can create an environment with lower resistance to other opportunistic pathogens, a concurrent fungal or bacterial pneumonia may overshadow the effects of PV B19.
