<p>Infection by PV occurs worldwide with similar infectivity rates in the USA, Europe, and Asia (Norja et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2008</xref>). By age of 15 years, over 50 % of adolescents have antibodies from previous childhood infection (Young and Brown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2004</xref>). The number of people infected over adulthood increases so that the majority of elderly individuals are seropositive (Kerr 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1996</xref>). Studies of fifth disease outbreaks in the UK have shown that many children, and adults had evidence of PV antibodies but not the symptoms of the disease (Anderson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1983</xref>). In temperate climates, infections peak in late winter or early spring with sporadic small epidemics (Cohen and Buckley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1988</xref>). PV B19 spreads through respiratory droplets and is highly contagious (Anderson et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1985</xref>). Household transmission is &gt;50 % and 20â€“30 % for teachers and day-care providers. As it lacks a lipid envelope and has high genomic stability, the PV is difficult to kill and is resistant to heat and solvent detergents (Kaufmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2004</xref>). PV infection has been reported as a nosocomial infection with transmission via blood products (especially pooled factors VIII and IX) and in health-care workers from patients and contaminated specimens (Kooistra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2011</xref>) (Seng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1994</xref>) (Siegl and Cassinotti 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">1998</xref>). PV is transmitted vertically from infected mothers to fetuses with a 30 % risk of transplacental transmission. PVB19 is the predominant pathogen and is the prototype strain for genotype 1 (Failey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1995</xref>; Jordan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2001</xref>). Less common, recently discovered erythroviruses (genotypes 2 and 3) are increasing and spreading. Genotypes 1 and 2 are typically present in Western countries (the USA and Europe) and genotype 3 in sub-Saharan Africa and South America (Freitas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2008</xref>).
