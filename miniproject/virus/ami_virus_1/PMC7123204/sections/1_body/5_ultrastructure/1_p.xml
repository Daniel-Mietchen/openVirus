<p>Parvovirus B19 is a 26 nm, non-enveloped 5.6 kb single-stranded DNA virus. The capsid consists of two structural proteins (VP1 and VP2) which arise from alternative splicing, therefore VP1 and VP 2 are similar except VP2 contains an additional 226 amino acids. In addition, PV has one nonstructural protein (NSI). Importantly PV has P blood group antigen cellular receptor (globoside) (Heegaard and Brown
