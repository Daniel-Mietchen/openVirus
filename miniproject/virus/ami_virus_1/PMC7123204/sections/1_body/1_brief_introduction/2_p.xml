<p>Parvovirus infection is more common in children than adults. About 20 % of those infected will be asymptomatic and 50 % will experience nonspecific flu-like symptoms. PV can cause serious illnesses including pneumonia with diffuse alveolar damage resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome, major joint arthritis, life-threatening transient aplastic crisis especially in patients with underlying sickle cell disease, and hemolytic disease such as chronic red cell aplasia in immunocompromised patients (Smith-Whitley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2004</xref>). It may also cause early fetal death or hydrops fetalis and unrecognized viral myocarditis (Young and Brown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2004</xref>). Lung involvement is uncommon but has been reported to occur in children with fatal multiorgan failure (Ferraz 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>). Pleuropneumonitis due to PV can be seen in immunocompromised adults with heart-lung transplants (Janner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">1994</xref>; Castagna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2011</xref>) but may also be seen in sporadic non-immunocompromised patients (Wardeh and Marik 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">1998</xref>; Morris and Smilack 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1998</xref>). The multiplicity of clinical presentations of the infection can masquerade as other disorders, in all ages resulting in misdiagnosis and possible overtreatment.
