<p>Skin lesions when biopsied to exclude other diseases usually have a nonspecific histologic picture (Katta 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2002</xref>). There may be interstitial histiocytic infiltrates with piecemeal fragmentation of collagen and a mononuclear cell-predominant vascular injury pattern. Other features include an interface dermatitis, eczematous alterations, and papillary dermal edema (Bonvivini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2010</xref>). The pathology of cutaneous B19 infection suggests tissue injury mediated by delayed-type hypersensitivity, by antibody-dependent cellular immunity directed at microbial antigenic targets in the epidermis and endothelium, and by circulating immune complexes in the setting of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (Magro et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2000</xref>). In patients with transient aplastic crisis, the bone marrow will have erythroid hypoplasia and occasional giant erythroblasts and may rarely have proerythoid cells with intranuclear viral inclusions (Crook et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2000</xref>). In infected fetuses, there are many erythroid precursor cells with eosinophilic inclusions which compress the nuclear chromatin against the nuclear membrane in the placenta and fetal tissues (Morey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1992</xref>).
