<p>Parvovirus is demonstratable in the bloodstream some 7–10 days after exposure and persists for approximately 5 days with viral loads exceeding 10
 <sup>12</sup> particles/ml of blood. Parvovirus B19-specific IgM antibodies are at a detectable range within 10–12 days and persist for about 3–5 months. IgG antibodies are seen 15 days postinfection and can persist for long periods. Usually, the patient will have lifelong immunity (De Haan et al.
