<p id="Par3">Close contact with 2019-nCoV-infected patients is the main transmission route in children. Although the number of reported pediatric patients is limited, we should attach importance to prevention, diagnosis and treatment in children. People of all ages are susceptible to 2019-nCoV infection; children have special respiratory tract structure characteristics, immature immune system and susceptibility to respiratory virus infections. Considering these characteristics, and with further wide-use of pathogen tests, the number of pediatric patients will increase. Based on the collected data, infected children have relatively milder clinical symptomsthan infected adults; and no deaths have been reported in pediatric patients.</p>
