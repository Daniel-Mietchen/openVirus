 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] have also revealed that IFN-α atomization can reduce the viral load, alleviate symptoms and shorten disease duration in treating viral infections including bronchiolitis, viral pneumonia, acute upper respiratory tract infection and hand, foot and mouth disease. Our team also found that topical use of recombinant human IFN-α2b spray in the mouth and nose can alleviate symptoms and shorten disease course of upper respiratory tract infections in children [
