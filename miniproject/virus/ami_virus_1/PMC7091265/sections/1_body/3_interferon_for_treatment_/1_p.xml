<p id="Par7">Interferon (IFN) is a group of low-molecular glycoproteins with similar structure and function, which is produced by host cells through antiviral response when the body is infected by virus. IFN is the first-line innate immune defense of the body against viral infection. Based on different gene and protein structures, IFN is divided into IFN-α, IFN-β, and so on. Interferon mainly plays antiviral effects through two ways: (1) inducing production of antiviral effector proteins, thereby inhibiting viral replication in the cells to protect normal cells from viral invasion; (2) activating cellular immunity by promoting proliferation and activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), activating natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages to clear the virus. The body’s endogenous IFN deficiency or insufficiency may lead to reduced antiviral activity. Children are susceptible to viral infections because of their immature immune function and relatively low levels of specific humoral and cellular immunity and IFN secretion.</p>
