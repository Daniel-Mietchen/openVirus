<p id="Par48">Preferably, only aqueous, loose faeces samples if not epidemiological examination. Faeces from patients in the acute phase and preferably within the first 3 days (up to 7 days) after the disease starts. Take samples from all cases during the primary outbreak, including personnel with symptoms. If the outbreak continues, sampling is unnecessary if the virus is already detected. 5–10 g faeces (a spoon) is sampled in a sterile test tube and sent immediately or stored in a refrigerator until sent to the laboratory (no more than 2 days).</p>
