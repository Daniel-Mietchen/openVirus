<p id="par0160">Reinforcing this, in addition to its well-established surveillance system which facilitates viral detection and characterization, there are multiple factors that predispose Taiwan to rubella importations. Past serological studies show that seronegativity is higher among immigrant women (

In 2014, 9.9 and 11.8 million people, respectively, travelled in to and out of the country and an estimated 84–88% of these travelers either visited or visited from countries in E/SE Asia (
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">Shih et al., 2016</xref>). While these patterns are unlikely to outweigh high vaccination coverage and result in Taiwan contributing importantly to regional dynamics, such high rates of immigration and international travel, coupled with its strong geopolitical ties to China, a clear source of rubella infection, makes Taiwan an ideal sentinel for the identification of new lineages in the region.
