<p id="par0050">In this study, we aimed to assess the importance of metapopulation dynamics to rubella persistence in E/SE Asia. We used publicly available genetic sequences to map pathways of regional spread from 2000 to 2016 and identify countries that act as sources and sinks of viral diffusion. We compared the dynamics of the two most commonly sampled genotypes in Asia, 1E and 2B (

Our results suggest that there are identifiable sources and sinks for rubella, but that the directionality of spatial spread may be primarily governed by stochasticity and founder effects. We additionally estimated country-specific susceptibility profiles to link temporal trends in rubella incidence and susceptible population size with the timing of viral importation and exportation events. Finally, we discuss limitations arising from analyzing spatially and/or temporally biased samples, a common challenge with studies of this scope.
