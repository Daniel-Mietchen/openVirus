<p id="par0075">To identify predictors of viral spread within Asia, we selected one representative dataset for each genotype (sample 1; supplementary Table 2, supplementary Figs. 2â€“3), removed sequences collected outside E/SE Asia and used a phylogenetic generalized linear model (GLM) as implemented in BEAST v1.8.4 (
 <xref rid="bib0130" ref-type="bibr">Lemey et al., 2014</xref>). The phylogenetic GLM assesses support for various ecological and sampling factors predicted to influence epidemic diffusion patterns across the phylogeny. We selected 16 different variables encompassing geographic, ecological, demographic, environmental and epidemiological differences between countries to include in the model (see supplementary material). To determine whether the set of variables driving diffusion over the entire 16-year period differed from that responsible for viral spread during the most recent epidemics, we performed the analysis on the dataset of sequences from E/SE Asia collected from 2000 to 2016, as well as the subset of these sequences collected during the height of the regional epidemics, which, according to our dataset, occurred from 2011 to 2015.
