<p id="par0100">Phylogeographic analysis of the circulation patterns of genotype 1E reinforce the importance of China and Taiwan. Within the region, Bayes factors (BF) indicate decisive support (BF &gt; 100) for movement of the virus from China to Japan and Taiwan, and from Taiwan to Malaysia (

 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c). Numerous imports and exports in and out of Taiwan are tied to the country’s significant connections to both East and Southeast Asia (supplementary Fig. 13). Additional analyses of datasets containing only sequences collected from recent cases in Taiwan (occurring from 2010 to 2015) confirmed that older sequences from Taiwan were not biasing the ancestral state characterization (see supplementary information). In contrast, there was no support for viral migration out of Japan, where importations far exceeded expected exportations (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>c, supplementary Fig. 11). Of the 16 predictors tested in the phylogenetic GLM, there was weak support for geographic distance metrics and destination country sample size having an effect on viral diffusion when examining the entire time period (supplementary Fig. 6). However, none of our selected predictors were significant when considering only sequences collected during the recent epidemics from 2011 to 2015 (supplementary Fig. 7).
