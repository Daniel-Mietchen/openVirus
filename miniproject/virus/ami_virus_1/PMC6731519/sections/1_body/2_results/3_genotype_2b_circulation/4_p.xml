<p id="par0115">Phylogeographic analysis of the circulation patterns of genotype 2B again suggests an important regional role for Taiwan (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b, supplementary Fig. 13). We find decisive support (BF &gt; 100) for movement from Taiwan to both China and Southeast Asia. Additional analyses of datasets containing only sequences from recent cases in Taiwan (occurring from 2010 to 2015) show that exportations from Taiwan scale with the number of recent sequences included in the analysis, suggesting high genetic diversity among recently sampled Taiwan sequences rather than a collection of highly homogenous sequences sampled from a few related outbreaks (see supplementary material). Bidirectional exchange between China and Japan is also strongly supported (BF &gt; 10) although few movements between these countries occurred. Again, far more importations than exportations are observed for Japan (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>d, supplementary Fig. 11), and significant movement from Thailand to Japan is apparent (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>b, supplementary Fig. 14). Viral exchange between India and countries outside of Asia is strongly supported (BF &gt; 100), though we find no significant connections between India and E/SE Asia, suggesting that India does not play a role in the E/SE Asia metapopulation. None of the 16 predictors included in the phylogenetic GLM were significantly correlated with viral diffusion when considering the entire period from 2000 to 2016 (supplementary Fig. 8). When considering only sequences collected during the recent epidemics from 2011 to 2015, geographic distance and destination country sample size were marginally significant (supplementary Fig. 9).
