<p id="par0130">Rubella importation can only be successful if sufficient susceptible individuals are present. The timing of viral importation events into each country appear to precede epidemic peaks (supplementary Fig. 4) and tend to occur during local peaks in susceptible population size (supplementary Fig. 5). For example, imports of genotype 2B into China are observed around 2006 and 2009, the times during which susceptible population size peaked just prior to each major outbreak. As the epidemiological data suggests that the susceptible population size in China falls after 2005 (supplementary Fig. 1c), we might expect that there are fewer opportunities for the introduction of new strains. However, if erratic local dynamics cause extinctions in areas where not enough susceptibles are present, susceptibles throughout China will eventually accumulate enough to allow new introductions. In support, the phylogeny suggests that introductions continued to happen in China across the time course of this study. Further, the small spike in introductions to China in 2009 coincides with an accumulation of susceptibles following the epidemic in 2008 even though the overall proportion susceptible is consistently decreasing (supplementary Fig. 5). As only 1â€“2 epidemics occurred during the time period of study in each of the focal countries, we were unable to statistically test this observation, but in the context of the previously described phylogenetic patterns it is suggestive of the importance of metapopulation processes in the epidemic dynamics of rubella in this region.</p>
