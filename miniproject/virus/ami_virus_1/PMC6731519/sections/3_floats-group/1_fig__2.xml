  <p>Circulation patterns of rubella virus in Asia. Circulation maps of a) genotype 1E and b) genotype 2B. “Other” represents sequences collected from outside of Asia. Connections between countries are represented by lines colored by their Bayes factor (BF). Dark red (BF &gt; 100) indicates decisive support for the connection, red indicates very strong support (100 &gt; BF &gt; 30), orange indicates strong support (30 &gt; BF &gt; 10). Connections with weak support (10 &gt; BF &gt; 3) are not mapped. Total estimated number of viral importations and exportations per country for c) genotype 1E and d) genotype 2B. Locations identified as being outside the metapopulation circulation network (i.e. no significant connections to the countries of E/SE Asia) are shaded in grey in panels c and d (For interpretation of the references to coloured in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article).</p>
