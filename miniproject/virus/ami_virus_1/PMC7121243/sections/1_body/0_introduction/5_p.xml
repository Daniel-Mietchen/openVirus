<p id="Par6">However, as we discuss later, these alignment-free graphical representation methods are not without their problems either. One of these is related to computation of the sequence descriptors. In geometric approaches (Raychaudhury and Nandy

In some instances, defining a suitable matrix to characterise and an invariant to associate with a gene sequence presents some difficulties (Qi et al.
