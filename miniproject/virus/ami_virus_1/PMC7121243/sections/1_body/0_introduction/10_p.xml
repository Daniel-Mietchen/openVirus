<p id="Par11">In a slightly different application area, we refer in some detail to the applications of graphical representations and numerical characterisation schemes to viral genetics, focusing our attention more on the influenza virus in view of the several pandemics that it has caused, but we do mention in passing other viral pandemics also. It will be seen that some of the issues related to vaccine design and drug discovery are more easily and readily approached using graphical techniques, and these approaches with their visual representations also give fresh insights into base distribution and composition characteristics. These have led to determination of vaccine targets in the virions, tracking viral progress across geographical and time boundaries, computation of phylogenetic relationships and possible regulation of base composition and distribution in DNA/RNA sequences. Brief discussions of these applications and methods of surveillance of viral developments and progress are covered in another section of this chapter.</p>
