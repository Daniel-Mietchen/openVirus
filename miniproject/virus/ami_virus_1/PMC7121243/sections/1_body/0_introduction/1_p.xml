<p id="Par2">Since the availability of large nucleic acid sequence data in the late 1980s, followed by the subsequent exponential growth of such data in the databases, the need for supportive tools to store, view, retrieve and analyse such sequences became and continues to be of urgent necessity. These tasks require methods to characterise the information contained in these sequences with a view to compare and contrast different sequences to determine their functions and place in the biological domain. The symbolic DNA sequence representation has been the legacy mainstay of such analyses carried over from the oligonucleotide sequence days, falling far short of the requirements of the broad sweeping overview of local and global base distributions, multiple sequence similarities and dissimilarities, molecular evolution and other studies necessary for an overarching assessment of the relationship of any DNA/RNA sequence to the biome through the accumulated data in the nucleic acid databases.</p>
