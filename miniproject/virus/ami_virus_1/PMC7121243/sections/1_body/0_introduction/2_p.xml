<p id="Par3">Sequence alignment has been the primary tool of choice for such comparison of generic sequences. However, in the conventional methods, the time complexity of sequence alignment varies as ~

In the realm of genomic sequences, this clearly consumes an enormous amount of computation time, which grows even worse when multiple alignments are necessary. The reason behind such sequence alignment is the fact that mutational changes in nucleic acid sequences through individual nucleotide mutations and rearrangements in nucleotide distributions brought on by various biological processes are reflected in the DNA/RNA sequences we observe today. This constitutes one of the main considerations facing biologists trying to understand the variations between different sequences of the same genera and their evolution (Qi et al.
