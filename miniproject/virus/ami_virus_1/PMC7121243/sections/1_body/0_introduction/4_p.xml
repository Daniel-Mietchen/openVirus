<p id="Par5">A more general approach that permits local and global sequence comparisons, generation of phylogenetic trees, numerical characterisations of DNA/RNA/protein sequences, quantitative estimation of sequence divergences and other properties and rational design of peptide vaccines is offered by novel, alignment-free schemes of graphical representation and numerical characterisation of biomolecular sequences (see review Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2006</xref>). The basic procedure in all these methods is to identify a vector with each type of nucleotide and plot each vector successively until the end of the sequence, thus drawing out a trajectory in the space of the model; associating a numerical value with the curve results in a descriptor of the sequence. This allows for quantitative comparisons between sequences and forms a powerful tool for analysis of similarities and dissimilarities between genes on a local and global scale. These novel approaches dispense with the need for alignments, which, for large sequences, become less reliable due to divergence of species and subsequent rearrangements (e.g. reversal, transposition or block exchange) occurring over evolutionary time scales; corrections introduced to take care of these divergences depend upon significant homologies between the sequences and the genes to be compared and thus become restrictive (Qi et al.
