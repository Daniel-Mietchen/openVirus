<p id="Par4">Numerical characterisation of the DNA/RNA sequences is one of the main tools in undertaking this task, and a number of methods were developed to analyse specific attributes of DNA sequences. For example, the dot plot (Gibbs and McIntyre 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">1970</xref>) is used to visualise identical sequence segments between two proteins by the diagonal runs in a matrix of the constituents of the two sequences. Needleman and Wunsch (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">1970</xref>) used dynamic programming techniques to align protein or nucleotide sequences; another dynamic programming scheme was later proposed by Smith and Waterman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">1981</xref>) (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">1985</xref>), for improved scoring local sequence alignment, but the computational complexity and time requirements have limited its use. For protein secondary structure prediction, Chou and Fasman (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">1974a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">b</xref>) developed an empirical technique, which, however, has been superseded by new machine learning techniques. In particular, dynamic programming techniques that analyse DNA sequences in terms of discrete small segments to eventually merge into the full sequence require time commitments of

 <italic>)</italic>, where 
 <italic>k</italic> is the number of sequences to be aligned and is expensive in the use of computing resources, whereas fast Fourier transform (FFT) requiring resource time of 
 <italic>~O(l log l)</italic> is only slightly better (Hanson, thesis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2003</xref>). Multiple alignment fast Fourier transform (MAFFT) with a simplified scoring system to reduce the computational overhead (Katoh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2002</xref>), discrete Fourier transforms (Yin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR130">2014</xref>) and wavelet transforms (Dodin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2000</xref>) that displays regularity in patterns in DNA sequences have been some of the other methods deployed to extraction of information of interest from the DNA databanks. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) is one of the most popular search tools for local alignments; it uses a heuristic algorithm that takes shortcuts to identify, very rapidly, sequences in a library that most closely resemble the query sequence (Altschul et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1990</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1997</xref>).
