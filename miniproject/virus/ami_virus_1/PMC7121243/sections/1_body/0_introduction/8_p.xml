<p id="Par9">In a number of interesting applications of the original 2D graphical representation of DNA/RNA sequences, one of the current authors of this chapter showed that introns and exons of mammalian genes differed significantly in base distribution characteristics (Nandy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1996a</xref>), that these properties can be used to determine coding regions in newly identified DNA sequences (Nandy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1996b</xref>) and that mutational changes in genetic sequences are guided by some restrictions which indicate an intricate relationship between intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine content of the sequences (Nandy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2009</xref>), among others.
