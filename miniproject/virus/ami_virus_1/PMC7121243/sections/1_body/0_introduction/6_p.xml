<p id="Par7">In this chapter, we present a concise summary of a selection of graphical representation methods to demonstrate the basics of this class of approaches of numerically characterising a biomolecular sequence. There have been a very large number of methodologies proposed to quantitatively estimate the differences between selected groups of genes and genomic sequences (see review Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2006</xref>). Extensions of these approaches have been made to take into account protein sequences (see review Randic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2011</xref>) where the problem is compounded by the fact that the basic building blocks in protein sequences are constituted by 20 amino acids (Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2009</xref>) in comparison to nucleotide sequences where the basic building blocks constitute four bases; in terms of the methodologies, we consider a few in a short section and refer the readers to the original papers for greater details.
