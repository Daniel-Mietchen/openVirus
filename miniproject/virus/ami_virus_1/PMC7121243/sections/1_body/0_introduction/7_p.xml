<p id="Par8">These graphical representation methods are found ready for acceptance in research. The visual representation of base distribution in DNA sequences was used by Larionov et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2008</xref>) to compare the chromosomal DNAs of human and mouse to find several examples of palindromic runs in almost the same manner in the two species. Wiesner and Wiesnerova (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2010</xref>), in an innovative application of 2D graphical techniques to multiallelic marker loci from 
 <italic>Begonia</italic> x 
 <italic>tuberhybrida</italic> Voss, suggested that the DNA walks could be correlated with genetic diversity to predict new allele-rich loci and improve new DNA germplasm identificators. Applications of the graphical representation and numerical characterisation techniques were made by Liao and his group (Liao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2005</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2006</xref>) to analyse the genomic sequences of the viruses in SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic of 2003 and generate their phylogenetic relationship tree. Humberto Gonzalez-Diaz and his group applied the underlying concepts in an analysis of protein sequences for drug discovery research through numerical parameters analogously to quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) topological indices (Estrada and Uriarte
