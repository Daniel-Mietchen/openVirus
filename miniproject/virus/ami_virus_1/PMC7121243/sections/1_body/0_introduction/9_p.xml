<p id="Par10">A number of applications have been made over the years of some of these graphical representation and numerical characterisation methods, molecular sequence similarity/dissimilarity and phylogenetic relationships being among the ones with the most abiding interest. For example, Randic et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2000a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">b</xref>) and Liao and Ding (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2006</xref>) used a novel 3D graphical representation model to examine the base distributions in the first exons of beta-globin genes of 11 species giving results that matched closely with those obtained by other graphical representation methods. In another approach, Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">2010</xref>) used a spectral representation of DNA sequences defining a 24-component vector as sequence descriptor and illustrated their method using complete beta-globin sequences of seven species. Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2016</xref>) introduced a novel method of considering dinucleotides in a 3D graphical representation model and obtained phylogenetic trees of 4 datasets: the coding sequences of the beta-globin genes of 18 species, the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) genes of 9 butterflies, the S segments of 32 hantaviruses (HVs) and 70 complete mitochondrial genomes, all of which gave evolutionary relationships that matched with standard data.
