<p id="Par101">Surveillance of infectious viral diseases necessitates the analysis of antigenic constitutions of human-infecting viruses, as well as of viruses that belong to the same group which have not yet escaped their respective sylvatic cycles, in order to ascertain whether the molecular modifications have significantly altered known antigenic characteristics (Ghendon 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">1991</xref>). Some of the methods employed in viral discovery and analysis include tissue culture studies, immunohistochemical assays, singleplex and multiplex assays, serology and high-throughput sequencing (Lipkin and Firth 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2013</xref>). One of the primary applications of disease surveillance and analysis is in the development of drugs and vaccines. The antigenic differences in the existing vaccine and the viral strains in circulation call for the synthesis of appropriate vaccine compositions to establish renewed immunity in the host population against epidemic- and pandemic-causing viruses (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2004</xref>). For surveillance of influenza, the Influenza Division at CDC collects specimens from over one million patients USA-wide which then follows a protocol for testing of the patient samples in various laboratories, followed by gene sequencing on approximately 6000 influenza viruses annually. Out of the pool of 6000 viruses, antigenic compositions are analysed in 2000 of them. The hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay is used to identify the subtype of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of a new influenza isolate on the basis of inhibition of hemagglutination by subtype-specific antibodies (Pedersen
