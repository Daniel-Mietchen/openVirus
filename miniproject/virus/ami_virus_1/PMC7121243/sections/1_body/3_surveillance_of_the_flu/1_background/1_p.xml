<p id="Par100">With the high rate of mutations in influenza genome along with the high frequency and intensity of influenza epidemics and pandemics recurring every few years, surveillance of influenza genomic variations is an important issue for monitoring its changes and designing drugs and vaccines. Using influenza, hepatitis, poliomyelitis and malaria as examples, Alexander Langmuir expounded disease surveillance as the constant vigilance over the patterns and spread of disease occurrence via accumulation, integration, assessment and interpretation of data on morbidity and mortality along with other parameters and relevant information (Langmuir
