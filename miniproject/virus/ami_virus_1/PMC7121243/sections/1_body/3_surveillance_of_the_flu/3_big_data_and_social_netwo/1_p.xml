<p id="Par108">Dr. Tarun Weeramanthri introduced the term precision public health (Severi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2014</xref>) and is now defined as the usage of computational and technological progress and big data to improve disease surveillance (Dolley 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2018</xref>). The primary goal of precision public health is the accuracy involved in gathering data including emerging pathogens, reactions based on susceptibility and geographical distribution of the diseases. It makes use of real-time data generated, among other computational methods, to gather quick observable data. Traditional methods of forecasting influenza trends by CDC usually lag behind real time by 1–2 weeks, whereas information contained in cloud-based electronic health records and search queries in the Internet are typically available near real time. Yang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2017</xref>) combine these cloud-based records and Internet searches with historical flu data and use dynamically selected set of variables to give the best fit in their model for the 2013–2016 flu season. Their results correctly estimated the peak timing and magnitude of the studies of flu season. These kinds of predictive models of influenza activity help public health officials prepare and allocate resources for possible disease outbreaks.
