<p id="Par109">However, as with any individualâ€™s information, the use of public data calls for discretion: consent, privacy and security must be upheld and protected. Furthermore, an application that has come into prominence is the use of millions of data available from the social media platforms on the World Wide Web. However, the risk of inaccuracy in predictive analysis based on such data is high. A wide margin of error is required to compensate for over- or underestimation. Google Flu Trends, which is the recent surveillance tracking arm of the search engine giant, came into the spotlight for over-calculating the doctor visits for influenza-like illness than the reports generated by CDC which relies on records procured from laboratories (Lazer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). The idea was to correlate search criteria with flu incidence and establish a trend. The initial trials matched 50 million searches with 1152 data points (Ginsberg et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2009</xref>) and came out with erroneous results due to certain ad hoc procedures. Even after corrections to the programmes, GFT persistently overestimated flu prevalence and has been relegated to the background for now in favour of more traditional procedures as adopted, for example, by CDC. Ideally, perhaps a combination of the two approaches could auger for better predictive trend analyses.
