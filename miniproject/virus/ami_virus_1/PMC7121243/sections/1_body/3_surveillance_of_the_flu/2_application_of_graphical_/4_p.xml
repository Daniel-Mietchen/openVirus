 </sub> values, which directly correlate with the nucleotide distribution in gene sequences, the graphical method can also be specifically employed to deduce the mixing between viruses originating from different regions due to homologous recombination. This is significant in understanding the geographical dispersal and trend of viral strain and subtype circulation, a key point in surveillance study of disease spread. A study (De et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) of the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of H1N1, H5N1, H3N2 and H7N9 subtypes from Asia, spanning the years from 2010 to 2014, showed that there were homologous recombinations of whole segments between the same subtypes. Some instances indicated that the parental and progeny strains were from same geographic regions, while others showed unexpected regional disparity, for example, parental H1N1 strains were found to be from Kowloon and Guangdong in China, and the daughter strain was isolated in Singapore. These genomic trails can be used to glean movement patterns of pathogenic viruses. In another study (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>), it was found that H5N1 strains in geese from Qinghai, China, were also observed 5000Â km away in strains in swans from Southern Russia in 2005; H5N1 strains were detected in poultry in Turkey that were also observed in chicken in Israel, via the trade route; and the same H5N1 strain were found in Egypt and Ghana, while H5N1 samples collected in 2006 from ducks in Hunan had the same sequence as found in human samples isolated from Indonesia.
