 </sub> in the surveillance of viruses. Earlier in the chapter, we described methods for calculation of other sequence descriptors. Different descriptors may encode different structural information on the sequences. So, a collection of sequence descriptors or orthogonal factors like principal components (PCs) derived from them may be more powerful tools for the comparison and surveillance of emerging viral pathogenesis. Such a critical analysis of different methodologies was done by us some time ago (Sen et al.
