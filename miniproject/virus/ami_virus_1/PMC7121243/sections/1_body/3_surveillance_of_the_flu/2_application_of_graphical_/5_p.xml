 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2005</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2006</xref>). Its application has also established new insights about virus families, exemplified by dengue type 2 virus (DENV2) which belongs to the flavivirus family along with Zika virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis virus, among others. The envelope gene sequences of DENV2 greatly deviate from the other aforementioned flaviviruses in their nucleotide distribution and composition. This was a new find compared to available literature which has classified dengue to be similar to the other flavivirus members. The change in their

 </sub> values is significant (Dey et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017b</xref>). This type of analytical observation will aid in surveillance of pathogens for antiviral and vaccine development.
