<p id="Par104">Graphical representation can also help us understand the collected data which might contain incomplete information and annotation. Partial coding sequences can be graphically analysed to determine which part of the whole gene it belongs to through an alignment-free model. The approximate location of the sequence fragment can be determined in the gene by inferences from the nucleotide distribution pattern and the quantification of the pattern in form of

 </sub> values. In their study of the Zika envelope gene, Dey et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2017a</xref>) evaluated partial CDS fragments and pinpointed their nucleotide start and end positions within the whole envelope gene sequence. Moreover, by cross-checking with existing annotated complete gene sequences, they were also able to identify additional peptide fragments in their sample sequences which contributed to the genetic differences between sequences collected from two different locations, Uganda and Brazil.
