<p id="Par103">That same work (Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2007</xref>) showed another facet of viral surveillance. As described in some detail in Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec26" ref-type="sec">9.3.3</xref>, for this study 173 strains of the H5N1 of the period 1996â€“2005 were grouped on the basis of pathogenic years in the human population, two denoting periods of human infections and another representing the absence of human cases. Significant differences in the

 </sub> were observed between the two groups of strains. The observed differences implied that genetic drifts had occurred among the strains of the two periods with the mutations having led to a quantitative decrease in the hydrophobicity of the proteins of strains belonging to the infective period. This paper illustrated that a relatively simple mathematical metric, viz.

 </sub>, can be related to the location and effects of mutations in RNA, sort through conserved regions in the RNA, compute similarity between multiple sequences and thus aid in the surveillance of changes in the viral genomes.
