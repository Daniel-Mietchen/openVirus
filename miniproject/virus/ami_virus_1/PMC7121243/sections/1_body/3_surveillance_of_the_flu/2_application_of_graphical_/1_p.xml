<p id="Par102">Mathematical model analyses can extend the HI assays by quantitative estimation of antigenic differences; the results can also be reproduced visually to compare many strains at a time and check out significant differences. Examination of a number of plots of the influenza H5N1 neuraminidase gene in a 2D graphical representation system (Nandy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1994</xref>) led to the discovery of a 50-base segment at the 3â€² end that was very strongly conserved (Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2007</xref>) and led eventually to a proposal for design of a peptide vaccine (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>). This was found to be applicable across multiple subtypes of influenza, including H5N1, H1N1, H7N1, H9N1, H10N1 and others.
