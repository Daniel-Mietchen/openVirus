<p id="Par110">With any scientific research, one must take into account the ethical implications of their work and inferences. A bone of contention in the prevention of spread of avian influenza and possible epidemics in human population is the recent trend in culling of poultry birds suspected to be infected by the H5N1 and H7N9 avian flu. The ethical dilemma arises between the prices of avian life against human population safety. Furthermore, WHO sheds light on the risks which the healthcare professionals place themselves in and also illuminates on the extent of travel restrictions that can be imposed in order to mitigate the spread of disease and the individual rights to freedom of movement. In 2006, WHO published a manual to integrate ethics with the influenza pandemic response structure (WHO

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>). Their papers showed the conclusions of genetically inducing mutations in H5N1 that conferred onto the viruses the ability to transmit through air among ferrets in the form of respiratory water droplets. The authors asserted that similar conditions among human populations would produce similar results. The NSABB, National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity, allowed revised and heavily edited versions of the papers to be published in fear of dual-use research concerns (DURC) where scientific findings can be used for catastrophic implications. The NSABB, after much deliberation, recommended the full publication of their work.
