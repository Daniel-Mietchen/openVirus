<p id="Par93">The two surface proteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, have more in common: It appears that there is some kind of correlation between the two proteins such that suppression of the role of one influences changes in the sequence of the other and that coadaptation between the two was required for initiation of the H1N1 pandemic of 2009 (Wei

There was also an observation that the influenza over the years had shown only a few subtypes instead of large numbers possible from the existence of 18 HA and 11 NA subtypes. Clearly, there was some interdependence between the two proteins, but there was no idea of what and how strong the interdependence could be. We undertook a study through graphical representation method (Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2014</xref>) and hypothesised a coupling between the HA and NA nucleotide sequences which could be measured through the

 </sub> values. We assumed that subtypes that exist would have strong coupling and subtypes that are not found in nature would be weakly coupled, i.e. their interdependence would be weak, and hence those strains would not survive in nature. Our results (Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2014</xref>) amply bore this out and in fact showed that the couplings were stronger for avian flus compared to human-infecting flus, which one would have expected since wild birds seem to be the reservoir of influenza viruses of different kinds. We carried this analysis further and forecast the effects of possible reassortments of the H5N2 virus affecting poultry in the USA for therapeutic development and surveillance purposes (Nandy and Basak
