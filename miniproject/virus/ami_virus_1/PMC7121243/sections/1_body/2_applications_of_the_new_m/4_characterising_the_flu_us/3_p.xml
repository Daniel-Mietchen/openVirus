<p id="Par90">A study of mutational changes in influenza strains such as of H5N1, H1N1, etc. is important for surveillance against the influenza subtypes building up resistance against the therapeutics and vaccines. Studying a group of 682 strains of the H5N1 virus over the years 1997–2008 (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>), we came across an interesting phenomenon: How far a strain had travelled geographically and temporally. Considering the property that the same

 </sub> of two sequences implies very close similarity of sequences (Nandy and Nandy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">2003</xref>), we found that identical sequences have appeared over significant distances in space and time, raising questions about a virus’ longevity. Based on the statistics, we found it compelling to hypothesise that virions could probably survive ex vivo (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>, but also see Bean et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1982</xref>) in dried mud or dirt carried over long distances by wild birds to infect other birds and poultry in wetlands in distant areas.
