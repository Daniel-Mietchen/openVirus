<p id="Par91">The same investigations revealed an interesting facet of mutations through recombination. The role of recombination in viral sequence changes is hotly debated (Hao 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2011</xref>; Boni et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2012</xref>), the general opinion being that if recombination does take place in RNA viruses at all through the copy-choice method, it would be below 2%. We enquired into the possibility of another style of recombination, complete segments of a gene being exchanged through polymerase jumps at the segment boundaries: the neuraminidase gene with three segments – transmembrane, stalk and body – is a good example. Taking A/chicken/Afghanistan/1573–65/2006(H5N1)NA as a test case (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>) and computing

 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> values for the three segments individually, we compared each segment with corresponding segments of a selected group of H5N1 neuraminidase genes in terms of the 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> values. We found that the

 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>

 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> value of the transmembrane segment of A/turkey/Islamabad/NARC7873/2007(H5N1)NA, i.e. they have the exact same sequence, implying a segment exchange had taken place at some time. Similarly, the stalk segment was found identical in the test sample and in A/greatcrestedgrebe/Denmark/ 7498/06(H5N1)NA, and the body was found to have been duplicated in A/turkey/Islamabad-Pakistan/NARC-7871/02/2007(H5N1)NA, which implies that recombination-like events through exchanges of individual segments do take place (Ghosh et al.
