<p id="Par92">To understand the extent of this phenomenon, we undertook a detailed survey of the hemagglutinin protein that is comparatively simpler in that it has two segments designated HA1 and HA2. Our study (De et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>) involved a total of 1274 HA sequences comprised of H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H7N9 subtypes from Asia over the period 2010â€“2014. In this database we searched for sets of three strains where a HA1 from one strain and a HA2 from a different strain would combine to form a third, daughter strain (see schematic, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig">9.11</xref>). This was easily accomplished by computing

 </sub> values for each segment for all the strains and comparing to find duplicates, with the proviso that the two parental strains were from the same time and place. We found a total of 73 daughter strains, but, interestingly, there were no exchanges between different subtypes of the hemagglutinin. The daughter strains comprised 16 out of 427 H1 subtype, 30 of 408 H3 subtype, 20 of 350 H5 subtype and 7 of 89 H7 subtype in our database totalling 5.73% of all the strains in the database. Extending the analysis to 102 new strains from 2015 yielded another 5 instances of segment-wise recombination-like events. Thus, while the evidence for copy-choice recombination event mosaic in any gene sequence may not be readily evident, segment-wise recombination-like events do appear to occur in around 5% instances.
