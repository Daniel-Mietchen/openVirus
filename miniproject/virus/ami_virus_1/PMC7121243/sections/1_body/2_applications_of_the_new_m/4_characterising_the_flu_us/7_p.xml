<p id="Par94">As is evident from the above applications, 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> is a convenient way to scan hundreds and thousands of sequences in a short time interval to determine segments of interest. One particularly important query is identifying conserved segments in any gene sequence. By scanning the relevant sequences through a window of the appropriate size and determining the number of instances where the 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> values remain identical, the best conserved segments of a gene sequence can be identified. Correspondingly, taking the protein sequence and computing the 
 <italic>p</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>R</italic>
 </sub> values in the 20D model (see Sect. 
 <xref rid="Sec22" ref-type="sec">9.2.3.2</xref>), the conserved domains in the protein can be identified. These techniques are an important tool in rational design of peptide vaccines where we may target those peptides that are conserved and have the capability of appropriate immune response to be the basis for vaccines that can outlive several generations of mutational changes. We had followed this procedure to identify best target sites in the NA of H5N1 (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>) and the HA of H7N9 (Sarkar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2015</xref>) influenza subtypes. Analyses for these targets are described briefly in the next section.
