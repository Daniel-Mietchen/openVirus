<p id="Par83">The host cells primarily include epithelial cells of the nose, throat and lungs of mammals and intestines of birds. Following binding, the viral lipid membrane fuses with the host cell membrane. The terminal sialic acid residues of the human cell receptors, where the HA binds, are of two types, 
 <italic>α-2-3</italic> linked and 
 <italic>α-2-6</italic> linked, having differential distribution in the lower and upper respiratory tract of humans, respectively (Kumlin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2008</xref>). Distribution of the 
 <italic>α-2-3</italic>-linked and 
 <italic>α-2-6</italic>-linked sialic acid receptors in swine respiratory tract is much more uniform. In contrast, birds have only 
 <italic>α-2-3</italic>-linked sialic acid receptor in their respiratory tract. This atypical distribution of sialic-linked glycoprotein receptors in the animal kingdom plays a significant role in evolution and dissemination of the virus. In China and the Far East, where poultry and swine herds are raised in numerous villages and farms, avian influenza with 
 <italic>α-2-3</italic>-linked sialic acid receptors can infect swine and develop the ability to bind 
 <italic>α-2-6</italic>-linked sialic acid receptors. This enables the modified virus to infect humans in the upper respiratory tract and make transmission between humans easy through sneezing and coughing. The scare with the bird flu, H5N1, was for this particular possibility – the virus has a high mortality ratio but to date can infect humans only through the 
 <italic>α-2-3</italic>-linked sialic acid receptors. Were it to develop the ability to bind the 
 <italic>α-2-6</italic> linked sialic acid receptors, humans would be susceptible to a pandemic catastrophe.
