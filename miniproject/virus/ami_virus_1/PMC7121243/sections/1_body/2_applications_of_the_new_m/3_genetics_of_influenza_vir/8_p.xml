<p id="Par86">Interestingly, the Spanish flu virus is believed to have had greater than expected number of silent nucleotide or synonymous mutations (mutations that do not change the corresponding amino acids) in its genome in comparison with its avian and mammalian counterparts (Morens et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2010</xref>) and caused other pandemics through reassortments: the H2N2 pandemic of 1957, the H3N2 pandemic of 1968 and the H1N1 pandemic of 2009. The H5N1 bird flu is believed to have been a reassortment of genes from a prior H5N1 and a H9N2. Similarly, the H7N9 avian flu that struck China in 2013 (Gao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2013</xref>) was a reassorted virus, picking up genes from multiple hosts like HA genes from H7N3 virus of domestic duck, NA from H7N9 virus of wild migratory birds and six other genes from the H9N2 virus of domestic poultry (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; Liu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2013</xref>). In 2015, there was an avian epidemic in the poultry market in the Midwest USA caused by H5N2 virus (Spackman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2016</xref>), another product of reassortment which held possibilities of further reassortants.
