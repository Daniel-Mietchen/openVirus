<p id="Par80">Influenza is a negative-sense strand RNA virus. It is characterised by a segmented genome (Bouvier and Palese 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>) where the IAV has 8 segmented genes coding for 11 proteins, as described in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab20" ref-type="table">9.20</xref>. The influenza A virion is roughly spherical in shape, typically around 100 nanometres wide. It consists of an envelope containing the two surface proteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), in the proportion of 4:1 (Bouvier and Palese 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2008</xref>). The central hollow core contains the RNA genome and the other proteins essential for packaging and survival of the virion.
