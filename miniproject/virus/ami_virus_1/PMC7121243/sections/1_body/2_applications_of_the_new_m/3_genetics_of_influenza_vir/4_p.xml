<p id="Par82">HA mediates entry of the virus in the host cell by binding with terminal sialic acid residues of the host cell glycoprotein receptors. The HA protein has two subdomains, HA1 and HA2. HA1 subdomain contains the receptor-binding region and the antigenic regions where many mutations occur. HA2 subdomain is comparatively more stable and functions to anchor the protein on the viral envelope. NA mediates exit of the virus from the host cell by cleaving the terminal sialic acid residues of the glycoprotein or glycolipid receptors (Chen and Li
