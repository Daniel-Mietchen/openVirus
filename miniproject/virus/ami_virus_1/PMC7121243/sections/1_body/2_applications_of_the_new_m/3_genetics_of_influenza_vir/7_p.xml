<p id="Par85">RNA viruses are prone to very high rates of mutation (Barr and Fearns 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>; Drake 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1993</xref>). The enzyme required for influenza gene replication in the host cell, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, is devoid of any proofreading activity, which allows mutations during replication to be retained. Mutational changes in IAV are known to proceed by two well-documented mechanisms, antigenic drift and antigenic shift (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2017b</xref>). Antigenic drifts arise out of random point mutations. If they occur in the viral antigenic site, the host cell may lose immunity against the virus, and the infection-immunity response cycle starts all over again. These drifts can cause seasonal outbreaks or epidemics, but they are not potent enough to give rise to pandemics. Antigenic shifts are less recurrent, occurring only when two or more virus subtypes infect a host cell. As the virus has segmented genome, the progeny virus may pack genes from different subtypes in a process known as reassortment. This may give rise to new and unique subtypes, sometimes introducing novel surface-exposed HA or NA that may predispose the viral host to high degree of pathogenesis. Antigenic shifts are often the causes of pandemics.
