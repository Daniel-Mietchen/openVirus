<p id="Par87">There is also a third mechanism by which a virus may mutate to form a new strain. If a host cell is coinfected by two different strains of the same subtypes, the RNA polymerase may jump during replication from one RNA segment to its counterpart on the other strain at a consensus sequence of the gene referred to as a break point, continue replication and then revert to the original strain at the next break point. This phenomenon is termed as copy-choice recombination. This can give rise to progeny virus having a novel RNA segment not present in either of the infecting strains. We have also considered the possibility of the natural division of distinct segments of a gene, such as HA1 and HA2 of HA as break points, a topic we discuss in some detail later. Recombination in viruses is a controversial subject where the incidence of recombination through copy-choice method is expected to be below 2% (Hao
