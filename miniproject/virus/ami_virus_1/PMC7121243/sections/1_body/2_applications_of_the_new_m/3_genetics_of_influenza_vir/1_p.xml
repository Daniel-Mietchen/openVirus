<p id="Par79">Influenza virus belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. They are of four types, A, B, C and D, referred to as IAV, IBV, ICV and IDV, respectively (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017a</xref>). Types A, B and C infect humans and a variety of animals, among which type A is the most virulent. Influenza D virus was identified as recently as 2012. Although, IDV has been found to infect cattle (Hause et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">2018a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">b</xref>), its detection in swine has raised the possibility of its spread in other mammals, including humans. Wild aquatic birds are the natural reservoir of the influenza A virus. The bird flu scare of around 1997â€“2005 was noteworthy because of the rapidity with which the virus spread throughout the globe causing huge fatalities among birds and animals; it still continues to precipitate frequent outbreaks. Because of the worldwide spread, virulence and pandemic history, IAV is of primary importance among the four types. In this chapter, we emphasise only on influenza type A virus except where otherwise stated.
