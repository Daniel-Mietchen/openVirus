<p id="Par98">It has therefore been a lingering quest to develop a universal flu vaccine that could act against all strains of the virus all the time. There have been claims off and on of a universal flu vaccine, but to date no such vaccine has been marketed. We undertook a graphical and numerical analyses of 514 strains of the H5N1 and 425 strains of the H1N1 influenza virus neuraminidase gene and determined six regions which remained conserved (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>). This was facilitated by our examination of the graphical representation of the neuraminidase gene sequence which showed a strongly conserved 50/51 base (17 aa) region near the 3′ end of the gene. When examined in the 3D crystallographic structure of the protein, this region was seen to be responsible for the bonding between the adjacent proteins in the neuraminidase quaternary structure and therefore extremely important for the structure’s stability. The other regions we identified as being conserved also turned out to be surface exposed. These observations indicated a possibility, albeit subject to experimental verification, of designing inhibitors for broad-spectrum pandemic control of flu viruses with similar NA structure that could remain active for many generations of mutations of the underlying neuraminidase gene sequences (Ghosh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2010</xref>). In another exercise, we explored the HA protein of H7N9 influenza virus using an improved protocol since there were concerns that the H7N9 could mutate to a human-infecting virus. We determined several targets in both the HA1 and HA2 regions of the hemagglutinin that could be used for rational design of peptide vaccines (Sarkar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2015</xref>). It is to be noted that the HA1 of the hemagglutinin is highly variable, but HA2 is comparatively much more stable and is one of the targeted regions for a universal flu vaccine.
