<p id="Par96">Drugs used in influenza treatment globally belong to two groups having distinctive pharmacological attributes: M2 ion channel blockers and NA (neuraminidase) inhibitors (Stiver 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2003</xref>). M2 protein forms a small proton channel across the viral envelope and mediates pH levels across viral membrane during cell entry and progeny maturation (Pielak and Chou 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">2011</xref>). It is vital for viral replication, and drugs amantadine and rimantadine were developed to block its function but has since been withdrawn because mutational changes in the prevailing influenzas have rendered them resistant to these drugs (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2011</xref>). Present drugs available in the market are neuraminidase inhibitors are peramivir (trade name Rapivab), zanamivir (trade name Relenza) and oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu). The neuraminidase inhibitors act both against IAV and IBV. However, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), there is widespread resistance against oseltamivir globally (WHO
