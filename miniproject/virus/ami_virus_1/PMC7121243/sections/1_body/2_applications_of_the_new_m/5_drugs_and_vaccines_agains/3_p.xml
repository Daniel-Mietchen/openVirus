<p id="Par97">Vaccines that prepare the body’s immune system against foreign pathogens form an alternative to drugs in the fight against viral diseases. Vaccines may be live-attenuated, inactivated or recombinant virus-like particle (VLP) type. With influenza there are so many different strains that finding a traditional vaccine against all types poses a perennial problem. Based on global surveillance data generated by WHO’s in-house surveillance system, viz. the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), vaccine strains are chosen for every year on the basis of preponderance of viral strains in each hemisphere. At present, for 2017–2018, WHO recommended four A and B strains, viz. A/Michigan/45/2015 (H1N1) pdm09-like virus, A/Hong Kong/4801/2014(H3N2)-like virus, B/Brisbane/60/2008-like virus (Victoria lineage) and B/Phuket/3073-like virus (Yamagata lineage), to be used as quadrivalent vaccine in the northern hemisphere (WHO

While these do reduce the scope of the infection, in some years the vaccine is only partly effective as in 2014–2015 season and again in the current year, i.e. 2017–2018. These are partly due to the continuing mutations in the viral strains and partly errors in the vaccine as is reported to have happened this year.
