<p id="Par99">Another approach has recently been advocated for vaccine development. One of the disadvantages of current vaccines is their instability and weakness towards protease activity which mandates additional operational and transport costs; it also results in reduced biological activity and bioavailability to the immune system. Mile et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2018</xref>) constructed a T-cell-restricted IAV synthetic peptide containing D-amino subunits. D-amino acids are rarely found in nature and are inherently protected from protease degradation. Peptide was able to elicit an immune response in mice after oral administration. Such synthetic ‘mimics’ can be a cost-effective alternative to traditional vaccines.
