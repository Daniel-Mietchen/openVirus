<p id="Par73">We have briefly recounted in the introduction the various applications that have been made of alignment-free comparisons of DNA/RNA/protein sequences using the new methodology of graphical representation and numerical characterisation techniques. An area of particular concern that has seen many applications has been viral pandemics; specifically, in the twenty-first century, successive waves of epidemics and pandemics have swept across the globe starting with SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) pandemic of 2002–2003 that killed over 8000 people, the swine flu of 2009 (&gt;100,000 deaths), the Ebola epidemic of 2014–2016 in West Africa (over 15,000 deaths) and the Zika virus pandemic that struck the Americas in 2015–2017 (&gt;200,000 deaths). Understanding the characteristics of the viral spread and genetics would thus appear of urgent necessity. In this section we concentrate on the influenza pandemics as one of the most virulent killer diseases and summarise some of the specific applications of graphical representation methods to understand the character of the influenza virus, especially in relation to the pandemic varieties.</p>
