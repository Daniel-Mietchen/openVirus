<p id="Par77">This was followed by two more influenza epidemics in 1957 and 1968. The two viruses arose by reassortment of human and avian strains. The avian strain was from wild waterfowl found in Eurasia, and the human strain originated from the H1N1 strain that was already present in the population. It is speculated that the surface proteins of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase that had adapted to humans were replaced by those found in the avian strains (Reid et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR05">2005</xref>). Towards the end of the century, in 1996, H5N1 virus was identified in China in geese which subsequently jumped the species barrier to infect poultry; some humans were incidentally infected in the 1997 wave and caused serious concern of another pandemic (De Jong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR012">1997</xref>). In the next few years, the H5N1 avian flu spread across various countries around the world and millions of wild as well as poultry deaths were seen. Human deaths arising from this avian influenza through physical contact were recorded globally till early 2014, but till date no human-to-human transmission has been observed, fortunately.
