<p id="Par75">The twentieth century saw one of the most horrific viral disasters of any era, viz. the 1918 ‘Spanish influenza’. This was a type A H1N1 virus that brought about an onslaught of worldwide pandemic, spreading to far corners of the world, including the Arctic and isolated islands in the Pacific (Mamelund

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR09">1998</xref>). During the peak of the pandemic in USA, more than 100,000 deaths were occurring in a week (Reid et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1999</xref>). It is interesting to note that post first infection wave, herd immunity within the population should have immunologically protected a second wave of infection in the same year. But on the contrary, the second wave drastically increased mortality rates. A key enigma, genetically, is the occurrence of the three infection waves in rapid succession within a period of 6–12 months: the H1N1 virus had to accumulate immense mutational changes or acquire key genetic alterations for it to become so fatal so rapidly which normally requires years of circulation within a population. However, in this case the virulence had increased over a matter of weeks (Reid et al.
