<p id="Par67">Graphical representation schemes for protein sequences came about as a natural consequence of the development and applications of graphical representations of nucleotide sequences. In contrast to that of nucleic acid sequences, graphical representation of protein sequences is complicated, given there are 20 amino acid residues as the basic units of proteins, while nucleic acids can be defined by only 4 bases. Initial efforts were made to portray the amino acids in terms of four properties so they could be represented in a 2D coordinate system like for the DNA sequences and later extended to multidimensional representations (see review Randic et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2011</xref>). We proceeded to simplify the representation intuitively by projecting the primary sequence in a 20-dimensional Euclidean space which can be used to understand the phylogenetic relationship, provide mutational insight and identify conserved regions for groups of proteins. We briefly mention just this one method in this chapter on nucleic acid research for completeness.
