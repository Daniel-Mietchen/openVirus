<p id="Par68">A 20-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is used to model the protein sequences. The 20 amino acids are assigned to 20 axes in the Cartesian framework (Nandy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2009</xref>); all the axes are equivalent, and the choice of association of amino acids with the axes can be made arbitrarily but once made will remain constant for the duration of the exercise. The computation starts from the origin and moves a step in the appropriate axis direction for the first amino acid in the sequence, another step in the respective axial direction for the next amino acid in the sequence and so on. Tracing the path for the occurrences of all the amino acids in the sequence in order results in a series of points in the abstract 20D space generating a 20D curve. An index for the protein sequence can be considered as a vector from the origin of the coordinate system to the endpoint of the graph. In order to eliminate the disadvantage that different distributions of the residues with the same composition in the sequences will lead to degeneracy in these vectors, the algorithm is designed to choose the characteristics of a sequence by a weighted centre of mass approach, first used for DNA sequence (Raychaudhury and Nandy
