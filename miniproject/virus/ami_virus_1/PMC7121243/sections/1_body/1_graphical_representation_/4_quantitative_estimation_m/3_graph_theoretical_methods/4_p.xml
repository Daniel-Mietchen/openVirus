<p id="Par20">Now the graph-theoretical distance (topological) D
 <sub>G</sub> and the Euclidean distance D
 <sub>E</sub> between the vertices are measured, and a particular type of matrix, D
 <sub>E</sub>/D
 <sub>G</sub>, is formed from which the leading eigenvalues are calculated. The leading eigenvalue is used to characterise a sequence, while the difference between the eigenvalues forms an estimate of the similarity/dissimilarity between the sequences. Thus, the leading eigenvalues of D
 <sub>E</sub>/D
 <sub>G</sub> matrix and the associated eigen matrices are considered to be descriptors of the DNA sequences.
