<p id="Par17">In this method, DNA/RNA sequence is represented and characterised by a two-step process: representation of the sequences using graphs and characterisation of the graphs by graph invariants. A graph invariant is a graph-theoretic property which is preserved by isomorphic graph (Harary 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1969</xref>; Janežič et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">2007</xref>). A graph 
 <italic>𝐺</italic> is defined as an ordered pair consisting of two sets, 
 <italic>𝑉</italic> and 
 <italic>𝐺</italic>=(
 <italic>𝑉</italic>(
 <italic>𝐺</italic>), 𝑅), where 
 <italic>𝑉</italic>(
 <italic>𝐺</italic>) represents a finite nonempty set of points and 𝑅 is a binary relation defined on the set 
 <italic>𝑉</italic>(
 <italic>𝐺</italic>). The elements of 
 <italic>𝑉</italic> are called vertices, and the elements of 𝑅 also symbolised by 
 <italic>𝐸</italic>(
 <italic>𝐺</italic>) or 
 <italic>𝐸</italic> are called edges. Such an abstract graph is commonly visualised by representing elements of 
 <italic>𝑉</italic>(
 <italic>𝐺</italic>) as points and by connecting each pair (
 <italic>𝑢</italic>, 
 <italic>𝑣</italic>) of elements of 
 <italic>𝑉</italic>(
 <italic>𝐺</italic>) with a line or edge if and only if (
 <italic>𝑢</italic>, 
 <italic>𝑣</italic>)
 <italic>ϵ R</italic>. The vertex, 
 <italic>𝑣</italic>, and edge, 
 <italic>𝑒</italic>, are incident with each other, as are 
 <italic>𝑢</italic> and 
 <italic>𝑒</italic>. Two vertices in 
 <italic>𝐺</italic> are called adjacent if (
 <italic>𝑢</italic>, 
 <italic>𝑣</italic>)
 <italic>ϵ R</italic>, i.e. they are connected by an edge. A walk of a graph is a sequence beginning and ending with vertices in which vertices and edges alternate and each edge is incident with vertices immediately preceding and following it. A walk of the form 
 <italic>v</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>, e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>, v</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>1</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>, e</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>, …, v</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub> joins vertices 
 <italic>v</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>0</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>v</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>n</italic>
 </sub>. The length of a walk is the number of edges in the walk. A graph 
 <italic>G</italic> is connected if every pair of its vertices is connected by a path. The distance (
 <italic>𝑢</italic>, 
 <italic>𝑣</italic>) between vertices 
 <italic>𝑢</italic> and 
 <italic>𝑣</italic> in 
 <italic>G</italic> is the length of the shortest path connecting 
 <italic>𝑢</italic> and 
 <italic>𝑣</italic>.
