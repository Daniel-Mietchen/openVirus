<p id="Par15">Various numerical descriptors for the numerical characterisation of sequences have been formulated during the past few decades. A particular descriptor maps the set of sequences (𝑆) into the set of real numbers (𝑅). In some cases, a vector may be extracted instead of a single number. Given below is a representative sample of the important and widely used descriptors known thus far. However, it should be noted that the list is not exhaustive.</p>
