<p id="Par26">There are many 2D approaches which do not involve the Cartesian coordinate system to represent nucleic acid sequence. Randic et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">2003</xref>) proposed four horizontal equidistant parallel lines labelled as A, T, G and C from top to bottom. To plot the nucleic acid sequence, the bases are labelled along the x-axis, and straight lines are drawn from individual points on the four parallel lines according to the bases occurring in the sequence (Fig.
