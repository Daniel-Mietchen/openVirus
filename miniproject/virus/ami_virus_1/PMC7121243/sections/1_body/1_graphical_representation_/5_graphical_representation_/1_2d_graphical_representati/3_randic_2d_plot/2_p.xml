<p id="Par27">A matrix method is used for determining a descriptor by constructing an M/M matrix for the given sequence ATGAACACTC. The off-diagonal entries of the M/M matrix are determined by dividing the Euclidean distance between two vertices of the zigzag curve by the graph-theoretical distance, i.e. the number of edges, between the two vertices. Here, if we take the first base A and the sixth base C of our sequence as an example, then the corresponding matrix element is obtained by taking the ratio of Euclidian distance between the first base (A) and the sixth base (C), i.e.
