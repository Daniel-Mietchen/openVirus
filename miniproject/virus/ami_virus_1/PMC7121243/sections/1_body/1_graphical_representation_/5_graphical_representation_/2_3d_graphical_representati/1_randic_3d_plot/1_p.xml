<p id="Par47"> The 3D graphical representation of DNA sequence was proposed by Randic et al. (2000). They associated the 2D method with a 3D graph by assigning each of the four bases to the corners of a tetrahedron where the points are as follows: (+1, −1, −1) for A, (−1, +1, −1) for G, (−1, −1, +1) for C and (+1, +1, +1) for T. The graph is plotted by placing the first base say A (for our mini sequence ATGAACACTC) at the corner position, i.e. at (+1, −1, −1), and the next base, i.e. T at (2, 0, 0). Proceeding in this manner, we obtain a plot of the sequence ATGAACACTC as shown in Fig.
