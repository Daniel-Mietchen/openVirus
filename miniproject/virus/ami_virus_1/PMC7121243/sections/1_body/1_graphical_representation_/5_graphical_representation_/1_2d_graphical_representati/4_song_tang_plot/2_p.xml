<p id="Par33">Keeping one of such groups, such as purine, as central line, and cytosine (C) and thymine (T) as the peripheral lines, we can plot a graph. Repeating the same process for the other groups, we get a total of six (
 <sup>4</sup>C
 <sub>2</sub>) combinations of plots. For each of them, the two peripheral lines can also be exchanged. In total, 12 (6Ã—2) plots can be obtained.
