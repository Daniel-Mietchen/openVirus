<p id="Par38">In this model, the L/L matrices are constructed first from the three 2D graphs shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">9.5</xref> as a typical example to characterise the DNA sequence. Then the eigenvalues are computed from the matrices, and lastly, λ
 <sub>non-N</sub> are calculated which is λ
 <sub>non-N</sub> = maxeig (maximal eigenvalue) + mineig (minimal eigenvalue), where N = A, G, C. Proceeding in the same way, we obtain Table
