<p id="Par36">In this method the leading eigenvalues of M/M and L/L matrices are used as DNA descriptors. These numerical parameters will facilitate the comparison of two DNA sequences. A vector can be constructed to characterise a DNA sequence from these data obtained from different characteristic curves. For example, if we consider only L/L matrix and since two symmetrical characteristic curves have the same L/L matrices, we can construct a six-component vector as a DNA descriptor by using the leading eigenvalues of these matrices associated with six characteristic curves.</p>
