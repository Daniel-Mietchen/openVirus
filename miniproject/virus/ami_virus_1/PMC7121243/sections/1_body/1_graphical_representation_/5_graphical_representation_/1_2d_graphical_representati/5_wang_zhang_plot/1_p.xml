<p id="Par37">In the Wang-Zhang method (Wang and Zhang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">2006</xref>), there are three configurations, namely, non-A, non-C and non-G. A binary method is employed where the presence or absence of bases in the sequence is assigned 0 and 1 according to the specific configuration, for example, 0 for A and 1 for the others if it is a non-A plot. A similar protocol is implemented for the non-C and non-G plots. The graphs for the sequence ATGAACACTC are shown in Fig.
