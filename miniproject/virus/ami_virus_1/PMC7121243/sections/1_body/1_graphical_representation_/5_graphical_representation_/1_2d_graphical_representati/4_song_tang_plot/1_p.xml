<p id="Par29">In a slight variation, Song and Tang (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2005</xref>) proposed a three-horizontal line method where the central line represents two bases and the two peripheral lines denote each of the remaining bases. Counting of the nucleotides is done along the x-axis, and the bases are plotted and connected by straight lines as in the case of the Randic 2D plot. In the case of DNA primary sequences, the four bases A, C, G and T can be grouped as per their characteristics:
