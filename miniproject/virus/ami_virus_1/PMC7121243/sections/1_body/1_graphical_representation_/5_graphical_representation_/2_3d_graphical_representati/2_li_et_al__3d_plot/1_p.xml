<p id="Par50">A novel 3D representation of DNA sequences was proposed by Li et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2016</xref>). If the bases are represented by a set {A, G, C, T}, they graphically characterised a sequence in terms of nucleotide pairs by taking two combinations of the set in terms of a multiset {∞. A, ∞. G, ∞. C, ∞. T}. The possible number of such pairs can be ten (Table
