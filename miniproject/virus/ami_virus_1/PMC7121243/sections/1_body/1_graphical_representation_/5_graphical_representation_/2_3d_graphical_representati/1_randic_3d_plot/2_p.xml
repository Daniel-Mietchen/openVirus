<p id="Par48">In this graphical plot of our mini sequence ATGAACACTC, a D
 <sub>E</sub>/D
 <sub>G</sub> matrix (from the Euclidean pairwise distance matrix D
 <sub>E</sub> and a pairwise graph-theoretical distance matrix D
 <sub>G</sub> of all the points on the graph) is constructed from which the leading eigenvalues are calculated to evaluate the descriptor of the sequence. In the following table, the coordinates of the bases of the sequence and the elements of the D
 <sub>E</sub>/D
 <sub>G</sub> matrix constructed from these coordinates are shown. Each matrix element is calculated as follows: Taking the (1,6) element, i.e. the first base A to the sixth base C as an example, the Euclidian distance is calculated from the coordinates shown in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab15" ref-type="table">9.15</xref> and is divided by the minimum distance between two consecutive points which is √3. The division by the minimum distance is performed in order to normalise the distance scale, so that the Euclidian distance between adjacent vertices equals 1 and not √3 (due to taking the side of the cube to be 1). Now this value is divided by the number of edges before the sixth base, i.e. 5 here. Thus, the value obtained is = (√3/√3)/5 = 0.200 (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab16" ref-type="table">9.16</xref>).
