<p id="Par62">The following table contains the list of values of the descriptors prescribed for each of the methods described above for comparative study based on the coding sequences of four human globin genes. Some of the result sets had to be trimmed to accommodate in the list. Brief descriptions are given below for the results listed of some of the methods to understand the computation.

    <italic>Yao-Nan-Wang plot</italic> (section “
    <xref rid="Sec13" ref-type="sec">Yu-Hua Yao, Xu-Ying Nan and Tian-Ming Wang plot</xref>”): Three curves had been proposed as part of this method (i.e. RY, MK and WS). Ideally each curve is described by a 3D vector (of θ, g
    <sub>R</sub> and ρ), among which only the results for the WS curve have been listed.

    <italic>Li-Ji plot</italic> (section “
    <xref rid="Sec14" ref-type="sec">Li and Ji TB curve</xref>”): The method proposes three curves the same as in Yao-Nan-Wang one. Only the leading eigenvalues for the L/L matrices corresponding to the RY family are shown in here.

    <italic>Zhao-Qi-Yang plot</italic> (section “
    <xref rid="Sec15" ref-type="sec">Zhao Qi Yang 2D plot (based on nucleotide triplets)</xref>”): The method proposes a 21-dimensional vector, of which the 0th set, given no weight, always ends up with a value of zero. Thus, it can be considered as a 20-dimensional vector, effectively. Values for only positions 1st, 2nd, 19th and 20th are listed for representational purpose.

    <italic>Li et al. plot</italic> (section “
    <xref rid="Sec18" ref-type="sec">Li et al. 3D plot</xref>”): This method prescribes a unique descriptor using ‘piecewise function’. It depends mainly on the average number of bases per sequence in a given dataset (in our case, this is 440.25) and a factor ‘k’ (logarithmically dependent on the aforementioned ‘average’ factor, which is ~4 in our case,). As per the proposed representation, the length of the representative vectors for our dataset would have been 12 for each sequence. Hence, for the sake of simplicity and a biting space crunch in hand, we did away with the critical representation and presented the endpoints of the prescribed 3D curve as a numerical descriptor for each sequence instead (Table 
    <xref rid="Tab19" ref-type="table">9.19</xref>).
