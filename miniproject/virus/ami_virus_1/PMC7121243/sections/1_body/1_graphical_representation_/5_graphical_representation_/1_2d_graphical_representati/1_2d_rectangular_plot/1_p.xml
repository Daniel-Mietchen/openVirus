<p id="Par22">A simple 2D Cartesian coordinate system is used to represent the nucleic acid sequences. Gates (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1994</xref>) and Leong and Morgenthaler (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1995</xref>) independently proposed the four cardinal directions on a 2D grid to represent the four bases. According to Nandy, starting from the origin, a point is plotted by moving one step in negative x-direction if the base is an adenine (A) and in the opposite direction if the base is a guanine (G) and a walk of one step in positive y-direction if the base is a cytosine (C) and in the opposite direction if it is a thymine (T) (or uracil, U). Plotting the points successively in this manner draws a graph of the sequence of bases. Gates and Leong and Morgenthaler proposed a similar graphical representation but with different assignments of the bases to the cardinal directions. The graph according to the Nandy prescription is given in Fig.
