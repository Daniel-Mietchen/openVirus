<p id="Par14">Although graphical representation provides visual clues to the characteristics of base distribution in a sequence and enables visual comparison of similarities and dissimilarities between two or more sequences, quantitative estimation of such characteristics or differences between sequences is required for any significant comparisons. All authors of graphical representations have, therefore, recommended sequence descriptors to quantify sequence similarity/dissimilarity through the use of such descriptors. There are two approaches to define mathematical descriptors: geometrical and graph-theoretical methods.</p>
