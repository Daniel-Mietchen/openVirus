<p id="Par13">While most applications to date have been done in graphical representations in 2D and 3D spaces, several authors (e.g. Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2010</xref>) have proposed representations in higher orders of dimensionality. However, there are some advantages and disadvantages to them; in a 4D graphical representation of nucleic acid sequences, while overlaps and intersections of the sequence curve with itself can be avoided, graphical visualisation and the ability to directly compare two sequences are lost which, on the other hand, are easily achieved in 2D or 3D plots. Liao and Wang (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR03">2004</xref>) proposed a 6D representation, while Randic et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR92">2005</xref>) suggested a novel four-colour map representation.
