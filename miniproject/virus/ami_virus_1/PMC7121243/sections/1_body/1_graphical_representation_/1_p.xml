<p id="Par12">Graphical representation and numerical characterisation (GRANCH) of nucleotide and amino acid sequences provides a very powerful tool for basic biological research. Mathematical descriptors based on graphical representations are used as a compact method for sequence comparison. The novelty, utility and low complexity of these representations have spawned a wide variety of approaches, some of which have seen many applications. A selection of such methods is given here in order to elucidate the many ways in which this technique can be formulated.</p>
