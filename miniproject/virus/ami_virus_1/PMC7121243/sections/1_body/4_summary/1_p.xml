<p id="Par111">In this chapter we have outlined powerful and novel alignment-free graphical representation and numerical characterisation (GRANCH) tools for comparative analyses of biomolecular sequences. We explained in brief some of the proposals put forward for graphical representation and numerical characterisation in various dimensionalities and mentioned some of the many applications done using these novel, alignment-free approaches. In particular, we concentrated upon several applications done through the simple and intuitive 2D graphical representation of Nandy (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">1994</xref>) to give an idea of how these approaches can be utilised to compare and contrast the several variants of the influenza virus, determine homologous recombinations between strains of the same influenza subtype, identify conserved segments in influenza gene sequences and design peptide vaccines. We have seen that these approaches can yield phylogenetic trees to understand the relationships between the various strains and subtypes and assist in focused surveillance to ensure advance knowledge of developments that could lead to epidemic and pandemic varieties. Graphical representation and numerical characterisation thus are very general but quantitative approaches that can be used to unravel myriad aspects of viral characteristics.
