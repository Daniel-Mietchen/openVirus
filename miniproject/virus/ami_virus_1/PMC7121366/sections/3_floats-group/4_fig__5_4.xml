  <p>A model of the within-host evolution and between-host transmission of HIV escape mutants [
   <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Hosts are divided into two types: immune responders (superscript IR) and nonimmune responders (superscript NIR). There are also two variants of virus, wild type (subscript WT) and escape mutant (subscript E). Hosts are either susceptible, S, or infectious, I, and the type of virus with which they are infected is denoted by the subscript. Rates of infection are determined by the number of people infectious with each virus type. Immune responding hosts infected with the wild-type virus drive immune escape at per capita rate φ, whilst nonimmune responding hosts infected with escape mutant virus drive reversion at per capita rate ψ. All hosts are prone to per capita death rate μ, and infected hosts have an additional death rate α
