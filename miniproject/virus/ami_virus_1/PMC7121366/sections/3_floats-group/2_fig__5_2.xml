  <p>Numerical solutions to the SIR difference equation model. Infection circulates in a population of 100,000 individuals, with an expectation of life at birth of 50 years. The infectious period is 1 week, and the basic reproductive number is 5. This gives the following model parameters: B = 38 per week, μ = 0.00385 per person per week, γ = 1 per person per week, and β = 0.00005 per infected per susceptible per week. (
   <bold>a</bold>) shows damped oscillations in all three classes after an initial perturbation of 20% of the susceptible class into the recovered class. In (
   <bold>b</bold>), vaccination of 50%, 70%, or 90% of newborns is introduced at time 10 years. With R
   <sub>0</sub> = 5, the critical vaccination proportion p
   <sub>c</sub> = 0.8. Vaccination coverage above this level (at 90%) leads to eradication
