<p>Models can help in two different ways. The first is to assist the understanding of systems that are intrinsically complicated. Many different interacting populations, events that occur on multiple timescales, and systems with multiple levels of organization can all be better understood when appropriate models are used as an organizing principle and a tool for formal analysis. Sometimes, the problem is that there is not enough data. A systematic description can be very revealing in searching for which new data are most needed. There are also situations where the problem is a deluge of data. In these circumstances, well-constructed models provide a useful organizing scheme with which to interrogate those data.</p>
