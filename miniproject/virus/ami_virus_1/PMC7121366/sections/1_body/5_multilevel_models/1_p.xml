<p>The models discussed so far deal either with events inside individuals or with transmission amongst individuals (people or farms) in a population. Some questions require simultaneous consideration of events at both levels of organization. This is particularly true for questions about the evolution of infectious agents as their evolution proceeds within individual hosts, but they are also transmitted between hosts. Models that capture events at both the within-host and between-host levels are fairly recent additions to the literature on infectious disease modeling. Here, they are illustrated with two examples, a set of models that consider the emergence of a zoonotic infection in humans and a model of the within-host evolution and between-host transmission of HIV.</p>
