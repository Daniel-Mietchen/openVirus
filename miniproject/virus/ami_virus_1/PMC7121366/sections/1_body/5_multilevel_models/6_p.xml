<p>Different hosts respond to different parts of HIVâ€™s proteins (known as epitopes). For CTL responses, it is the host class 1 human leukocyte antigen (HLA) type that determines which epitopes are recognized. When CTL escape mutants are transmitted into a host who does not make immune response to that epitope, the mutations are no longer advantageous, and the virus can revert to the wild type [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Global change in the prevalence of CTL escape mutants is therefore driven by three parallel processes: the selection of escape mutants in some hosts, transmission between hosts, and reversion of escape mutants in other hosts. Once again, this is a process that takes place across multiple levels of organization, evolution and reversion of escape mutations within infected hosts, and transmission between hosts.
