<p>This model of the emergence of a novel infection has been extended by other authors to address questions about the interpretation of surveillance data [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and the role of host heterogeneity in the process of emergence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. These extensions confirm the original finding that the transmission efficiency (R
 <sub>0</sub>) of the introduced variant (and any intermediate variants) is a very important driver of the probability of emergence. Kubiak and colleagues explored the emergence of a novel infection in populations split into several communities, with commuters acting to join those communities together. They found that most communities are sufficiently interconnected to show no effect of spatial distribution on the emergence process, even a small number of commuters being sufficient to successfully transmit any novel pathogen between settlements. Thus, although many zoonotic events happen in isolated parts of the world, unless they are really cut off from urban centers, that isolation offers little barrier to the transmission of newly emerged infections.
