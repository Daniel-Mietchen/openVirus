<p>Fryer and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] developed a multilevel model of the three processes of within-host evolution, within-host reversion, and between-host transmission. The model is a version of the so-called SI model which is a simplified version of the SIR model presented above which does not allow recovery. The model allows heterogeneity in hosts and in the infecting virus so that there are hosts who do and do not mount immune responses to a given epitope and there are viruses that do and do not have escape mutations in that epitope. This model is represented in 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5.4</xref>. As in the SIR model described in 
 <xref rid="Sec3" ref-type="sec">section “The SIR Model</xref>,” the rate at which susceptibles become infected is determined by the number of infectious people present. However, in this model, because it represents the spread of a sexually transmitted disease, it is the proportion of hosts who are infectious that drives new infections. Furthermore, there are now two virus types circulating – wild type and escape mutant. Within-host adaptation allows hosts who do mount immune responses to the epitope to drive the evolution of escape mutants, and conversely, hosts who do not mount such responses can drive the reversion of escape mutant viruses back to the wild type.
