<p>Emerging infections are a continuing threat to human well-being. The pandemics of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 swine flu in 2009 illustrated how quickly a new infectious agent spreads around the world. Neither of these was as devastating as some predicted, but the continuing pandemic of HIV is ample proof that emerging infectious diseases can have devastating consequences for human communities. Many novel emerging infections arise as zoonoses – that is, infections that cross from animals into humans [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. To become a successful emerging infection of humans – that is, one that spreads widely amongst people – is a multi-step process [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. First, the pathogen must cross the species barrier into people, then it must transmit between people, and finally, it must transmit 
 <italic>efficiently enough</italic> that epidemics arise. This latter step amounts to having a basic reproductive number, R
 <sub>0</sub>, that is greater than 1. The emerging infections mentioned already, SARS, swine flu, and HIV, have transited all these steps. But there are other zoonoses that transmit to humans without emerging as epidemics or pandemics. For example, simian foamy virus, a retrovirus that is endemic in most old-world primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], can be detected in people who work with primates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] or hunt them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. There is no record of any human-to-human transmission, implying that this zoonosis only completes the first step in becoming an emerging infection. Other infections, whilst spreading from person to person, still do not cause epidemics because that spread is insufficiently efficient. An example of such an infection is the newly discovered arenavirus from Southern Africa called “Lujo virus” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. This virus caused a small outbreak in the autumn of 2008. Very dramatically, four out of the five known cases died, but with five cases and just four transmission events, the basic reproductive number stayed below one, and there was no epidemic.
