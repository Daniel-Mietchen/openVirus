<p>As well as predicting the future spread of escape mutations for different rates of escape and reversion, this model can be used to infer escape and reversion rates from data on their current prevalence. This exercise reveals a surprisingly slow average rate of escape. Across 26 different epitopes, the median time to escape was over 8Â years. There is close agreement between rates of escape inferred using this model and those estimated from a longitudinal cohort study. These slow rates are in marked contrast to the general impression given by a large number of case reports in which escape is described as occurring during the first year of infection. However, a collection of case reports is a poor basis upon which to estimate an average rate of escape.</p>
