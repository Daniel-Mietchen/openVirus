<p>Acquiring R
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1 is thus an important threshold that zoonoses and between-host transmission of a zoonotic infection that initially has R
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, but through within-host adaptation in humans can evolve to become efficient enough at transmitting from one human to another that R
 <sub>0</sub> increases above 1 and epidemics become possible. They developed a multi-type branching process model of the transmission and evolution of a zoonosis. They found that the probability of emergence depends very strongly on the basic reproductive number of the pathogen as it crosses into humans. This is because, even when R
 <sub>0</sub> &lt; 1, short chains of transmission are still possible (as exemplified with Lujo virus described above). During ongoing infections in humans, the zoonosis has opportunities to evolve towards higher transmissibility. The higher its initial R
 <sub>0</sub>, the more opportunities there are for such ongoing evolution and hence for emergence.
