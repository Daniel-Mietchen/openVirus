<p>HIV emerged as a human infection sometime during the end of the 1800s and the early 1900s [

As discussed above, during the course of a single infection, HIV is able to adapt to escape from the selection pressures imposed by its host’s immune response. HIV variants that cannot be recognized by current host CTLs are termed “CTL escape mutants.” These mutants yield important information about the strength of the immune responses that they evade. However, since they were shown to transmit from one host to another, their status has been raised to potential drivers of evolutionary change across the global HIV pandemic [
