<p>This model’s behavior is easy to understand. The total numbers of susceptible and infectious people simply follow the well-characterized SI model. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.5a</xref> shows total cases through time. The total epidemic goes through three phases: an initial exponential growth, a saturation phase, and then settling to a long-term equilibrium. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.5b</xref> shows the proportion of all cases that are escape mutants through time. Not surprisingly, faster escape rates and slower reversion rates lead to higher prevalence of escape mutants. Less intuitive are the following characteristics of 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5.5b</xref>. Whilst the epidemic is in its exponential growth phase, so long as reversion rates are reasonably fast (say once in 10 years or faster), the prevalence of escape is expected to stabilize quite quickly. However, this is not a long-term equilibrium, and as the total epidemic turns over, the escape prevalence shifts again. For an epitope that escapes fast but reverts at an intermediate rate, this leads to a substantial drop in the prevalence of escape. Secondly, fixation of escape variants only occurs if they never revert, and even then fixation takes a very long time – much longer than it takes for the underlying epidemic to equilibrate. Thirdly, the predicted dynamics and equilibrium are very sensitive to the reversion rate when that is slow. Notice the big difference, in the long term, between no reversion (brown line) and average time to reversion of 50 years (yellow line).
