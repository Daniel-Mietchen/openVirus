<p>During the course of a single infection, HIV evolves to escape from the selection pressure imposed by host CTLs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this process, new HIV variants emerge that are not recognized by the host CTLs. These variants are called “CTL escape mutants.” These CTL escape mutants can be seen to grow out in hosts who mount relevant CTL responses (
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5.3</xref>) and to revert in hosts who do not. The rate of reversion in hosts without relevant CTL responses reflects the underlying fitness cost of the mutation. The rate of outgrowth in hosts who do mount relevant CTL responses is a balance between the efficacy of those responses and the fitness cost of the mutations. These costs and benefits need to be examined in the context of the underlying rate of turnover of HIV-infected cells. All this can be represented in a two-line mathematical model [
