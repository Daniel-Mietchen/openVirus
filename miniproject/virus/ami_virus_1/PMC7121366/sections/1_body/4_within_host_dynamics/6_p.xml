<p>It is straightforward to fit the analytic expression (12) to data on the outgrowth of escape mutants to obtain estimates of the quantity c − (a − â). 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure 5.3</xref> shows fitted curves with estimates of c − (a − â) of 0.048, 0.012, and 0.006. The quantity of interest is the parameter c – the rate at which CTL kills cells infected with wild-type virus. Fortunately, independent estimates of the fitness cost of the escape mutation (a − â) are available. The median of several such observations yields (a − â) = 0.005 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Taken together and combined with further data, the inference is that on average, a single CTL response kills infected cells at rate 0.02 per day.
