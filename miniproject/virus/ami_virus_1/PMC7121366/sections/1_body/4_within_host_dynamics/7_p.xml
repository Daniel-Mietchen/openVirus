<p>The half-life of an HIV-infected cell is about 1 day. This figure was itself derived from the application of elegantly simple models to data on the post-treatment dynamics of HIV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. If a single CTL response kills infected cells at rate 0.02 per day and their overall death rate is one, then just 2% of the death of infected cells can be attributed to killing by one CTL response. Patients will typically mount many responses – but probably not more than a dozen. This analysis shows that even though CTL responses are effective enough to drive viral evolution, they are, in quantitative terms, very weak. A vaccine to protect against HIV infection would have to elicit immune responses that are manyfold stronger than the natural responses detected in ongoing infection. This simple, model-based observation greatly helps understand why the vaccines trialed so far have failed.
