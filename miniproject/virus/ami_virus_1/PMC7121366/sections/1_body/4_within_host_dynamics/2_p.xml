<p>Several trials of prophylactic HIV vaccines have shown little or no effect [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and understanding why these vaccines failed is a major research priority [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A quantitative description of the interaction between HIV and host immune cells would be an asset to such understanding. For one component of host immunity – the cytotoxic T cell (CTL) response – such a description can be derived. The question is how effective are host CTL responses at killing HIV-infected cells? Not how many CTLs are present, nor which cytokines they secrete, but how fast do they kill HIV-infected cells?
