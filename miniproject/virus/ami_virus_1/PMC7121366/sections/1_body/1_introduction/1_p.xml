<p>Why is it that smallpox was eradicated in 1979 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] but measles, once scheduled for eradication by the year 2000, still kills over a hundred thousand children each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]? Both diseases can be prevented with cheap, safe, and effective vaccines which probably induce lifelong immunity, and neither virus has an environmental or animal reservoir.
