<p>One way to address this question is to consider the comparative ease of spread of the two infections. A useful parameter that summarizes this ease of spread is the â€œbasic reproductive number is the number of secondary infections caused during the entire duration of one infection if all contacts are susceptible (i.e., can be infected). The concept has widespread currency in the literature on infectious disease models with varying degrees of affection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. There is no question that it has been a useful, simple rule of thumb for characterizing how easily an infection can spread [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, the simplest of calculations relate R
 <sub>0</sub> to the degree of intervention needed to bring an infection under control and, eventually, eradicate it. The relationship between the basic reproductive number and disease control arises from the simple fact that if each infectious person causes less than one secondary case, then the number of infections must fall. If it is always true, even when there is no infection circulating, that each new case causes less than one secondary case, then the infection will die out. This simple observation leads to a straightforward calculation for the proportion of a population that must be vaccinated in order to achieve eradication, p
