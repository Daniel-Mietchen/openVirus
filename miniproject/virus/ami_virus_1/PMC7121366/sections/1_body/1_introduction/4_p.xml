<p>Comparing estimated values for R
 <sub>0</sub> for measles and smallpox and inferred values for the proportion that need to be vaccinated to ensure eradication (
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 5.1</xref>) leads to a simple answer to the question why has smallpox been eradicated, but not measles? Smallpox, with a basic reproductive number around three, was eradicated with vaccination coverage of around 67%. The higher R
 <sub>0</sub> for measles, nearer to 15, requires vaccination coverage close to 95% to ensure eradication. Many parts of the world remain unable to achieve such high coverage; measles remains suppressed by tremendous efforts at vaccination but is not yet eradicated.
