<p>This relationship arises from the fact that if (R
 <sub>0</sub> − 1) out of the R
 <sub>0</sub> people a case might have infected have been vaccinated, then each case, in a population vaccinated to that degree, will cause less than one secondary case. For example, say R
 <sub>0</sub> = 10, if 9/10 of the population are successfully immune following vaccination, then infection cannot spread. Thus, in general, p
 <sub>c</sub> = (R
 <sub>0</sub> − 1)/R
 <sub>0</sub>, as stated in 
 <xref rid="Equ1" ref-type="">Eq. 5.1</xref>. If the fraction of the population that are successfully vaccinated is greater than p
 <sub>c</sub>, then each case will cause, on average, less than one case, and infection cannot spread.
