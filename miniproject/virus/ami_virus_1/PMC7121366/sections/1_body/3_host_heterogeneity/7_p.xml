<p>On February 19, 2001, a vet in Essex reported suspected cases of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in pigs he had inspected at an abattoir. FMD is a highly infectious viral disease of cloven-hoofed animals. Because of its economic and welfare implications for livestock, FMD had been eradicated from Western Europe. The FMD outbreak that unfolded in the UK over the ensuing months had a huge impact with millions of farm animals killed and major economic impact in the countryside as tourism was virtually shut down.</p>
