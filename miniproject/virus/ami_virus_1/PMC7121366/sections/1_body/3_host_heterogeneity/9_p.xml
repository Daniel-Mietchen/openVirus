<p>Suppose all farms in the UK are listed and indexed with i. Then p
 <sub>i</sub>, the probability that an individual farm i becomes infected during one unit of time, is:

 </disp-formula>where β
 <sub>i</sub> is the susceptibility of farm i, determined by the number of sheep and cows it holds; τ
 <sub>j</sub> is the infectiousness of farm j, also determined by the number of sheep and cows it holds; and K (d
 <sub>ij</sub>) is a function of the distance between the pair of farms i and j which determines how quickly infectiousness falls off with increasing distance. K is known as the “infection kernel.” In the FMD example, the infection kernel was estimated from contact tracing data on farms that were sources of infection and their secondary cases. This observed relationship shows a very sharp falling off of infectiousness, with a farm just 2 km distant being less than tenfold as infectious to a susceptible farm than one that is adjacent.
