<p>There was heated debate about the best way to control the spread of infection from farm to farm. FMD virus is so very infectious that no attempt was made to control its spread within a farm. Once infection of livestock on a farm was detected, all susceptible animals were slaughtered. Mathematical models of the spread of this epidemic thus treat each farm as a unit of infection, and, as before, farms can be categorized as susceptible, infectious, etc. The best of these models [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] keeps track of every single farm in the United Kingdom, characterizing farms by their location and the number of sheep and cattle they hold. The model classifies farms into four groups: susceptible, incubating, infectious, or slaughtered. As in all epidemic models, the heart of the model is the per capita rate at which susceptible farms become infected â€“ the so-called force of infection. Because this FMD model is an individual-based, stochastic simulation, it is not possible to write out its equations in a simple form as before, but the probability of infection for a single farm can easily be written.
