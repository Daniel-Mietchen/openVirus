<p>This section describes just two of the possible heterogeneities that are often included when making models of the spread of epidemics. There is almost no end to how complex an epidemiological model can become. However, it is very easy for complex models to outstrip the data available to calculate their parameters. In some cases, this can mean that models become black boxes concealing ill-informed guesswork, rather than prisms unveiling the implications of well-sourced and well-understood data.</p>
