<p>Rubella is a directly transmitted viral infection that usually causes mild disease when contracted during childhood. However, infection of a woman during early pregnancy can lead to serious birth defects for her unborn child. The set of consequent conditions is labeled “congenital rubella syndrome” or CRS. Because vaccination acts to extend the time between epidemics (
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5.1b</xref>), it also acts to increase the average age at infection. This sets up a complex trade-off when introducing rubella vaccination to a community. On the one hand, vaccinated girls are protected from catching rubella at any age, but on the other hand, the girls who remain unvaccinated are likely to catch rubella when they are older, more likely to be in their childbearing years and so at greater risk of CRS. This means that vaccination with low coverage can actually lead to more CRS, and only when coverage levels get above a certain level do the benefits of vaccinating the community outweigh the costs. Calculating where that level lies then becomes an important public health question.
