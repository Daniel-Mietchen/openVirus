<p>Models with age structure akin to that presented in 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">Eqs. 5.5</xref>–
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="">5.7</xref> have been essential components of the planning of rubella vaccination strategies around the world [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. A model as simple as these equations would never be used for formulating policy; furthermore, most age-structured models use the continuous time and age versions and so have the structure of partial differential equations. Nevertheless, 
 <xref rid="Equ5" ref-type="">Eqs. 5.5</xref>–
 <xref rid="Equ7" ref-type="">5.7</xref> illustrate the fundamentals of how to include age in an epidemiological model.
