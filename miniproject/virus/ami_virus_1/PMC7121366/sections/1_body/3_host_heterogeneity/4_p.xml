<p>Notice how these equations, by taking account of age as well as time, allow consideration of several different kinds of age dependence. Firstly, 
 <xref rid="Equ6" ref-type="">Eq. 5.6</xref> calculates the number of cases of infection 
 <italic>of a given age</italic> over time. Since the main consideration in balancing up the pros and cons of rubella vaccination is the number of cases in women of childbearing age, this is an essential model output. Secondly, the per capita rate at which susceptibles become infected depends on their age and on the age of all the infected people. This model is thus able to take account of the complexities of family, school, and working life which drive people of different ages to age-dependent patterns of mixing. Thirdly, the recovery rate γ(a) and, more importantly, the background death rate μ(a) can both be made to depend on age. Since a fixed per capita death rate is a particularly bad approximation of human survival, this is another important advance on models without age structure.
