<p>The spatial distribution of hosts is another important aspect of their heterogeneity. If the units of infection are sessile (e.g., plants), the assumption that all hosts are equally likely to contact each other becomes particularly egregious and models that acknowledge the spatial location of hosts more important. One example of units of infection that do not move is farms. If trade between farms has been halted because of a disease outbreak, then disease transmission between farms is likely to be strongly dependent upon their location. This was the case during the 2001 foot-and-mouth disease epidemic in the UK, and spatial models of that epidemic are nice examples of how to explicitly include the distance between hosts in a model epidemic.</p>
