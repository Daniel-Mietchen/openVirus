<p>The ability to identify target vaccination levels predicted to lead to disease eradication has been widely influential in policy circles [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Models with the same fundamental structure as the SIR model are used to set targets for vaccination coverage in many settings [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similar models are also used to understand the likely impact of different interventions of other sorts, for example, drug treatment [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] or measures for social distancing [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, models for informing policy need to explore more of the wrinkles and complexities of the real world than are acknowledged in the simple equations of the SIR model. The next section describes some of the types of host heterogeneity that have been explored in making versions of the SIR model that aim to be better representations of the real world.
