<p>The assumptions of the SIR model are the following: People are born at a constant rate B, and a proportion p of them are vaccinated at birth. Vaccinated newborns are immune for life and so they join the recovered class. Unvaccinated newborns enter the susceptible class. Susceptibles are infected at a per capita rate proportional to I, the number of infectious people in the population. This gives rise to a transfer from the susceptible to the infectious class at rate βIS. Susceptibles are also subject to a per capita background death rate μ. Infectious people recover into the recovered class I at per capita rate γ or die at the per capita background death rate μ. Recovered individuals are immune for the rest of their lives, so the only exit from the recovered class is at the per capita background death rate μ.</p>
