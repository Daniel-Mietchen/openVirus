<p>This difference equation form is particularly easy to handle numerically and can be straightforwardly solved in a spreadsheet. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5.2a</xref> shows the solutions to 
 <xref rid="Equ2" ref-type="">Eqs. 5.2</xref>–
 <xref rid="Equ4" ref-type="">5.4</xref> over 50 years with a 1-week timestep. Parameters are set so that an infection with a basic reproductive number of 5 and a 1-week duration of infection is spreading in a population of 100,000 individuals. The figure illustrates how this model shows damped oscillations towards a stable state. The same is true for the ODE version of this model.
