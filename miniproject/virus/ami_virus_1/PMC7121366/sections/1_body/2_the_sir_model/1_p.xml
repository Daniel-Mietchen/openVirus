<p>The “plain vanilla” model of mathematical epidemiology is called the SIR model because it splits the host population into three groups:
 <list list-type="bullet">
  <list-item>
   <p>The susceptible (S) can be infected if exposed</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The infectious (I) are both infected and infectious to others</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The recovered (R) are no longer infectious and are immune to further infection</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
</p>
