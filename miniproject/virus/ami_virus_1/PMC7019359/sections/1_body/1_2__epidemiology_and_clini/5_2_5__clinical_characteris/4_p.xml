<p>Respiratory viruses can interact with each other or bacteria affecting predisposition to severe respiratory disease, particularly in patients with underlying immunodeficiency or chronic respiratory disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cystic fibrosis [

 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. The possible role of ICV in bacterial–viral or viral–viral respiratory co-infection is of interest but is not well understood. In a study of 706 infants &lt;2 years old hospitalized with respiratory illness, 6 patients had influenza C virus infection, and 3 were co-infected with RSV or adenovirus [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. While the low number of patients hospitalized with ICV and co-infection with another respiratory pathogen may minimize the role of ICV in respiratory infection leading to hospitalization, few studies have been performed and uncertainty remains.
