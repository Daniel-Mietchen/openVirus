<p>Seropositivity studies have provided key insights into the epidemiology of ICV but have several limitations including limited ability to determine time of infection. This makes it difficult to identify active infection, describe symptoms, isolate virus for molecular epidemiology, or determine seasonality. Recent epidemiologic studies have taken advantage of improved cell culture techniques and RT-PCR as a means of detecting ICV and have provided further insight into the characteristics of active ICV infection. Until recently, cell culture has been used as the primary method of detecting ICV cases and outbreaks, including many studies in Japan [

 <xref rid="B61-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, the weak cytopathic effect of ICV makes it difficult to detect, resulting in underestimation of burden [

Seroepidemiology studies of ICV infection measuring hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers have been key in demonstrating the widespread nature of ICV circulation and infection. Within the last decade, highly sensitive nucleic acid detection (RT-PCR) methods have been developed for the detection of ICV [

 <xref rid="B64-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In a study comparing RT-PCR to cell culture detection of ICV, RT-PCR detection rate was nearly twice that of cell culture and samples with lower viral load were more likely to be detected with sensitive nucleic acid methods [
