<p>Similar findings were reported in another US study that included sera from 237 subjects in 4 age groups: 1 to 2 years (36%), 2 to 5 years (47.2%), 20 to 30 years (96%), and 65 to 85 years (66.7). The highest level of seropositivity was found among young adults (20–30 years), while low ICV HAI titers and decreased seropositivity in those 65–85 years of age may suggest waning ICV immunity in the elderly [

HAI antibodies were detected in 61% of samples overall with the highest rate of seropositivity found among those 16–30 years of age (76%), while young children (&lt;15 years) and older adults (51–88 years) had lower rates of seropositivity (46% and 44% respectively) [
