<p>In the decade following initial recognition of ICV, studies reporting ICV outbreaks and seroprevalence suggested that ICV infection was widespread among children in the US and England [

 <xref rid="B73-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. A Japanese study including 434 individuals showed seropositivity of 100% among infants &lt;6 months old, presumably maternally derived, dropping to a nadir by 6 months. Increases in ICV seroprevalence began to rise notably by one year of age and by age 7–10 years, 80–90% of children were seropositive [

A California group reported an ICV outbreak that was first detected among healthcare workers and tested 334 serum samples from participants &lt;1 to 25 years of age. Seropositivity increased with age, with 64% seropositivity in children 0–5, 96% in children 6–10, and 98% in adults 16–25 years. Stability of HAI titer across age groups suggested periodic reinfection that maintained antibody titers [
