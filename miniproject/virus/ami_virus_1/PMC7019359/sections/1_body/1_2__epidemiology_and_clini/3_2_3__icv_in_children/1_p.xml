<p>A number of studies have focused on pediatric populations. As noted above, seroepidemiology shows that the majority of primary ICV infection occurs during early childhood. An early study from Japan noted most patients were around one year old [

 <xref rid="B90-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. A Japanese longitudinal study of 190 ICV isolates collected over seven years found that nearly all were &lt;6 years old, with the highest rates of infection in children 1–2 years old [
 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Rates of detection of ICV in outpatient or hospitalized children with acute respiratory illness have ranged from 0.7–10% in studies from Australia, Canada, Cuba, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, Peru, Scotland, and Spain [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Most of these studies found higher rates of ICV infection in younger children. Several studies have reported ICV as a cause of radiographic pneumonia in children, in some series as frequently as IBV [

 <xref rid="B102-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. These widely varied rates are likely due to varying circulation of ICV in different years; several studies have reported large outbreaks in a single year [
