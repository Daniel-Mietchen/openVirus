<p>Influenza C virus (ICV) is lesser known type of influenza virus that commonly causes cold-like symptoms and sometimes causes lower respiratory infection, especially in children &lt;2 years of age [
 <xref rid="B1-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. ICV is mainly a human pathogen; however, the virus has been detected in pigs, dogs, and cattle, and rare swine–human transmission has been reported [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. ICV seropositivity has been found to be as high as 90% by 7–10 years of age, suggesting that most people are exposed to influenza C virus at least once during childhood [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Although ICV was discovered in 1947, disease burden has been poorly described until recently due to difficulty isolating the virus in cell culture [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Human challenge studies confirmed that ICV caused upper respiratory disease and immune responses [
 <xref rid="B14-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The recent development of RT-PCR for ICV detection has resulted in expanded understanding of ICV clinical characteristics, seasonality, and molecular epidemiology. A related novel influenza D virus (IDV), was discovered in swine in Oklahoma in 2011 and has been detected in other mammals [

 <xref rid="B19-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; however, while cattle workers exhibit seropositivity, no definitive evidence of productive human infection with IDV has been reported [

 <xref rid="B21-viruses-12-00089" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of ICV.
