<p>ICV is an important respiratory pathogen of childhood, though there are wide variations in prevalence from year to year and in different regions. While the most common manifestation of ICV infection is upper respiratory infection, severe lower respiratory infection does occur. Co-infection with other viral and bacterial pathogens is frequent, making the causal role of ICV in these cases uncertainty. Larger scale studies describing year-to-year prevalence, clinical characteristics, and strain type are needed. ICV exhibits minimal antigenic drift over time, suggesting that a monovalent vaccine could be effective against childhood infection.</p>
