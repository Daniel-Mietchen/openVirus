<p id="Par11">Live-born data was aggregated by 400 socioeconomically homogeneous microregions, as defined by the census bureau. As dengue fever counts are organized by epidemiological week, the first approach was to use this time scale (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). Maps (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>) present the overall microcephaly rate per 10,000 live-born babies and dengue fever incidence per 100,000 inhabitants by microregion in the three selected Brazilian macroregions: NE, Central-West (CW) and Southeast (SE).
