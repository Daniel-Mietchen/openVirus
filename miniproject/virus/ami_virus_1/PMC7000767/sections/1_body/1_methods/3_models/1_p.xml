<p id="Par12">Using the microcephaly counts as the dependent variable and the total number of live births as offset, we fitted four random-effects models varying the likelihood: Poisson, Negative Binomial, zero-inflated Poisson and zero-inflated Negative Binomial. Two random-effects components were included in the model: the first is a time-varying coefficient for the time since the last big dengue epidemic modelled as a second-order random walk to allow a smooth non-linear behaviour. The second random-effects component was an independent and identically distributed Gaussian random effect by microregion. Vague priors were used and the inference was done under the Bayesian approach using the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA)
