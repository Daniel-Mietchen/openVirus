<p id="Par14">In brief, the model evaluates the number of microcephaly cases, considering the total number of live births as offset, and dengue fever epidemics with an incidence above 400/100,000 between one and fourteen years prior as an explanatory variable. The model included two random effects: (1) microregion random effects considering both a spatial structured random effect and an unstructured one, allowing for spatial dependence and extra-variability, and (2) spline-like random effects for the time, in years, since the last dengue epidemic in each region.</p>
