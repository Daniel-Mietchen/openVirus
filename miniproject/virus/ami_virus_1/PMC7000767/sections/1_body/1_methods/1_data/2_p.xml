<p id="Par6">The neonates’ data are collected by the Brazilian Live Births Information System (SINASC), which includes a field to inform the presence of an observed malformation and five fields to classify the condition. Since, at the time, CZS did not have a specific code, we considered as a microcephaly case a live-born with the microcephaly code “Q02” (10
 <sup>th</sup> edition of the ICD) in any of the five fields. We compared the number of microcephaly cases between 2015–2016, considered the epidemic period, to the 2014 data, both in the exploratory analysis and the maps.
