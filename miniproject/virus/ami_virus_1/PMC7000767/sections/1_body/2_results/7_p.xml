<p id="Par22">The random effect estimated for each microregion, as presented in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>, suggests that the dengue fever epidemic effect is not enough to explain the large number of microcephaly cases in some areas in the NE. The Supplemental material presents the results of different models, exploring dengue epidemic definitions from 100 to 600/100,000 inhabitants and other statistical distributions. Blue areas are those with a lower rate of microcephaly cases than predicted by the time lag after the last dengue fever epidemic, while orange/red areas are the opposite. In some areas, the estimated random effect is above two standard deviations, mostly spatially concentrated in the NE region.
