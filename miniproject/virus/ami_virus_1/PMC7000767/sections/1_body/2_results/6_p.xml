<p id="Par21">To estimate the association between both indicators – microcephaly rate and previous dengue fever incidence – we estimated the effect of the time lag between the most recent large dengue epidemic and the microcephaly epidemic. Figure 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> presents the main results of this article: the credibility time interval since the last dengue fever epidemic above 400 cases/100,000 inhabitants over the rate of microcephalic neonates. This finding suggests a protective effect up to 6 years prior to an increased risk from 7 to 12 years.
