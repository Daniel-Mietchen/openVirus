 </sup>. However, the time interval between the infections and the anti-DENV antibody titres were not considered in the analysis. Our findings indicate that a previous dengue fever epidemic may be related to microcephaly incidence and reinforce the idea of a window of cross-protection and a window of increased risk. Our window of protection is wider than detected in a longitudinal analysis of human immune sera, which showed a cross-neutralizing antibody response to ZIKV on DENV-immune subjects 1â€“3 years after DENV infection

 </sup>. The larger window at the ecological level is possibly an effect of herd immunity and of multiple exposures to DENV that would boost immunity. This is consistent with a case-control study in which the DENV seroprevalence and the mean number of neutralized serotypes (indicative of multiple exposures) were significantly lower among mothers of neonates with CZS
