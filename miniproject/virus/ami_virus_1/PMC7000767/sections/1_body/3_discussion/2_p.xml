<p id="Par24">Our hypothesis considers that the antibody decay due to the time interval between infections changes the role of anti-DENV antibodies on ZIKV infection, either to protect or to increase the risk (possibly via antibody-dependent enhancement – ADE), as illustrated in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>. This hypothesis is based on what is described for sequential heterotypic DENV infections (there are four DENV serotypes). It has been established that a narrow range of pre-existing anti-DENV antibody titres is associated with the risk of severe dengue disease, while high titres protect against clinical illness

 </sup>. As the antibody titres decay over time, there is a window of cross-protection between the DENV serotypes. A previous study found that a shorter interval between first and second infections was associated with protection from clinical illness

 <sup>+</sup> T cells from previous exposure also seems to play a role against ZIKV. Mice primed with DENV and 30 days later challenged with ZIKV during pregnancy presented reduced burden in maternal and fetal tissues, and increased fetal viability compared to non-immune mice. DENV-immune CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells were required for this cross-protection. However, mice challenged 80 days after DENV priming were not protected, indicating the transient nature of cross-protection again
