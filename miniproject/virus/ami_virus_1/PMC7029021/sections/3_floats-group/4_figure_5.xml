  <p>Histopathological changes in the lungs of BALB/c mice. The lung histopathology in each group; six mice were sacrificed at 5 dpi, and their lungs were removed and fixed with 10% formalin. Thin sections of paraffin-embedded lung tissues were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Representative sections (magnification 200x) are shown. Compared with non-infected mice, all groups of infected mice showed swelling of bronchiolar epithelial cells, alveolar dilation and extensive infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages surrounding the bronchioles and higher mean scores. a-f represent the control group, genotype A alone, genotype B alone, genotype A:B = 50:50; genotype A:B = 20:80 and genotype A:B = 80:20. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Inflammation scores for lung histopathology in BALB/c mice. The inflammatory response was significantly more dramatic compared to that in the DMEM control group (P &lt; 0.01). In addition, there were no differences among the five infected groups (P &gt; 0.05).
