  <p>Airway responsiveness of BALB/c mice. Lower dosages of methacholine (3.125 and 6.25 mg/ml) produced no differences (P &gt; 0.05) between the control group and the infected groups, but higher doses of methacholine (12.5, 25, and 50 mg/ml) produced differences (P &lt; 0.05). There were no differences among the five infected groups (P &gt; 0.05). Control group: Black solid inverted triangles; Genotype A alone: Red solid squares; Genotype B alone: Blue solid triangles; Genotype A:B = 50:50: Green solid circles; Genotype A:B = 20:80: Purple solid diamonds; Genotype A:B = 80:20: Orange solid squares.</p>
