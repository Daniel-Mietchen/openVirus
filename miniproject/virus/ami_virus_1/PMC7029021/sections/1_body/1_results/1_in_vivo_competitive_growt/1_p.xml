<p id="Par7">To determine whether competitive replication occurred 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we divided the mice into six groups. Three groups were given nasal drops with different proportions of mixed strains (genotype A:B) as 50:50, 20:80 and 80:20; Two groups dropped with genotype A and genotype B; one group dropped with DMEM (Virus preservation solution) as control group. If the copy numbers were too low, the detection accuracy could not be guaranteed. When the virus copy numbers in the lung were less than 10
 <sup>3</sup>, the competitive experiment was terminated. A similar alternation in terms of the predomination of genotypes A and B could be seen in the mouse model. When A:B = 50:50 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>), the proportion of genotype A decreased from day 1 to 8, but after day 8, it increased from 4.54% (day 6) to 63.74% (day 17); by day 20, it had decreased to 44.90%, and genotype B was predominant.
