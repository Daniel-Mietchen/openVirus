<p id="Par8">After the adjustment of the input ratio of the A:B genotypes to 20:80 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>), the proportion of A was increased on day 1 and decreased from day 2 to day 8; however, during this process, the proportion of A increased slowly and was higher than 20% on day 13. Regarding the group with an input ratio of 80:20 (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1C</xref>), the two genotypes alternated in terms of their proportions. The proportion of genotype B increased slowly and was higher than 50% on day 13, but decreased on day 17, then increased to 72% on day 20. In a word, hMPV can only survive for 3 weeks in mice. Regardless of the initial proportion of subtype B, after competing with subtype A, type B would dominate finally and show an absolute growth advantage.
