<p id="Par12">The results (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) showed that there were no differences between the control group and any of the infection groups when dosages of methacholine of 3.125 and 6.25 mg/ml were administered (P &gt; 0.05). However, when the concentration of methacholine was higher than 12.5 mg/ml, there was a significant difference between the infection groups and the control group (P &lt; 0.05). At concentrations of 25 and 50 mg/ml, there was significantly higher airway responsiveness in all infection groups than in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). Nevertheless, there were no differences among the five infected groups (P &gt; 0.05).
