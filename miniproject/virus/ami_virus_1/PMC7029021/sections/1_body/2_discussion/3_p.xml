<p id="Par20">We analysed the global trends in terms of hMPV subtypes, and the statistical results were consistent with those of a previous study that reported an alternating trend in the global hMPV subtypes over ten years

 </sup>. The statistical results for the two subtypes indicated that subtypes A and B of hMPV alternate in terms of prevalence, and each epidemic can last for 1–3 years. This result was also compared with those of previous studies

 </sup>. Many researchers have studied the alternation of genotype prevalence of hMPV and the most discussed reason for this phenomenon is environmental changes and human immunity
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>
 </sup>. Viral evolution and escape are also thought to play a role in this phenomenon

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>
 </sup>. In summary, studies of the epidemiological distribution, alternation of the genotype predominance and genetic diversity of hMPV have been conducted all over the world, but these studies have mainly involved patients with clinical manifestations of respiratory infection, and no basic research has been conducted to explain the occurrence of this phenomenon
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>
 </sup>. Studies have shown that such alternation may be related to virus-to-host immune escape, and persistent infection or a high viral load is easily detected, which leads to the neglect of low-load subtypes. The differences in the genetic structure of hMPV and immunization against viruses caused a seasonal shift in the predominant genotype and led to the maintenance of infection rates

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>,
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>
 </sup>. If we can determine how hMPV genotypes interact, this may be helpful for epidemic detection, treatment and prevention. We try to focus on the virus itself firstly and explore whether the interaction mechanism between A and B subtypes will affect this alternation.
