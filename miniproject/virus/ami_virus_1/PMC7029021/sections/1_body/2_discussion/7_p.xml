<p id="Par24">Regrettably, there were still several limitations in our experiments. First, we verified the phenomenon using a single model. We used only the Vero-E6 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> system and BALB/c mice for the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments, and additional cell lines and animal models needed to be studied. Second, we monitored the animal model for only 20 days, because in previous studies, we found that the hMPV can only survive in mice for 2â€“3 weeks. If we find a way to extend the survival time of the hMPV in mice, the results may be more consistent with the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> results. Third, in animal experiments, host immunity can interfere with the impact of hMPV subtype competition on hMPV alternating epidemics. We tried to use the immunosuppressant cyclophosphamide to suppress the immunity of mice, but the use of the inhibitor caused a large number of deaths in mice. We are still looking for suitable inhibitors to suppress the immunity of mice to verify the effect of hMPV subtype competition on alternating epidemics simply. Fourth, the statistical analysis of hMPV global epidemiology may be incomplete, and some reports did not subdivide the subtypes, which may have led to insufficient data for the statistical analysis. Therefore, the actual relationships between hMPV epidemiology, disease severity and genotype alternation need to be further explored.
