<p id="Par23">There has been a contradictory phenomenon 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>; genotype alternation predominated was observed first and then subtype A became the predominant strain in the cell model, but genotype B predominated in animal experiment. We speculate that the reason for this disparity may be that the cell infected with virus as a simple model, and the final result is only related to the different mixing ratios of the hMPV two subtypes. In animal experiments, even if we control the external environment and diet of each group to be the same, the final result is related to the virus subtype addition ratio and the host immunity. Obviously, in animal experiments, subtype B shows a stronger adaptability. This is inconsistent with the conclusion that subtype A is the dominant strain in human

 </sup>. It may be that the hMPV dominant strain is different in different populations, or that our experiment time is too short

 </sup>. In a word, our experiments showed that the competition exist between the two subtypes and this competition could affect the alternation of genotype prevalence.
