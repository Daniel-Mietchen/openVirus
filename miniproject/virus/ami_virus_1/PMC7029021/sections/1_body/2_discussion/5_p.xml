<p id="Par22">Then we performed a subtype competitive replication experiment in cells, and wanted to verify this phenomenon 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. In the cell model (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref>), different input ratios were used to infect Vero-E6 cells, and the viral titer of the two genotypes were detected. Genotype shifts were observed at input ratios of 50:50, 20:80 80:20, 10:100 and 100:10. The proportion of genotype A rose, fell and finally rose again until genotype B could not be detected. Even when A:B = 10:100 and the initial proportion of A was only 1/10 of that of B, it was also possible to gradually obtain a growth advantage and finally for A to become the predominant genotype. In the A:B = 100:10 group, due to the absolute initial proportion of genotype A being very large, the proportion of genotype A did not increase and decline but first decreased and then increased. Based on the above, in spite of the A and B genotypes having different initial proportions, the genotype ratio trends were the same; that is, the proportion of A first increased and then decreased and finally predominated. At the same time, the proportion of genotype B decreased, which was followed by an increase, until finally B disappeared at the detection end point. In summary, we observed the competition of the two hMPV genotypes, type A and B were alternately predominant in cell in the first four generations, and subtype A became predominant strain in the end.
