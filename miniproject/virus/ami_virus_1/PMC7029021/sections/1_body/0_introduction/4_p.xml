<p id="Par5">Despite the common worldwide of hMPV alternating epidemics, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Many researchers have suggested that virus alternating epidemic may be related to the environmental-climate change, host immunity and susceptibility, and the bottleneck effect of the virus transmission process

 </sup>. The above reasons are “external factors” of this alternating epidemic, “internal factors” include virus escape, virus evolution, and interactions between virus subtypes. Co-circulation of the two genotypes of hMPV was usually observed and the interactions between them such as competitive growth might play a role in the formation of alternation

 </sup>. However, there is no study about it. Most studies of the alternation of the A/B strains during epidemics have been focused on clinical investigations of hMPV strains isolated from symptomatic patients that involved genotyping and statistical analysis, and there was no basic experimental evidence
