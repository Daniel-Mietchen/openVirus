 </sup>. hMPV is a negative sense, single-stranded RNA virus with a genome that is approximately 13 kb in length that encodes eight genes and nine proteins, including the following genes and proteins, respectively: N, nucleocapsid; P, phosphoprotein; M, matrix; F, fusion; SH, small hydrophobic; G, glycoprotein; and L, polymerase and M2-1 and M2-2. Based on the genetic variability and phylogenetic analysis of the G gene and the F gene, hMPV is classified as one of two major genotypes, hMPV-A and hMPV-B, which are subdivided into four subgroups (A1, A2, B1 and B2)
