<p id="Par29">We carried out the test in batches because of the large number of animals. BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old, female) were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of Chongqing Medical University and were divided into six groups: 54 mice each experimental group(A, B, C, D, E) and 6 mice in control group(F). Each mouse was infected intranasally with 50 μl 1.0 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies/ml of virus after being anesthetized with chloral hydrate. Group A received NL/1/00, group B received NL/1/99, group C received a 50:50 mixture of NL/1/00 and NL/1/99, group D received a 20:80 mixture of strains, group E received a 80:20 mixture of strains, and group F was the control group and received 50 μl DMEM. The mice were housed in groups in individual ventilated cages (IVC). Each group of mice were sacrificed at different times post infection (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 13, 17, and 20 days); 6 mice were sacrificed every time from each group, the lung tissue of the mice were extracted to measure viral load. This competition experiments found that the clinical manifestations of mice were most obvious on the fourth and fifth days after hMPV infection, so airway responsiveness experiments were performed on the fourth day after infection, and lung tissue was extracted on the fifth day for pulmonary histopathology.
