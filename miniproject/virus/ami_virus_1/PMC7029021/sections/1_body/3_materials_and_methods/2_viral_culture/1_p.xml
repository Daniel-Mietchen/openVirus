<p id="Par27">hMPV NL/1/00 (virus genotype A) and NL/1/99 (virus genotype B) were kindly provided by Professor Fouchier (Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands) and were prepared using the reverse genetics method as described previously

 </sup>. Viruses were used to infect Vero-E6 cells, which were incubated at 37 °C and cultured in DMEM in the presence of 3% FBS (Invitrogen, USA), 2 mM L-glutamine, and 5 μg/ml trypsin (Sigma, USA). Five days after infection, the culture was ultra-centrifuged at 250,000 rpm at 4 °C for 12 h using a Beckman ultracentrifuge. NL/1/00 and NL/1/99 were respectively quantified by 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCID50) and real-time PCR. The concentrations of NL/1/00 and NL/1/99 were 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies/ml. Then, the two viral strains were mixed to generate three different proportions of hybrid virus strains at ratios of (A:B) 50:50, 20:80, 80:20, 10:100 and 100:10 on the basis of the real-time PCR results.
