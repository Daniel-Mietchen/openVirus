<p id="Par37">Data obtained from the competitive replication experiments are expressed as the mean and standard deviation. Mixed linear models were used to compare the weight changes and viral loads after infection in different groups of animals at different time points. General linear models were used for comparisons of data obtained from noninvasive measurements of airway responsiveness. A rank correlation test was used for the analysis of the data for pulmonary histopathology.</p>
