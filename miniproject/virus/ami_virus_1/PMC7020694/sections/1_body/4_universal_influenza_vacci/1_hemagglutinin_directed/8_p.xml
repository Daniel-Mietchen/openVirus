<p>An important challenge for HA stalk-directed vaccines is whether these vaccine strategies are capable of providing protection against strains from both HA groups. As described above, HA stalk-directed antibodies often provide HA group-specific protection. While the ability to provide protection against a broad range of influenza virus strains within a given HA subtype is a vast improvement over approved seasonal vaccines, this still falls short of providing universal influenza virus protection. Another important consideration involves providing protection for both influenza A and B virus strains. While the HA stalk-directed approaches described above demonstrate protection against influenza A viruses, protection against influenza B strains is not always addressed. A truly universal vaccine should be able to provide protection against both influenza A and B strains. Therefore, current universal vaccine research should be cognizant of the need to elicit protection for both types of influenza viruses. Antibodies targeting the HA stalk domain have been shown to be protective against influenza B strains, with the human monoclonal antibody CR9114 demonstrating protection against lethal challenge from both influenza A and B strains (

While this study does not provide evidence for protection against influenza A strains, it further serves to highlight the potential for vaccination approaches that improve upon the breadth of protection provided by the current seasonal vaccination strategies. It would be interesting to examine whether combining influenza A mHAs and influenza B mHAs into a single vaccine might provide even greater protection for both influenza A and B strains than the current inactivated quadrivalent vaccine.
