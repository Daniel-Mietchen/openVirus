<p>A major hurdle in developing effective vaccine strategies targeting the HA stalk domain is overcoming the poor immunogenicity of the HA stalk domain, as in the context of full-length HA, antibodies are mainly produced toward the highly immunogenic HA head domain (

Studies performed in the 1980s with monoclonal antibodies that were cross reactive against H1 and H2 subtypes of HA demonstrated that a vaccine approach targeting the stem region of HA can provide broad protection and overcome the limitation of antigenic drift (
