<p>Another method of improving exposure of the HA stalk domain involves the generation of chimeric HAs (cHA) that express the head domain from one virus strain and the stalk domain of another. This method involves sequential immunization with constructs that express the same stalk domain but different “exotic” head domains, thereby specifically stimulating stalk-directed antibody responses to induce broader protection than strain-specific HA head directed antibodies generated by seasonal vaccines (

Ferrets vaccinated with cHA demonstrated greater protection against the pandemic H1N1 challenge as compared to ferrets immunized with two doses of a seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine, demonstrating improved protection elicited by the cHA vaccination approach (

Despite the lack of protection across different HA groups, the cHA approach shows promise for human vaccination and has been recently evaluated in human clinical trials. The outcome of the human clinical trials is still being evaluated (
