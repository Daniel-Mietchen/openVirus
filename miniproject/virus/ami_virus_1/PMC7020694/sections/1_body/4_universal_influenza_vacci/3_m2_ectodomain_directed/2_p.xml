<p>As with NA and the HA stalk, M2e-directed immune responses must overcome the highly immunogenic HA head domain. In addition, while M2 is abundantly expressed on the cell surface of infected cells, M2 is less abundant on the virion itself, a challenge for eliciting robust immune responses in LAIV approaches due to the reduced availability of M2 on the LAIV virion (

Previous attempts to improve M2e-directed immune responses involved the use of several viral vectors including papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) carrying M2e, HPV VLPs conjugated to the M2 protein, or VLPs derived from the RNA phage QÎ² that display the M2e protein (

These M2e-based vaccines elicited M2 specific antibody responses and protected mice against influenza A virus challenge, highlighting the importance of M2e mediated protection and the importance of considering the M2e protein when formulating universal influenza vaccines (

 <xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">Denis et al., 2008</xref>). Another approach to improve M2e antibody responses involved expressing a membrane anchored tandem repeat of M2e epitope sequences of human, swine, and avian origin on recombinant baculovirus VLPs (M2e5x VLP) (

 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). The M2e5x VLPs induced M2e-specific antibody responses against H1N1, H3N2, and H5N1 and conferred protection in mice against both H1N1 and H3N2 challenges (
 <xref rid="ref61" ref-type="bibr">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Recently, combinatorial vaccination with both M2e5x VLPs and HA-VLPs generated higher antibody titers, reduced lung inflammation, and provided improved protection against lethal challenge with H5N1 as compared to M2e5x VLP alone (
 <xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">Kang et al., 2019</xref>). While this study did not address whether these responses were greater than with HA-VLP vaccination alone, this study demonstrated the utility of combinatorial vaccination approaches to induce broader protection. The M2e5x approach was taken a step further by supplementing an attenuated pandemic A/Netherlands/602/09 LAIV with M2e5x VLPs (
 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). This strategy showed improved protection from morbidity and mortality in mice following viral challenge as compared to vaccination with LAIV alone (
 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, incorporating LAIV into this approach allowed for induction of T-cell responses, providing an additional layer of protection against influenza viruses in the respiratory tract (
 <xref rid="ref67" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). As with NA-directed approaches, the question remains whether M2e vaccines are able to provide meaningful protection in humans when M2e directed antibodies are only shown to reduce disease severity. Likewise, the modest protection provided by M2e vaccines is a limitation for this vaccination approach as is the breadth of influenza strain protection. While M2e vaccination approaches may not provide as strong of protection as other methods, an exciting possibility for M2e approaches involves the inclusion of M2e into other vaccine strategies. This approach should be considered in the development of other vaccines to enhance the immunogenicity and protection against a broader range of influenza viruses.
