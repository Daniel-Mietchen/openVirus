<p>The third surface protein on the influenza virion is the M2 protein. M2 is encoded by the M segment, which encodes M1 from unspliced mRNA and M2 protein by mRNA splicing (
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">Fields et al., 2013</xref>). M2 forms homotetramers and possesses ion channel activity that allows for acidification of the inside of the virion during endocytosis and facilitates the dissociation of the matrix protein M1 from viral ribonucleoprotein complexes (
