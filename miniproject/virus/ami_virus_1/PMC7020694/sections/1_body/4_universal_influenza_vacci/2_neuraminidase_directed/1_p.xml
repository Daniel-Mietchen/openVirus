<p>The second major surface protein for influenza A virus is the NA protein, which has an important role in facilitating virus release from the host cell. The sialidase or neuraminidase activity of NA helps cleave the terminal sialic acids from glycans and thereby facilitate virion release from infected cells (

 <sup>Â®</sup>) and zanamivir, both of which target the enzymatic activity of NA and are effective against both influenza A and B virus strains. Mutations that render NA resistant to the aforementioned drugs have been reported. While NA is also capable of undergoing antigenic changes, these changes occur at a much slower rate than those observed with HA (
