<p>In comparison to the surface glycoproteins of influenza virus, the internal proteins show higher degrees of conservation among influenza viruses and are often targeted by the antigen-specific CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells and CD4
 <sup>+</sup> helper T lymphocytes. Given the importance of T cells in protection against influenza virus infection, vaccines stimulating influenza specific T-cell immunity have been explored as a promising avenue for improving influenza vaccine efficacy and developing a universal influenza vaccine.
