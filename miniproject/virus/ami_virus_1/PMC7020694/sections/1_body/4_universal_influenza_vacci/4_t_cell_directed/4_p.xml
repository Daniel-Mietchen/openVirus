<p>Recently, another viral vector-based vaccine approach has been described using the live-attenuated vaccinia Wyeth backbone expressing HA, NA, M1, M2, and NP from H5N1 along with IL-15 as an adjuvant (

 <sup>+</sup> T cells at the time of vaccination or challenge, vaccinated mice showed reduced survival, suggesting that CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are required for this vaccine-mediated protection (

 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from human PBMCs, highlighting its potential for protection in humans as well (
