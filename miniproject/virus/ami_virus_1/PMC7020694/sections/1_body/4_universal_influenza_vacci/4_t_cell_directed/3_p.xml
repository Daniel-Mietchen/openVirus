<p>As with the other vaccine approaches, there have been attempts to generate T-cell-based influenza vaccines through the use of viral vectors. One approach currently in clinical trials involves the use of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) that encodes influenza proteins NP and M1 (MVA – NP + M1) (
