<p>While vaccination remains the most efficient method to provide protection against influenza virus infection, there is also significant interest in developing more broadly protective therapeutic methods for prevention and treatment of influenza virus infection. A growing area of interest involves utilizing broadly neutralizing antibodies to protect against influenza virus infection. As with influenza vaccines, a significant focus on broadly neutralizing antibody research revolves around the development of HA stem targeting antibodies, in particular antibodies that neutralize both Group 1 and Group 2 influenza virus HAs. Despite the fact that the majority of neutralizing antibodies targeting the HA stem only protect against Group 1 or Group 2 HAs, HA targeting antibodies capable of neutralizing both phylogenetic groups have been identified (

 <xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">Joyce et al., 2016</xref>). Further improvements in broadly neutralizing antibody discovery have enabled the development of novel therapies, several of which are currently in different stages of clinical trials. For example, one study was able to identify four broadly neutralizing influenza A antibodies through the activation and enrichment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells from vaccinated donors (

 <xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, co-administration of oseltamivir and the antibody after lethal challenge significantly improved the survival of mice as compared to either therapy alone, demonstrating a potential avenue for improving current therapies through co-administration of both antivirals and neutralizing antibodies (
 <xref rid="ref82" ref-type="bibr">Nakamura et al., 2013</xref>). Using a novel antibody design approach, another broadly neutralizing HA antibody, VIS410, was engineered and shown to bind both Group 1 and Group 2 HAs (

 <xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">Tharakaraman et al., 2015</xref>). These studies also demonstrated improved protection when co-administered with oseltamivir (
 <xref rid="ref109" ref-type="bibr">Tharakaraman et al., 2015</xref>). When administered post infection, VIS401-treated mice showed reduced clinical symptoms of influenza virus infection, including decreased viral spread and reduced damage in the lungs (
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">Baranovich et al., 2016</xref>). VIS401 is currently under clinical trials. MEDI8852 is another broadly neutralizing antibody targeting the HA stem that has been shown to interact with both Group 1 and Group 2 HAs (
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Kallewaard et al., 2016</xref>). Even when administered 4 days post lethal virus challenge, MEDI8852 treatment improved survival of mice and protected against several different influenza A virus strains (
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Kallewaard et al., 2016</xref>). Similar results were observed in ferrets, with MEDI8852 providing protection against lethal challenge when administered up to 3 days post infection, further underscoring the therapeutic potential of this antibody (
 <xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">Kallewaard et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to several HA targeting monoclonal antibodies, a M2e targeting antibody, TCN-032, is currently in clinical trials (
 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>). Healthy human volunteers infected with H3N2 and treated with TCN-032 exhibited reduced viral shedding and reduced clinical symptoms (
 <xref rid="ref89" ref-type="bibr">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>). While the broadly neutralizing antibodies in these studies show promise in providing protection in humans, the studies fail to address the potential for the development of escape mutants that are able to evade antibody neutralization following treatment with these antibodies. Studies examining whether prolonged treatment with these antibodies leads to resistance are important in determining whether these therapeutics can truly provide meaningful protection for a wide range of individuals. Together, these studies underscore the potential for utilizing broadly neutralizing antibodies to improve clinical outcomes of influenza virus infection.
