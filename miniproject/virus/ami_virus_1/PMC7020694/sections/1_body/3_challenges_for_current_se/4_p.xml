<p>Another alternative to egg grown vaccine approaches involves the use of DNA and mRNA vaccines. While none are currently approved for use, DNA and mRNA vaccines can be manufactured synthetically, allowing for quicker production times than egg and cell-culture grown vaccines (

 <xref rid="ref66" ref-type="bibr">Ledgerwood et al., 2011</xref>). In fact, several of the universal vaccination methods described in this review utilize DNA prime-boost vaccination to improve immune responses. Likewise, mRNA-based vaccines show potential as an alternative vaccination approach. An example of an mRNA-based approach includes RNActive
 <sup>®</sup> vaccines. RNActive
 <sup>®</sup> vaccines are mRNA vaccines complexed with protamine, which allow for the mRNA to acts as a “self-adjuvant” through interaction with TLR7 (

 <sup>®</sup> vaccine encoding the full-length PR8 HA has been shown to induce IgG antibodies against PR8 HA and provide protection against homologous PR8 viral challenge (
