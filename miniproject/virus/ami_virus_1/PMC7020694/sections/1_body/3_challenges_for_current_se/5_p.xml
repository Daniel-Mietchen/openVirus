<p>An additional consideration for seasonal influenza vaccines is the ability to provide protection among older adults, who are often at higher risk for influenza infection. The usual dosage of 15 μg HA antigen per vaccine strain in seasonal inactivated vaccines is insufficient to induce protection in older adults. To address this concern, a new vaccine named Fluzone
 <sup>®</sup> was developed to improve serum antibody responses in older adults. Fluzone
 <sup>®</sup> is a trivalent, inactivated split-virus vaccine that contains 60 μg of HA for each influenza strain included in the vaccine (
