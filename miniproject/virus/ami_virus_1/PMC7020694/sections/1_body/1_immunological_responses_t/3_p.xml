<p>The mucosal antibody response is an important feature in determining the ability of the host to efficiently clear viral infections. Mucosal antibody responses are more effective in preventing subsequent infection rather than primary viral infection. The three main immunoglobulin (Ig) isotypes induced during influenza infection are IgG, IgA, and IgM. Secretory IgA antibodies are generated early during infection and can act as an indicator of acute influenza infection (
