<p>The composition of seasonal influenza virus vaccines is based on the strains currently propagating in the human population. Presently, there are two influenza A virus strains (H1N1 and H3N2) and two influenza B virus lineages circulating in humans, with only one influenza B strain from each type circulating as the predominant strain during influenza season. However, as it is impossible to predict the predominant strain for a given season, the majority of the current seasonal influenza vaccines are composed of all four strains. The selection of influenza strains for incorporation into seasonal vaccines is based on surveillance of circulating strains by WHO influenza centers as well as on an assessment of which strains will likely become the predominant strain in human populations (
