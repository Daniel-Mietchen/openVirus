<p>We merged epidemiologic and genotype outbreak data at China CDC and then imported them into SPSS Statistics 25 software (IBM, 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ibm.com" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">https://www.ibm.com</ext-link>) for data cleaning and analysis. We generated descriptive statistics on reported outbreaks by setting, transmission route, outbreak size, and province and examined differences between genotypes and mode of transmission, outbreak size, setting, and season using χ
 <sup>2</sup> tests. We used an α value of p&lt;0.05 to assess statistical significance. Genotypes were assigned by phylogenetic analysis using the UPGMA method with reference sequences used by CaliciNet for capsid typing.
