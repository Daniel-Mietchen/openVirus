<p>The China CDC Ethical Review Committee approved CaliciNet China as routine surveillance for norovirus. Because CaliciNet China collects only aggregate data on norovirus outbreaks, we did not analyze any personal identifying information as part of this project. Linkage of specimens to patient name was maintained by provincial-level CDCs and not submitted into the CaliciNet China database.</p>
