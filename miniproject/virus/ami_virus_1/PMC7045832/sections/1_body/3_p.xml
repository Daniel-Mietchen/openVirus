<p>Since 2004, provincial and local Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCs) in China have been required to report all acute gastroenteritis outbreaks of

 </xref>). Although PHEESS provides useful information, detailed epidemiologic and molecular data from norovirus outbreaks are typically not included. In October 2016, the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention at the China CDC launched CaliciNet China as a surveillance network to monitor the epidemiology and molecular characteristics of norovirus outbreaks. We describe this new network and report data from the first 2 years of surveillance.
