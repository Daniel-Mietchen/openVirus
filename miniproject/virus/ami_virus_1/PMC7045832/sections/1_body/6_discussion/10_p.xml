<p>In conclusion, we collected information about 556 norovirus outbreaks using standardized epidemiologic definitions and laboratory testing procedures in 6 provinces in China. Person-to-person was the predominant transmission route, and childcare centers and schools were the most common settings for reported norovirus outbreaks. The large number of outbreaks during winter 2016â€“17 was attributable at least in part to the emergence of the new recombinant genotype GII.2[P16]. CaliciNet China provides essential information about the evolving strain distribution and epidemiologic characteristics of norovirus outbreaks, which can contribute to the development of effective vaccines.</p>
