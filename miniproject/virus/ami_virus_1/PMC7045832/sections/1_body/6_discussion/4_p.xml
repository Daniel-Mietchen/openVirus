<p>The dominant genotype in our study, GII.2[P16], was mainly associated with outbreaks in childcare centers and schools, consistent with a study in Japan, which found GII.2 was the most prevalent genotype in childcare facilities and schools for multiple years (

GII.3[P12] mainly occurred among children in this study, similar to other studies where GII.3 was one of the most common genotypes associated with sporadic norovirus infection, particularly among children (
