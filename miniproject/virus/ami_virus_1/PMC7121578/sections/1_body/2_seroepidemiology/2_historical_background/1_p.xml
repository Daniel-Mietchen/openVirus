<p>The introduction of serological tests for the diagnosis of disease provided the basis for later serological surveys. As early as 1916, the Wassermann test was applied routinely to patients attending a prenatal clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Williams [

Antibody surveys for influenza also date back to the mid-1930s. The discovery of swine influenza virus by Shope [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>] in 1933 was rapidly followed by population studies to measure antibody to these viruses among persons of different age groups [
