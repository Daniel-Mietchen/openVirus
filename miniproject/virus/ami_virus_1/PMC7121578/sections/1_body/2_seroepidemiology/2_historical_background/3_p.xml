<p>Seroepidemiologic techniques were critical to the discovery by Blumberg et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] in 1965 of a particular antigen in the serum of an Australian aborigine; it was uncovered in the course of genetic studies of β-lipoprotein. Since the agent from which the antigen was derived could not be isolated or cultivated in the laboratory, serological surveys using immunodiffusion tests were carried out to detect its presence in the sera of different population groups and different disease entities. The results provided the sole initial evidence that this “Australia antigen” was associated causally with hepatitis B or “long-incubation hepatitis” [
