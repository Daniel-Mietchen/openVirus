<p>Seroepidemiology is the systematic collection and testing of blood samples from a target population, or a sample of a population, to identify current and past experiences with infectious diseases by means of biological markers (i.e., antibody, antigen, or other tests). Findings from the tests are the outcomes that, when analyzed, are used to describe patterns and potentially identify factors associated with the outcomes. Seroepidemiologic studies are used worldwide to measure and characterize infectious diseases in the population. Sources of seroepidemiologic data are widely available and may be collected for other purposes (e.g., blood donor screening), but can be useful for public health purposes. In the context of viral infections, seroepidemiology serves at least three objectives:
