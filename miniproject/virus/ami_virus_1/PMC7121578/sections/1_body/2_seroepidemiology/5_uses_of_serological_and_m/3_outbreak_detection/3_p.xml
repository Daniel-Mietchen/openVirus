<p>Measles has also reappeared in other developed countries, and a web-based, quality-controlled database with epidemiologic and nucleotide data for measles infection in the WHO/Europe region was developed: the Measles Nucleotide Surveillance (MeaNS) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>]. The major objectives of the MeaNS initiative are to function as an epidemiologic surveillance tool and to monitor progress in measles control. Dynamic reports and graphical charts can be created on any user-selected fields in the MeaNS database (e.g., genotype or sequence variation in a geographical location or time period). Information about MeaNS is available at
