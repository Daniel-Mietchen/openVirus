<p>The advances in genetic characterization and communication online have combined to expand the scope and breadth of serosurveillance into early detection of clusters of infectious diseases. In the United States, norovirus is the most common cause of foodborne disease outbreaks. Surveillance to detect early clusters of disease is conducted through routine notifiable diseases methods and by a laboratory network called CaliciNet [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. It is a national surveillance network that includes a database for public health laboratories to submit gene sequences from human caliciviruses (noroviruses and sapoviruses) identified from outbreaks. The information is used to link norovirus outbreaks that may be caused by common sources (such as food), monitor trends, and identify emerging norovirus strains.
