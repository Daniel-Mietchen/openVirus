<p>The effectiveness of an immunization program is traditionally judged on the basis of clinical cases or epidemic behavior. A program is regarded as effective when cases decrease or epidemics do not occur. This information may be biased by the possibility that the decrease in clinical cases is related to poor reporting or that insufficient time has elapsed for another epidemic to have occurred. Currently, our knowledge of the utilization of vaccines depends on such sources as sales records of manufactures, public clinic and physiciansâ€™ data, direct interviews, and school entry surveys [

Because of the inadequacy of these traditional surveillance techniques in determining the need for and the effectiveness of a given vaccine, serological surveys could play an even larger role in evaluation of immunization programs. Although the necessity for a venipuncture reduces the ease and acceptability of this method, public health professionals and physicians can help surmount such barriers by conveying the importance of seroepidemiology for such purposes. Newer techniques that obviate the requirement for blood sampling may further encourage the application of biological tools to the evaluation of vaccination effectiveness.
