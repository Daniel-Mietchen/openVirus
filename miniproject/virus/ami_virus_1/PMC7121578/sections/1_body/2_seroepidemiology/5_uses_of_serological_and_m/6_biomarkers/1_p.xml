<p>Revolutionary advances in immunology and molecular biology have opened the possibilities for intensive analysis of humoral and cellular material—what some are calling broadly “molecular epidemiology”—analysis that will clarify the role of viral infection in the pathogenesis of autoimmune, degenerative, neoplastic, and even “genetic” diseases and will facilitate targeted drug and vaccine development. An example of one such possibility for molecular study is a European network for hepatitis B virus. The HepSEQ (
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hepseqresearch.org/" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.hepseqresearch.org</ext-link>) is a pioneering online resource for the management, characterization, and tracking of hepatitis B infection in the area. An important use will be to detect mutations of the hepatitis B virus such as those consistent with antiviral resistance [
