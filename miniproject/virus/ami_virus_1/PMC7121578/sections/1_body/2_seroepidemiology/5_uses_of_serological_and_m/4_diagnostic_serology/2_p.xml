<p>A third application for sera stored over time is the measurement of 
 <italic>secular trends</italic> or antigenic shifts in viruses over time. This is especially useful in relation to influenza viruses. A fourth use, employing freshly received sera from high-risk populations, is the search for influenza antibody patterns that may reveal the beginning of an outbreak or a change in the antigen composition of currently circulating strains; this was used by Widelock et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">101</xref>] at New York City public health laboratories. Comparison of the geometric mean antibody titer to influenza sera from persons in the acute phase of an unidentified respiratory illness with the titer in others convalescing from a similar illness may permit early identification of an outbreak without waiting for serial samples from the same persons.
