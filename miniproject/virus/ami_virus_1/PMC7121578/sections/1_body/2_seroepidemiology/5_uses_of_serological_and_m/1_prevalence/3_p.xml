<p>Measurement of IgG and IgM antibody by tests such as the ELISA or immunofluorescent antibody tests provides a simple way in a single serum sample of reflecting current and past infection, respectively. Although IgM antibody usually denotes a primary infection, certain viruses such as herpes viruses may induce IgM on reactivation. It should also be reemphasized that unlike prevalence data for clinical infectious disease, serological prevalence data reflect total infection rates, representing both clinical and subclinical (or asymptomatic) infections.</p>
