<p>Multipurpose antibody surveys have been carried out in a number of countries. In the United States, the successive NHANES surveys have provided large numbers of serum specimens for estimating cumulative exposure to various infections in representative samples of the population. For example, NHANES was critical in an understanding of hepatitis A immunity in the United States because a vaccination program was initiated in 1996 targeting select higher incidence areas. Stratifying seroprevalence by country of birth and race/ethnicity (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">4.1</xref>) showed the higher levels of immunity among foreign-born and US-born Mexican Americans of any age. The impact of the initial vaccination strategy was evident in an analysis of seroprevalence stratified by geographic region and age group (Fig.
