<p>Sera sent to large hospitals or public health laboratories for various tests can be frozen and stored for later antibody testing against other antigens. The specimens must be adequate in amount and free of bacterial contamination. Specimens sent for viral antibody tests usually fulfill these criteria and are accompanied by minimal demographic and clinical data concerning the patient. There are many uses for this type of collection. All sera or exanthems coming from patients with central nervous system, gastrointestinal, or respiratory infections can be tested at the time of receipt or, later, against a battery of viral antigens in order to reveal the profile of agents likely to have caused the syndromes. An example of this was the evaluation of the importance of a new virus, called “the California encephalitis virus” in the causation of infections of the central nervous system by testing of all sera received in a state public health laboratory for this syndrome [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">91</xref>]; in Minnesota, 4.1 % of 1,617 retrospectively tested sera contained this antibody. A second and related application is the determination of the clinical spectrum associated with a newly discovered virus; this is accomplished by testing stored sera from patients with a variety of clinical syndromes and looking for evidence of infection with the new agent.
