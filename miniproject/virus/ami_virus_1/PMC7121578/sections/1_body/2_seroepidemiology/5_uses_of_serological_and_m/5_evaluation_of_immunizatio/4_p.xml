<p>Over the years, serological surveys in American cities, such as Syracuse [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], and Houston [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>], have uncovered serious deficiencies in the antibody patterns for viral diseases for which vaccines are available. The US military has used this approach to similar advantage. A national serosurvey of 1,547 Army recruits entering in 1989 at ages 15–24 years documented 15–21 % seronegativity for measles, mumps, and rubella; 7 % for varicella zoster virus; and 2.3, 0.6, and 14.6 % for poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively [

Thanks to testing of antibodies to hepatitis B that allow distinguishing immunization (where antibodies to hepatitis B surface antigen are positive and antibodies to hepatitis B core are negative), from past or from chronic infection, seroprevalence in NHANES has guided the US vaccination program for hepatitis B. Wasley et al. compared findings from the 1999–2006 NHANES with previous surveys and found that a history of infection with HBV had decreased from 1.9 to 0.6 % among children. Prevalence of antibodies consistent with immunization increased from 20.5 % in 1999–2002 to 25.2 % in 2003–2006 [
