<p>Prevalence from serosurveys, or seroprevalence, is defined as the number of persons whose sera contain a particular biomarker among the total number of persons examined at that point in time (frequently, 1 year). Unlike “case prevalence,” which indicates the existence of disease at the time of the survey, the presence of antibody reflects the cumulative experience, past and present, with an infectious agent. The prevalence is a function both of prior and current infection and of the duration of the antibody tested. In contrast, antigen indicates presence of the virus at that time; in cases of latent or asymptomatic infection, it indicates prevalence of chronic infection.</p>
