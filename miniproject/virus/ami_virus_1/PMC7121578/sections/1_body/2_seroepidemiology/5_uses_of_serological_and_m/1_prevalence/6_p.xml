<p>Initial tests for poliomyelitis antibody employing conventional microtiter neutralization procedures indicated that 27, 42, and 54 % of those tested at 1:5 or 1:8 serum dilution lacked antibody to poliomyelitis types 1, 2, and 3, respectively [

Two mass poliomyelitis programs were carried out after the 1972 survey, one in 1974–1975 and another in 1977–1978. There have been no reported cases of poliomyelitis since 1972.
