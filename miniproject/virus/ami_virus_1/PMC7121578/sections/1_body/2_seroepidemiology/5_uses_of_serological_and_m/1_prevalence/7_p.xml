<p>The 1972 Barbados serum collection was tested for human retroviruses after the agents were discovered. The HTLV-1 antibody was found in 4.25 % overall, rising in age from a 2.7 % prevalence for persons aged ≤10 years to 9.0 % among those aged 61–70 years [

The adult pattern raised the possibility of sexual transmission, and this was strengthened by the finding of a prevalence rate of 14.1 % among persons with a positive VDRL test for syphilis as compared with 3.5 % of those who were VDRL negative. There was evidence of household clustering and of vertical transmission.
