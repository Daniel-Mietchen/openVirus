 <italic>Specimen Management.</italic> The collection and management of specimens depends on the type of specimen (e.g., viruses might be identified in stool samples, oral swabs). For blood, the specimen must be collected and separated under sterile conditions. Aliquots of 0.5 ml each have been used by the WHO and CDC and are very useful for microtiter tests; several replicates of the entire collection may be prepared at the time of aliquoting so they can be shipped to other laboratories for testing. Sera are usually stored at −20 °C, often in a commercial warehouse. Temperatures of −70 °C are best but are more expensive to maintain. Lymphocytes can also be separated from anticoagulated blood, frozen at low temperatures in fetal calf serum and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and later thawed for examination of stable cell surface markers and other cell-associated products. Cellular material, even in extremely low concentration and a nonviable state, may be quite suitable for amplification and identification of fragments of nucleic acid. These techniques offer powerful tools for detecting genes characteristic of specific infectious agents and other biological material of interest.
