<p>The general principles and techniques of laboratory testing for viral infections are presented comprehensively in 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_2 and 10.1007/978-1-4899-7448-8_3 of this text. The antibody tests most suitable to serological surveys of specific viruses are detailed in each corresponding chapter of this book. The criteria for a satisfactory test include simplicity, sensitivity, specificity, reliability, ability to detect long-lasting antibody, minimal interference from nonspecific inhibitors, the availability of satisfactory reagents, and the safety of the test for the laboratory technician [

It is adaptable to a wide variety of antibody determinations, it requires a minimal amount of serum (usually 0.1 ml) and other ingredients, and large numbers of sera can be efficiently tested. Several automated methods of dilution and of adding various reagents have been introduced to speed the testing even more [
