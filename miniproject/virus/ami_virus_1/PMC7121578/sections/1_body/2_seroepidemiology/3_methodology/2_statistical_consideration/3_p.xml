<p>For rapid surveys or for surveys in developing countries, WHO has developed methods for cluster sampling that are more easily implemented and analyzed than multistage probability sample surveys [

Using this method, and assuming the survey is conducted to meet several health information needs, the first step is to plan carefully to ensure best use of resources. Sampling is conducted in several stages, starting with regions of a country, then districts within regions, then communities (e.g., villages, blocks, etc.) within the districts and households within the communities. Ideally, the community sampling framework should be a list of all the communities in the region, and there should be a measure of the population size of the community in order to sample with probability proportionate to size. This assessment is helpful because weighting at the time of analysis then becomes unnecessary. The total population divided by the number of communities to be selected determines the sampling interval, which will be used to select the communities after a random start. Also ideally, there is enumeration of the households within the selected communities such that a simple random sample can be selected. If that framework is not available, methods from the 30 × 7 Expanded Program on Immunization can be used since the selection of households is conducted in the field using a central start; interviews are conducted until information on seven children aged 12–23 months are completed [
