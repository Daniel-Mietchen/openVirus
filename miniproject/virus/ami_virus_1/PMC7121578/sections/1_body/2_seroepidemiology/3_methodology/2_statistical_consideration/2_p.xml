<p>NHANES uses a complex sample survey design [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Primary sampling units are generally single counties, where the sampling frame is all counties in the United States. The additional stages of selection in the probability design consist of clusters of households, where each person in a selected household is screened for demographic characteristics, and one or more persons per household are selected for the sample. As with any complex probability sample, the sample design information must be used when undertaking statistical analysis of the NHANES data. In particular, sample weights and the first stage of the cluster design need to be considered. Participants are compensated for participation and receive a report with their health results.
