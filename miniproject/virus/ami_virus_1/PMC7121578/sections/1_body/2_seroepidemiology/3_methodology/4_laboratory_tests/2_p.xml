<p>The development of simple tests such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for antibody measurement in microtiter plates has provided a sensitive method for identification of antibody in serum samples from survey populations and can indicate both past and current infections [

The use of monoclonal antibodies in this and other antibody tests permits highly specific identification of individual strains of the virus, a special advantage in determining whether a new strain has been introduced in a community or if reinfection or reactivation has occurred in the individual. Commercial kits for many antibodies are now available, and new formulations are continually being devised for a variety of clinical, public health, and research applications. Detection of virus and genetic characterization of viruses can be accomplished using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Handling of specimens for PCR depends on two components: the source and virus, for example, varicella zoster virus can be identified in dried blood specimens, which can be stored at ambient temperature indefinitely. In general, PCR requires specialized kits that differ for qualitative or quantitative detection. Sequencing of select regions of amplified genetic material can be used to describe strains of virus circulating in a region or country; however, because of cost, these methods are frequently restricted to determine transmission during investigations of acute clusters of disease [
