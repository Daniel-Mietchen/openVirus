<p>When serosurveys are designed as primary data collection, representativeness of the population is usually desirable. In the United States, NHANES combines interviews, physical examinations, and laboratory specimens from a nationally representative sample of about 5,000 persons each year. These persons are located in different geographic areas called primary sampling units, of which 15 are visited each year. Health interviews are conducted in respondentsâ€™ homes, whereas health measurements are collected in specially designed and equipped mobile centers.</p>
