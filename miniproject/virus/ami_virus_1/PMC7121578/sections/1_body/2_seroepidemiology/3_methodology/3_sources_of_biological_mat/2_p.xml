Examples of sources of specimens for secondary use include blood collected for routine tests during physical examinations for the armed forces or industry or during an outpatient visit or admission to a hospital and from neonates screened for specific heritable disorders. Sera sent to a public health laboratory for serological tests for syphilis, viral diagnosis, or other diagnostic tests have also been employed. These collections of sera may not be representative of the age, sex, and geographic distribution of the entire population; the nature of the biases introduced must be recognized and evaluated. However, they are economical to obtain and sometimes may reveal important information about the presence or absence of a certain virus in the community or about the occurrence of a recent outbreak. An example of this type of serostudy was the description of the frequency of HIV and hepatitis B and C infection among injection drug users in several US cities [
