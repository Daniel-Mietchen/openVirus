<p>Seroepidemiologic studies were used early in the HIV epidemic because there was a need to determine the unbiased frequency of infection in different populations. A series of serosurveys were conducted to cover different populations including persons attending STD clinics [

To protect the identity of infected persons, these surveys were conducted anonymously and data were unlinked, such that notifying the person whose blood was tested was not feasible. The ethical issues discussed over time are described by Fairchild and Bayer [

The issues included participant consent, the participantâ€™s right to know and to control their information, and the responsibility of the health officials to inform the individuals of their test results. When treatment became available, serosurveys continued as long as voluntary counseling and testing was available to survey participants. As clinical data became a more complete source of similar surveillance information, the use of serosurveys became ethically indefensible [
