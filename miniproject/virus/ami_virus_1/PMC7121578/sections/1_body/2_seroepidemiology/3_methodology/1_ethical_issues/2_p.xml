<p>Currently, in the United States, Federal Regulations (45 CFR 46.111) require that studies involving human research subjects satisfy the following rules: (a) risks to participants are minimized; (b) risks to participants are reasonable relative to anticipated benefits, if any, to participants, and the importance of the knowledge that may reasonably be expected to result; (c) selection of participants is equitable (i.e., could any special problems arise when research involves vulnerable populations, such as children, pregnant women, fetuses, prisoners, mentally disabled persons, economically or educationally disadvantaged persons); (d) informed consent will be sought from each prospective participant or the participant’s legally authorized representative; (e) informed consent will be appropriately documented; (f) the research plan makes adequate provisions for ensuring the safety of participants; and (g) there are adequate provisions to protect the privacy of participants and to maintain the confidentiality of data. Institutions conducting epidemiologic studies maintain “Institutional Review Boards” to ensure that investigators address the above ethical requirements.</p>
