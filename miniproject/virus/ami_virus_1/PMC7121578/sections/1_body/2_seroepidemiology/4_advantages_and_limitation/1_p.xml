<p>The use of serological surveys is an important means of supplementing morbidity information, such as that obtained from routine case surveillance. Advantages are listed in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">4.3</xref>. Because many viral infections may be clinically mild or inapparent, laboratory confirmation is necessary for accurate diagnosis of even overt cases. Data from serological surveys can reveal 
 <italic>total</italic> burden of infection (apparent and inapparent), both currently and in the past. Selection of tests that reflect antibody of long duration permits measurement of the cumulative experience of the population tested with the disease in question; selection of a test based on short-lived antibody such as immunoglobulin M (IgM) allows identification of a recent infection or epidemic. Testing of two sera spaced in time permits measurement of the incidence of infection during the interval period.
