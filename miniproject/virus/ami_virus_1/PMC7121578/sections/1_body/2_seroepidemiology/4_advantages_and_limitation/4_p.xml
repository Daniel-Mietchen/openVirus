<p>The disadvantages of seroepidemiology are the cost, time, and effort involved in the selection of the target population, the collection and analysis of data and blood, and the need for and cost of laboratory facilities equipped to carry out the tests. There must also be a satisfactory means of measuring antibody for the particular virus to be studied, and the method of carrying it out must be simple enough to allow performance on a large-scale basis. Finally, because serostudies designed for primary data collection are labor-intensive and prospective, there are significant delays in the availability of data. For example, the NHANES data require about 2 years between the end of data collection and the availability of datasets for public use.</p>
