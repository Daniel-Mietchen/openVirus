<p>The reporting of cases of specified infectious diseases also is legally required in most countries. The US National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System includes over 70 diseases, of which approximately 30 are viral diseases including 6 arboviruses, 6 hepatitides, and 6 types of hemorrhagic fevers. Reportable disease systems form the backbone of surveillance for most state and local health departments and for many CDC programs. The advantages are that (1) reports are usually made by physicians and/or laboratories, (2) laboratory confirmation is generally available, and (3) there is typically an organized system of regional or national tabulation and reporting. The disadvantages are as follows: (1) the absence of some viral diseases from the required list; (2) the notorious underreporting of diseases despite legal requirements, primarily because of lack of resources to support both reporting and education of physicians about the need to report; and (3) the variability of reporting efficiency from one jurisdiction to another. Lack of rapid, reliable, inexpensive diagnostic techniques also represents a discouraging obstacle to accurate identification and reporting of many viral diseases [
