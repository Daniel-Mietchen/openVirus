<p>Active surveillance requires contacting the reporters at regular intervals and request for specific data on cases of specified diseases. It permits more extensive data collection on epidemiologic features of certain diseases. CDCâ€™s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an active surveillance system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. States contact residents by telephone and administer a standardized questionnaire to eligible consenting adults aged 18 years or older to obtain information about a variety of chronic diseases and related risk behaviors. Relevant to viral infections, the BRFSS includes questions about receipt of influenza, shingles, and human papilloma virus vaccination. The BRFSS has also been used by CDC to provide state-specific estimates of HIV-related behaviors such as ever tested for HIV, where tested, and why tested. Some states conduct active surveillance for HIV/AIDS using other data sources.
