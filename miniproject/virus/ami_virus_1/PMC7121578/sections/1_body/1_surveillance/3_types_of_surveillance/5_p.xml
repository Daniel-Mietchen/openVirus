<p>For a few diseases, some special clinical feature of the disease may be used to estimate prevalence data. For example sudden severe acute lower respiratory illness may indicate hantavirus infection or jaundice may be evidence of hepatitis. In some instances, surveillance is based on laboratory data, as with the isolation of the agent or results of a serological test. In the case of viral hepatitis, the CDC/CSTE case definition includes both clinical features and laboratory test results. Most surveillance systems cover political jurisdictions (e.g., national, state, and county). However, some surveillance systems cover high-risk or specific population groups, requiring special reporting methods. Examples are military populations, hospitals, day-care centers, and homes for the elderly. Most surveillance systems incorporate a list of reportable diseases, but the focus of the reporting may be on specific disease entities, such as congenital defects as a reflection of the impact of rubella and cytomegalovirus infections [
