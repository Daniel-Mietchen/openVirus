<p>The US National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System (NNDSS) is an example of passive reporting [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. States send case reports of nationally notifiable diseases to the CDC on a weekly basis. States determine which diseases are reportable within their jurisdiction and who (laboratory, physician, clinic, or some combination) initiates the report. State epidemiologists and CDC subject matter experts collaborate, through the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), to develop case definitions and define reportable data elements for reportable diseases. Generally, laboratories and/or physicians report cases to the local health departments, local health departments report cases to state health departments, and state health departments notify CDC of confirmed cases. Most laboratory reports and some physician reports are submitted electronically. However, reporting can be accomplished in print, by telephone, even using toll-free numbers or automatic recording devices available at all hours. Time and lack of resources greatly limit such a system to a small percentage of most reportable diseases, but as long as the system and requirements remain unchanged, the changes in incidence may reflect meaningful patterns of disease.
