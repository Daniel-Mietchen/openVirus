<p>On April 28, 1955, the Surgeon General of the United States directed the establishment of a “National Poliomyelitis Surveillance Program” in response to paralytic polio cases following the use of Salk vaccine (the “Cutter Incident”). Based on this program, established at the CDC, surveillance methods became an effective tool in following trends in the disease, in measuring the effectiveness of polio immunization programs, and in detecting suspected vaccine-associated cases. Likewise, other surveillance systems and units were developed in response to occurrence of other epidemics. WHO established regional, national, and international control programs with surveillance as an essential component of each type of control program. While European unification was anticipated, individual countries employed different approaches to surveillance; thus, there were concerns about comparability of data and coordination of activities [
