<p>Surveillance concepts and methodologies were developed in response to national needs for disease surveillance or in response to epidemics. Surveillance data were needed to define the magnitude of the problem and to inform policy/decision makers and others who were responsible for development, implementation, and/or evaluation of prevention and intervention programs and policies. Use of the term “surveillance” in the United States began in 1949 with the development of a modified program at the CDC called “Surveillance and Appraisal of Malaria.” In 1951, the concept was applied to the residual smallpox cases in the United States.</p>
