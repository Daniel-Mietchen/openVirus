The primary goal of HIE is to facilitate access to and retrieval of patient clinical data to provide more efficient, timely, effective, equitable, and safe healthcare. HIE secondary goals are to improve bidirectional communication, to enhance case reporting, and to focus on technology, interoperability, utilization standards, and harmonious collaboration between all patient-centered healthcare providers [
