The program which started in 1972 collaborates with local, state, and territorial health departments, clinical laboratories, healthcare providers, and emergency departments to collects and analyzes information on influenza in the United States. Information is collected from five categories of influenza surveillance: viral surveillance, including surveillance for novel influenza A viruses; outpatient illness surveillance; mortality surveillance; hospitalization surveillance; and geographic distribution. Information from these five categories of surveillance is used to track influenza-related illnesses and deaths and to provide a comprehensive overview of activities. CDC also collaborates closely with WHO in global surveillance, including surveillance for novel influenza viruses and in influenza vaccine strain selection.
