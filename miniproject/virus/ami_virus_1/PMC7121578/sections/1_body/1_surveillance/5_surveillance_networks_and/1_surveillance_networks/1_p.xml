<p>Surveillance networks grew out of the need for a more global approach to surveillance of infectious diseases. Surveillance of infectious diseases was often inadequate in the developing world due to a lack of resources and public health infrastructure. The need for early warning of outbreaks of emerging and reemerging diseases led the Federation of American Scientists to support the establishment of the first infectious disease network, the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMED-mail) in 1993 [

ProMED-mail is an Internet-based system for reporting and disseminating information on infectious diseases outbreaks and acute exposures to toxins that impact human health. This open-source network receives reports from clinicians, public health officials and epidemiologists, laboratory scientists, medical missionaries, journalists, and laypersons. The editors also search the Web and press reports for information. A panel of experts screens, reviews, and investigates reports before they are posted to the website. ProMED-mail allows comparison of reports by geographic location. Thus, users of the system can identify similar outbreaks in both space and time.
