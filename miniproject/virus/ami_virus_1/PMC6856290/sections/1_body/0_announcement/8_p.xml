<p>The polyprotein annotation was obtained through alignment with the Brazilian reference sequence (GenBank accession number 
 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/YP_009428568" assigning-authority="ncbi:protein" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">YP_009428568</ext-link> ). Ten nonsynonymous substitutions, namely D107E (capsid protein C), H691Y and E940K (membrane glycoprotein M), A1027T, K1059E, R1118W, and V1143M (envelope protein E), and I2509T, T3213I, and T3353A (nonstructural protein NS1), were observed in the polyprotein region (10,269â€‰bp) when the sequence of Zika_virus_459148_Meta_Colombia_2016 was compared to the Brazilian reference sequence.
