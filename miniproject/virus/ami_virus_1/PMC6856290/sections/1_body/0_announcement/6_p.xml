<p>The presence of neurological manifestations such as hypersensitivity to touch, action tremor, and gait instability 7 days postinfection suggested that the strain was able to cross the developing blood-brain barrier. Fresh whole brains were collected by manual dissection; one cerebral hemisphere was immersed in RNAlater and stored at −70°C for molecular assays, and the other hemisphere was fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyde (PFA) solution for immunohistochemistry assays. The presence and purity of ZIKV was confirmed by immunoassays against ZIKV (anti-ZIKV pAb, lot 6 1576; donated by the CDC) and by conventional and real-time RT-PCR. Animal procedures were performed with the approval of the INS Animal Care and Use Committee (code 13-2016).</p>
