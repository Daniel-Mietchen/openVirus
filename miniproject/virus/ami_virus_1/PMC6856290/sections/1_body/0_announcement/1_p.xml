<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is the etiological agent of an emerging viral disease with serious public health impact (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). It belongs to the family 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flaviviridae</named-content>, genus 
 <named-content content-type="genus-species">Flavivirus</named-content>, and possesses a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 10.8 kb. From August 2015 to November 2016, Colombia reported 105,000 cases of ZIKV infection, and 147 cases of microcephaly were confirmed by laboratory diagnosis (

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Experimental infection in an animal model could be valuable for identifying specific mutations allowing neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence (
