<p>Five newborn mice were inoculated with ZIKV and mock infected with their respective controls by the intracerebral pathway. In this assay, coinfection of ZIKV and CHIKV was detected in the brains using the Trioplex assay, although no CHIKV was detected in the cell culture inoculated with the isolate. The initial inoculum contained CHIKV at a level below the detection limit of the assay (coinfections are frequently encountered in our region), and the CHIKV titers increased in the mouse brain due to the strong capacity of CHIKV to infect neurons (
