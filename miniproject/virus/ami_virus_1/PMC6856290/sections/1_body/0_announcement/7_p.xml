<p>RNA purification from brain tissues was performed using the RNeasy lipid tissue minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), followed by cDNA synthesis with SuperScript IV reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and random hexamers (Promega, Dübendorf, Switzerland). One RNA sample from the brain was taken for ZIKV sequencing. The library was prepared with the Nextera XT DNA library prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was performed with the MiSeq reagent kit version 2 (Illumina) on a MiSeq instrument (2 × 300 bp). Reads were demultiplexed by barcode, and a total of 423,712 reads (paired ends) were obtained and quality filtered with FastQC using a 
 <italic>Q</italic>-score threshold of 30. A total of 5,031 reads mapped directly to a reference genome (GenBank accession number
