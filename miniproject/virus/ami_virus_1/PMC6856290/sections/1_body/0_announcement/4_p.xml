<p>To obtain a pure ZIKV strain without coinfections, a plaque-to-plaque transfer assay was performed. Seven lysis plaques (clones 1 to 7) were taken randomly with a syringe needle and cultured in Vero cells in independent assays. Five days postinoculation, 200 Î¼l of the supernatants was reinoculated into a fresh monolayer, and 7 successive passages of each clone were done with the same strategy. This was done to rule out the growth of other possible viruses in these assays. Six of the clones (clones 2 to 7) were positive only for ZIKV, while clone 1 showed coinfection with CHIKV.</p>
