<p id="Par29">There is a need for constant surveillance of emerging viral diseases in all countries around the world. Constant surveillance is needed to monitor trends in epidemiological patterns of disease occurrence. To achieve this, humans and animals need to be tested regularly to detect the presence of disease agents before the occurrence of epidemics. Considering the current ease of transportation especially through the air, it is possible for commercial aircraft to transport infected humans and vectors from one part of the world to another. For example, the Rift Valley fever introductions into Egypt in 1977 and the Arabian Peninsula in 2000 followed epizootics in Sudan in 1976 and the Horn of Africa in 1998, respectively. Also, the potential for such globalization of other arboviruses has been demonstrated in the case of West Nile and Chikungunya viruses over the past 15Â years (Nash et al.
