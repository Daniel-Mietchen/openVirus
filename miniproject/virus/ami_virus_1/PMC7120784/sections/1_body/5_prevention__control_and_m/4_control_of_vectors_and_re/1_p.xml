<p id="Par32">The control of vectors and reservoirs includes measures to prevent zoonotic pathogens from being transmitted to non-infected animals, humans and disease-free areas, through arthropod vectors, contaminated fomite and animal reservoirs. This may involve improving hygiene and control of the environment. For instance, the control of yellow fever during the construction of the Panama Canal in the early twentieth century is linked to the destruction of

Arthropod vector control is another effective strategy in reducing sources of infection, as in the case of Rift Valley fever, yellow fever and other mosquito-borne zoonoses. Rodent control and avoidance of bush burning, setting traps in and around homes to reduce rat population and avoiding contact with rats are other effective methods of reducing contact with animal reservoirs of dangerous pathogens like Lassa fever virus. To achieve such effective control, adequate sanitation would be an absolute necessity. However, most African countries are far from achieving the set global sanitation goals of 2030 as detailed in the Sustainable Development Goals (Nhamo et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2019</xref>). Thus, without adequate sanitation, the control of vectors within African countries would be challenged, hence the control of emerging and re-emerging viral pathogens.
