<p id="Par25">The successful detection of an emerging virus may depend on the type of procedure used, and this, in turn, can be determined by economic, human resources and laboratory robustness at the time. Serological techniques, including antigen and antibody testing, involve the use of labelled enzymes and their substrates as indicators in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) (Whitehouse

However, because the methods are time-consuming and not sensitive enough to detect occult and early infections, rapid detection of a viral agent may be eluded when using such methods, especially among individuals with nonspecific symptoms of the disease (Whitehouse
