<p id="Par24">The early detection of emerging viral agents is vital in the management and control of diseases. Several measures that facilitate clinical and epidemiological investigation of emerging viral diseases in any environment have been identified (Chan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2017</xref>). Such measures involve rapid detection of viral agents using the most sensitive and specific laboratory assays, including viral antigen and antibody testing, isolation of viral agents using cell and tissue culture techniques, molecular characterization, including nucleic acid synthesis and amplification with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), genotyping and genomic sequencing. The use of quantitative molecular tools such as real-time reverse transcription PCR for enumerating RNA viruses, especially during outbreaks, has helped in the identification of new viral agents (Marston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014</xref>). These advanced techniques enable rapid diagnosis and identification of cases and contacts within a short period.
