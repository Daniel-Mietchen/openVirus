<p id="Par26"> Molecular tools such as PCR and genome sequencing remain the gold standard for identifying emerging and re-emerging viruses (Rosenstierne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2014</xref>). PCR is a very sensitive technique, which involves the amplification of the viral genetic material (DNA or RNA), even at very low concentrations, in the specimen for easy identification, regardless of the stage of infection. Methods such as real-time PCR complement the techniques involving antigen and antibody testing (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">2011</xref>). It is best suited for early diagnosis in clinical samples and during viral diseases outbreaks such as Marburg or Ebola (Weidmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">2007</xref>). Molecular techniques are, however, costly, requiring substantial funding to acquire equipment and reagents. Another limitation is the need for trained laboratory personnel. These limitations hinder the use of molecular techniques for the diagnosis of viral infections, including emerging and re-emerging ones, in most African countries given that the methods cannot be used for routine clinical diagnosis.
