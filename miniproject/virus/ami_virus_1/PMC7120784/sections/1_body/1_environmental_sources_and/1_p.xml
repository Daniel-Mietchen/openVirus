<p id="Par4">The emergence patterns of new viral agents and re-emergence of already known ones have been continuously changing, mostly due to several factors that could be climatic, agricultural, anthropological or a combination of two or more of these factors (Andrew and Gregory 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>). Viruses cannot replicate outside the living host but can survive in the environment for a long period. For instance, enteroviruses are very stable in harsh environments. Several waterborne viruses have been isolated from contaminated sources such as sewage. Such enteric viruses include norovirus, hepatitis A and E viruses, human enterovirus A-D, and human adenovirus A-G. These viruses have been implicated in gastrointestinal problems and responsible for infections such as hepatitis, conjunctivitis, poliomyelitis and several others (La Rosa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>). Other known sources of emerging viral diseases are wild and domestic animals responsible for most zoonotic viral infections (Woolhouse et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2005</xref>). Again, human involvement in numerous activities to harness natural resources, coupled with other essential factors such as increased residencies, close contacts with animal reservoirs in the wild, poor land use leading to degradation and alteration of natural habitations, have been implicated in the emergence of new infectious diseases. A host of disease-causing microorganisms including viruses in the environment in Africa are not often detected, probably due to inadequate evaluation of the environment. Residential areas sited close to dumpsites and stagnant water sources face hazards of air pollution which poses serious threats to human health. This is commonplace in most urban cities in the continent. Humans interact with such environments through activities such as scavenging at dumpsites, fishing and washing in contaminated water making these sites primary sources of infections, which could subsequently spread through the community (van Doorn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR93">2014</xref>). Exchanges through trade, coupled with human and animal travels, have also contributed to the spread of virus-carrying vectors from one region to another (Tatem et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">2006</xref>; Hufnagel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2004</xref>). Human-animal-environment connections have resulted in cyclical events that promote infectious disease epidemiology. Zoonotic infectious diseases are most implicated in this pattern, depicted by disease transmission from animals to humans or vice versa and result in disease outbreaks among the human population. It is believed that new viral agents emerge when known viruses from animals switch hosts and become established in humans. This occurrence can lead to severe epidemics when the human-human transmission is achieved, especially with highly pathogenic viruses (Olsen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2006</xref>). The viral agents can be airborne and so transmitted through droplets, as in the case of influenza viruses. They can also be transmitted through direct animal bites and scratches such as the rabies virus in dogs and cats; other viral agents such as HIV-1 in primates and SARS-CoV in bats undergo host switching over time to cause epidemics in humans (Parish et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2008</xref>). Thus, restricted human contact with primates and other virus reservoirs in the wild is notably a significant obstacle to the establishment of viral infections and the occurrence of outbreaks in the human population.
