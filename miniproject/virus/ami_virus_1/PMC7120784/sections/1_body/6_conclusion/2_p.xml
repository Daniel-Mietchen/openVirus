<p id="Par37">Human activities, including agriculture and exploitation of forest resources, will continue to bring humans closer to sylvatic cycles of zoonotic viruses. These activities could also alter the natural population and geographic distributions of insect and animal, which serves as vectors or reservoirs for these viruses, thereby leading to the emergence of new viruses and re-emergence of known ones. Rapid globalization also increases the risk that infections that emerge in one part of the world can spread internationally in human and animal populations. Currently, vaccines for the prevention of many of these viruses are unavailable, and the public health delivery system is weak in many African countries where most of the emerging and remerging viruses are known to occur. There is, therefore, the need for consistent surveillance and monitoring of these diseases of epidemic and pandemic potential. Surveillance and monitoring information will allow for timely alerts and effective response activities that will prevent major outbreaks in Africa and beyond. There is also the need to invest more resources in the development of vaccines for more of these emerging viruses. Increased investment in public health infrastructures, transportation and sanitation facilities are also required in the control of these viruses.</p>
