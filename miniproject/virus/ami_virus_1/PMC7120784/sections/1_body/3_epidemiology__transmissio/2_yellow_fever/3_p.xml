<p id="Par14"> Yellow fever is a zoonotic disease, maintained in nature by non-human primates and diurnally active mosquitoes that breed in tree holes in the forest canopy (
 <italic>Haemagogus</italic> spp. in the Americas, and 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. in Africa). People are exposed to infected mosquitoes when they encroach on this cycle during occupational or recreational activities (Hanley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). In the warm, humid savanna regions of Africa, tree-hole-breeding 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes reach very high densities and are implicated in the endemic and epidemic transmission of viruses from monkeys to humans. 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, a domestic mosquito species that breeds in human-made containers, transmits the yellow fever virus among humans in cities (Possas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">2018</xref>). The virus is maintained over the dry season by vertical transmission in mosquitoes. Transovarially infected eggs survive in dry tree-holes and hatch infectious mosquitoes when the wet season begins (Monath
