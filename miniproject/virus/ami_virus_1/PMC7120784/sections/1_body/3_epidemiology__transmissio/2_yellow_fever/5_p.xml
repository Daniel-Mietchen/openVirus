<p id="Par16">Mosquito vectors capable of transmitting yellow fever exist in regions where the disease does not presently occur, such as Asia (Barnett 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). Vector-control strategies that were once successful for the elimination of yellow fever from many affected regions have failed, leading to the re-emergence of the disease. Consequently, the administration of vaccines is still the most effective method of prevention of the disease, coupled with the prevention of mosquito bites. Effective vaccines against yellow fever have been discovered since 1937 (Theiler and Smith 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">1937</xref>) and have been responsible for the significant reduction in occurrences of the disease worldwide (Garske et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2014</xref>). Till date, the yellow fever 17D vaccine is very effective despite its use for over seven decades probably due to the genetic stability of the yellow fever virus structural proteins which the host immune cells target (Baba and Ikusemoran

However, despite this success, effective administration of the vaccine is still a challenge and has been contributing to the resurgence of the disease in many African countries. There have been occasional issues of supply and demand, as experienced in Angola and Democratic Republic of Congo in 2016 (Barrett
