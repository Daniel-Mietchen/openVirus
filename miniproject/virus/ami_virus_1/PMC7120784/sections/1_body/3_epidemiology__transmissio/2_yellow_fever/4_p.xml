<p id="Par15">Approximately 200,000 cases of yellow fever occur annually worldwide, 90% of which occurs in Africa. A striking resurgence of the disease has occurred since the 1980s in both sub-Saharan Africa and South America (Monath and Vasconcelos 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>). Studies on yellow fever outbreaks across Africa revealed that epidemics of the disease were more frequent and more extensive in west and east African countries than countries in central Africa. This is due to the influence of climate and the environment on both mosquito vectors and the virus (Hamlet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2018</xref>). Also, the periodicity of an upsurge in yellow fever activities in west African countries is between 5 and 20 years while much longer intervals of up to 45 years have been observed in parts of east Africa. Some countries have also sustained epidemics across multiple years, for example, in Ghana (1977–1983), Guinea (2000–2005), and Nigeria (1986–1994) (Monath and Vasconcelos 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2015</xref>). In December 2015, another urban outbreak of yellow fever was declared in Angola and soon after in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). These outbreaks ended in 2017 with 7334 suspected cases and 393 deaths (Kraemer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2017</xref>). In 2016, another outbreak occurred in Uganda, and since then, several sporadic yellow fever cases have been reported in Chad, Ghana, the Republic of Congo, Guinea and Nigeria (Domingo et al.
