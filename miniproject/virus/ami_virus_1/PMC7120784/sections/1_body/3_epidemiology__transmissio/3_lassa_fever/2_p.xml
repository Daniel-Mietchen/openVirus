<p id="Par18"> Lassa virus is transmitted through contact with body fluids or excreta, or inhalation of aerosols produced by infected rodents. Hunting and consumption of peri-domestic rodents as a source of food have also been reported as another route of virus transmission to humans (Ter Meulen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR91">1996</xref>). The infection also spreads between humans through contact with body fluids of infected persons or contaminated medical equipment (Fisher-Hoch et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">1995</xref>). The Lassa virus infects approximately 500,000 people and causes about 5000 deaths worldwide (Mateer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2018</xref>). In endemic regions, seropositivity for Lassa virus-specific antibodies could be as high as 55% in populations residing around forested areas harbouring large populations of reservoir rodents (Lukashevich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1993</xref>). Most times, early diagnosis of the infection is missed as most early symptoms are mild and resemble those of other diseases like typhoid fever and malaria in endemic areas (Safronetz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">2010</xref>).
