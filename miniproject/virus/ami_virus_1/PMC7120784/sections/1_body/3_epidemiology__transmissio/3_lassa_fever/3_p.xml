<p id="Par19">The multimammate mouse, 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic>, is the primary host for the LASV (Lecompte et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2006</xref>). The virus has little or no adverse effect on its rodent reservoir under natural circumstances (MariÃ«n et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2017</xref>). 
 <italic>Mastomys natalensis</italic> is widely distributed throughout West, Central and East Africa (Lopez and Mathers 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2006</xref>), where they aggregate in houses in large numbers during the dry and harmattan season due to harsh environmental conditions and dispersing into gardens and farmlands when the rains return (Fichet-Calvet et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2007</xref>). Infected rodents remain carriers of the virus throughout life; the virus is shed in urine, faeces, saliva, respiratory secretion and exposed blood vessels through micro or macro trauma (Keenlyside et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">1983</xref>). In endemic countries, other common rodent species such as 
 <italic>Rattus rattus</italic> and 
 <italic>Mus minutoides</italic> have also been implicated in Lassa virus transmission (Wulff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR104">1975</xref>).
