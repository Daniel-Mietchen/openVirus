<p id="Par21">The Ebola virus belongs to the family 
 <italic>Filoviridae</italic> and the order Mononegavirales. The virus causes haemorrhagic fever, an important emerging viral infection in central Africa. The Ebola virus was first identified in 1976 following two outbreaks of haemorrhagic fever in northern Zaire (the present Democratic Republic of Congo) and southern Sudan. The most highly virulent strain (subtype) is Ebola-Zaire, which has a mortality rate of 88%. Between 2014 and 2016, several outbreaks of the Ebola virus disease were reported in parts of west Africa, where more than 28,000 cases were confirmed with over 11,000 deaths in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Nigeria (Baize et al.
