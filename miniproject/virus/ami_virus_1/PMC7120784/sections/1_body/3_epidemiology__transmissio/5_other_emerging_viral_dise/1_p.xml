<p id="Par23"> Viral disease outbreaks occur periodically with the potential to increase in incidence. Their unique nature allows the viruses to change their form and evade the hostsâ€™ immune defence to produce persistent or latent infections, or worse still, an outbreak in any population. This attribute has enabled the emergence of novel or pandemic variants among several viral agents, including influenza virus (Meseko et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2013</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). Typically, new infections emerge as a result of changes in existing strains that can lead to resistance or due to some environmental factors that support the growth of emerging infectious agents, in a particular geographical zone. A typical example is the emergence of several subtypes of the influenza virus over time, as a result of re-assortment and mutation in animal reservoirs, especially birds and swine, with major variants such as H1N1, H1N2 and H3N2, now being detected at the human-animal interface (Alexander and Brown 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>; Yu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2009</xref>). Other newly identified viral agents include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus and species or strains that have a significant burden on public health and global economies.
