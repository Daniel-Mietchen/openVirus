<p id="Par9"> Rift Valley fever (RVF) is a devastating mosquito-borne zoonotic disease that causes illnesses in humans and animals (Hartman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2017</xref>). The virus is a Phlebovirus in the family 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae</italic>. It has a tri-segmented, single-stranded RNA genome in which two segments, L (large) and M (medium), have a negative polarity, while the third, S (small), is ambisense (Ly and Ikegami

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">2010</xref>). Large outbreaks of the disease have occurred in many African countries, Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula, and have usually been indicated by a sweep of abortion in livestock (Mariner

 <italic>Aedes</italic> and 
 <italic>Culex</italic> mosquitoes which serve as reservoirs and amplifying vectors, respectively. The virus can also be transmitted through contact with infective animal tissues such as blood, aborted foetus and other body fluids (Nyakarahuka et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2018</xref>). Humans have also been infected through drinking of raw, unpasteurized milk from infected animals (Ng’ang’a et al.
