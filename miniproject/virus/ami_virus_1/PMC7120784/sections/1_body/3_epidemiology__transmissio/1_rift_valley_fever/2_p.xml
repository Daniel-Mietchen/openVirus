<p id="Par10">The RVF virus is maintained during the dry season in desiccation-resistant vertically infected eggs of several 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species (Lumley et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2017</xref>). RVF epizootics and epidemics usually occur during periods of above normal and prolonged rainfall. The rainfall events result in flooding of dambo-type grassland depressions at greater depths and for extended periods compared to interepizootic periods. Consequently, previously dormant infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs are induced to hatch, causing the emergence and survival of at least one large generation of virus-infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR101">2016</xref>). These mosquitoes then transmit the virus to ungulate livestock, especially sheep, cattle and goats which serve as amplifying vertebrate hosts that may begin the epizootic cycle. After infection from primary 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> vectors, livestock species, especially sheep, suffer significant morbidity, mortality and up to 100% abortion. These amplifying vertebrates develop high viraemia, enough to infect secondary mosquito vector species (Lutomiah et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2014</xref>). Secondary mosquito species including 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> species then serve as the primary horizontal vectors of the RVF virus between viraemic domestic animals and humans. The pace of the epizootic may be further compounded because virus-infected moribund ungulates display little mosquito avoidance behaviour and are preferentially fed upon by secondary vectors (Linthicum et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2016</xref>).
