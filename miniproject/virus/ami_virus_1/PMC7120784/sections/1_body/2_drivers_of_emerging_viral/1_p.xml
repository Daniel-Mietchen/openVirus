<p id="Par6">Increases in the movement of people, climate change, and viral evolution involving cross-species at the human-animal interface lead to the emergence of new viruses (Parish et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">2008</xref>; Ippolito and Rezza 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2017</xref>). Environmental factors such as inadequate water supply, sanitation, food and climatic changes, as well as lapses associated with the collection, treatment and disposal of solid waste in developing nations often result to pollution of soil, water and air. This creates breeding sites for biological vectors of viral diseases such as insects and rodents (Obi and Shenge 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2018</xref>). A likely trend is the dispersal of insect vectors such as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes implicated in the spread of many arboviruses which have spread to new locations by adopting new breeding sites in tyres, overcrowded settings and stagnant water pools, mainly because of population growth and expansion. Most are as a result of massive settlements and residential building in unapproved sites such as marshy areas and near dumpsites lacking basic sanitation and proper waste disposal facilities (Marston et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR107">2014</xref>). In such areas, solid and open waste such as tyres, cans, plastic bottles, and nylon bags that collect water become breeding sites for vectors of viral agents.
