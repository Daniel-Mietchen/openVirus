<p id="Par8">Another critical driver of the emergence of viral diseases is host switching, where a virus that initially infected an animal host shifts to a new host and subsequently gets established within the human population after it is successfully transmitted (Lindstrom et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>). Host switching enables these viral agents to adapt as a result of recombination and assortment in their genomes, which may lead to the emergence of entirely new strains of the virus or strains with reassorted gene segments. This trend was observed in the 1957 H2N2, and 1968 H3N2 Influenza, human pandemic viruses containing gene segments of haemagglutinin (HA) and polymerase (PB1) obtained from the avian influenza virus (Webby and Webster
