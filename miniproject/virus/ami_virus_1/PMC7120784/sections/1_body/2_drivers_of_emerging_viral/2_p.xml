<p id="Par7"> Climatic factors like temperature, rainfall and relative humidity influence the incidence, duration and intensity of the emergence of epidemic forms of viral diseases. For example, it has been observed that the incidence of Rift Valley fever in East Africa at a time increased as a result of long periods of heavy rainfall, which created increased breeding sites for the vectors of the disease (Davies et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1985</xref>). Microbial adaptation in any environment is driven by factors which range from host to agent and ecological influences. Hosts factors include gender, age, and immune status, among others, which may determine the outcome of infection in an exposed host. Additionally, human activities and individual behaviours may influence the transmission of viral diseases. Evolution of viruses resulting in cross-species transmission has also been tagged as a driver of emerging viruses. This is mainly seen among rapidly evolving viruses such as RNA viruses, which are prone to error during replication (Drake and Holland 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR019">1999</xref>), due to lack of proofreading machinery by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">1997</xref>). This results in nucleotide substitutions (mutations) due to rapid replication and synthesis of enormous virus quantity within a short time (Moya et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2004</xref>). The distribution of viral variants in the human population can be due to epidemics through different means of transmission (Parish et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">2014</xref>). Such diversities have been observed in some RNA viruses such as the HIV and hepatitis C virus (Argentini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2009</xref>; Shenge et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2018</xref>).
