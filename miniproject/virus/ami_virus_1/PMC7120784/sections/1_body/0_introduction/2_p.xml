<p id="Par3">Approximately 80% of viruses that infect humans are zoonotic (Taylor et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2001</xref>). Most of these viruses perpetuate naturally in animal reservoirs that include numerous mammalian, avian and invertebrate vectors or intermediate hosts (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR103">2005</xref>; Kilpatrick and Randolph 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2012</xref>). Farm and wild animals are the primary sources of novel zoonotic viruses causing disease in human. This gives rise to about 60% of known human pathogens and up to 75% of emerging human infections (Cleaveland et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2001</xref>). Outbreaks of several viral haemorrhagic diseases have been reported in Africa, majorly caused by viruses in the families 
 <italic>Filoviridae, Arenaviridae, Flaviviridae</italic> and 
 <italic>Bunyaviridae.</italic> Animal reservoirs have been involved in the emergence of these viruses in humans. Hence, the transmission of these infectious agents from animals to humans, or vice versa, has resulted in the sustained periodic dissemination in the human population.
