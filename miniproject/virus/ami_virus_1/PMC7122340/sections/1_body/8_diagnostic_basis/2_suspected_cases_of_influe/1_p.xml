In any other periods, the occurrence of fever with cough and/or sore throat and other acute respiratory symptoms should be suspected as the cases of influenza after an epidemiological history related to influenza is reported. The epidemiological history may be a visit to the area or community with outbreak of influenza within 7 days before the onset, living together or having close contacts to suspected cases of influenza, and traveling back from the country or area with prevailing influenza.</p>
