<p id="Par54">During the prevailing period of influenza, its diagnosis presents no challenge, which can be made based on clinical symptoms and stratified diagnosis. However, early sporadic cases should be diagnosed comprehensively based on the epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and laboratory findings. The diagnostic basis includes history of contact to influenza, typical symptoms and physical signs, and pathogen detection. Successful detection of influenza virus or virus antigen or serious antibody from nasal or pharyngeal secretions can define the diagnosis.</p>
