<p id="Par57">Radiological findings demonstrate the severity of the conditions in a certain degree. In slight cases, chest radiology demonstrates no obvious abnormalities or only thickened pulmonary markings and blurry interstitial pneumonia. In serious cases complicated by pneumonia, intrapulmonary consolidation changes can be found in a large range. The lesions may be distributed consistently with morphology of pulmonary lobe or segment. In some cases, the complications of emphysema and acute respiratory distress syndrome occur, with multiple diffusive lesions in both lungs that rapidly changes. In rare cases, life can be threatened.</p>
