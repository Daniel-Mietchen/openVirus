<p id="Par5">As early as in the years of 412 BC, Hippocrates described a flu-like disease. But the first detailed description of influenza pandemic was in 1580. A total of 31 influenza pandemics have been recorded in documents, indicating periodic occurrence of influenza pandemics. Since the twentieth century, four global influenza pandemics have been recorded, respectively, in 1918, 1957, 1968, and 1977, all of which were caused by strains of influenza A virus.</p>
