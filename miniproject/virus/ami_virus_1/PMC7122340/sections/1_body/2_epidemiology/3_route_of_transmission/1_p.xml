<p id="Par7">Influenza mainly spreads via droplets in the air. The influenza virus exists in the respiratory secretions of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients. By talking, coughing, and sneezing, droplets or aerosols carrying the virus are disseminated into the air. The inhalation of the droplets or aerosols by a susceptible person can cause the infection. The virus can also spread via direct or indirect contact to mucosa of the mouth, nasal cavity, and eyes. Therefore, influenza has a strong infectivity, with rapid spreading and extensive prevalence. Its spreading speed is related to the population density.</p>
