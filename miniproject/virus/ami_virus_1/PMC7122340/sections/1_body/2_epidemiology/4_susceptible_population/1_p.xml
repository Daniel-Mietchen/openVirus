<p id="Par8">Populations are generally susceptible and the susceptibility is not related to gender and occupation. Once cured, certain immunity can be acquired. The antibody can be firstly detected in 1 week after the infection, which peaks at weeks 2–3 after the infection and begins to decrease in 1–2 months. The antibody can be detected in the blood and secretions of nasal mucosa. No cross-immunity exists among influenza A, B, and C and among subtypes of influenza A. Influenza has a repeated onset and the acquired immunity after the infection only persists for a short period of time. Although antibody exists in the blood, the person can be reinfected by the same virus. The influenza virus is always subject to variance, and the highest incidence rate is found in the populations of young adults and adolescents.</p>
