<p id="Par6">Patients with influenza and asymptomatic infected patients are the main sources of infection, whose infectivity lasts from the end of incubation period to the acute stage after onset. In the first 2–3 days after the onset, their infectivity is the strongest. When adults and elder children are sustaining seasonal influenza with no complications, virus excretion persists for 3–6 days in the respiratory secretions. Hospitalized adult patients can disseminate the viruses with pathogenicity for 1 week or longer after the onset. Studies have demonstrated that in infants and young children with influenza or human patients with influenza caused by avian H5N1 subtype of influenza A virus, long-term virus excretion is common, usually persisting for 1–3 weeks. In addition, patients with immunodeficiency such as patients with AIDS may also show a prolonged period of virus excretion.</p>
