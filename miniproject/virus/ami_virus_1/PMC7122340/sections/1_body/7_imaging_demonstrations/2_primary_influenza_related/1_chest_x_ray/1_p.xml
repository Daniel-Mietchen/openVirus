<p id="Par37">Chest X-ray demonstrations mainly include interstitial pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia, with early demonstrations of enhanced lung markings with blurry boundaries that are more obvious in both lower lungs and increased density in ground-glass opacities. Due to not obvious clinical symptoms, the diagnosis cannot be hardly defined. With progress of the conditions, the X-ray demonstrations are reticular shadow and reticulonodular shadow in the long fields with nodules being smaller than 5 mm, which can be concurrent with enhanced blurry lung markings. The lesions are commonly distributed in lower fields of both lungs and around the hilum (Figs. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">21.1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">21.2</xref>). The pathological changes include exudative inflammation at the alveolar wall and lobular septum. In the late stage, due to inflammatory obstruction of bronchioles, cystic changes occur in different sizes, with demonstrations of a honeycomb-like lung, shrinkage of lung volume, elevated diaphragm, and shifted interlobar fissures. By lung biopsy, about 30 % of the cases can be confirmed with pulmonary interstitial fibrosis but no abnormalities by chest X-ray. X-ray is not sufficiently sensitive to alveolitis and the demonstrations are nonspecific.
