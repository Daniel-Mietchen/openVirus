<p id="Par40">Compared to traditional chest X-ray, CT scanning can more favorably demonstrate the conditions. It facilitates more accurate assessment about the severity, range, and location of the lesions. By adjusting the window width and window level, subtle dynamic changes and distribution of lesions can be demonstrated, providing more information than chest X-ray. CT scanning demonstrations include large flake of consolidation opacity in the lung lobe or segment with accompanying air bronchogram, small nodular shadows, ground-glass opacity, tree-in-bud sign, and mosaic perfusion as well as thickened interlobular septum, pleural inferior line, thickened adjacent pleura, and pleural effusion.</p>
