<p id="Par3">In the year 1971, the WTO officially claimed the nomination system of influenza virus. Based on the antigenic difference of the virus nucleocapsid protein (NP), influenza viruses are classified into types A, B, and C (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">21.1</xref>). Influenza virus is an RNA virus, which is most stable in an environment with a pH value of 6.5–7.9 and has weak resistance to heat. It loses its pathogenicity at a temperature of 56 °C for several minutes and is inactivated at a temperature of 100 °C for 1 min. Influenza virus is more stable in an environment of low temperature. It can survive for more than 1 month at 4 °C and for more than 5 months at −70 °C. Influenza virus is sensitive to dryness, ultraviolet radiation, ethanol, iodine, and other common disinfectants. Rapid mutation and evolution are its main features, which is the result of antigenic structural changes in hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, particularly hemagglutinin. Each variation of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase continually combines to form new mutant strains, and a new strain may defeat the established immunity against the former strain. Only when the population immunity is compromised to a certain level can the new strain likely invade the susceptible populations to cause an outbreak. This is the main reason for recurrent pandemics of influenza. Significant variation commonly occurs in influenza A virus, but rarely in influenza B virus and none in influenza C virus.
