<p id="Par16">It is the most commonly found influenza, with sudden onset and symptoms of aversion to cold and high fever. The body temperature can be up to 39–40 °C. Fever is the most important initial symptom, commonly with accompanying headache, systemic muscular and joint soreness and pain, fatigue, poor appetite, and other toxic symptoms, whose severity is related to the degree of fever. Commonly, fever in patients with influenza is persistently high, typically for 3 days. Some patients may experience photophobia and lacrimation. And other symptoms including nasal obstruction, runny nose, sore throat, coarse voice, and other respiratory tract symptoms can be found at the onset. After the body temperature returns to normal, the systemic symptoms are improved, but with increasingly obvious respiratory symptoms. Coughing and physical strength commonly require 1–2 weeks to return back to normal. By physical examination in the acute stage, the patients have an acute complexion, with flushing on the face, mild conjunctival congestion, as well as damp and warm skin. In some patients with pharyngeal congestion, oral mucosal herpes may occur.</p>
