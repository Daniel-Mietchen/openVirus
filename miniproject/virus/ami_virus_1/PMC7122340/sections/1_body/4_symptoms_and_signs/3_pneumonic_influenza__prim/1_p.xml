<p id="Par17">Pneumonic influenza can be either primary or secondary to simplex influenza. The occurrence of pneumonic influenza is the result of influenza virus infection spreading from the upper respiratory tract downward to the lower respiratory tract, which is more common in the elderly, children, patients with primary cardiopulmonary disease (especially rheumatic heart disease and left atrioventricular valvular stenosis), women in pregnancy, and populations with immunodeficiency. But in up to half of the cases, no underlying disease is reported. The manifestations of typical pneumonic influenza include high fever that persists for a long period of time, rapid occurrence of dyspnea, cyanosis, severe cough, foamy thick sputum or purulent sputum, and bloody sputum. By physical examination, breathing sounds of both lungs are low, with moist rales. Generally, the course of the disease lasts for 3â€“4 weeks. Antibacterial therapies have no therapeutic efficacy. Death may occur due to heart failure or respiratory and circulatory failure and pneumonic influenza has a high mortality rate.</p>
