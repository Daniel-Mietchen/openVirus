<p id="Par22">The elderly influenza refers to infection of influenza by elderly population aged above 65 years. Because this population commonly has primary respiratory or cardiovascular disease, the conditions of the elderly influenza are commonly serious, with rapid development. The possibility of pneumonia in the elderly patients with influenza is higher than that in the adult patients with influenza. In this population, influenza may involve other systems to cause influenza-related viral myocarditis and influenza-related viral encephalitis.</p>
