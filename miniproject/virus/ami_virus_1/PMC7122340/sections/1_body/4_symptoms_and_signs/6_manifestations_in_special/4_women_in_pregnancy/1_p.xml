<p id="Par23">In addition to fever and cough, women infected by influenza virus in middle and late stages of pregnancy are susceptible to pneumonia. The conditions rapidly progress into dyspnea, hypoxemia, and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Subsequently, miscarriage, premature birth, intrauterine fetal distress, and death may occur. Infection of influenza in middle and late stages of pregnancy can induce aggravation of the basic disease. In some serious cases, death may occur in 2 days after the onset; antiviral therapy should be administered. Otherwise, delayed treatment obviously increases the mortality rate.</p>
