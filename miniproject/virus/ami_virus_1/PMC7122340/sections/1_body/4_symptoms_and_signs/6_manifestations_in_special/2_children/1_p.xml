<p id="Par21">During the flu-prevailing seasons, more than 40 % of preschoolers and 30 % of school-aged children sustain influenza. Influenza in common healthy children is mild, with symptoms of fever, cough, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore throat, and headache. In some rare cases, muscular pain, vomiting, and diarrhea occur. Influenza in infants and young children commonly has atypical clinical symptoms, with possible occurrence of high fever and convulsion. Neonatal influenza is rare but its occurrence is commonly complicated by pneumonia. In addition, neonatal influenza commonly has septicemic manifestations including drowsiness, feeding refusal, and apnea. In young children, influenza-induced laryngitis, tracheitis, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, and gastrointestinal symptoms are more common than in adults.</p>
