<p id="Par14">In fatal influenza-related viral pneumonia, the gross pathological changes include bleeding, severe tracheobronchitis, and pneumonia. The lesions are characterized by extensive bronchial and bronchiolar cell necrosis, with accompanying shedding of ciliated epithelial cells, fibrin exudation, inflammatory cell infiltration, hyaline membrane formation, congestion of alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells, interstitial edema, and mononuclear cell infiltration. The later changes also include diffuse alveolar damage, lymphocytic alveolitis, metaplastic regeneration of epithelial cells, or even extensive fibrosis of lung tissues. By autopsy, extensive necrotic tracheobronchitis can be found, with accompanying ulceration and tracheal mucosal shedding and necrosis. Above 1/3 of the cases have diffuse brain tissue hyperemia and edema, myocardial cell swelling, interstitial hemorrhage, lymphocytic infiltration, necrosis, and other inflammations.</p>
