<p id="Par13">After the initial infection, lesions may involve the trachea, bronchi, and lower respiratory tract. In the cases of simplex acute influenza, extensive inflammatory changes, mucosal lesions, and edema occur in the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. Biopsy demonstrates vacuolar degeneration of bronchial mucosa columnar epithelial cells, loss of cells, and even extensive shedding which involves basilar cells, shedding of ciliated cells, and metaplasia of epithelial cells. Antigen of influenza virus can be detected in surface layer of epithelial cells. There are congestion and edema of lamina propria mucosa cells with accompanying infiltrations of lymphocytes and monocytes that persist for more than 2â€“3 days. Subsequently, the undifferentiated basilar cells regenerate. With the conditions improved, the layer of epithelial cells can recover through rapid regeneration and metaplasia.</p>
