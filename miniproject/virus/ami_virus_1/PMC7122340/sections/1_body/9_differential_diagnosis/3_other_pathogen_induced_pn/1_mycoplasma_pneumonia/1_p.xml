<p id="Par63">Mycoplasma pneumonia is an acute respiratory tract infection with accompanying pneumonia caused by mycoplasma. It occurs in both children and adults, with positive cold agglutination test. Chest X-ray demonstrates early lesions of only increased pulmonary markings with poorly defined boundaries. The lesions then develop into blurry cloudy or homogeneous shadows that commonly distribute in the middle and lower lung fields. The shadows close to the hilum are denser with gradually lighter shadows towards the periphery and poorly defined boundaries. The lesions commonly have no involvement of the whole lobe. Mycoplasma pneumonia with lobar lesions cannot be differentiated from lobar pneumonias caused by other pathogens. CT scanning demonstrations are mainly pulmonary ground-glass opacity and nodular shadow or small patches of consolidation shadows of air cavities that is the characteristic CT scanning demonstration, thickened bronchial vascular bundles, tree-in-bud sign, large flakes of consolidation shadows and possibly accompanying mediastinal lymphadenectasis, and pleural effusion. The pulmonary lesions are usually absorbed in 2 weeks or even in 4â€“6 weeks.</p>
