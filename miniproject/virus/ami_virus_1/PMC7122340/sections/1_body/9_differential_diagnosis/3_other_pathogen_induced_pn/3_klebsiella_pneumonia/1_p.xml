 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pneumonia is an acute pulmonary inflammation caused by 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic>. It is more common in individuals with chronic alcoholism, individuals with malnutrition, and the elderly. Chest X-ray demonstrations can be divided into three types: (1) increased lung markings, (2) lobular or diffuse pneumonia, and (3) lobar consolidation or pulmonary abscess. CT scanning can more favorably demonstrate the lesions than chest X-ray. The early consolidations in the cases of 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> pneumonia have lobular distributions, with patches or irregular dense shadows that scatter and commonly involve multiple pulmonary segments. The lesions rapidly fuse to lobar consolidation that is more common in the right upper lobe. Due to thick and heavy exudate fluid in the lesions, the interlobar space drops. Necrosis of the lesions induces pulmonary abscesses, which are multiple small cavities with a diameter of less than 2 cm. The healing is slow, commonly with residual extensive fibrosis.
