<p id="Par64">Allergic pneumonia is a group of non-asthmatic allergic lung disease caused by different allergens. Chest X-ray may demonstrate normality or diffusive interstitial fibrosis. The commonly demonstrated lesions include bilateral patches or nodular infiltration, thickened bronchial lung markings, or small acinus-like changes. Hilar lymphadenectasis and pleural effusion are rare. CT scanning demonstrates thickened bronchial vascular bundles, small patches of shadows along bronchial vascular bundles with poorly defined boundaries, and ground-glass opacity. CT scanning demonstrations are not regular. The severity of lesions by radiology may be inconsistent with the clinical symptoms.</p>
