<p id="Par61">Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common pathogen that causes infantile viral pneumonia. The typically change is diffusive interstitial infiltration. Most of the cases have small flakes of shadows that are commonly found in 2â€“3 lung lobes. About 1/3 of the patients experience emphysema or excessive gases in the lung of different severities. About 15 % of the cases have only X-ray demonstration of excessive gas in the lungs. About 1/4 of the cases have pulmonary consolidation or atelectasis, with the lesions confined inferior to the pulmonary segments and commonly found in the right upper lung lobe. Imaging demonstration of absorption of pulmonary consolidation obviously lags behind the actual improvement of the symptoms and signs.</p>
