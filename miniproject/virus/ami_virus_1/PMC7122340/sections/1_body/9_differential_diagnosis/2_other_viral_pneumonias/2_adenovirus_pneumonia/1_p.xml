<p id="Par60">The X-ray demonstrated morphology of adenovirus pneumonia lesions is closely related to the severity and stage of the disease. The early demonstrations include thickened and blurry pulmonary markings and small nodular shadows along the pulmonary markings in the medial middle zone of the middle and lower fields of both lungs. In 3â€“5 days after the onset, pulmonary consolidations occur, with flakes of lesions in different sizes or fusion of the lesions that are more commonly found in the lower field of both lungs and in the right upper lung. The density of the lesions increases along with the progress of the conditions, with increased quantity of lesions and extensive distribution and fusion of lesions. Emphysema is common. Pleural effusion occurs in rare cases.</p>
