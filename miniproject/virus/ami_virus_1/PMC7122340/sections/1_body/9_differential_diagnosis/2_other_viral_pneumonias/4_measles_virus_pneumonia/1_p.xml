<p id="Par62">Measles virus pneumonia is more common in infants, young children, and individuals with compromised immunity and commonly occurs in the early period of the disease. Chest X-ray demonstrations are mainly flakes or diffusive ground-glass opacity and/or thickened bronchial vascular bundles. CT scanning demonstrates lobular central nodules with poorly defined boundaries, ground-glass opacity, thickened lobular septum, and consolidation shadows in lobules or segments.</p>
