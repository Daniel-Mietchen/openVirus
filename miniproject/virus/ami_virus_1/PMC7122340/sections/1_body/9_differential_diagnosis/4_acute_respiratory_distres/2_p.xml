<p id="Par67">The radiological demonstrations of ARDS are related to leakage of edema fluid containing a large quantity of proteins to fill in the alveolar cavity because of damaged alveolar epithelial cells or diffusively destructed alveolar walls. Chest X-ray commonly demonstrates diffusively distributed shadows in both lungs and characteristic radiological changes of basic diseases such as severe pneumonia caused by various pathogens. CT scanning demonstrates unevenly distributed lesions, including (1) normal or nearly normal gravity-independent area (mainly the anterior chest in supine position), (2) ground-glass opacity at the anterior and middle regions, and (3) consolidation shadow in the gravity-dependent area. In the cases with no lesions in the pulmonary capillary membrane, the patches of shadows in both lungs are evenly distributed, with no gravity dependency and no gravity-dependent change after changing body posture, which facilitates the differentiation from pulmonary infectious diseases. The advanced manifestations of ARDS include twisted bronchi and traction of bronchi and shrinkage of pulmonary segment or lobe volume, with grid-like shadow, cord-like shadow, and honeycomb-like shadow. In serious cases, honeycomb-like lung occurs.</p>
