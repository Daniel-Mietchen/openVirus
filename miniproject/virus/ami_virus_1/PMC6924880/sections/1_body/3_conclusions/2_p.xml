<p>Our data demonstrate that a number of the JEV isolates we obtained in select countries of Southeast Asia during 2016â€“2018 were phylogenetically related to isolates reported in the same country in the 1980s, suggesting that some JEV strains have been maintained in their corresponding regions. Contrary to our expectation, the JEV transmission cycle seems to have been maintained indigenously. JEV strains are presumed to be transferred between JEV-endemic regions by movement of arthropod vectors and bird reservoirs. Nonetheless, we infer that fixation of an invading JEV strain into a new region is difficult unless the new strain possesses properties advantageous for virus growth and expansion (

However, the genotype shift from GIII to GIa has occurred in East Asia since the 1990s, indicating that GIa must have had some sort of growth advantage over GIII that permitted its spreading to and expansion in these countries. Our findings that JEV strain invasion in Asia is infrequent could assist in public health decision-making regarding vaccine formulation and campaign strategies.
