<p>On the basis of their genome sequences, JEVs are classified into 5 genotypes (
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>4</italic>
 </xref>). JEV genotype I (GI), which has been further classified into subgenotypes GIa and GIb, and JEV GIII are the dominant lineages and have been detected widely throughout Asia. JEV GII is the thirdmost common lineage and has been found in Indonesia, Singapore, South Korea, Malaysia, and Australia. JEV GIV and GV are rare lineages; only a few viruses of these genotypes have been isolated from Indonesia, Malaysia, and China as of October 2019. Over the past 30 years, JEV GIa has displaced GIII as the dominant lineage in many countries of Asia (

 <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">
