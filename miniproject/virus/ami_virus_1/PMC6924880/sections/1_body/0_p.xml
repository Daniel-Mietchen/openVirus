<p>The locations of epidemics of arthropodborne viruses (arboviruses) are strongly associated with the distribution of their vectors. In general, the distribution of arboviruses can expand through the dispersal, transfer, and migration of their vector arthropods and reservoir animals. Mosquitoes transmit a variety of viral pathogens (e.g., dengue, Zika, and chikungunya viruses) and have caused a number of arboviral epidemics throughout the world (

 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>, genus 
 <italic>Flavivirus</italic>) is a mosquitoborne arbovirus that causes a severe form of encephalitis in humans. JEV is distributed across most of Asia, the western Pacific, and northern Australia (
