<p>We should distinguish at this point the clinical seriousness caused by different influenza virus types and subtypes, as observed in severe influenza surveillance systems, from those results on the effect of influenza on population mortality rates obtained from population-based studies that use regression models. As previously reported, influenza A(H3N2)–dominant epidemics have a considerable impact on mortality, with highest excess mortality attributable to influenza occurring mainly in older adults (

 </xref>). However, many of these deaths might have occurred in older persons who have a cascade of illness after an influenza infection, and influenza in older patients might not have a typical clinical profile. Moreover, many older patients might die at home or in managed care facilities and might not get to a hospital. The increase in deaths associated with influenza A(H3N2) at the population level might reflect greater population susceptibility or reduced vaccine effectiveness against influenza A(H3N2) that has become apparent in recent years (

 </xref>), although it might not reflect the relative clinical seriousness of the individual infection. Therefore, our finding that pH1N1 infections caused a higher clinical seriousness in hospitalized patients than influenza A(H3N2) or B infections is fully congruent with the greater effect on the population mortality caused by influenza A(H3N2) seasons (
