<p>During the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, an unexpectedly low number of case-patients were reported compared with previous seasons. Similar observations were reported during the 2011–12 influenza season in the United States (

 </xref>). Given that the definition of case-patient was established in a season with almost exclusively pH1N1 circulation, the figures for the first postpandemic season with dominant influenza A(H3N2) virus might have been affected by lower definition sensitivity for identifying case-patients infected with other influenza types and subtypes. In addition, according to 2 international cohort studies conducted during 2009–2015 (
 <xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">
  <italic>15</italic>
 </xref>), outpatients with influenza A(H3N2) virus infection were less likely to be hospitalized than those infected with pH1N1 or influenza B virus, which might have influenced the numbers reported. Another aspect that could influence the higher number of pH1N1 infections recorded compared with other subtypes is the wider availability of the PCR assay for this virus subtype since the 2009 pandemic in all the laboratories of the hospitals participating in SHCIC surveillance.
