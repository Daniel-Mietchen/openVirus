<p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that hospitalized patients infected with pH1N1 virus had a higher risk for ICU admission, death, or both than patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B infections, despite being younger and having fewer underlying medical conditions. Therefore, in those seasons with considerable circulation of pH1N1, more admissions to hospital ICUs should be expected, especially among hospitalized young adult patients. To decrease treatment delays, antiviral treatment should be started shortly after admission to hospital when influenza is suspected. These observations could be of crucial importance when planning resource deployment during influenza epidemics. Understanding the patterns of disease severity associated with influenza and how these patterns might differ among virus types and subtypes can help guide public health measures to control influenza. This knowledge can help in directing resource allocation in the healthcare system during each influenza season and thus can ensure an effective response to pressures on ICUs, especially during pH1N1 epidemics.</p>
