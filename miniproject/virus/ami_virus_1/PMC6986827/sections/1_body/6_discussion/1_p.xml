<p>Our findings show that SHCIC surveillance has provided valuable information on disease severity by influenza virus type and subtype since the 2009 pandemic. We found that case-patients infected with pH1N1 were significantly younger than those infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B and had a higher risk for clinical complications and severe outcomes, such as ICU admission, death, or both compared with case-patients with influenza A(H3N2) or B virus infections.</p>
