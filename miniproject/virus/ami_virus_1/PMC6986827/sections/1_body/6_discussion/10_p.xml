<p>This study has several limitations. First, we cannot exclude a possible bias that results from using hospitalized case-based surveillance systems with many reporting sites that might have had different testing practices and might also have varied by season. However, because of the high percentage of the national population included in the SHCIC surveillance, the results obtained should be highly representative of the entire country. During the last 4 seasons, a relatively high proportion of influenza A infections were not subtyped, probably because of the implementation of rapid tests for influenza confirmation. Influenza testing could also have been biased depending on age, severity of symptoms, changes in swabbing practices in the last few seasons, or even as a result of the selection of patients for swabbing based on physician-suspected influenza; however, these factors should not have influenced the virus type and subtype recorded. The multivariable analysis has been controlled for bias by season to avoid potential biases related to the inclusion of several seasons in the study (i.e., differing dominant influenza virus types and subtypes and their antigenic drifts and shifts, influenza vaccine uptake, and seasonal variations in match the vaccine to the circulating influenza strains could all complicate comparisons between seasons). However, a real strength of this study is its representativeness; it enrolled patients from hospitals throughout Spain and across every age group, it covered every influenza season since SHCIC surveillance began in 2009, and it benefited from substantial virus co-circulation and a large sample size.</p>
