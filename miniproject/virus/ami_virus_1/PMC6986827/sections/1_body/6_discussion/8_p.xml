<p>Our results indicate that patients with influenza A(H3N2) or B infections were less likely to be admitted to an ICU, die, or both than were those with pH1N1 infections, after controlling for potential confounders. These findings are in agreement with other studies of disease severity by influenza virus type and subtype, which report higher ORs for ICU admission for pH1N1-infected patients (
