<p>Our results indicate that the likelihood of pneumonia was higher among patients with pH1N1 than patients with influenza A(H3N2) or B infections. However, patients with influenza A(H3N2) or B infections had a higher risk for bacterial or viral co-infection. Although our study lacks information on other clinical features or radiologic findings, the results seem to be in line with previous studies. A US study found that adults with pH1N1 infection had an increased risk for radiographically confirmed pneumonia compared with those with influenza A(H3N2) infection (
