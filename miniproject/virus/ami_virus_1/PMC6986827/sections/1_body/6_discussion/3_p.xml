<p>Our results are similar to those from previous studies, which found that hospitalized influenza pH1N1-infected patients were younger than those infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B (

The different susceptibility of each birth cohort is based on the likelihood that their influenza primary infections were with group 1 or 2 hemagglutinin. Individuals born before 1956 likely had their first infection with a group 1 virus and had preexisting cross-reactive antibodies against viruses of the same group as pH1N1 virus, whereas those born in 1968 or later appear protected against severe influenza A(H3N2) infection (

The younger patients, who have less exposure to this older seasonal influenza A(H1N1) virus, might have experienced more severe disease as a result of direct infection by pH1N1 and the resulting cytokine-induced inflammatory responses, an immune-mediated pathologic process which is believed to play an important role in the onset of severe disease (
