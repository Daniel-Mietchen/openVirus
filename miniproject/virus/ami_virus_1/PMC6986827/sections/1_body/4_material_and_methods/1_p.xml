<p>We conducted a retrospective cohort study by using SHCIC surveillance data obtained across the 7 postpandemic influenza seasons (2010–11 through 2016–17). The SHCIC surveillance system is a passive, hospital-based surveillance system that includes 90–181 reporting hospitals during the study period; these hospitals are located throughout Spain and serve 45%–60% of the population of Spain, depending on the influenza season.</p>
