<p>We used univariate multinomial logistic regression models to compare demographic and clinical characteristics across virus types and subtypes, including as a dependent variable the influenza virus type and subtype, with pH1N1 used as reference, and as independent variables each of the characteristics of interest. We measured the effect of each predictor in the model as a relative risk ratio (RRR). We also conducted univariate logistic regression models to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for the risk for clinical complications or death, considering influenza virus type and subtype to be an explanatory variable and using influenza pH1N1 as reference. We compared patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B against patients infected with pH1N1.</p>
