<p>This study was conducted within the framework of ongoing SHCIC surveillance by the Institute of Health Carlos III National Epidemiology Centre. A formal ethics review was not required because the study was part of the routine surveillance activities in Spain. However, we collected anonymized data and obtained verbal consent from all patients before they were swabbed for surveillance purposes.</p>
