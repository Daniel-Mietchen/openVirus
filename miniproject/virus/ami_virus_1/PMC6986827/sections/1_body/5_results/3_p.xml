<p>The distribution of case-patients by age group varied according to the circulating virus type and subtype in each influenza season (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). In seasons with dominant pH1N1 circulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels A, C, and F), most patients (52%) were persons 15–64 years of age. Patients 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>65 years of age accounted for 65% of case-patients in those seasons with dominant influenza A(H3N2) circulation (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panels B, E, and G); however, during the 2011–12 season, a relatively high percentage (33%) of case-patients were children. In the 2012–13 season, 54% of case-patients 15–64 years of age were infected with pH1N1, whereas 89% of case-patients 5–14 years of age were infected with influenza B (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel C). In general, case-patients infected with pH1N1 were significantly younger (median age 53 years [interquartile range (IQR) 37–66 years]) than those infected with influenza A(H3N2) (median age 73 years [IQR 56–83 years]) and influenza B (median age 60 years [22–74 years]) (p&lt;0.001).
