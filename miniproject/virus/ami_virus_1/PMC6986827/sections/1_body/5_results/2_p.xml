<p>SHCIC surveillance indicated week-by-week patterns that matched the epidemiologic patterns for influenza in the community based on the sentinel system for primary care. The identified influenza virus types and subtypes among case-patients were consistent with the type and subtype of influenza virus circulating within the general population (

Also, we noted a substantial contribution from influenza B infections during the influenza A(H3N2)–dominant 2014–15 season and after the peak of the pH1N1-dominant 2015–16 influenza season (
