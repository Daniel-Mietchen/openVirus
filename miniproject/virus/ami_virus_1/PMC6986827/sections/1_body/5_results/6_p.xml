<p>We used a multivariable logistic regression analysis to explore the effect of influenza virus type and subtype on the severity of outcomes, such as ICU admission, death, or ICU admission and death, according to age group (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1). Case-patients 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>15 years of age who had influenza A(H3N2) or B infection showed less risk for death or ICU admission than patients infected with pH1N1, independent of other risk factors (
 <xref ref-type="local-data" rid="SD1">Appendix</xref> Table 1). The pattern for all case-patient age groups combined was similar. When we compared pH1N1-infected patients with the other 2 patient groups, we observed significant differences in risk for ICU admission among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients (adjusted OR [aOR] 0.56 [95% CI 0.44–0.71]) and influenza B–infected patients (aOR 0.51 [95% CI 0.41–0.63]); risk for death among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients (aOR 0.56 [95% CI 0.40–0.77]) and influenza B–infected patients (aOR 0.38 [95% CI 0.26–0.54]); and risk for ICU admission and death among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients (aOR 0.59 [95% CI 0.47–0.73]) and for influenza B–infected patients (aOR 0.50 [95% CI 0.44–0.62]). However, among children &lt;15 years of age, we observed no significant differences in the severity of outcome by virus type and subtype. In addition, we observed no difference in the risk for ICU admission between different influenza A subtypes among patients 
 <underline>&gt;</underline>65 years of age (
