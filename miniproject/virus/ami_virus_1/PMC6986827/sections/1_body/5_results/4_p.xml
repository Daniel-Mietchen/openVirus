<p>Regarding the clinical characteristics, case-patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B virus were more likely to have

However, immunosuppression was less likely among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients than pH1N1-infected patients (cRRR 0.72 [95% CI 0.63–0.84]). Class III obesity was less frequent among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients (cRRR 0.66 [95% CI 0.55–0.78]) and influenza B–infected patients (cRRR 0.59 [95% CI 0.46–0.75]) than among pH1N1-infected patients. Among women 15–49 years of age, fewer pregnancies were observed among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients than pH1N1-infected patients (cRRR 0.33 [95% CI 0.17–0.64]). Patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B virus were less likely to receive antiviral treatment than those infected with pH1N1 (cRRR 0.48 [95% CI 0.42–0.54] for influenza A[H3N2]–infected patients and cRRR 0.30 [95% CI 0.26–0.34] for influenza B–virus infected patients) (
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The median days from symptom onset to hospitalization was longer among pH1N1-infected patients (4 days [IQR 2–6 days]) than for influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients (3 days [IQR 1–5 days] (p&lt;0.001),
