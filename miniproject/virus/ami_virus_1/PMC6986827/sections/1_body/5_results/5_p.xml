<p>The analysis of clinical complications and outcome revealed that patients with influenza A(H3N2) and B virus infection had lower risk for pneumonia (crude OR [cOR] 0.68 [95% CI 0.61–0.76] for influenza A[H3N2]–infected patients and cOR 0.77 [95% CI 0.67–0.89] for influenza B–virus infected patients), ARDS (cOR 0.69 [95% CI 0.61–0.77] for influenza A[H3N2]–infected patients and cOR 0.73 [95% CI 0.63–0.85] for influenza B–virus infected patients), and ICU admission (cOR 0.55 [95% CI 0.50–0.61] for influenza A[H3N2]–infected patients and cOR 0.64 [95% CI 0.56–0.73] for influenza B–virus infected patients) compared with patients with pH1N1 infection (

However, patients infected with influenza A(H3N2) or B had a higher risk for co-infection (cOR 1.23 [95% CI 1.09–1.38] for influenza A[H3N2]–infected patients and cOR 1.43 [95% CI 1.22–1.67] for influenza B–virus infected patients). The case-fatality rate was significantly higher among influenza A(H3N2)–infected patients (cOR 1.25 [95% CI 1.10–1.43]) than for pH1N1-infected patients. The risk for death was significantly lower for those patients infected with influenza B (cOR 0.76 [95% CI 0.62–0.93] for patients hospitalized and cOR 0.73 [95% CI 0.55–0.97] for those admitted to ICU) than patients with pH1N1 infection.
