<p>The association of certain influenza virus types and subtypes with disease severity has been a major topic of influenza research in recent years (

Some studies have reported no statistically significant differences in case-fatality rates and other markers of severity by type and subtype of influenza infections (

 </xref>) and have shown that the risk for serious outcomes was not increased in hospitalized influenza patients infected with influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (pH1N1) compared with seasonal influenza B viruses (
