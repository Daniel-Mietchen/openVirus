  <p id="Par7">Adele Clarke et al. (2010) classify the time period after 1985 as the era of biomedicalization, where changes in technoscience, political economy, and biopolitics shaped a new landscape for medical culture in practice, research, and public culture, optimization being one of the imperatives engendered in this new era.</p>

  <p id="Par10">We understand post-postmodernism as a reaction to postmodernism circa early 2000s. This has been characterized as the tendency toward the recognition of the lack of definite meaning in language (inherited from postmodernism), while still re-energizing literature and cultural study to intervene in the world, primarily through affect—expression of emotions and feeling aimed toward intersubjectivity, sameness, and presence.

   <italic>technology and the imagination.</italic> Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars. 55–6. Other scholars have conceptualized this movement or period as digimodernsim or metamodernism.

  <p id="Par15">Just as Bashford and Hooker focus on biological contagion while keeping metaphorical contagion “a central focus,” so too does Mitchell suggest that the material and the figurative are intimately linked, though she focuses on the metaphor.</p>

  <p id="Par27">This is generally referred to as “contagionism” and was the prevailing model of disease transmission from the middle ages to the early nineteenth century. Its proponents emphasized the 
   <italic>cordon sanitare</italic> (quarantine) in contrast to environmental efforts to sanitize urban and impoverished areas—the method proposed by miasmists (sometimes referred to as anticontagionists).
