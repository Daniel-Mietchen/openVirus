 <italic>endemic</italic> prevalence in discourse and society. While epidemics and their narratives remain important for critical study, there has been little to no work done contextualizing the sheer prevalence of these narrativesâ€”a prevalence that constitutes by its very nature, as we argue in this volume, an endemic cultural perspective.
