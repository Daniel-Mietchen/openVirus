<p id="Par25">Thus, much like contagious discourse itself, this volume considers both the metaphorical and the biological forms of the endemicity of contagion, without seeking to—and in many ways avowedly refusing to—demarcate where the one begins and the other ends. While some contributors focus on biological iterations and others on the social, cultural, or digital “metaphors” of contagion, rather than parsing phenomena in one category or the other, each of the authors in this volume considers the concept holistically, examining ways that the biological and the figurative borrow from each other to shape the various discursive topoi of biomedicine, political economy, media, epistemology, and other systems of thought.</p>
