<p id="Par20">Contagion can be broadly characterized as any kind of influence that threatens our agentive control of our health, behavior, emotions, and social bonds. The relationship between biopolitics and contagion is ultimately about the production of self and the social. In this capacity, whenever we are investigating contagion we are investigating subjectivity, particularly Western, liberal subjectivity—that autonomous, self-contained, sealed-off self. The anxiogenic penetration that threatens the boundaries between the self and the other is based on the “membrane model,” in which identity is constructed upon the ability to resist external influences and forces, which are often “projections of undesirable internal drives” (Otis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>, p. 7), a characteristic, for instance, of Western constructions of EVD as Catherine Belling suggests in her chapter; selfhood is compromised by the penetration of one’s “membrane,” in the form of pathogens or foreign ideas (Otis 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1999</xref>, p. 7). Thus, contagion in its ideative and biological forms threatens the very fiber of our insulated subjectivities. It is in this power, however, where its revolutionary potential lies.
