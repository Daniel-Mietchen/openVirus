 <italic>s</italic> construction of the 1976 and 1989 Ebola outbreaks to the most recent 2014 Ebola pandemic. She suggests that the metonymic network of the Ebola body—the river, the virus, the disease symptoms, and its “horrors”—is indicative of how the self is contingent upon a “dark zone” which at once contains and fails to contain our subjectivity’s boundaries. This contingent definition of subjectivity, she argues, significantly impacts epidemiological discourse in fiction and news media during times of threatened outbreaks.
