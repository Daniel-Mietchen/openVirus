<p id="Par13">Since the turn of the twenty-first century, there have been a number of influential collections and monographs devoted to the subject, beyond medical histories of “plagues and peoples.” However, the prominent rubric by which cultural studies, science and technology studies (STS), and literary scholars have tended to approach the idea of contagion in their collections and monographs is through the epidemic. That is to say, it is framed as the form of contagion, whether pathogens or ideas, that emerges or, as it is frequently characterized, “strikes,” a population, disrupting the social and biological status quo. This is best characterized in Priscilla Wald’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>) landmark 
 <italic>Contagious</italic>, in which she chronicles “the outbreak narrative,” an emerging story of disease that “dramatizes the most basic of human narratives: the necessity and danger of human contact” (p. 2). Wald chronicles the plotting of epidemics from the case of Typhoid Mary to the Cold War era “viral cultures” to the turn-of-the-century Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic, contending that this narrative shapes the material conditions of epidemiology. Much of this kind of cultural studies work began earlier with Laura Otis’ (

 <italic>Membranes</italic> and then, notably, with Alison Bashford and Claire Hooker’s (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2001</xref>) collection 
 <italic>Contagion</italic>, both of which focus largely on histories and on biological contagion.
