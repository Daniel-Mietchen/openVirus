<p id="Par17">The etymology of epidemic and endemic is useful here to distinguish the relationship between a communicable disease and its specific proximity to and influence on a population. The term 
 <italic>epidemic</italic> originates from the Greek roots 
 <italic>epi</italic> (“upon” or “over”) and 
 <italic>demos</italic> (“people”). In other words, epidemics are diseases that come from without to intrude upon a people. The “en” prefix in 
 <italic>endemic</italic> on the other hand, in its original meaning, is that which is “in a people.” Said differently, it is a regular condition of a population, if not characteristic of it. Contagion is itself, in its etymology—“to touch together”—and as a target of public health an inherently biopolitical concept, at least, according to Foucault, since the end of the eighteenth century. While we naturally think of this in terms of “epidemics,” from suicide to EVD, again, we might recall biopolitics in its genealogy is conceptually more aligned with endemicity:

  <p id="Par18">At the end of the eighteenth century, it was not epidemics that were the issue, but something else—what might broadly be called endemics, or in other words, the form, nature, extension, duration, and intensity of the illnesses prevalent in a population. These were illnesses that were difficult to eradicate and that were not regarded as epidemics that caused more frequent deaths, but as permanent factors which…sapped the population’s strength, shortened the working week, wasted energy, and cost money…In a word, illness as phenomena affecting a population. Death was no longer something that suddenly swooped down on life—as in an epidemic. Death was now something permanent, something that slips into life, perpetually gnaws at it, diminishes it and weakens it. (Foucault

 </disp-quote>Today it is the lingering chronic illness, both figurative and metaphorical, that structures our cultural anxieties. The chronically ill citizen cannot contribute to a neoliberal society that prizes production, quotas, and stamina in the extreme social environment of the modern state that is increasingly devoid of social support for such “productivity.” Making live and letting die become a question of calculating and calibrating endemicity and its effects. The victim of an 
 <italic>epidemic</italic> disease, that is, at least functions in their death to relieve society of an unproductive member. The endemically ill linger and metaphorically contribute in the social imaginary to the troubling endemic conditions of “wasted energy” and “costs” which neoliberal actors seek to track, mitigate, and eliminate both in and beyond traditional disciplinary structures of the school, the prison, and the workplace.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> In the First World, this often translates to so-called “diseases of civilization” such as hypertension, obesity, and drug abuse; however, we also suggest that this is not only indicative of endemics such as “diseases of civilization” or microbial endemics such as TB in Africa but also indicative of how we perpetually tend to construct threats to governmentality as contagious, such as social-media-inspired suicide, financial collapse caught from Asian markets, or, emergent exotic disease such as EVD—in short, how we construct an endemic of epidemics. We suggest that the discourse of endemicity stresses the particular dimensions surrounding the object described. It highlights how whatever is being described as “endemic” is characteristic of its context or milieu.
