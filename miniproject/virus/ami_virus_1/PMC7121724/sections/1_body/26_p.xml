<p id="Par39">Together, these interdisciplinary chapters sketch out the manner in which a theory of contagion can be developed from multiple perspectives and methods while homing in on themes of universal social and academic interest: global connections, oppressive political practices, the effect of digital media on community interactions and aid, and the possibility of certainty and stable individual identity in an uncertain, interconnected world. We live in a digital world where viral videos, Reddit upvotes, and retweets might seem to structure our world more than influenza strains or rampant heart disease. However, we maintain that at the interstices of material, biological realities and metaphoric potential lie political power and social meanings that warrant serious consideration; for, as the authors in this volume demonstrate, these power structures and epistemologies are already in play. It is only the ends to which they are used that we can hope to guide.</p>
