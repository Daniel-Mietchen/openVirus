<p id="Par38">Our volume concludes with Claire Hooker, Chris Degeling, and Paul Mason’s provocative essay on the problematic bioethical effects of the very construct of endemics. Reading the often naturalized diseased state attached to particular Third-World locations, they contend that “there is no such thing as endemic disease” but rather that these states are human-made configurations—products of political, economic, public health, and agricultural policies and practices that “
 <italic>make disease</italic>.” The authors juxtapose the nonchalant First-World designation of a variety of Third-World endemics—diseases that are thusly constructed as beyond the reach (or necessity) of aid because of their perceived inevitable pervasiveness—against First-World constructions of its own “epidemics” such as obesity. While many of the chapters show the positive potential in contagious and endemic discourse, Hooker, Deglin, and Mason incisively reveal how endemicity is, in most cases, representative of political and moral failure—not just in terms of aid response but also because the very rhetoric used to discuss disease states in various cultures precludes the prevention of such diseases altogether, and might almost be said to create them.
