<p id="Par4">Contagion is not just “in the air” (Weinstein 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2003</xref>, p. 113); it is endemic to our contemporary culture. The critical landscape of the new millennium has witnessed the advent of a variety of “posts”: post-postmodernism, post-humanism, and post-naturalism. Of course, these critical trajectories reflect cultural shifts and a growing collective desire, even outside of academic and critical discourse, to interrogate the anthropocene (the current zombie craze being one example of this turn in popular culture). However, the decentering of the anthropocene has yet to yield any extensive forays into that which has naturally destabilized it quite literally for millennia—infectious microorganisms.
