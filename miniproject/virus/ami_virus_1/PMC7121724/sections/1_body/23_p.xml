<p id="Par36">Woo’s post-humanist theorization of contagion points toward our final section, “Reconstructing Contagion,” which features three essays focused on the ways that contagious discourse might be constructively reconfigured toward shaping a world more engaged in critical bioethics. First, Mathieu Donner’s chapter argues for a reasoning methodology that bridges epidemiology and epistemology. Donner contends that certain beliefs function much like a virus whose introduction can cause fundamental mutations in the host—that is, every belief contains within itself the possibility of a collective epistemic shift. He theorizes contagion as a way to work through postmodernism’s dissolution of universal truth and knowledge. Instead, he proposes an epidemiologically-informed performative logic in epistemology, allowing for an ethical relation to truth rooted in responsibility and vulnerability.</p>
