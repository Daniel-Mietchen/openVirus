<p id="Par32">Kimberly Hallâ€™s chapter follows, analyzing the structural impact (in the construction of digital networks and in the geographical shaping of their very user bases) of epidemiological discourse in specific digital communities, such as anonymous message boards on college campuses and mobile social media such as Yik Yak. She begins by tracking the deployment of epidemiological frameworks to model the decline of Facebook, exploring the ways that such modeling presupposes the virality of social networks, digital, and otherwise. In doing so, this chapter considers the ways that social media configure their own identities around epidemiological discourse. Ultimately, Hall demonstrates that contagion theory has been used to define social responses to social media, the material design of its infrastructure, and the social construction of its user communities.</p>
