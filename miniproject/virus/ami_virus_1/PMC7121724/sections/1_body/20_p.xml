<p id="Par33">Our third section comprises three chapters pertaining to “Theorizing the Politics of Contagion in a Neoliberal World.” Transitioning from the concerns of the psychological iterations of public health in suicide prevention, this section begins with Robert Geroux’s chapter on neoliberalism and the politics of the human microbiome—what he terms “biomial politics.” Geroux argues that our obsessive attempts to rid the human body of bacteria—a drive which has paradoxically ushered in our current era of antibiotic resistance—speaks to our current neoliberal condition and its imperatives of extremophilic existence. Recognizing this connection and its costs, as well as acknowledging the value of our symbiotic relationship with many microorganisms, offers us a way to rethink this socio-political order. Biomial politics, he suggests, fosters collective and diverse attachments between the self and others by admitting occasional disruptions of extremophilic (and always imagined) life while rejecting the time pressures of neoliberal chronicity. In his biomial stance, Geroux offers an affirmative valance on contagion and germs vis-à-vis political economy.</p>
