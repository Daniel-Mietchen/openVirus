<p id="Par28">Therefore, while 
 <italic>Endemic</italic> largely covers scientific and technological developments of the last half-century, chronology is not its main organizational determinant. The first section “Contagious Culture and Cultural Contagion” sets the stage for the three sections that follow by revealing the different ways that media forms—prose, fiction, journalism, and cinema—in the post-germ theory context became early agents in shaping discourse about contagion, and, simultaneously, were shaped by epidemiological rhetoric. This theoretical aim maps onto another that structures this section: the exploration of how other cultures threaten the contamination of one’s own, a fear that, as Servitje’s and Thibault’s essays demonstrate, often marches in lockstep with the fear that one’s own culture may be insidiously infecting itself with values that threaten hegemonic norms. Lorenzo Servitje’s essay begins this first section with a discussion of Matthew Arnold, whose writings are synchronous with the early periods of germ theory’s discussion and experimentation. His essay considers how Matthew Arnold’s writings came to characterize “modern” (American and British middle-class) culture as a pathogenic and contagious form that threatened to dissolve social order at the turn of the nineteenth century. He argues that Arnold’s anxieties of the “Anglo-Saxon contagion” drew both from germ theory and 
 <italic>fin-de-siècle</italic> sociology to show how the beginning of cultural studies and liberal humanism was entangled with the discourse of contagion.
