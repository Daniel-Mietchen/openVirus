<p id="Par35">Yunjin Woo’s chapter closes this section with an exploration of the politics of treating endemic foot-and-mouth disease in farm animals in South Korea. Woo reads the South Korean farmers’ experiences with killing and burying their cattle (as part of an antimicrobial—and Western—sanitary initiative) alongside their alternative approaches to animal husbandry as a way to rethink our human 
 <italic>inter</italic>dependence with other life forms, such as microbes, and as a means to resist “the modern myth of 
 <italic>in</italic>dependence as a pathway to sanitized progress.” To be contaminated is to touch, her chapter reaffirms, and she assesses the potentially positive value of that touch and connection—particularly to the meat animals we produce and consume.
