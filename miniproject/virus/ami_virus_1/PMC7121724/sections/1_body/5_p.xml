<p id="Par12">What does it mean that contagion not only continues to be used, but increasingly so, to reflect the replication of ideas, traits, products, processes, and traditionally non-infectious diseases? While our understanding and perception of contagion as a disease and a metaphor has certainly changed significantly over the past 100 years—particularly in the last few decades—contagion continues to influence how we perceive and construct our world. The advent of research on the microbiome and antibiotic-resistant infections, for instance, has significantly changed how we understand humans’ relationship to microbial life. Moreover, recent research and popular media attention to how digital, social, and mobile media affect heath and behavior, while itself often characterized under the rubric of “virality,” speaks to the timeliness of investigating how contagion is currently operating as a discourse and what kind of cultural work it is doing. The conceptual construct has tangible, biopolitical effects in shaping the conditions of our existence. It is this mutual constitution between culture and contagion that concerns this volume.</p>
