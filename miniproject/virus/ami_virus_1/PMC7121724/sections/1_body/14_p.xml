<p id="Par26">While the understanding of contagion has been part of human history for centuries, its development as a “living” figurative concept has co-evolved with its understanding within biomedicine. Increasingly, the findings of germ theory and bacteriology in the last decades of the nineteenth century reconfigured society in the collective imaginary as enmeshed in a veritable atmosphere of microorganisms that science had by this time revealed to be dwelling in and around everyone and everything. While germ theory had been suggested with some frequency as early as the 1840s, its period of intense debate began mostly in the 1860s, when groups of scientists began to experiment in earnest with attempts to prove or disprove the concept. Nevertheless, the so-called advent of germ theory is in part a misnomer because it was hardly the first moment during which contagious particles were theorized to cause disease. Individual scientific voices had proposed such methods of disease transmission even in ancient times.

Prior to the rising popularity of germ theory in the mid-century, miasma theory (which in this early period was considered less of a theory than a given) prevailed. Miasma theory held that poisonous or polluted air, particularly to be found in specific sorts of “unhealthy” places, caused disease. The nomenclature of the then-infamous malaria (which means “bad air”) remains an artifact to miasma theory’s predominance. By the 1880s, enough experimentation on the part of European scientists—most notably Koch, Pasteur, Semmelweis, and Lister—had proven to most other scientists as well as much of the lay public that germ theory was “true.” In this later period of germ theory’s widespread acknowledgment as reality, the era of the “microbe hunters” (as Paul De Kruif’s 1926 eponymous book terms it) arose. The era might less sensationalistically be termed the Bacteriological Age, in which a new generation of young scientists, trained in the ostensible verity of germ theory, sought to identify the specific microbes associated with various diseases. As preoccupation with contagion from the late nineteenth century forward indicated, a general sense of interdependence and interconnectedness was therefore increasingly at the forefront of social consciousness (Tomes
