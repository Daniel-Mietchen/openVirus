<p id="Par34">Stephen Casper’s “The Political Without Guarantees” follows this discussion on the politics of contagion. His chapter traces the genealogy of the neuroscientific and political conditions of the rampant spread of deadly gunfire on unarmed minorities by police—what has often been called “contagious shootings.” This term, as Casper points out, repurposes epidemiological rhetoric to naturalize these tragedies and divest their perpetrators of what would otherwise be obvious culpability. Casper posits the case of “contagious shootings” to suggest that what is actually at stake in these cases is not in fact agency-robbing “contagious” behavior at all but rather the need to place humanistic knowledge and social science within a neuroscientific frame. He contends that the turn toward a social belief in neurological determinism makes belief in “contagious”—and therefore naturalized—shootings possible and ultimately argues that such beliefs make their way into governing practices via the public imaginary.</p>
