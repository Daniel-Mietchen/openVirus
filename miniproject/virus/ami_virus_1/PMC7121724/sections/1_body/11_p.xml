<p id="Par22">We might be tempted to ascribe the seeming increase in the contagiousness of contagion discourse to the emergence of social networking and telecommunications advancements, such as mobile devices which facilitate the spread of so-called “viral” content, what Jussi Parikka (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2007</xref>) has called the “viral logic of networks.” Certainly, since Wald’s 
 <italic>Contagious</italic> and Bashford and Hooker’s 
 <italic>Contagion</italic>, we have seen an exceedingly expansive set of social connections and forms of digital replication that deploy contagion into the technocultural realm. And yet, there exists a number of other conditions that have influenced the use and understanding of contagion in our contemporary moment, many biological in nature: such as antibiotic resistance, the 2014 EVD outbreak, studies in the microbiome, and zoonotic outbreaks; while other “non-biological” conditions such as the collapses of global markets, spread of fear pertaining to “emerging diseases” themselves, the increase and visibility of suicide, and the replicating, mimetic nature of school shootings have affected the facility to which we turn to contagion to explain threatening or socially destabilizing phenomena. However, as many of the authors in this collection suggest, the threat of contagion often reaffirms extant socially constructed boundaries, or, as Wald has suggested, social and biopolitical bonds for shaping populations must be “meaningfully reproduced” (p. 58). The reaction and construction of contagion often does this work. Despite the increased understanding of social phenomena under the logic of contagion, the biological has not been supplanted by contagion’s different metaphoric iterations; our changing understanding of contagious disease continues to influence how we see other forms of propagating replication.
