<p>Trying to understand the potential risk of transmission of CDV to humans, it is necessary to gather all the existing evidence; and the study of the origin and dissemination of this agent in the canine population could present an important key to understanding this process. Recently, a paper published in the 
 <italic>International Journal of Paleopathology</italic> invited to a discussion on the evolutionary origin of CDV. It concludes that CDV originated as a pandemic pathogen in South America following the infection and adaptation of MeV to dogs during the South American colonization period. This result was obtained via an interdisciplinary approach adopted by synthesizing a paleopathological analysis of 96 pre-Columbian dogs (750â€“1470 CE) from the Weyanoke Old Town, Virginia site, with historical reports, molecular analysis, and morbilliviral epidemiology (Uhl et al.,
