<p>However, molecular phylogeography related to evolutionary predictions and the time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) were calculated for the CDV origin in the United States in the 1880s (95% highest posterior density, 1858â€“1913) (Panzera et al., 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which clearly contradicts the description of the virus in Europe in the eighteenth century. Sequence analyses that led to this hypothesis must be carefully examined because of the bias and the limited availability of sequences that were used in this molecular phylogeography reconstruction. Moreover, many original ancestral sequences have been lost due to the lability of the viral RNA genome of the CDV and other morbilliviruses. These factors have given rise to the questioning of the utility of current tMRCA calculations for RNA viruses (Sharp and Simmonds,
