<p>Natural CDV outbreaks in different non-human primates have raised a concern regarding the possible transmission of CDV to humans (Yoshikawa et al., 
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Sun et al., 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Qiu et al., 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Sakai et al., 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>). There are reports that CDV monkey strains have the intrinsic ability to use human nectin-4 for virus entry and that those monkey CDVs easily adapt to use the human CD150 (SLAM) receptor following minimal amino acid changes to the viral H protein (Bieringer et al., 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Sakai et al., 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>). However, based on the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental CDV infection of Cynomolgus macaques (
 <italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) in the presence of MeV immunity, macaques were partially cross protected from the CDV challenge (De Vries et al., 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). This suggests that although CDV can readily infect primates, MeV immunity is protective and that CDV infection could be self-limiting. Transferring this result to humans, there is a potential risk of CDV infection in people who lack cross-protective MeV immunity due to non-vaccination and vaccine failures (Haralambieva et al., 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) or due to the absence of vaccination in the possible post-eradication era (Holzmann et al., 
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).
