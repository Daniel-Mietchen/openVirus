<p>Furthermore, one of the most interesting results presented by Uhl et al. is the optimization of both the CDV and MeV genes to human codon usage bias (CUB), suggesting that CDV codon usage is closer to human CUB than canine CUB because the virus or its progenitor, most likely MeV, was initially adapted to humans (Uhl et al., 
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">2019</xref>). CUB refers to the phenomenon wherein some synonymous codons are used more often than others and how this preference varies within and among species (Behura and Severson, 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In RNA viruses, codon usage is under selection because the viruses are completely dependent on host tRNAs and the bias results from viruses matching the codon usage of their hosts (Jenkins and Holmes, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Evolution can sometimes favor viruses that match their host codon usage to promote the replication speed and adaptation to the host as has been reported in other RNA viruses (Goni et al., 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Lauring et al., 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Di Paola et al., 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>; Freire et al., 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2018</xref>).
