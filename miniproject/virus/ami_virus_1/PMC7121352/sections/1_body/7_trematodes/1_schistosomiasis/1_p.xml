 <italic>Schistosoma</italic> infection is found in various parts of the world, most commonly in areas of Africa and the Middle East. 
 <italic>Schistosoma intercalatum</italic> in particular causes liver disease. The cercariae penetrate skin and proceed to the lungs and in the liver. The adult fluke may also migrate to the mesenteric vasculature. The eggs induce a granulomatous response. Clinical features of schistosomiasis include headache, fever, cough, a tender liver, and diarrhea. Chronic liver disease is described with portal hypertension, gastroesophageal varices, ascites, and splenomegaly. Chronic infection may be associated with an increased susceptibility to Salmonella infections and frequently coexist with hepatitis B and C viral infections in endemic areas. This leads to progression of liver disease and an increased predisposition to hepatocellular carcinoma. Stool tests and serological analysis aid in diagnosis. A liver biopsy demonstrates periportal fibrosis. The infection is treated with praziquantel.
