 <italic>Fasciola hepatica</italic> is caused by a liver fluke and leads to acute, chronic, or obstructive hepatic disease. Clinical features are marked by fever, right upper quadrant pain, and eosinophilia. An enlarged liver is appreciated on exam. The chronic obstructive phase is characterized by intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct inflammation. This leads to cholangitis, stone formation, and obstruction. The diagnosis is by antibody detection or the identification of the eggs in stool, duodenal aspirate, or bile. Treatment is with triclabendazole.
