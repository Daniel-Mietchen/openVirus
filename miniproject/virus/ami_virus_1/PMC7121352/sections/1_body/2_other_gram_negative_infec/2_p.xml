<p>Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne rickettsial infection which is characterized by the development of a maculopapular rash, fever, and hepatic disease. The latter consists of portal inflammation and vasculitis. Jaundice and increased liver enzymes are seen with disease. Hemolysis may lead to hyperbilirubinemia and biliary obstruction. In contrast, Ehrlichia (another tick-borne intracellular bacteria) infections are associated with liver injury due to proliferation within the hepatocyte and a concomitant immune response. Focal necrosis, fibrin ring granulomas, and cholestasis are seen. Treatment with doxycycline is indicated.</p>
