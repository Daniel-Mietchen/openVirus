<p>Leishmaniasis, caused by 
 <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, is transmitted by the sand fly and is endemic in the Mediterranean, Central Asian, and South Asian regions as well as Africa, South America, and New Guinea. A papular or ulcerative lesion occurs at the bite site and is followed over a period of time, ranging from months to years, with fever, weight loss, diarrhea, and massive hepatosplenomegaly. Hepatocyte necrosis is followed by cirrhosis and complications of chronic liver disease. The diagnosis is based on characteristic clinical features, history, and the identification of the parasite on Wright, Giemsa, Leishman, or Jenner staining of buffy-coat preparations of peripheral blood or aspirates from marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes, or skin lesions spread on a slide to make a thin smear. Pancytopenia and an increased predisposition to secondary bacterial infections such as pneumococcal infections and tuberculosis may occur. Cutaneous pigmentation may also be seen. Treatment of infection is with the pentavalent antimonials. Alternative parenteral agents include liposomal amphotericin B and paromomycin. Miltefosine, a phosphocholine analogue, has also been used for treatment [
