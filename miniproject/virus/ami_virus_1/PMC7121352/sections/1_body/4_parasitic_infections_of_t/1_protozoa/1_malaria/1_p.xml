<p>Malaria is an infection by the protozoan species, 
 <italic>Plasmodia</italic>. It is estimated that about 300â€“500,000,000 people are infected globally with these parasites every year. The major species differ in their life cycle as well as presence or absence of a hepatic phase. 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and 
 <italic>Plasmodium malariae</italic> are not associated with a hepatic cycle, while 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic> and 
 <italic>ovale</italic> do have a persistent exoerythrocytic phase in the liver. The extent of hepatic injury relates to the species and the severity of infection. Active hemolysis leads to an increase in the unconjugated fraction of bilirubin. However, once hepatocellular dysfunction sets in, the conjugated fraction of bilirubin begins to rise as well. Liver failure leads to liver synthetic function impairment and a decrease in serum albumin and prolonged prothrombin time. Hyperglycemia and lactic acidosis are late complications. There is a high mortality with disease. Congenital malaria, although rare, may also lead to severe and even fulminant liver disease in the newborn infant. The diagnosis of malaria requires history, physical examination, and the identification of the parasite on blood smear. Rapid antigen detection assays are now available. Treatment depends on the species of 
 <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. Chloroquine may be effective, but in many parts for the world chloroquine resistance is increasingly seen, and in these areas treatment requires mefloquine and quinine. Pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine and proguanil are also used for treatment [
