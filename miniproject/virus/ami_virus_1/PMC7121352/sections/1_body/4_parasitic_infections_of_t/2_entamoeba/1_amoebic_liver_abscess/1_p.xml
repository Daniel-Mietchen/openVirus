<p>Amoebic infections of the liver occur commonly in the developing world. Patients present with abdominal pain and an enlarged liver. There may be a history of a preceding diarrhea. Pulmonary features as well as pericardial involvement and peritonitis may occur but are very rare. The diagnosis of amoebic liver abscess is based on a good history, clinical exam, imaging, and serological analysis. However, it is important to note that serological testing may need to be interpreted with caution as antibodies may remain elevated for several years after treatment. Aspiration may be attempted when the diagnosis is unclear. There is a characteristic reddish-brown anchovy paste on aspiration. Treatment includes antibiotics such as metronidazole for a month or if necessary intravenously for 7–10 days. Tinidazole or chloroquine may be used [
