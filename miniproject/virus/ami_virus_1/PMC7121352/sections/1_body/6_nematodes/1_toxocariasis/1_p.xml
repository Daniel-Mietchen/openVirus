 <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> and 
 <italic>cati</italic> infect dogs and cats, respectively, and may ultimately lead to human disease. Visceral larva migrans is seen commonly in children with a history of pica ingestion. It presents with fever, hepatomegaly, urticaria, and an increased eosinophil count. The infection leads to cholestatic hepatitis and liver abscess formation. Pulmonary disease with asthma and pneumonia may be seen and neurological involvement with seizures and encephalopathy may also occur. Migration into the eyes is associated with visual loss. A liver biopsy may be necessary and enzyme immunoassays confirm diagnosis. Treatment of infection is with mebendazole or albendazole [
