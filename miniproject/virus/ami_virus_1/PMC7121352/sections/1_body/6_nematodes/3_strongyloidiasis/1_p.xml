 <italic>Strongyloides stercoralis</italic> is prevalent mostly in the tropics. The larvae penetrate the skin, are carried to the lungs, and then are swallowed to reach the intestine where maturation occurs. Symptoms of acute infection include pruritus, abdominal discomfort, and diarrhea. Hepatic infection leads to jaundice and cholestasis. Periportal inflammation and eosinophilic granulomas are seen on biopsy. Diagnosis is achieved by serological tests or the identification of the larvae in the stool or intestinal biopsy specimens. The treatment for acute infection is ivermectin or albendazole.
