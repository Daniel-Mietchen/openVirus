<p>IFN-alpha is delivered by subcutaneous injection and was the first of the approved therapies for HBV. Predictors of IFN responsiveness include active hepatitis, low HBV DNA levels (&lt;1,000 pg/mL), high serum alanine aminotransferase ALT(&gt;2× ULN), short duration of disease, non-Asian ethnic origin, and horizontal transmission. On the basis of European experience, consensus recommendations for the use of IFN-alpha for HBV infected children were developed. The main goals of therapy, according to these recommendations, were to accelerate HBeAg clearance in children with HBeAg and HBV DNA positivity, with low-intermediate HBV DNA levels and abnormal aminotransferase enzymes, ages 2 years or older. IFN therapy is less likely to be of benefit in children with perinatally acquired infection who have normal or minimally elevated aminotransferases. The recommended treatment regimen for IFN-alpha is five to ten million units per square meter thrice weekly by subcutaneous injection for 4 to 6 months. The response rates are variable, depending on route of acquisition, ethnic origin, disease activity, and treatment regime. Adult data suggest that HBeAg-negative chronic disease should be treated for 12 months, whereas others demonstrate that longer durations of treatment of 24 months increased sustained response rates [

Pretreatment with corticosteroids (“priming”) and their withdrawal before commencing IFN-alpha may exacerbate the host immune response, facilitating seroconversion. The benefit, however, remains unproven and is associated with the risk of precipitating fulminant liver failure. IFNα is thought to simply accelerate seroconversion, as many patients who do not respond to treatment may still seroconvert to anti-HBe later in life [
