<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a worldwide health problem, which can cause acute liver failure, acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. It is most prevalent in Asia, Africa, southern Europe, and Latin America, where the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive rate in the general population ranges from 2 to 20 %. Approximately two billion people in the world have been infected by HBV and more than 350 million are chronic HBsAg carriers. In endemic areas, HBV infection occurs mainly during infancy and early childhood. Mother-to-infant transmission accounts for approximately half of the chronic HBV infections. In contrast to infection in adults, HBV infection during early childhood results in a much higher rate of persistent infection and long-term serious sequelae such as liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HBV carriers have a lifetime risk of developing HCC in up to 25 % and an incidence of cirrhosis of 2â€“3 %/year [
