<p>Adefovir dipivoxil is a purine analogue approved to treat children with chronic hepatitis B aged 12 years and older. 23 % of patients aged 12â€“17 years achieved viral response after a 48-week treatment with adefovir (compared to 0 % of placebo-treated subjects). The efficacy on HBV DNA suppression and ALT normalization was less significant in younger children (15 % vs. 3 %) [

Patients with HBeAg-positive chronic HBV infection should continue on treatment for at least 6 months after seroconversion with discontinuation of treatment if there is incomplete viral suppression after 24 weeks.
