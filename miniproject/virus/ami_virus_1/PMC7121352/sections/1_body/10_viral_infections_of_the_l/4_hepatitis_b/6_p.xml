<p>Most individuals with sudden elevations of aminotransferases undergo spontaneous HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion. After HBeAg clearance, aminotransferase levels gradually return to normal limits, with anti-HBe developing spontaneously. The majority of individuals who demonstrate this clearance enter an “inactive carrier” state with normalization of aminotransferases, a reduction in HBV DNA levels, and improvement in hepatic inflammation. A fraction of patients retain hepatic inflammation with elevated aminotransferases and HBV DNA and remain in the immune-active state. There is a greater risk for the development of cirrhosis and HCC. Risk factors that have been associated with progressive hepatic inflammation and subsequent complications include HBV genotype, persistent viremia, and specific mutations in the HBV genome. The optimal goal of antiviral therapy for chronic HBV infection is to eradicate HBV and to prevent its related liver complication by shortening the duration of liver inflammation. However, due to the limited effect of available therapies in viral eradication, the goal of current antiviral therapy for hepatitis B is to reduce viral replication, minimize the liver injury, and reduce infectivity [
