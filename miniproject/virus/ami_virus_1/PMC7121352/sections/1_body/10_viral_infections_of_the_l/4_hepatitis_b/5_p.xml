<p>Three phases of chronic hepatitis B have been identified: the immune-tolerant phase, the immune-active phase, and the inactive phase. Most children with chronic HBV infection are immune tolerant, with high viral replication, positive hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg), high HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) levels, and normal levels of aminotransferases [

The immune-tolerant phase may last long into adulthood; however, some children go into the immune-active phase. This phase is marked by active inflammation and elevated aminotransferases and may develop into fibrosis over time.
