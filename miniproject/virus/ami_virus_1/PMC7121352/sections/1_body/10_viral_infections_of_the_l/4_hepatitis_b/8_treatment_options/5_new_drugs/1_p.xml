<p>Telbivudine is an L-nucleoside analogue with a potent antiviral activity and a safety profile similar to lamivudine (although myopathy and peripheral neuropathy were reported in adults). Resistance rate is lower than lamivudine but higher than adefovir. Therefore, telbivudine is only used in combination with other antiviral drugs. A phase I clinical trial is ongoing on children 2â€“18 years of age [
