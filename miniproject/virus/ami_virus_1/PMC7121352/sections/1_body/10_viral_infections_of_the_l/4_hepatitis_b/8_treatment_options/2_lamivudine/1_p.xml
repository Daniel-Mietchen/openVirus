<p>Lamivudine is an orally administered pyrimidine nucleoside analogue. It prevents replication of HBV in infected hepatocytes, is incorporated into viral DNA leading to chain termination, and competitively inhibits viral reverse transcriptase. Viral response was achieved by 23 % of children receiving lamivudine after 1-year treatment (compared to 13 % in the control group). The response increased to 35 % in children with ALT levels of at least twice the ULN [
