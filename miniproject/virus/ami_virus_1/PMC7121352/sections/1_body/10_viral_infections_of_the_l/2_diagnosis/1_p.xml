<p>The diagnosis of infection is by the detection of specific antibodies in serum. An elevation of anti-HAV IgM indicates an acute infection and is detectable in the serum with the onset of symptoms and may remain positive for approximately 4 months. Some patients may have low levels of IgM antibody for almost a year after the initial infection. IgG antibody remains present for life and indicates previous infection or vaccination. Testing for the RNA is limited to research. The RNA can be detected in body fluid such as serum, stool, and liver tissue.</p>
