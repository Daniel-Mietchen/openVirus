<p>There is little data with pegylated interferon in the treatment of chronic hepatitis D. The largest published study included 38 patients who were treated with pegylated IFN alfa-2b (1.5 MU/kg/week) alone or in combination with ribavirin for 48 weeks [

At the end of follow-up, HDV RNA was not detectable in 21 %. The response rate was similar in the monotherapy and combination therapy groups suggesting that ribavirin had no effect on viral clearance. A higher virologic response rate (43 %) was found in another study with 12 months of pegylated IFN [
