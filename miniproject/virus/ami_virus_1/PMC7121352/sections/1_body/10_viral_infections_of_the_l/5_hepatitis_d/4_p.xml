<p>In the Western world, where the predominant HDV genotype is genotype 1 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>], acute hepatitis D has an increased risk of a fulminant disease. Chronic HDV infection exacerbates the preexisting liver disease in patients with hepatitis B with rapidly progressive cirrhosis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>]. In the Far East, where the predominant genotype is genotype 2, there is a less frequent fulminant hepatitis with acute HDV infection and rapidly progressive liver disease with chronic HDV. Severe outbreaks of acute hepatitis D with a high incidence of liver failure have been reported in South America with genotype 3.
