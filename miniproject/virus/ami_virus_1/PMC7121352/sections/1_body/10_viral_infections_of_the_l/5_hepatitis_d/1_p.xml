<p>Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is closely associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The simultaneous presence of HBV is required for complete virion assembly and secretion. HBV replication is suppressed in most HDV-infected individuals. The HDV genome is a small RNA molecule and expresses the HDV antigen.</p>
