<p>As of May 2011, two protease inhibitors, boceprevir and telaprevir, are licensed in the USA for use in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin in adults with chronic HCV genotype 1. This therapy is associated with a significantly higher rate of sustained virologic response as compared with the combination of pegylated interferon and ribavirin. A pediatric trial of combination therapy with boceprevir is underway and a trial of telaprevir is being planned.</p>
