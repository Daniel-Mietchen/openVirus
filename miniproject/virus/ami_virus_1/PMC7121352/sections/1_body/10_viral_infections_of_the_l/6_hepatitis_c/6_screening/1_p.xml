<p>Patients suspected of having chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or with risk factors for HCV should be tested for HCV antibodies. HCV RNA testing should be performed in those with a positive antibody test to confirm infection and in those with unexplained liver disease whose anti-HCV test is negative and who are immunocompromised. HCV RNA quantitation (viral load) should be obtained in patients being considered for treatment. Quantitative and qualitative tests are used during treatment to assess response. HCV genotype should be determined in all infected persons prior to treatment to determine the duration of therapy, dose of ribavirin, and the likelihood of response (Table
