<p>Practice recommendations for children with chronic HCV are similar to those for adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">154</xref>]. However, because of limited data in the pediatric age group, treatment decisions may vary with the childâ€™s age and individual disease characteristics. Combination treatment with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin is considered for children with chronic HCV infection who are older than 3 years and who appear to have progressive disease or advanced histological features. For these children, the course of action depends on the HCV genotype.
