<p>The diagnosis of EBV hepatitis is based on clinical features as well as the tests that support the diagnosis. There are predominant lymphocytosis, monocytosis, and thrombocytopenia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR164">164</xref>]. The monospot test may be positive and IgM antibodies are seen early in disease with IgG antibodies indicating possible past infection. It is important to note that the monospot test however may be falsely negative. An abdominal ultrasound frequently demonstrates hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, and gallbladder thickening. A liver biopsy is rarely necessary for diagnosis. There is no specific therapy for EBV hepatitis. Acyclovir inhibits replication of EBV but has no effect on clinical symptoms or outcome [
