<p>Infection with this virus has myriad clinical presentations. While most infants and young children are asymptomatic or have nonspecific complaints, adolescents may have fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis. Subclinical liver disease may occur and overt disease ranges from mild transaminitis to hepatic necrosis with fulminant failure. Serum lactic dehydrogenase may be elevated to three times ULN. Alkaline phosphatase is elevated and hyperbilirubinemia is also seen in about 45 % of patients. The laboratory abnormalities are slow to resolve. Cholestatic jaundice with pruritus may occur in women with EBV hepatitis taking the oral contraceptive pill.
