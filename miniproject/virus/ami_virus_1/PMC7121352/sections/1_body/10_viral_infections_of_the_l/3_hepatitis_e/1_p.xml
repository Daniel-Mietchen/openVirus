<p>The hepatitis E (HEV) virus is a small RNA virus that is 32–34 nm in diameter. It is a non-enveloped, icosahedral particle that belongs to the family Hepeviridae. It contains three open reading frames (ORF). The open reading frame [ORF] 1 includes nonstructural proteins. ORF2 encodes the virus capsid protein and ORF3 encodes a protein of unknown function. Details of replication in the liver cells and release from infected cells remain unknown. They are four different genotypes. Genotype 1 is found in Asia and genotype 2 from Mexico and Western Africa. The USA has genotype 1, 2, and 3 infections. Genotype 3 has also been reported in several European countries and genotype 4 from China, Taiwan, Japan, and Vietnam. All genotypes belong to a single serotype [
