<p>Cytomegalovirus or CMV is a member of the herpes family and persists for life in a non-replicative state. Clinically disease may occur as a primary infection or reactivation in immunocompromised patients. In those who are immunocompetent, primary infection is usually subclinical or may mimic infection with EBV. Hepatic disease is characterized by an increase in liver enzymes and alkaline phosphatase with or without organomegaly. The clinical course is usually mild; however, occasionally there may be hepatic necrosis. In congenital infections with CMV, jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, thrombocytopenic purpura, and severe neurological impairment have been described [

CMV hepatitis may be difficult to distinguish from graft rejection in liver transplant patients, but the differentiation is crucial to appropriate management. Diagnosis requires serological analysis and liver biopsy. IgM antibodies demonstrate acute infection and PCR is used for confirmation particularly in immunocompromised patients. Multinucleated giant cells and mononuclear portal infiltrate are seen on liver biopsy. There are characteristics intranuclear inclusions that are called “owl’s eye” inclusions. Ganciclovir is used for treatment, and alternative agents include foscarnet and cidofovir.
