<p>HAV hepatitis is an acute infection and does not develop into chronic disease. There may be a prolonged or relapsing course with significant cholestasis. A relapsing course, occurring over a 6â€“10 week period, is observed in approximately 10 % of patients with acute hepatitis. Rarely acute hepatic failure may occur. The incubation period is short from 2 to 4 weeks. In previously healthy children, the morbidity and mortality are low but are higher in older children and adults. Younger children are usually asymptomatic and jaundice may develop in only 20 % of these patients. Icterus is seen more often in children older than 5 years of age. HAV infection is not associated with a higher mortality in pregnant woman.</p>
