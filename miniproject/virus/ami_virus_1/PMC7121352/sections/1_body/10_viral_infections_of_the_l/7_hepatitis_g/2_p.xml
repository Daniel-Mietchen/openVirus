<p>The virus is found worldwide with five different genotypes. The development of antibodies correlates with loss of viremia and suggests past exposure and clearance of the infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR156">156</xref>]. About 16 % of healthy blood donors are positive for antibodies with much lower rate of active viremia. The rate of natural clearance of the virus is higher than that for hepatitis C. Although GBV-C is detected in many patients with chronic hepatitis of unclear etiology, it does not appear to cause any liver disease [
