 <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> is also found in many areas of the world. Infection occurs through the ingestion of contaminated food. The liver is most commonly involved followed by the lungs, kidney, spleen, and brain. Cysts in the liver are called hydatid cysts. The cyst has characteristic layers on imaging with most patients being asymptomatic. However, as the cyst increases in size, it may lead to abdominal pain and a tender enlarged liver. The cyst may rupture into the lungs or may induce a life-threatening anaphylactic reaction. It may also rupture into the biliary tree and may induce cholangitis or obstruction. Rare complications include pancreatitis, portal hypertension, and the Buddâ€“Chiari syndrome. Infection of the bile ducts may lead to liver abscess formation as well. Diagnosis requires the identification of ring-like hepatic calcifications on plain X-ray and further imaging with an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan for confirmation of diagnosis. Percutaneous aspiration of the cyst may be associated with anaphylactic reactions and therefore was traditionally discouraged. However, aspiration may be attempted under carefully controlled circumstances. Treatment has included surgical cystectomy, marsupialization, and in advanced cases hepatic resection. Calcified cysts do not need to be removed. Percutaneous drainage may be attempted for complicated cysts. Administration of albendazole for 8 weeks is recommended [
