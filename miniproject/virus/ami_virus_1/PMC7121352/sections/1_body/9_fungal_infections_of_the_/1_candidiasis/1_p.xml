 <italic>Candida albicans</italic> is an infection that is frequently seen in severely immunocompromised individuals. It may lead to hepatic abscess formation and multiorgan disease with dissemination. Seeding of the portal vein leads to the formation of small abscesses in the liver. A CT scan of the abdomen is the most useful test to identify these tiny abscesses. Clinical features include fever, abdominal discomfort, and tender hepatomegaly. The serum aminotransferases, bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase levels are elevated. There is a very high mortality rate. Treatment of infection is with intravenous amphotericin B [
