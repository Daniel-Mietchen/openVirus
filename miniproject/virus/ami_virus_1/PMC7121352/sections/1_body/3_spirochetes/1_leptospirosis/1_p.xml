<p>Leptospirosis is carried by a variety of domestic and wild animals with human infection on exposure to urine or contaminated soil and water. Anicteric leptospirosis occurs in more than 90 % of cases. There is usually a biphasic illness, with the first phase characterized by fever and conjunctival injection. The second phase is associated with myalgias, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It is at this time that aseptic meningitis may occur and an increase in serum liver enzymes and jaundice is seen.</p>
