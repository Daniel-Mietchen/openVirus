<p>In developing countries where tuberculosis is endemic, hepatic disease is often seen. Granulomas with central caseation necrosis are found on liver biopsy in 25 % of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and in about 80 % of those with extrapulmonary disease. Similar granulomas may be found in immunocompromised individuals who have been vaccinated with the Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine. Diagnosis is based on the identification of the acid-fast bacilli and treatment is with 4-drug therapy. Jaundice and an increase in serum alkaline phosphatase may also occur when there is miliary disease [
