<p>Ultrasound and CT scans are the initial imaging modalities of choice and allow small abscesses up to 1 cm in diameter to be identified. A CT scan identifies localization of the abscess and defines whether there is gas in the abscess. It allows for aspiration for culture or insertion of a drain when necessary. The treatment of pyogenic liver abscess is by drainage of the pus and initiation of appropriate antibiotic treatment. An indwelling catheter may be placed in the abscess cavity when the abscess is larger than 5 cm in size. Intermittent needle aspiration may be attempted. With multiple abscesses, it is only the large ones that need to be aspirated. Small abscesses are treated by antibiotic therapy alone.</p>
