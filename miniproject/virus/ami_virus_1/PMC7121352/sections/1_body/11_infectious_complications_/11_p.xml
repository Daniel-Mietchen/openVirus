<p>Invasive aspergillosis is associated with a very high mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR199">199</xref>]. Opportunistic infections become uncommon beyond the first 6 months after transplant. However, since these patients are immunocompromised, they are at increased risk for infections with pathogens such as 
 <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, Legionella, and also West Nile virus. Respiratory infections due to pathogens such as 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> and 
 <italic>Haemophilus influenza</italic> may be life threatening if not promptly treated. Recurrent infections with EBV, CMV, and herpesvirus 6 and 7 may occur and may be devastating. Fungal infections with 
 <italic>Histoplasma</italic>, 
 <italic>Coccidioides</italic>, and 
 <italic>Blastomyces</italic> may be seen in the late posttransplant period. Listeria infection may manifest as hepatitis, bacteremia, and meningitis [
