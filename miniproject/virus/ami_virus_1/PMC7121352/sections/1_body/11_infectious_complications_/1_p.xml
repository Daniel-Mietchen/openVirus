<p>In transplant patients, morbidity and mortality due to infections remains a persistent problem. Infections include those with bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens. It is important to note that in solid organ transplant recipient, the signs and symptoms of infection are often blunted in the setting of immune suppression. In addition, antibiotics or antimicrobials used may have interactions with immunosuppressive medications. An important risk factor is the presence of latent infections in either the transplant recipient or donor. All potential transplant donors are screened for infection with cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and the human immunodeficiency virus. Pretransplant infections with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA or vancomycin-resistant enterococcus VRE lead to posttransplant infections [
