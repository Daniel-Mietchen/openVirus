<p>Pediatric infections with 
 <italic>Actinomyces israelii</italic> occur in the immunocompromised host and include cranial, thoracic, and abdominal disease. It is a gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that leads to hepatic infection in 15 % of abdominal actinomycosis cases and often spreads from other contiguous abdominal sites. The disease process is usually indolent with nonspecific elevation of inflammatory markers and leukocytosis. The liver may be dotted with multiple abscesses and treatment includes intravenous penicillin or oral tetracycline. Surgical resection may be required for large abscesses [
