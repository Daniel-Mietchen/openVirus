<p>There are several gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections that may lead to hepatic compromise. This includes infections with 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> or the group A streptococcal species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Common risk factors for 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infections include surgical wounds and the use of tampons in adolescents. Complications such as hypotensive shock may ensue. Hepatic manifestations of disease include elevation of serum transaminases and the appearance of jaundice. Progression of disease may lead to extensive hepatic necrosis and liver failure. On histology the liver may be punctuated with microabscesses and granuloma formation. Treatment of infection with clindamycin is recommended and antibiotics such as vancomycin or linezolid may be required for methicillin-resistant infections.
