<p>In the developing world, 
 <italic>Salmonella</italic> and 
 <italic>Shigella</italic> infections are common. Typhoid fever in particular leads to systemic disease that frequently involves the liver. 
 <italic>Salmonella typhi</italic> infection is acquired through contaminated food/water and presents with high fever and abdominal pain. While the serum transaminases rise, the bilirubin in contrast is minimally elevated. Cholecystitis and liver abscess formation may occur. The bacterial endotoxin-mediated hepatic compromise is treated with ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone as first-line agents [
