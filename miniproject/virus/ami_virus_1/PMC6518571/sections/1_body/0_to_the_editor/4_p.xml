<p>In closing, it is worth reflecting on the rather ironic possibility that this letter may not have been necessary had Kraemer 
 <italic>et al</italic>. released an early draft of their work as a preprint. Doing so would have allowed for a wider range of input from those not involved in the process of formal peer review at 
 <italic>Epidemiology and Infection</italic>. Similar value applies to the use of preprints to disseminate time-sensitive findings during disease epidemics.
