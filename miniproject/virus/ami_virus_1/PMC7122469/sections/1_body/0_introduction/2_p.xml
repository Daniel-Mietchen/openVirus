<p id="Par3">Viruses are identified more frequently than bacteria in children with ARI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) has long been believed to be the most important viral cause of childhood ARI, particularly bronchiolitis, accounting for at least three million hospitalizations and up to 200,000 deaths each year [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Human rhinovirus (RV) is the leading cause of upper respiratory infections (URI), but is also an important cause of LRI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis, and accounts for the majority of asthma attacks in children [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Advances in molecular methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in recent years have led to the identification of new viruses and viral species, and the importance of other viruses is now widely acknowledged. Adenovirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, human metapnuemovirus, coronavirus and bocavirus are among other commonly identified respiratory viruses known to contribute to the burden of childhood ARI.
