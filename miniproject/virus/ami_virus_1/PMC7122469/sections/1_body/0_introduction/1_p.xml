<p id="Par2">Acute respiratory infection (ARI), both upper and lower, is a significant cause of childhood morbidity and mortality worldwide. Lower respiratory infection (LRI), including pneumonia, is among the leading causes of childhood mortality worldwide, accounting for close to a million deaths in children under 5 years of age in 2013 [

However, both are also frequently detected in asymptomatic children, and hence, the clinical significance of their detection has long been debated. Furthermore, a wide range of prevalence rates are reported for the detection of viruses and bacteria, most likely due to differences in case definitions, diagnostic tools and methodologies used between studies and hence, the epidemiology and etiology of ARI are still not clear. Viruses and bacteria are often co-detected in respiratory samples from children with ARI and their interaction is likely to play a key role in the development of disease. However, the clinical significance of viral-bacterial co-infections and the mechanisms leading to ARI are not well understood.
