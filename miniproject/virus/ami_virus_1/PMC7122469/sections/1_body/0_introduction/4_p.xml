<p id="Par5">The respiratory tract is a reservoir of a diverse community of microorganisms, both commensals and potential pathogens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. There is growing evidence that synergistic and antagonistic interactions between viruses and bacteria play a key role in the development of ARI. A better understanding of the interactions between viruses and bacteria in the respiratory tract may provide improved insight into the pathogenesis of ARI, and potentially reveal new prevention and treatment strategies. This chapter summarizes the current knowledge on viruses, bacteria and viral-bacterial interactions in childhood ARI and the possible mechanisms by which these interactions may lead to disease.
