<p id="Par4">Although less frequently detected than viruses, bacteria were traditionally believed to be the cause of more severe ARI-associated morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, traditional diagnostic methods such as blood culture, which are still considered the gold standard in most settings, lack sensitivity and hence, the disease burden attributable to specific bacteria is not well understood. The recent advent of sequencing technologies such as 16S rRNA gene sequencing have led to the discovery of far more diverse respiratory microbial communities than previously recognized [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, advanced diagnostics are largely limited to countries with the most resources and studies detecting a comprehensive range of pathogens remain scarce or non-existent.
