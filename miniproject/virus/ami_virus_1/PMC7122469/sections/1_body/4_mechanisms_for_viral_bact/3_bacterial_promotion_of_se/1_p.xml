<p id="Par42">The historical emphasis on influenzaâ€”
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> co-infections in adults and the unidirectional view that viral infections increase bacterial growth may be less relevant for children. While 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> carriage rates are approximately 4% in adults, carriage rates are over 50% in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR142">142</xref>] and up to 80% in children under 5 in developing countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR143">143</xref>]. This supports growing evidence that bacterial infections may promote secondary viral infections, rather than vice versa. In a large, double-blind placebo-controlled trial in infants in South Africa, the 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was shown to prevent 31% of pneumonias associated with respiratory viruses in children in hospital, leading to the suggestion that viruses contribute to the pathogenesis of bacterial pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">144</xref>]. In another study of healthy children under 2 years of age, Verkaik et al. found that higher seroconversion rates to hMPV were associated with increased nasopharyngeal carriage of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>]. Furthermore, well-differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells pre-incubated 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> resulted in increased susceptibility to infection with HMPV-enhanced green fluorescent protein, suggesting that 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> can modulate HMPV infection [
