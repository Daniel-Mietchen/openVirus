<p id="Par43">Experimental models often show an increase in influenza virus titres following a bacterial challenge. In one study, influenza viral titres in mice were shown to increase when 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was present [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. Subsequent mathematical modelling by Smith et al. established that the influenza infection reduced the bacterial clearance ability of alveolar macrophages and that the secondary 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection enhanced viral release from infected cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR146">146</xref>]. In contrast, in another mouse model study by McCullers et al., influenza infection preceding a pneumococcal challenge primed for pneumonia led to 100% mortality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR147">147</xref>]. Interestingly, this effect was specific for viral infection preceding bacterial infection, and reversal of the order of administration led to protection from influenza and improved survival [
