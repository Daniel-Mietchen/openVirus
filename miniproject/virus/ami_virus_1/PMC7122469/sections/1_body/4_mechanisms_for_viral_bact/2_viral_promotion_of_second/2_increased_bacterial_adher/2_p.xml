<p id="Par41">Although the majority of evidence for enhanced bacterial adherence during viral respiratory infection comes from studies of influenza virus or RSV, there is growing evidence for the role of RV in bacterial adhesion. In an 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study by Wang et al., nasal epithelial cells were infected with RV, and then 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, or 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> were added to the culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>]. Compared with RV-uninfected control cells, the adhesion of 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> increased significantly in RV-infected nasal epithelial cells. In another 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study on the effects of RV infection on the adherence of S
 <italic>. pneumoniae</italic> to tracheal epithelial cells, the number of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> adhering to epithelial cells increased after RV infection [
