<p id="Par39">Modulation of innate immune cells following a viral-infection is also believed to decrease bacterial clearance in the respiratory tract. Among host innate immune responses, alveolar macrophages are the major cell population in the normal airway and form the first line of defence against respiratory pathogens. A deficiency in alveolar macrophage-mediated phagocytosis following influenza has been reported in several studies. Using a murine-model, Ghoneim et al. showed that influenza infection depleted and induced cell death of alveolar macrophages leading to impaired clearance of

Another murine-model study by Jamieson et al. showed that influenza infection resulted in decreased production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines through virus-induced glucocorticoid production, reduced recruitment of innate immune cells to the infection site and consequently, a dramatic increase in bacterial burden [
