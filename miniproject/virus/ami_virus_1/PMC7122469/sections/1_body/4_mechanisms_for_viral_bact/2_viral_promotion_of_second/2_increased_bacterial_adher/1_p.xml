<p id="Par40">Viral infections of respiratory epithelial cells can also promote bacterial adherence to host cells. In an experimental mouse model study, Hament et al. found that 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> adherence to epithelial cells was enhanced by a preceding RSV infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">131</xref>] and it was later shown through 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> studies that RSV was capable of direct binding to 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>]. Similarly, Avadhanula et al. showed that respiratory viruses including RSV, HPIV, and influenza virus enhanced adhesion of 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to primary immortalized cell lines but only RSV and HPIV increased receptor expression for bacteria by primary bronchial epithelial cells and A549 cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>]. Other studies have shown that RSV virions can bind directly to 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae</italic> acting as a direct coupling particle between bacteria and epithelial cells and thereby increasing colonization by, and enhancing, invasiveness of bacteria [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">124</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. There is also evidence that during RSV infection, viral glycoproteins at the host cell surface, act as additional receptions for bacteria adherence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">132</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. Respiratory viruses can also increase expression of host surface proteins to which bacteria can bind [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">133</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">135</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Host cell receptors for bacterial adherence have also been found to be exposed by viral neuraminidase activities in studies of influenza virus and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR137">137</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">138</xref>]. There is also evidence that viral-mediated epithelia damage can lead to exposure of the basement membrane and additional receptors for bacterial adherence [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">139</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">140</xref>].
