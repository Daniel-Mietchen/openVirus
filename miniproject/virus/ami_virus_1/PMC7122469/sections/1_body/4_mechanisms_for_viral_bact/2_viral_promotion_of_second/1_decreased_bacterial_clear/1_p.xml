<p id="Par38">The respiratory epithelium is the primary site of host-pathogen encounter in the respiratory tract and the first line of defence against infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. The respiratory epithelium restricts bacterial attachment through mucociliary clearance and maintenance of cell-cell junctions, which restricts access to bacterial receptors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR123">123</xref>]. There is evidence that primary viral infections disrupt the respiratory epithelium leading to decreased bacterial clearance. 
 <italic>In-vitro</italic> studies have shown that cells infected with RV, RSV, adenovirus and influenza led to impairment of mucociliary function and consequent decreased clearance of bacteria including
