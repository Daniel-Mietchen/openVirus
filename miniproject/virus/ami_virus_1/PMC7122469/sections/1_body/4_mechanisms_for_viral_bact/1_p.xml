<p id="Par37">The historical context of viral-bacterial co-infections during influenza pandemics have led to a predominantly unidirectional view that primary viral infections increase the development of secondary bacterial infections leading to LRI. Viral-bacterial co-infections in children have been described in many clinical studies, with some associations with disease severity. However, in clinical studies, it is difficult to differentiate primary from secondary infections and to elucidate the clinical significance of co-infections. However, several 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> and 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> experimental model studies have proposed mechanisms to explain interactions between viruses and bacteria. Most mechanisms involve viral facilitation of secondary bacterial infections, for example through disruption of the respiratory epithelium or modulation of innate and adaptive immune responses to decrease bacterial clearance or increase bacterial adherence. However, there is also growing evidence that bacterial infections may promote secondary viral infections, though direct interactions, bacterial interference with antiviral immunity or by synergism or complementation by virulence factors that have similar functions.
