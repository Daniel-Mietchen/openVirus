<p id="Par46">Although viral-bacterial co-infections are common, the clinical significance of co-infections and the mechanisms leading to ARI are yet to be fully clarified. Complex synergistic and antagonistic interactions between viruses and bacteria most likely play a key role in the development of ARI. Viruses and bacteria of the respiratory microbiome may each influence the pathogenicity and consecutive development of infections of the other. Improving knowledge of the interactions between viruses and bacteria may lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of ARI and eventually to new prevention and treatment strategies.</p>
