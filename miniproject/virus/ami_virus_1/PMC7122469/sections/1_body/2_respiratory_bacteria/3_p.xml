<p id="Par23">The human respiratory tract is home to a diverse community of both commensal and potential pathogenic bacteria that cause respiratory disease. The term “microbiome” was first proposed in 2001 by Joshua Lederberg and is used to describe this “ecological community of commensal, symbiotic and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space.” [

However, imbalances in the respiratory microbiome can contribute to the acquisition of new pathogens, carriage of multiple pathogens or interactions among pathogens that lead to respiratory disease. In order to cause respiratory disease, bacterial pathogens must first colonize the nasopharynx. Since the nasopharynx lies between the nose, sinuses, ears, larynx, and the lower respiratory tract, pathogens of the nasopharynx can be the source for both upper and lower respiratory tract infections and hence, plays an important role in both the development of disease and the spread of pathogens [
