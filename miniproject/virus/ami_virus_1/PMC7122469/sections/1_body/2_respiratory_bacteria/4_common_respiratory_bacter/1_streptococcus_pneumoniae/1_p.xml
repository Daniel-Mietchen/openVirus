 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae,</italic> or pneumococcus
 <italic>,</italic> is a Gram-positive, alpha-hemolytic (under aerobic conditions) or beta-hemolytic (under anaerobic conditions), facultative anaerobic member of the Streptococcaceae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80">80</xref>]. It is responsible for a range of illnesses including pneumonia, meningitis, bacteremia, otitis media and sinusitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">81</xref>] and is the most commonly isolated organism in patients with community-acquired pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonizes the upper respiratory tract and is part of the normal flora of healthy individuals, particularly children. Although there are over 90 different serotypes, most cases of disease are caused by relatively few serotypes, with the ten most common serotypes accounting for 62% of invasive pneumococcal disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>]. Since its isolation in 1881, there have been great efforts to treat and prevent 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae.</italic> Antibiotic treatment for invasive pneumococcal infections typically includes broad-spectrum antibiotics until results of antibiotic sensitivity testing are available. However, emerging antibiotic resistance is a growing concern because of its potential negative impact on the outcome of patients who receive standard antibiotic therapy. Pneumococcal vaccines such as the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine are now commonly administered to children globally.
