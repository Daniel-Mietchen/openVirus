 <italic>Haemophilus Influenzae</italic> is a Gram-negative, coccobacillary, facultative anaerobic pathogenic bacterium belonging to the Pasteurellaceae family [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR84">84</xref>]. It was first described in 1892 during an influenza pandemic and was mistakenly considered to be the cause of influenza until 1933 when the viral cause of influenza was known [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>]. 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> is commonly found in the upper and lower respiratory tract as a commensal but also causes a variety of both invasive infections, such as bacteremia, facial cellulitis, septic arthritis, and meningitis primarily in non-immune children under age 4 years of age, and respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia, acute otitis media, bronchitis, epiglottitis and sinusitis in children and adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. There are six different 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> capsular serotypes, a through f, in addition to nonencapsulated or nontypeable strains. The two most important human pathogens are the capsular serotype b strains and the nontypeable strains which are nonencapsulated. Non-typeable 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> (NTHi) live exclusively in the pharynges of humans and are increasingly recognized as pathogens that cause both localized infections of the respiratory tract (middle ear spaces, sinuses, and bronchi) and systemic infections such as bacteremia and pneumonia [
