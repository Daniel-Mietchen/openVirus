<p id="Par21">Although less frequently detected than viruses, bacteria are also acknowledged to be an important cause of ARI-associated morbidity and mortality. Traditional diagnostic methods such as blood culture, which are still considered the gold standard in most settings, lack sensitivity, and hence the disease burden attributable to specific bacteria is not well understood. Given the absence of a reference standard for the detection of bacterial pathogens, the prevalence of bacteria in ARI is likely to be higher than often reported. 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic>, 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> are acknowledged as the most common and important bacterial pathogens in childhood ARI, although more recent studies have reported substantial reductions of pneumococcal and Hib disease, most likely owing to the widespread introduction of conjugate vaccines [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>] and that only 1% of all bacteria can be cultured using standard diagnostic methods [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. However, advanced diagnostics are still rare in most clinical settings and studies detecting a comprehensive range of pathogens remain scarce or non-existent.
