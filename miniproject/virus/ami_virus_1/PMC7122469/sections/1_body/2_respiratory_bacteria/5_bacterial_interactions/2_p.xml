<p id="Par29">Mathematical models investigating bacterial interactions have produced conflicting results. Using a multivariate random effects model for longitudinal data, Jacoby et al. found a positive association between 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> colonization among Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in Australia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR98">98</xref>]. In contrast, Pettigrew et al. modeled bacterial colonization in children and reported 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonization to be negatively associated with colonization by 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. The study also reported negative associations between 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and between 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, but interestingly, when 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> was present with 
 <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic>, the odds of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> colonization increased by more than two-fold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">99</xref>]. These studies suggest that interactions between bacteria are complex and may shift from negative to positive when additional bacteria species are present.
