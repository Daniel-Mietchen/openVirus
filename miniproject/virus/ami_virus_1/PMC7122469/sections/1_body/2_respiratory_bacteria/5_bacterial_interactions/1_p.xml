<p id="Par28">Several studies have investigated interactions between bacteria, although mostly in experimental and mathematical model studies. In an 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> study where 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> was introduced into the nasopharynx of neonatal rats that had or had not been pre-colonized by 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae,</italic> Margolis et al. reported that 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> density increased when 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was present, suggesting synergism between these bacterial species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. However, when these two species were inoculated in the reverse order, inhibition was observed, indicating competition between both species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">94</xref>]. Another 
 <italic>in-vivo</italic> study by Lysenko et al. found that both 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> successfully colonized mice when each bacteria species was injected separately [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">95</xref>]. However, when 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was co-colonized with an 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> strain, the density of 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> was lower than when inoculated alone, and this was later proved to be fully dependent on complement- and neutrophil-mediated killing of pneumococci [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR96">96</xref>]. These findings were supported by a large epidemiological study of the 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and prevalence of bacterial colonization in HIV-uninfected and HIV-infected children in South Africa that reported inverse associations between 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and between 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>H. influenzae</italic> in HIV-uninfected children but not HIV-infected children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR97">97</xref>].
