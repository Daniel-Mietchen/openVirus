<p id="Par30">Viral-bacterial co-infections are frequently detected in children with respiratory illness, and there is strong evidence for enhanced ARI severity in children during co-infections compared with single infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">100</xref>]. While most studies report viral-bacterial co-infection rates ranging from 20 to 50%, rates as high as 66–77% have been observed [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. The clinical significance of viral-bacterial co-infections and mechanisms that drive these interactions are not well understood. It is difficult to determine the relative importance of individual viruses and bacteria involved in co-infections since both viruses and bacteria can be carried commensally in the respiratory tract and their detection may reflect colonization, rather than infection. Furthermore, it is not possible to distinguish between primary and secondary infections in clinical studies, making it difficult to elucidate the interactions between viruses and bacteria in co-infections.
