<p id="Par32">During the 1918 “Spanish flu” pandemic, over 50 million deaths occurred, most of which were not caused directly by influenza alone but rather as a result of secondary bacterial pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The most frequently identified organisms in sputum, lung and blood samples of infected patients were 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> and 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>, and it was believed that the influenza virus acted synergistically with pathogenic bacteria resulting in increased incidence of disease and death [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. These findings were supported by data from the 1957 “Asian flu” and 1968 “Hong Kong flu” pandemics showing that increased mortality was associated with increased incidence of bacterial pneumonia [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. The availability of antibiotics effective for secondary bacterial infections was believed to be a key factor for the lower number of deaths during the 1957 and 1968 pandemics compared with 1918. During the 2009 “swine flu” pandemic involving the H1N1 influenza virus, bacterial co-infection was frequently reported in fatal pneumonia cases, with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> being the most frequent bacteria identified [
