<p id="Par36">Other respiratory viruses have also been implicated in bacterial co-infections in children, but to a lesser degree. It has been suggested that the pathogenesis of hMPV infection is strongly affected by bacterial co-infection with 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. In a study of children hospitalized with LRI in South Africa, Madhi et al. found that administration of conjugate pneumococcal vaccine reduced the incidence of hMPV infection and the incidence of clinical pneumonia in both HIV positive and negative patients [

These findings suggest that a significant proportion of hMPV-associated hospitalizations may be prevented by vaccination with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Adenovirus co-infection was identified in 21% of children with invasive pneumococcal disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>]. While clinical studies confirm that viral-bacterial co-infections are common in children with ALRI, the absence of a control population in most studies makes it difficult to elucidate the clinical significance of co-infections.
