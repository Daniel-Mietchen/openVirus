<p id="Par6">Respiratory viruses are an important cause of both upper and lower ARI. The burden of viral respiratory infections is greatest in children, with infants and pre-school children experiencing an estimated 6–10 viral infections annually [

Respiratory viruses are also commonly identified in children with LRI, and although their role in LRI is acknowledged, evidence for the clinical significance of respiratory viruses in LRI is still debated. Lung aspiration is considered the gold–standard for sampling since it is obtained directly from the site of infection and would indicate etiological significance for LRI, but is limited due to its invasive nature and rate of complications [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Upper respiratory tract samples such as nasopharyngeal aspirates are easily obtained and hence, more frequently used in etiological studies. However, it is argued that viruses identified in the nasopharynx represent only colonization and are not indicative of LRI. Nonetheless, viruses of the upper respiratory tract are more commonly identified in children with LRI than in asymptomatic, healthy children. A 2015 systematic review and meta–analysis of case-control studies of children with and without LRI found evidence for causal attribution of RSV, influenza, parainfluenza virus, human metapnuemovirus and RV in children presenting with LRI compared to asymptomatic or healthy children [
