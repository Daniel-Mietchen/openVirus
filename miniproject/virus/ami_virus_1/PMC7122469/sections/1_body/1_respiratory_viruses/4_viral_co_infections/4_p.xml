<p id="Par20">Several other explanations for why identification of multiple viruses do not increase ARI severity have been suggested. One suggestion is that identification of a virus in a respiratory specimen using molecular methods may represent early detection of an infection, asymptomatic carriage, low-virulent infection or prolonged shedding [

It is also possible that the clinical outcome of viral co-infections is dependent on specific viral combinations, and this may explain the lack of consensus in the literature regarding whether viral co-infections is associated with an increased ARI severity. Many viral co-infection combinations have been reported, as reviewed by Scotta et al.
