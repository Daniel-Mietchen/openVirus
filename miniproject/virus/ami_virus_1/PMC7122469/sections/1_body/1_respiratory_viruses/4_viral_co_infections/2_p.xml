<p id="Par18">To date, experimental studies of respiratory co-infections are scarce. An 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> study examining interactions between RSV and influenza virus demonstrated that growth of RSV was blocked by competitive infection with influenza A virus [

 <italic>,</italic> RSV infection produced a higher peak viral load in single infections than in co-infections with influenza virus, if the infections were initiated at the same time [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. However, if the influenza co-infection was initiated after the RSV infection, influenza growth was suppressed by RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. The study also demonstrated suppression of the growth of RSV by influenza A infection at the level of viral protein synthesis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. Indirect immunofluorescence revealed that a large proportion of infected cells synthesized both RSV and influenza A virus antigens, while scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that influenza A and RSV virions possessing surface antigens specific for each virus were selectively released from dually-infected cells [
