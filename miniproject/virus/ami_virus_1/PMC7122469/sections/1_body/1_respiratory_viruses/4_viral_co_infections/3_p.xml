<p id="Par19">In a mathematical model study investigating the dynamics of respiratory viral co-infections, Pinky et al. found that during co-infections, one virus could block another virus by being the first to infect the available host cells and that viral interference through immune response interaction was unlikely [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. For example, RV, the fastest-growing virus, reduced replication of the remaining viruses during a co-infection, while parainfluenza virus, the slowest-growing virus is suppressed in the presence of other viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. The authors of the study suggest that the blocking of one virus infection by the presence of another could be explained through resource competition and this finding has been supported by clinical studies of children with ARI [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Canducci et al. found that co-infection of RSV and metapneumovirus in infants with ARI was a protective factor for length of hospital stay and hypoxia, when compared with RSV infection alone [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Marguet et al. also found shorter length of hospitalization in infants with RSV and RV co-infection comparing with single RSV infection [
