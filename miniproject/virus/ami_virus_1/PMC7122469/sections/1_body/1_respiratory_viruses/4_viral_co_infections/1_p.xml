<p id="Par17">The advent of improved molecular methods in recent years has increased the sensitivity in identifying viruses in children with ARI [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. As a result, identification of multiple viruses in respiratory specimens from children with ARI is frequently reported [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], with co-infection rates as high as 40–50% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>]. However, the relationship between viral co-infections and severity of ARI in children is not conclusive. Some studies have reported increased risk of ARI hospitalization, increased length of hospital stay and worse clinical outcomes in children with viral co-infections [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. In contrast, recent systematic reviews and meta-analysis evaluating the relationships between respiratory viral co-infections in children have concluded that viral-coinfections were not associated with ARI severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>].
