 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In a study evaluating the burden of hMPV infections in children in the USA, hMPV was detected in 6% of children hospitalized with ARI, 7% of children in outpatient clinics and 7% of children examined in emergency departments, with the greatest burden in children less than 1 year of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. Other studies of hMPV in children hospitalized with ARI have reported prevalences as high as11–25% [
