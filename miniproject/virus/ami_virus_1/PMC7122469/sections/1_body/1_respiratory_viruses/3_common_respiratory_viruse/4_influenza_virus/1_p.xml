<p id="Par12">Influenza virus is an important cause of ARI morbidity and mortality, with the highest burden among children less than 5 years of age and adults over 65 years of age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. The two main subtypes of influenza virus, A and B, routinely circulate and are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics each year. In the first study to estimate the global incidence of influenza-associated ALRI in children less than 5 years of age, there were an estimated 90 million new cases of influenza episodes, 20 million cases of influenza-associated ARI and one million cases of influenza-associated severe ARI causing  28,000–111,500 deaths worldwide in 2008 [
