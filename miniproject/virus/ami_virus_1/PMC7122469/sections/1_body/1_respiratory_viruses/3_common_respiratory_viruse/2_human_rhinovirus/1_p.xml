<p id="Par9">RV is the most commonly identified respiratory virus in both adults and children and was found to be responsible for approximately two-thirds of cases of the common cold [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Hence, it is frequently referred to as the “common cold” virus. However, there is now abundant evidence from experimental and observational studies to support the role of RV as a lower respiratory tract pathogen. Early experiment studies with RV suggested that viral replication was optimal at 33 °C (91.4 °F) and was reduced at 37 °C (98.6 °F) and 39 °C (102.2 °F) [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, more recent studies have shown minimal differences in replication capacities at 33 °C (91.4 °F) and 37 °C (98.6 °F) for eight different RV strains, including when viruses were cultured and titrated at the same temperature [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Hence, RV is now recognised as an important cause of LRI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis and importantly, accounts for the majority of asthma attacks in children [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several studies worldwide have reported RV as the most common virus identified in children with LRI, with identification rates of up to 63% in some populations [
