<p id="Par8">RSV has been considered the most important viral cause of ARI in children, although its contribution is variable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. RSV is a seasonal virus that peaks in the cold season in temperate climates and in the rainy season in tropical climates [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. It affects about 90% of infants and young children by the age of 2 years, with peak rates occurring in infants 6 weeks to 6 months of age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. There are two subtypes of RSV, A and B, which circulate concurrently, although some studies have suggested that RSV-A may be more virulent than RSV-B [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In 2005, there were an estimated 33.8 million new episodes of RSV-associated ARI worldwide in children less than 5 years of age, with at least 3.4 million RSV-associated ARI hospitalizations, and an estimated 66,000–199,000 deaths, 99% of which occurred in developing countries [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Hence, RSV is justifiably seen to be the most important cause of childhood ARI and a major cause of ARI-associated hospital admission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Although RSV has been associated with higher rates of hospitalization than other respiratory viruses in several studies, estimates of RSV-associated ARI incidence and hospitalization are highly variable between and within regions, likely due to methodological differences [
