<p>Astute clinicians can often make a presumptive diagnosis of infection based on the clinical signs of wheezing or pneumonia in an infant during a local epidemic. Laboratory testing of nasal or lower airway secretions by antigen test (ELISA) or nucleic acid detection (by RT-PCR) provides rapid diagnosis of the presence of virus in many cases. The gold standard for diagnosis is isolation of the virus in cell culture, but this test is typically only available in referral laboratories because of the need for extensive equipment and a high level of technical expertise.</p>
