<p>It is not clear whether infection with RSV causes prolonged abnormal pulmonary function during childhood or whether children with underlying predisposition to lower respiratory tract disease of all causes manifest their susceptibility first to RSV because of the young age of RSV infection. Certainly measureable pulmonary function abnormalities are common after RSV lower respiratory tract disease, and these findings may persist for a decade or more [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">134</xref>]. A large case-control study of 200 children hospitalized for bronchiolitis or pneumonia in which RSV was the most common cause found that 7 years later there was a strong predisposition in these subjects toward decreased pulmonary function, recurrent cough, wheezing, and bronchitis [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. This correlation persisted in children during the first 3 years of life [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR136">136</xref>]. Even some individuals who do not typically exhibit recurrent wheezing have postexercise or pharmacologically induced bronchial reactivity [
