<p>Infection during the first day or weeks of life may just be characterized by temperature instability or fever, irritability, and lethargy even in the absence of overt respiratory signs or symptoms. In very young infants, especially those born prematurely, apneic spells may occur in response to RSV infection. Apnea may be the first reported evidence of infection in some cases, and apneic spells may recur during the acute infection. These events thankfully are usually self-limited and rarely cause neurologic damage. Apneic events are an indication for hospitalization and careful medical supervision with respiratory monitoring. Because of the association with apnea, some have considered whether RSV is associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Although RSV has been detected in the lung tissues of some cases of SIDS, there is no statistically significant association between RSV and SIDS. The reported cases likely reflect a temporal association caused by the high prevalence of RSV in this age group, the prolonged pattern of shedding, and the simultaneous peak incidence of both RSV infection and SIDS in winter months [
