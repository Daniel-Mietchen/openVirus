<p>RSV infection usually causes upper respiratory tract symptoms during primary infection in otherwise healthy term infants; asymptomatic primary infection is not common. There is often profuse rhinorrhea, and the upper tract disease is very often complicated by otitis media. Symptoms of lower respiratory tract involvement occur in about a third of primary cases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The principal diagnoses are bronchiolitis (manifested by tachypnea and wheezing) and pneumonia. These entities are probably not discrete processes but more likely represent a continuum of disease involving increasing tissue distribution. The typical illness starts with nasal congestion, followed in a few days by cough. The infection is sometimes associated with fever, which is usually low grade. After several days of upper tract symptoms, infants may wheeze. Many infants suffer mild wheezing that resolves, but some cases progress with tachypnea, diffuse inspiratory crackles, and expiratory wheezes. Most children recover in 1â€“2 weeks with supportive care and observation. If expiratory obstruction becomes severe, however, hyper-expansion of the chest occurs due to air retention, and the compliant nature of the infant chest wall leads to intercostal and subcostal retractions during tachypnea. With prolonged tachypnea, fatigue may occur with poor oxygenation and CO
 <sub>2</sub> retention (measured by pulse oximeter or arterial blood gas measurement), markers of respiratory failure. Intubation and mechanical ventilation is used in this setting to manage the respiratory failure.
