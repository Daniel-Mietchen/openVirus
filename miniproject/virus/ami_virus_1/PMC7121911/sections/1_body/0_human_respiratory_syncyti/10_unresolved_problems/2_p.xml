<p>The mortality in infants has been greatly reduced in the USA through advances in critical care, but little RSV-specific intervention is available. Currently, there is little to offer for therapy except for supportive care. Prophylaxis of high-risk infant with a MAb prevents some hospitalizations but is expensive and is not always effective. There are no licensed vaccines. Given the disaster of early FI-RSV trials, it is not clear that a non-replicating vaccine can be proven safe enough in preclinical models to absolutely assure that enhanced disease will not occur. On the other hand, the explosion of new technologies for generation of recombinant RSV strains, the determination of pre- and post-fusion antigen structures, and new tools for the detailed study of the molecular and genetic basis of human immune responses suggest that much progress will be made in the RSV research field in the coming years.</p>
