<p>Higher titers of virus in respiratory secretions usually are associated with increased severity of disease, in prospective studies of natural infection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">114</xref>] or of clinical vaccine trials [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR115">115</xref>]. RSV infection is an acute infection and virus shedding usually resolves within days to weeks. RT-PCR tests for virus nucleic acid may remain positive for prolonged periods. Some animal studies suggest that a negligible amount of infectious virus may persist in airways far after apparent resolution of shedding, as evidenced by the recovery of low amounts of infectious virus during immunosuppression several months after infection [
