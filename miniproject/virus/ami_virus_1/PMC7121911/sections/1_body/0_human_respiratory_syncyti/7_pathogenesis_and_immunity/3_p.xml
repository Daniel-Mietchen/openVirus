<p>The virus infects respiratory epithelial cells in the lung and airway. It is not clear whether RSV also replicates productively in macrophages and dendritic cells in the airway or not. RSV protein antigens have been detected in circulating mononuclear cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR117">117</xref>], and viral genomic RNA and mRNA have been detected by RT-PCR in blood cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">118</xref>], but this probably represents cells from the airway recirculating, as infectious virus in the blood (viremia) is not detected. RSV replicates in the cells at the luminal surface of the respiratory epithelium and virus both enters and is shed from the apical surface of infected epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. Studies of polarized, differentiated respiratory epithelial cells in vitro show that RSV infection preferentially infects ciliated cells at the luminal face [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR121">121</xref>], but it is not clear if infection is restricted to such cells in humans. Histopathology studies of infected humans are very limited, but show RSV antigens in the superficial cells of the airway in a patchy distribution, with antigen-positive cells and debris in the airway lumen.
