<p>Infection occurs by inoculation of the nasal or conjunctival mucosa, often by self-inoculation with infected secretions from a close contact. Adult volunteers were infected experimentally if virus was inoculated onto the conjunctival sac or into the nose, but not following introduction into the mouth [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR113">113</xref>]. Virus replication initiates in the nasopharynx and rapidly can reach concentrations of over a million particles per mL in the upper airway in children. Adults, who are partially immune, typically shed much lower amounts of virus. Virus spreads quickly to the lower respiratory tract, often causing symptoms within days of onset of upper respiratory symptoms. Virus may spread from cell to cell, but also it is likely that small aspirations of upper respiratory secretions with virus inoculate the lower tract.
