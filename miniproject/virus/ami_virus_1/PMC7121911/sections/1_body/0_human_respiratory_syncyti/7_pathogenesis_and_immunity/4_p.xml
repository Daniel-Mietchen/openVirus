<p>Pathology caused by RSV infection during infant bronchiolitis includes necrosis and proliferation of the bronchiolar epithelium and destruction of ciliated epithelial cells [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR122">122</xref>]. There is an influx of a large variety of immune cell types including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. The respiratory tissues become edematous. Mucous secretion, sloughing of dead cell debris, and the influx of apparent inflammatory cells obstruct the lumen of the narrow bronchioles and alveoli. The small diameter of infant bronchioles is easily obstructed in the presence of dead cells and edema of the airway tissues [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. It is surprising, given the extent of disease, that RSV antigen staining is usually patchy or focal, and even in some cases of fatal RSV bronchiolitis, antigen is present only in small amounts [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">119</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">120</xref>]. The number of cases that have been collected is limited, however, and there is virtually no histopathology from milder cases.
