<p>RSV upper respiratory infection is complicated frequently by otitis media caused by bacteria. It is unusual to observe frank bacterial pneumonia or sepsis as a complication of RSV infection, in contrast to some other respiratory viruses like influenza. Although some clinicians may empirically use antibiotics during infant pneumonia, there is no evidence that antibiotic therapy alters the course of RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Antimicrobial therapy should not be used in most cases of RSV bronchiolitis or pneumonia because of the lack of benefit and risk of selection of antibiotic-resistant colonizing organisms. Nevertheless, there is some suggestion that bacterial-viral interactions may affect the overall rate of disease in the population. It is interesting that annual RSV and influenza virus epidemics correlate directly with the time of peak incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in many population studies [
