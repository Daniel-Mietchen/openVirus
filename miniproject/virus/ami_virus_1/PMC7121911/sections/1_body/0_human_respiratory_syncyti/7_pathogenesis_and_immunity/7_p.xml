Most experts agree that high levels of serum neutralizing antibodies are associated with relative protection against severe lower respiratory tract disease in otherwise healthy subjects. This idea is supported strongly by the observation that prophylaxis of high-risk infants with a neutralizing monoclonal antibody prevents about half of hospitalizations in that group of patients. Many population studies suggest that infants born with high levels of transplacental RSV-neutralizing maternal antibodies develop milder illness or illness at an older age than infants with low maternal antibody levels [

Mucosal secretory IgA appears to contribute to local protection against reinfection in the airway, although potent protective IgA responses are likely relatively short lived. In human infants, the decrease in virus shedding in nasal secretions was associated with the appearance of RSV-specific IgA antibodies [
