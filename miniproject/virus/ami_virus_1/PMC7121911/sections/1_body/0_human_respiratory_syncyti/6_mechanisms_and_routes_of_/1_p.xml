<p>Direct contact with secretions from an infected human, usually by fomites (contaminated objects, including hands), allows transmission of virus. In some cases, infected subjects may inoculate contacts at short distance by coughing via large-particle droplets. However, the virus is not spread efficiently by small-particle aerosols [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR110">110</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR111">111</xref>]. The nasal and conjunctival mucus membranes are probably the most common portals of entry [

RSV is one of the most infectious viruses spread by contact, and transmission is very efficient even among subjects who possess partial immunity due to prior infection. Spread among family members and day-care contacts is especially common. The infectious doses for humans are probably only a few infectious particles per mL of respiratory secretions, but infants routinely shed at least a millionfold higher concentration of virus during the peak of illness. The incubation period is not known definitely but is about 3â€“6 days and likely varies according to the intensity of exposure and the amount of virus in the inoculum. The period of viral shedding is many days; infants can shed infectious virus for weeks [
