<p>Virtually any serious medical or genetic condition is associated with some increased risk of severe diseases [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Certain particular categories of subjects are at highest risk for severe RSV disease, including infants with congenital heart or chronic lung disease, immunodeficient subjects of any age and the elderly [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. These latter subjects are thought to have reduced competency of RSV-specific T cells. Prematurity increases risk to a small extent, but more importantly chronic lung diseases are important factors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>]. Infants who are born prematurely and then suffer persistent chronic lung disease, especially those needing oxygen supplementation, are at very high risk of hospitalization with RSV. Children with cystic fibrosis are at high risk of severe disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]. In children younger than 2 years with cystic fibrosis, the consequence of RSV infection may be prolonged respiratory morbidity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. Children with congenital heart disease also are at increased risk [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>,
