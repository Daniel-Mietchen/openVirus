<p>Epidemics occur in the winter and early spring in the USA. Onset of the annual epidemic varies by region of the country and by year but typically begins in the USA in October or November and lasts through late spring. Within a region, the timing of RSV season changes slightly each year. Florida often has the earliest onset of RSV epidemic and the longest lasting season in the USA. Near the equator, infections may be more common during rainy season.</p>
