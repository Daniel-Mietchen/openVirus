<p>Transmission of RSV in the hospital setting can lead to serious disease, especially in critical care units with neonates or other high-risk infants [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. Nosocomial outbreaks in inpatient transplantation facilities are sometimes severe and unit outbreaks can be difficult to terminate because transplant patients can shed RSV for many months [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>]. Theoretically, transmission in inpatient healthcare settings should be preventable through strict compliance with infection control practices, especially hand washing and contact precautions, which are universally recommended for RSV patients. A high level of compliance with precautions is difficult to achieve in busy care settings but is needed to prevent transmission by healthcare providers. The use of the prophylactic monoclonal antibody palivizumab has been studied to interrupt an outbreak in a neonatal intensive care unit setting [
