<p>During community outbreaks of RSV, the venues with the highest level of young infants and children exhibit the highest rates of transmission of virus, especially large families and day-care settings with large numbers of children per room. Hospital infection control practices must be used to prevent RSV spread, using measures including careful hand hygiene, contact precautions for patient isolation, gowns and gloves [
