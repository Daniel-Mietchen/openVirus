<p>There is a single serotype of RSV, but two antigenic subgroups of RSV, with about 25 % antigenic relatedness, have been defined using immune sera; the subgroups are designated A and B. Antigenic dimorphism for RSV had been noted in an early study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] and subsequently was delineated using MAbs, which identified extensive differences in the G protein and less extensive differences in F and other proteins [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The two subgroups exhibit a three- to fourfold reciprocal difference in neutralization by polyclonal convalescent serum. Analysis of glycoprotein-specific responses in experimental rodent models or human infants by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with purified F and G glycoproteins showed that the F proteins are 50 % related antigenically and the G proteins are 1–7 % related [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. Consistent with this level of antigenic relatedness, F protein expressed by a vector immunization was equally protective in small animals against challenge with the homologous or heterologous subgroup virus, whereas the G protein was 13-fold less effective against the heterologous subgroup virus [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Thus, the F protein is responsible for most of the observed cross-subgroup neutralization and protection. In some communities a pattern of infection with viruses of alternating subgroups has been described, but this is not a universal phenomenon. RSV subgroup B virus is more difficult to isolate and propagate in culture, so subgroup B viruses are less commonly associated with severe disease in some studies. However, clearly viruses of both subgroups can cause severe disease leading to hospitalization [
