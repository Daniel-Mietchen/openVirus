<p>Infants exhibit the highest risk of severe lower respiratory tract disease. This elevated risk is explained by a myriad of physiologic, immunologic, and other factors. First, the highest point of resistance in the airways is the bronchioles, and the resistance of airways is inversely proportional to the airway radius to the fourth power (resistance ~ 1/radius
 <sup>4</sup>, from Poiseuille’s law). The bronchioles of infants are narrow, and inflammation and secretion in the bronchioles leads to turbulent airflow, and further reduction of the airway lumen size. These physical factors lead to the clinical signs of wheezing (a sign of outflow obstruction) and air retention. Increased respiratory rate can compensate to some extent for respiratory compromise, but prolonged tachypnea can lead to fatigue and eventual respiratory failure. Also, during primary infection infants do not possess active immunity to infection, which allow this efficient virus to replicate in the airway to titers as high as 10
 <sup>7</sup> infectious particles per mL of secretion. Mothers pass RSV antibodies to infants across the placenta during the third trimester, but premature infants do not obtain maternal antibodies prior to 32 weeks’ gestation. Also, the airways of premature infants are smaller than those of term infants. Another factor leading to respiratory difficulty is dehydration. Obstruction of the nasal passages with thick secretions can impede the feeding of infants, who are obligate nose breathers.
