<p>Although primary infection of infants is probably most efficient, RSV can infect subjects of any age [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Since otherwise healthy adults all possess measurable RSV serum antibodies and RSV-specific T cells, it is clear that prior exposure and induction of immune responses may not prevent infection. However, disease severity is usually reduced after one or several infections early in life, thus immune effectors such as serum neutralizing antibodies do prevent severe disease during reinfections. Unlike influenza virus, RSV does not exhibit a progressive antigenic drift. Although RSV antigenic diversity is observed in field strains, diversity of the antigenic proteins is not required for RSV to cause reinfection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Most experts believe that serum neutralizing antibodies protect against severe lower respiratory tract disease but do not result in sterilizing immunity against infection at the respiratory mucosa. Thus, healthy adults show signs and symptoms of the common cold in about half of cases of natural or experimental infections, even though they have experienced numerous previous RSV infections [
