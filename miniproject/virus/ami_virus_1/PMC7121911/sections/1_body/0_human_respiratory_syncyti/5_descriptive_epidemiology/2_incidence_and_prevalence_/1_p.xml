<p>Early prospective studies showed that approximately half of infants in the USA are infected during their first year of life; most were infected after two winter epidemics [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. RSV is the most common virus associated with hospitalization for respiratory illness and in fact is one of the most common of all causes of infant hospitalization. For example, RSV caused 13 hospitalizations per 1,000 US children younger than 1 year in one large study [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. During winter RSV epidemics, over 75 % of the children hospitalized for acute lower respiratory tract infection are infected with RSV [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. The rate of very severe disease in hospitalized infants is high, with about 2–5 % of hospitalized infants requiring mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure [
