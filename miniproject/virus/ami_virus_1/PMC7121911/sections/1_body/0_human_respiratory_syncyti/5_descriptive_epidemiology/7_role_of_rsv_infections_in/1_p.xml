<p>RSV is a common cause of severe respiratory disease in immunocompromised patients, including lower respiratory disease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Mortality rates in some populations of immunocompromised patients verges on 50 % [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>]. Infants with congenital severe combined immunodeficiency are at special risk [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>], but any acquired immunosuppressive condition such as cancer or transplantation puts patients at risk, especially when T cell function is compromised [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. RSV infection can cause severe lung disease in recipients of lung transplants, sometimes with a long-term outcome of obliterative bronchiolitis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Children with HIV infection shed RSV for extended periods, but disease is not especially severe in HIV-infected children prior to onset of AIDS [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. Interestingly, although most immunocompromised subjects appear to be at risk because of T cell problems, infants with phagocytic cell defects including those with interferon-γ receptor deficiency or chronic granulomatous disease also are at risk of severe RSV disease.
