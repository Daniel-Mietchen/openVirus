<p>Prevention of severe disease probably will best be accomplished by development and use of an effective vaccine. Vaccine development for RSV has proven exceptionally difficult, however. First, young infants are a difficult population to immunize. Obstacles to immunization at this early age include immunologic immaturity and immunosuppression by maternal antibodies, as already noted [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">167</xref>]. This vaccine suspension was made by mixing concentrated, inactivated virus with alum adjuvant and was delivered by the intramuscular (IM) route. This inoculation did not protect against infection or disease, but rather during subsequent natural infection vaccinees experienced more frequent and severe disease. Most FI-RSV vaccinees (80 %) required hospitalization during subsequent natural infection, compared to 5 % in the control group. Autopsies of two fatalities showed evidence of RSV replication and pulmonary inflammation [

Therefore, RSV protein vaccines have been problematic for use in infants given their possible potential for disease enhancement, together with the poor immunogenicity in this population.
