<p>Therapy of RSV disease by any antiviral agent is challenging because it is a rapid acute infection, and by the time the onset of disease is recognized, it may be too late to alter the course of disease by reducing viral load. The guanosine (ribonucleic acid) analog ribavirin is a nucleoside inhibitor that inhibits viral RNA synthesis and viral mRNA capping. The drug has in vitro antiviral activity against RSV, and aerosolized ribavirin therapy has been associated with a small but statistically significant increase in oxygen saturation during the acute infection in several small studies. Decreases in mechanical ventilation and duration of RSV-associated hospitalization have not been proven (reviewed in [

Clinically, the drug usually is administered as a small-particle aerosol using a tent, mask, or mechanical ventilator, delivered for 6–18 h daily for a period of 3–7 days. The drug now is not recommended for routine use because follow-up studies have not shown a major benefit. The drug may be considered for use in select patients with documented, potentially life-threatening RSV infection. Over a dozen other experimental small molecule inhibitors of RSV fusion to cells have been described and tested in preclinical studies for inhibition of RSV, but none have progressed in development to date. A third approach employs short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), taking advantage of an ancient host cell regulatory system. Single-stranded and double-stranded RNA molecules that exhibit RSV-specific small interfering RNAs have been developed for treatment, which cause RNA interference activity against RSV, destroying the corresponding RSV RNA. These novel compounds have shown promising results in preclinical studies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR145">145</xref>] and have been tested in small clinical trials. Human immune globulin with a high titer of RSV antibodies and the RSV monoclonal antibody palivizumab have been tested as therapy of acute RSV disease, but they were not effective for treatment of established disease.
