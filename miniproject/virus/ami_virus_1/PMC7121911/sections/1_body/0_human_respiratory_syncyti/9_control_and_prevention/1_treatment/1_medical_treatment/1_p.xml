<p>Primary treatment is supportive care, which includes oral or intravenous hydration; monitoring of respiratory status, especially of oxygen saturation during tachypnea; use of supplemental oxygen; removal of secretions from the upper airway; and, in the case of respiratory failure, intubation and mechanical ventilation. Advances in support care in pediatric critical care units have caused a major decrease in morbidity and mortality from RSV in the developed world. Infants hospitalized for RSV disease should be monitored for apnea. Investigators have studied nitric oxide [
