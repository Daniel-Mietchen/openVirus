<p>It is intuitive to think of using beta-adrenergic agents, commonly used for the treatment of asthma, to treat the wheezing associated with RSV infection. These agents are not usually recommended for routine care of first-time wheezing associated with RSV bronchiolitis. Short-term improvements in oxygenation and clinical scores can be achieved by these therapies, but it has not been established that their use results in improvements in duration or severity of illness or disease outcomes. Studies in this area have been conflicting, but systematic reviews of randomized clinical trials of nebulized beta-agonist therapy for treatment of bronchiolitis suggest that they offer little benefit [
