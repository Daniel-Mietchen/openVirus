<p>Live-attenuated vaccines represent an attractive strategy for preventing RSV, since live infection induces a balanced immune response that is not associated with enhanced disease on subsequent natural infection. Many live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidates have been developed over several decades. It has proven difficult to identify a candidate that is satisfactorily attenuated while remaining satisfactorily immunogenic in the youngest infants. Clinical trials of a safe, live-attenuated RSV vaccine for intranasal administration have shown restriction of viral replication in infants following administration of a second dose and have been encouraging [
