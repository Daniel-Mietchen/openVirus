<p>However, an RSV protein vaccine might be useful in boosting immunity in RSV-experienced older children and adults who are at increased risk of severe RSV disease due to underlying disease or advanced age. Protein vaccines for RSV have been evaluated clinically for use in such RSV-experienced individuals, in whom they appear to be safe. One experimental subunit vaccine consisted of purified F protein (PFP) isolated from RSV-infected cell culture. This purified protein vaccine candidate was evaluated in adults, in older children with and without underlying medical diseases, and in the elderly [
