<p>The F protein is critical for entry into cells, by breaching the barrier of the cell lipid bilayer. It is thought that binding of virion particles to susceptible cells at physiologic pH triggers a conformational change of the F protein from a metastable pre-fusion state [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] to an altered post-fusion conformation [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] in which the hydrophobic fusion peptide in the protein is exposed and extended to insert into the host cell membrane. This membrane insertion event accomplishes a fusion of the viral and host membranes, allowing delivery of the nucleocapsid to the cytoplasm where viral replication occurs. This event is termed “fusion from without” when the particle enters a cell. An alternative fusion event (“fusion from within”) occurs when newly expressed F protein on the surface of infected cells causes fusion of an infected cell to an adjacent cell in culture causing “syncytia.” It is not certain whether this latter form of fusion (cell-cell fusion) occurs during natural infection and contributes to pathogenesis or if the formation of syncytia is a tissue culture phenomenon only.
