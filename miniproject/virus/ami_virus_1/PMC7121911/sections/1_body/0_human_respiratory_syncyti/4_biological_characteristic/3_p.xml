<p>The RSV virion buds from airway epithelial cells, incorporating host cell membrane as the lipid bilayer that forms the envelope of the particle. Since the virus is enveloped, chemicals that disrupt lipid bilayers (detergents) inactivate the virus, leading to the strong recommendations for healthcare provider hand washing following patient contact. The genome is a single strand of RNA, which forms a helical complex with the nucleoprotein (N). The final nucleocapsid structure likely is formed by the complete set of replication proteins, which also include the phosphoprotein (P) and the large RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L). It is suspected that the M protein helps the particle to form by bridging the nucleocapsid and the lipid envelope with its incorporated surface proteins. The surface of the particle incorporates three integral membrane surface glycoproteins, the highly glycosylated RSV G protein suspected to be the attachment protein, the fusion protein F, and the small hydrophobic protein (SH). RSV F (a Type I integral membrane protein) and RSV G (a Type II integral membrane protein) form oligomers on the surface of the particles, which appear like small spikes with globular heads when seen in electron microscopic (EM) images by negative stain. The morphology of particles in EM images or in fluorescent microscopy images labeled by conjugated antibodies suggests that the virion particles are filamentous. However, spherical particles, filaments, and more pleomorphic forms have been observed; therefore, it is uncertain what the morphology of infectious particles in vivo during natural infection is.</p>
