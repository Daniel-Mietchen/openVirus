<p>The replication proteins are common to both of the viruses, as are the matrix (M) protein and the surface fusion (F) and glycosylated attachment (G) glycoproteins. The gene order differs slightly, and RSV possesses two nonstructural (NS) genes NS1 and NS2 that are not present in MPV. The functions of these genes are not fully defined, but involve interactions with the host response machinery, especially interferons. The presence of these host response-modifying genes may explain in part why RSV appears to cause severe disease more commonly than MPV. Many of the gene sequences exhibit some clear global sequence relatedness; however, the extent of the relatedness of many of the sequences of corresponding proteins is relatively low. Based on sequence homology, it is not expected that there is a significant amount of immunologic cross-reactivity in responses to the two viruses.</p>
