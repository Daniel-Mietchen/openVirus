<p>RSV was isolated first in 1956 from an ill chimpanzee in a laboratory setting that had an illness similar to the common cold. A virus causing a similar cytopathic effect in cultured cells was recovered from infants with respiratory illness shortly after, and studies of human antibodies in the serum of infants and children indicated that infection was common early in life [

In most areas of the world, RSV is the most common cause of pneumonia and bronchiolitis in infants less than 1 year of age. RSV causes severe disease in young infants, but disease is not restricted to the early life period. The virus can cause severe lower respiratory tract illness in large numbers of elderly subjects and also in subjects who are severely immunocompromised such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients [
