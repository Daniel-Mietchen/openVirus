<p>Seroepidemiology studies suggest that virtually all children are infected in the first 2 years of life, and early infection is especially common in infants attending group day care. Serological methods are helpful in epidemiology and vaccine studies, but serologies are not often used for diagnosis in clinical settings. Because of the transfer of maternal RSV-specific antibodies across the placenta, and the high prevalence of early infection, it is unusual to find infants who are RSV seronegative. In older children and adults, a fourfold rise in serum antibodies is often used as evidence of RSV infection, but asymptomatic infections in which viral shedding is low in titer often are not accompanied by serum antibody rises. Serological tests in infants are even less sensitive, because young infants may not exhibit a large or durable rise in antibodies. Neutralizing antibody tests are considered the best functional marker of infection, but sensitivity is much higher in antigen binding assays using individually purified RSV F or G proteins [
