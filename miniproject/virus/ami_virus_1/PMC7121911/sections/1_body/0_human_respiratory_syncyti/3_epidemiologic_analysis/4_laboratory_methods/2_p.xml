<p>Culture is expensive and requires highly trained staff and therefore is not usually available at the point of care, which is often an outpatient clinic or emergency department. Therefore, rapid diagnostic methods were developed for the detection of viral proteins or RNA in respiratory secretions. RSV antigen tests mostly rely on direct immunofluorescent assays (DFA) on exfoliated cells in secretions or enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Nucleic acid detection assays based on RT-PCR are now widely available for RSV, often in a multiplexed panel for detection of multiple respiratory virus pathogens. These tests are typically more sensitive than any of the virus isolation or protein-based detection assays discussed above. Enhanced sensitivity is especially helpful when testing adults, who often shed virus in very low titers. Positive RT-PCR tests need to be interpreted in the context of the clinical scenario, since the tests can remain positive for prolonged periods of time after infection, well beyond the period during which infectious virus can be isolated. Since children may experience symptomatic respiratory infections every few weeks during the winter, caution must be used in interpretation of positive PCR tests, especially when multiple viruses are detected simultaneously in a sample. Some instances of multiple PCR test positivity likely represent residual RNA from a previous virus infection and a second RNA type representing live virus from the active current infection.</p>
