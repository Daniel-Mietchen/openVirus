<p>RSV also is one of the most common viral causes of serious lower respiratory tract illness in the elderly, especially in institutionalized subjects [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The elderly do not exhibit a remarkably diminished level of antibodies to RSV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Decreased levels of T cell memory in the elderly and specifically in patients with (COPD) may contribute to the increased susceptibility to RSV infection in these populations [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Many think of influenza virus as the principal viral respiratory pathogen in this population, but in a hospitalized cohort, influenza A virus and RSV infection resulted in similar mortality, lengths of stay, and rates of use of intensive care [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. RSV infection accounted for over 10 % of hospitalizations for pneumonia.
