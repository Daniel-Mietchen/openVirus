<p>RSV typically is propagated in monolayer cell cultures of continuous cell lines of human epithelial cell origin, such as HEp-2 cells. Monkey kidney cells of various types are also used commonly for propagation in the laboratory. In fact, the virus replicates to some extent in most cell lines of mammalian origin. In non-polarized epithelial cells, the virus often causes a typical cytopathic effect in which multinucleated giant cells form due to cell-cell fusion, termed cell syncytia. This in vitro effect is the origin of the virus name, although it is not clear that RSV causes syncytia in vivo. In polarized epithelial cells in culture, the virus assembles and buds from the apical surface of cells, mimicking to some extent the budding of virus into the lumen of the airway.</p>
