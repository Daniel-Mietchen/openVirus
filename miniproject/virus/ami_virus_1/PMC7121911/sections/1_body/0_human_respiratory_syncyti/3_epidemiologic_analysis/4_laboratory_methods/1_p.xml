<p>Isolation of the virus in cell culture provides a definitive test for diagnosis of active infection. Various methods of obtaining respiratory virus secretions for testing have been compared. Most studies suggested that aspiration or gentle flushing of nasal secretions using a solution like saline is best, though some types of nasal swab have given reasonable results. The virus is more thermolabile than most, and thus samples should be transported on wet ice to the diagnostic laboratory and processed rapidly. Prolonged times of transport to remote reference laboratories reduce the effectiveness of isolation. After inoculation onto susceptible cell culture substrates, highly trained staff can recognize cytopathology in the cell monolayers by visual inspection and conventional bright-field microscopy after about 3â€“7 days of incubation. Detection may be more efficient when using shell vial cultures and immunofluorescence [
