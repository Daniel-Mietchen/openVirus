<p>Mortality in infants and children caused by RSV is uncommon in developed countries with modern critical care units. Estimates of the mortality rate are about 0.3 % of hospitalized children or less. Mortality has been dropping over the last several decades, and by the late 1990s the estimated number of deaths in the USA was several hundred children a year or less [

Interestingly, while many providers think of RSV infection as principally a pediatric illness, there are over 17,000 deaths per year in the elderly, making them the highest risk population for death [
