<p>Infants with underlying illness are at highest risk among young children for morbidity and mortality from RSV infection. Infants with chronic lung disease requiring supplemental oxygen following treatment for prematurity, due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are perhaps at the highest risk for prolonged, severe, or fatal illness due to RSV [

The most severely immunocompromised, and thus those at highest risk of mortality, are hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients of any age [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. In some settings, the mortality rate of RSV infection in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients with severe immunosuppression verges on 100 % [
