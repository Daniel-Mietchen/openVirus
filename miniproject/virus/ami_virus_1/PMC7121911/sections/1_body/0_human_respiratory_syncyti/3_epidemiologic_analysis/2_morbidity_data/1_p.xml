<p>Hospitalization rates of infants for RSV disease vary with the setting, probably due to variations in exposure, genetics, socioeconomic, and other risk factors and due to the local practice style of medical providers. Many developed countries report hospitalization rates of about 1 in 100–200 infected infants during the first year of life [
