<p>MPV has four distinct genetic lineages or subgroups: A1, A2, B2, and B2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">218</xref>]. The predominant subtype varies by year and location [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">280</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR293">293</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR297">297</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>]. In Italy, over a 3-years period, all four subtypes were identified each season but the predominant subtype changed. In 2001–2002, A1 accounted for 59 % of all strains, the following year B1 and B2 were present equally, and in 2003–2004, 72 % of strains were A2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR308">308</xref>]. Similar variation was observed over 20 years in a US study, with multiple subgroups present in most seasons (Fig.
