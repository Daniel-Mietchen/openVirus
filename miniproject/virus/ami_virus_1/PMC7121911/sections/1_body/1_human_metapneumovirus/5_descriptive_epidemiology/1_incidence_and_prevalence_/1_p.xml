<p>Numerous studies document the fact that MPV infection is ubiquitous and that reinfection is common. Serosurveys testing large sample collections in Canada, China, Croatia, Germany, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Thailand, the USA, and Uruguay show that 95–100 % of children have antibodies against MPV by the age of 5 years [

Most identify a decrease in serum MPV antibody titer from birth to 6–12 months, presumably due to the expected decline of maternally derived antibodies. Studies in Japan and India that compared MPV and RSV titers in the same cohort found that after the expected nadir during early infancy, RSV titers began increasing at an earlier age than MPV [

This finding is interesting in light of epidemiologic data suggesting that primary MPV infection peaks between 6 and 12 months of life compared with the peak of RSV at 2–3 months (discussed below). Longitudinal studies in adults and children have documented reinfection by a fourfold rise in serum antibody titer [
