A large prospective study of children with URI detected MPV in 5 % of patients, similar to RSV, influenza, and PIV but less frequent than adenovirus and rhinovirus. In these children with URI associated with MPV, fever was present in 54 %, coryza in 82 %, cough in 66 %, pharyngitis in 44 %, hoarseness in 8 %, and conjunctivitis in 3 % [
