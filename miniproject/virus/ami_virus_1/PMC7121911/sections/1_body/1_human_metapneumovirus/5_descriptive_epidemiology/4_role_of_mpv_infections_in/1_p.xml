<p>Respiratory disease is among the leading causes for hospitalization of adults in the USA, and “influenza and pneumonia” ranks among the top 10 causes of deaths annually. Although the data are limited, MPV appears to be associated with a substantial burden of ARI in adults, primarily those with comorbidities. A prospective study in Rochester, NY, enrolled four cohorts during four winters: healthy adults &gt;65, high-risk adults &gt;65 with comorbidities, healthy adults 19–40 years old, and adults hospitalized for acute cardiopulmonary illness [

The rate of MPV infection was highest in young adults at 13 %, though many of these were asymptomatic and detected only serologically. Of note, this group had a mean age of 33, was predominantly female, and had daily exposure to children. Of the hospitalized patients, the incidence of MPV annually ranged from 4.4 to 13.2 %. More than 85 % of the hospitalized MPV-infected subjects had underlying conditions, chiefly cardiopulmonary disease or diabetes mellitus. There were six deaths in this study, all with comorbidities; one had concomitant bacteremia with
