<p>MPV has been implicated in several hospital and institutional outbreaks leading to mortality [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR278">278</xref>]. Kim and colleagues [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR279">279</xref>] report the transmission of MPV to pediatric hematology-oncology patients during a nosocomial outbreak. The incubation period was between 7 and 9 days. Standard, but not droplet, precautions were used. In laboratory studies, infectious virus persists on metal and nonporous surfaces for up to 8 h [
