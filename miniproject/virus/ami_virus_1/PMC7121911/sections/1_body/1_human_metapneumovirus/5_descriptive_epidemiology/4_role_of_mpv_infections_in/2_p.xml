<p>A prospective, population-based study in Nashville, TN, recruited adults hospitalized for ARI at several county hospitals over three winters [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">248</xref>]. Of 508 subjects, 23 (4.5 %) had MPV, 33 (6.5 %) influenza, and 31 (6.1 %) RSV. Notably, MPV-infected subjects were significantly older than influenza-infected subjects (mean 76 vs. 60 years) and had higher rates of chronic cardiopulmonary disease (78 % vs. 52 %). The overall population-based rates of hospitalization for the three viruses were similar, at 1/1,000 for MPV, 1.5/1,000 RSV, and 1.2/1,000 for influenza. However, for subjects â‰¥65 years, hospitalization rates were much higher for MPV and RSV at 2.2/1,000 for MPV and 2.5/1,000 for RSV compared to 1.2/1,000 for influenza, likely reflecting the use of influenza vaccine for older adults. A prospective study of community-acquired pneumonia in Canada found MPV in 4 % of hospitalized cases during an 18-month period, all with underlying conditions [
