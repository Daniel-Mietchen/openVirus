<p>It is unclear whether viruses from different subgroups differ in virulence. A study in Spain reported that children with group A infection more frequently had pneumonia and higher disease severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR309">309</xref>], while in Canada, group B was associated with more severe disease in hospitalized patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR261">261</xref>]. Patients with group B strains in a French study were more likely to have abnormal chest radiographs but did not have significant differences in oxygen saturation, hospitalizations, or clinical severity scores [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR310">310</xref>]. Other studies have found no major distinctions in disease severity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR241">241</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR311">311</xref>], laboratory abnormalities [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR228">228</xref>], or symptoms [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>] between subgroups. Group A viruses replicate more efficiently in animal models, suggesting some meaningful biological differences between groups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>].
