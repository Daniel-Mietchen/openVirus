<p>MPV was discovered by investigators in the Netherlands who cultivated specimens from children with respiratory infection on a variety of cell types [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. A hitherto unknown virus produced cytopathic effects (CPE) in tertiary monkey kidney cells, but could not be identified by antibody staining or RT-PCR for common viruses. Electron microscopy of infected cells revealed pleomorphic enveloped particles with surface projections suggesting protein spikes, while biochemical experiments showed that the virus contained a lipid envelope and did not hemagglutinate avian or mammalian red blood cells. Elegant randomly primed RT-PCR experiments yielded multiple fragments of genome, which sequence analysis identified as related to avian metapneumovirus (AMPV).
