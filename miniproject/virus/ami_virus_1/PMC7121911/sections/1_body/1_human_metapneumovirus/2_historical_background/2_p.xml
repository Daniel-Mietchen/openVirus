<p>AMPV (formerly turkey rhinotracheitis virus), identified in 1979, is an important global pathogen of poultry including turkeys and chickens [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">177</xref>]. There are four serotypes of AMPV (Aâ€“D), and MPV is most closely related genetically to AMPV-C [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis shows that MPV likely diverged from AMPV-C ~200 years ago and thus MPV is of zoonotic origin [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>]. However, MPV exhibits extremely restricted or no replication during experimental infection of chickens or turkeys and thus is a true human pathogen [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">176</xref>]. Human poultry workers exhibit serological evidence of asymptomatic infection with AMPV, providing evidence for the feasibility of an original trans-species transmission event [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">181</xref>].
