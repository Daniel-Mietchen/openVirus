<p>Detection in cell culture requires prolonged incubation and is both insensitive and often impractical. Shell vial culture offers increased sensitivity over traditional culture [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">184</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR328">328</xref>]. IFA has demonstrated a sensitivity of 73 % and specificity of 97 % with RT-PCR as the gold standard [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR330">330</xref>]. Commercial antibody kits for immunofluorescent detection of MPV are available. RT-PCR is most commonly used for detection of the virus in epidemiologic studies and is becoming more common in clinical laboratories [
