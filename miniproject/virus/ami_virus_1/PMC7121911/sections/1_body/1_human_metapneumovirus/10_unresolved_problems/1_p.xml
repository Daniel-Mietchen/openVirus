<p>The major unresolved problems in MPV epidemiology and research involve understanding mechanisms of disease and developing therapeutic or preventive strategies. Abundant evidence shows that MPV is a significant cause of acute respiratory disease, especially in the very young, older adults, and persons with underlying conditions. As with all mucosal viruses, the short incubation period of MPV combined with the transient nature of mucosal IgA means that reinfection is possible throughout life. However, serum IgG appears to offer protection against severe lower respiratory involvement, and thus a vaccine would likely ameliorate the most severe cases. The best candidate vaccine is not yet clear. Further, MPV has as yet unidentified mechanisms to subvert host immunity. Elucidation of these pathways might help guide vaccine development and uncover novel host targets for immunomodulation.</p>
