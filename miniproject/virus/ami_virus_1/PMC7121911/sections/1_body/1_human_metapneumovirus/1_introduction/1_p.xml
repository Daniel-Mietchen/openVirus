<p>Human metapneumovirus (HMPV, MPV) is a paramyxovirus isolated in 2001 from Dutch children with acute respiratory infection (ARI). Epidemiologic studies have since confirmed that MPV is a leading cause of upper and lower respiratory infection in children and adults worldwide. MPV causes many hospitalizations annually in young children and presumably deaths in developing nations. Children with comorbid conditions including prematurity, immune compromise, and chronic cardiopulmonary disease are at higher risk for severe disease. However, the majority of MPV-associated hospitalizations occur in otherwise healthy infants and children. Conversely, while MPV is associated with severe lower respiratory infection in adults at rates similar to those of influenza virus and RSV, almost all of the MPV infections in this population are in patients with comorbidities. MPV causes predictable annual outbreaks with late winter-early spring predominance in temperate regions. Substantial progress has been made in defining the biology, pathogenesis, and immunology of the virus. Small animal and nonhuman primate models of MPV have been developed and used to elucidate mechanisms of immunopathogenesis and test candidate vaccines. A variety of vaccine approaches against MPV are under study, including recombinant subunit, vectored, and live-attenuated vaccines. Human and murine monoclonal antibodies have been generated that exhibit potent in vivo efficacy in rodent models. A subset of integrins with a binding site for a natural ligand that contains an Arg-Gly-Glu (RGD) motif (RGD-binding integrins) has been identified as receptors that mediate MPV attachment and entry via an RGD motif in the MPV fusion protein. Remarkable scientific progress has been made during the decade since the discovery of MPV.</p>
