<p>The two major surface proteins are the fusion (F) and attachment (G), with a third integral membrane short hydrophobic (SH) protein. F is the target of neutralizing antibodies in animal models, F-only vaccines induce protection in animals, and F-specific monoclonal antibodies provide passive protection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR214">214</xref>]. Thus, it appears that MPV is unique among human paramyxoviruses in that the attachment protein does not contribute to protective antibodies. Further, the G protein exhibits a high degree of genetic variability between subgroups, with as low as 29 % amino acid identity between the major A and B subgroups and a minimum 60 % identity within subgroups [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR218">218</xref>]. The selective pressure for this diversity is unclear.
