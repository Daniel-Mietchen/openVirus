<p>Cross-neutralization against heterologous virus from the A and B lineages was tested using experimental infection of ferrets [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>]. This study found relative neutralization of homologous to heterologous virus ranging from 12 to 96-fold difference, thus providing some evidence for antigenic serotypes. However, subsequent experiments using hamsters, African green monkeys, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques found that the A and B groups were 64–99 % related antigenically [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR219">219</xref>]. Infected animals developed neutralizing antibodies that were highly effective against heterologous virus, and previously infected primates were protected against challenge with heterologous virus. Cynomolgus macaques infected with A or B subgroup viruses or with candidate vaccines exhibited only a 6–16-fold difference in neutralizing titer against homologous and heterologous viruses [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR221">221</xref>]. Taken together, these data show that while MPV F exhibits some antigenic diversity, the virus does not have truly distinct serotypes. The potential implications for human epidemiology are discussed further below.
