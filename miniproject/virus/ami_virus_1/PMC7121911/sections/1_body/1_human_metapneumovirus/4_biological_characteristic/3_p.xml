<p>In contrast to G, the F protein is conserved, with a minimum 94 % amino acid identity between A and B subgroups and a minimum 98 % identity within subgroups [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR179">179</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR202">202</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. Presumably there are functional constraints on the diversity of F, since the mutation rate of MPV is high, similar to other RNA viruses. The major question regarding the diversity between major or minor subgroups is whether it contributes to antigenic variation or escape in human populations.
