<p>MPV is an enveloped pleomorphic virus ranging in size from 150 to 600 nm, containing a single-stranded negative-sense RNA genome [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>]. Complete genomic sequences of numerous MPV strains have been published [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR178">178</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR180">180</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR197">197</xref>]. The genome comprises eight separate open reading frames encoding nine distinct proteins (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">26.1</xref>). MPV genes are analogous to those of RSV (though NS1 and NS2 are absent in MPV), but the organization of genes differs. AMPV and MPV have been taxonomically classified in the separate 
 <italic>Metapneumovirus</italic> genus based on the gene order. Phylogenetic analysis of MPV genes consistently identifies four genetic clades, two major groups designated A and B, each with two minor groups designated A1, A2, B1, and B2 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR198">198</xref>â€“
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR203">203</xref>]. One group has suggested further sublineages based on partial F sequence diversity [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR204">204</xref>], but there is no evidence that this further genetic distinction is of any antigenic or immunologic importance.
