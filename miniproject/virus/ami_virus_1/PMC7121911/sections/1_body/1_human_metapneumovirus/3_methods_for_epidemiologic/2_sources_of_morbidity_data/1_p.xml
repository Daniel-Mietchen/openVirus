<p>A substantial body of literature has accumulated in the last decade describing the epidemiology, disease burden, and clinical features of MPV. Many groups have used standard techniques to provide some estimate of the burden of MPV in diverse populations. Most reports have been cross-sectional studies of selected populations, usually based on convenience samples of patients with acute respiratory illness. These studies are thus limited by potential selection bias, narrow time periods, and incomplete demographic or clinical data and often lack controls. Nonetheless, the broad application of these studies to sizable global populations has illuminated the frequency of MPV infection. Many of these studies have focused on special populations, such as patients with asthma, immune compromise, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and thus offer valuable information about MPV among these persons.</p>
