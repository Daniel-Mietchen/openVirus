<p>Seroprevalence studies using diverse methods have been performed in different populations. Most have used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques against whole virus or purified proteins to detect IgM or IgG. A few have used immunofluorescent detection of MPV-specific antibodies or measured serum virus-neutralizing antibodies. These data have mainly been useful in determining the ubiquity of infection with MPV. Some studies have measured acute and convalescent sera to diagnose MPV infection, while others have attempted to establish a serum neutralizing titer that correlates with susceptibility to infection. Inherent limitations of serological surveys include the potential for cross-reactive antibodies and the lack of standardized reagents for MPV.</p>
