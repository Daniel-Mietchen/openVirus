<p>A number of prospective, well-designed studies in adults and children have been published and offer the best estimates of the population-based incidence of MPV infection. Some of these used preexisting prospective data and samples collected prior to the discovery of MPV for retrospective analysis. Classical methods including active day care and clinic surveillance, as well as newer approaches such as home surveillance with parent-collected swabs, have been used. These studies have been built upon the foundations of seminal longitudinal studies conducted to investigate other viruses including influenza, parainfluenza viruses, and RSV. Taken together, these reports provide a broad survey of MPV epidemiology across diverse geographic environments, socioeconomic populations, and high-risk groups.</p>
