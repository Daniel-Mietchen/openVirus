<p>Most studies have used RT-PCR to detect MPV due to the difficulty in cultivating the virus. The original isolation of MPV in tertiary monkey kidney cells was possible because the investigator had access to a monkey kidney cell source that was free of the endogenous simian foamy virus (A.D.M.E. Osterhaus, personal communication). Primary monkey kidney cells commercially available in the USA all contain SFV, and even the addition of anti-SFV antisera cannot prevent the growth of this endogenous virus prior to the slow emergence of MPV. Further, the fusion protein of MPV requires cleavage by exogenous trypsin for robust in vitro growth. Trypsin is added by most clinical virology laboratories only to cultures of Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for the isolation of influenza virus; however, MDCK cells are very poorly permissive for MPV even in the presence of trypsin. Finally, primary isolation of MPV often requires one or more passages prior to visible CPE and few laboratories routinely follow this procedure. Unlike RSV, MPV is not particularly labile to freeze-thaw cycles [
