<p>Limited mortality data are available and consist of sporadic case reports, case series, or the identification of fatal cases of MPV infection in research studies. MPV is not a reportable infection and there is no specific ICD-9 diagnostic code. Thus, an accurate estimate of the mortality associated with MPV is not feasible. However, lower respiratory infections are a leading cause of death in children worldwide, primarily in developing nations. MPV is a common cause of severe lower respiratory infection and thus likely accounts for a substantial number of deaths globally.</p>
