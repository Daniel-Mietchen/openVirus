<p>Thus, molecular diagnostic techniques have been used for virtually all studies of MPV epidemiology. A number of sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assays have been described [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR195">195</xref>]. Many early assays were based on limited sequence data and subsequently were found to be suboptimal for detecting multiple diverse strains [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR196">196</xref>]. Another limitation of molecular detection for all viruses is the ability to detect low levels of viral nucleic acid in the absence of infectious virus. It has become common to detect more than one virus in a single specimen, and the interpretation of these data is far from clear. Community respiratory viral infections are frequent in childhood, and the likelihood of detecting viral genome prior to the onset of illness or for prolonged periods after illness resolution complicates the assignment of causation to one of several co-detected viruses.
