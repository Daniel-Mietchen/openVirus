<p>The primary therapy for MPV infections is supportive care, including oral or intravenous hydration, monitoring of respiratory status and oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen, and mechanical ventilation for frank respiratory failure. There are no licensed antivirals for MPV. Reports of pharmacologic treatment of MPV are limited to severely ill or immunocompromised patients. Ribavirin, an antiviral agent used in severe RSV infection, reduced inflammation and viral replication in mice with MPV infection [
