<p>Human data are limited; studies in rodents and nonhuman primates reveal mild erosive and inflammatory changes in the mucosa and submucosa of the airways, with viral replication observed in ciliated epithelial cells in the respiratory tract [

Histopathology in three patients demonstrated acute, organizing lung injury with diffuse alveolar membrane formation and the presence of smudge cells. The fourth patient had no evidence of lower respiratory tract infection, and the fifth patient had nonspecific acute and chronic inflammation. A similar study in children revealed chronic inflammatory changes of the airways with intra-alveolar macrophages [
