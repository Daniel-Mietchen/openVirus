<p>Humans develop neutralizing antibodies to MPV, and passive antibodies alone can protect in animal models. However, immunity wanes over time and likely provides limited cross-protection between subgroups, since reinfections occur in children and adults [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR246">246</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR248">248</xref>] with genetically different strains [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">182</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR239">239</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR240">240</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR268">268</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR320">320</xref>] as well as strains from the same subgroup [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR280">280</xref>]. Early protection against reinfection following primary infection was confirmed in macaques; however, when challenged 12 weeks later, virus replication was detectable despite the presence of serum antibodies [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. Eleven months later, antibody levels had waned still further, and all macaques challenged with heterologous virus and two of three animals reinfected with homologous virus had no evidence of protection [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR220">220</xref>]. A prospective study in humans noted that baseline MPV antibodies were lower in patients who subsequently became infected versus those who did not become infected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR321">321</xref>]. Thus, cross-protection and duration of antibody responses are important issues for vaccine development.
