<p>MPV lacks genes present in other paramyxoviruses that inhibit interferon responses; nevertheless, MPV is capable of blocking type I interferon responses by an unknown mechanism [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR318">318</xref>]. MPV and other respiratory viruses induce pulmonary CD8+ T cells that fail to secrete IFNÎ³ or exhibit cytotoxic degranulation in response to viral peptides; these impaired CD8 T cells resemble exhausted CD8 T cells induced by chronic infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus [
