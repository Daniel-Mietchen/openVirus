<p>Total RNA from the cells was isolated by using Nucleospin RNA isolation Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and the cDNA was synthesised using PrimeScript RT reagent kit (Takara) by following the manufactures’ protocol. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on ViiA 6 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) using SYBR Green Select Master Mix (Life Technologies) and predesigned KiCqStart primers for mentioned caspases and cathepsins (Sigma-Aldrich). The primers for human beta-actin were 5′-GACGACATGGAGAAAATCTG-3′ (Forward) and 5′-ATGATCTGGGTCATCTTCTC-3′ (Reverse) [
