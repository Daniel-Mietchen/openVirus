<p>Considering all these IAV characteristics, it will be practically impossible to eradicate IAV from the nature. Therefore, it is critical to comprehensively understand the influenza virus-host molecular interactions to develop alternative and effective anti-influenza strategies. Recently, we have identified a role of host protein named cortactin in IAV infection [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Cortactin is a ubiquitously-expressed protein and is expressed in most eukaryotic cells [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B9-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Named after its cortical intracellular distribution and binding to actin [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], cortactin is a central regulator of branched filamentous actin network [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], which maintains cell shape and integrity and is critical for many cellular functions such as cell motility, migration and invasion, and membrane trafficking including endocytosis. Due to its role in cell migration and invasion, cortactin is associated with various types of cancers, and overexpression of cortactin is used as a biomarker for cancer progression [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In addition, cortactin has also been associated with the infection of various bacterial and viral pathogens [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Originally identified in phosphorylated form and as a substrate of Src tyrosine kinase, cortactin is now known to be a substrate of multiple kinases, and phosphorylation plays a central role in cortactin functions [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In addition, cortactin is also known to undergo acetylation [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], which regulates its binding to filamentous actin. We have found that cortactin promotes IAV infection, but undergoes degradation by lysosome-associated caspases in infected cells [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00087" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This was the first such observation, and the mechanisms and significance of the involvement of cortactin during IAV infection is not entirely clear. Herein, we present the data that provide further insight into the mechanism of cortactin degradation and its significance during IAV infection.
