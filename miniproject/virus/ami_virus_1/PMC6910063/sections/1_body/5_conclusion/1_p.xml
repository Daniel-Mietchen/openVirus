<p>Indirect immunofluorescence has acceptable performance, however, for clinically relevant situations, when diagnosing acute infection (detection of IgM antibodies), ELISA alone is sufficient for serologic diagnosis, and the use of an additional method is not warranted. Replacing ELISA with indirect immunofluorescence, in turn, could compromise diagnostic sensitivity, increasing the number of false-negative samples for IgM.</p>
