<p>We used 200 serum samples from routine testing at the Clinical Laboratory of 
 <italic>Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein</italic> (HIAE), collected in 2014 and sent to the laboratory due to clinical suspicion of infection by the dengue virus. Samples were characterized at the time as negative or positive for dengue virus using ELISA (Foccus, USA). All samples were tested with the BIOCHIP
 <sup>Â®</sup> mosaic IIF technique (Euroimmun, Germany).
