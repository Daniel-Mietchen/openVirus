<p>In samples for which the two methods were discordant, we used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) as a confirmatory diagnostic method. Polymerase chain reaction is a molecular assay which quantitatively detects DENV RNA, and is considered the gold standard, since it can effectively prove that the virus is present in the body. However, it has limitations, including its high cost, which prevents it from being routinely used for screening in laboratories.
