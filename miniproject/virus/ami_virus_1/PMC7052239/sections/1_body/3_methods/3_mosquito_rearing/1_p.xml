<p id="Par25">The paddles were allowed to dry at room temperature for 3–4 days, assessed for the presence of eggs under a stereoscope and placed individually in plastic trays containing 500 mL of water and ground fish food (Tretramin®) for larval hatching. All larvae in the L4 stage were identified and separated by species (
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> or 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>). Pupae were placed individually in small glass containers, and after the adults emerged they were killed by freezing and separated by species, season and sex into pools of 10 individuals, which were placed in 1.5 mL polypropylene microtubes. All 573 pools were kept at −80 °C until used to isolate DENV.
