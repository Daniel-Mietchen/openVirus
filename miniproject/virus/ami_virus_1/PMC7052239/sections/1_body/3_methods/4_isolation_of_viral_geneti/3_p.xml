<p id="Par28">The target sequence of the viral RNA was initially converted to cDNA by reverse transcriptase (RT) and then amplified using the consensus primers D1 and D2 and SuperScript® III One-Step RT-PCR with Platinum® Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, California, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol: 30 minutes at 50 °C and 2 minutes at 94 °C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94 °C, 15 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s) and extension (72 °C, 30 s). Semi-nested PCR was then performed using GoTaq Green Master Mix 2 ×(Promega, USA) and the following cycling conditions: 25 cycles of denaturation (95 °C, 30 s), annealing (60 °C, 30 s) and extension (72 °C, 1 min). RNA from the four DENV serotypes and ultrapure water were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. Bands were visualized under UV light on a 2% agarose gel stained with 5 μL of Gel-Red (Biotium). For double confirmation, all samples showing positive bands were reanalyzed from the extracted RNA using only the oligonucleotides specific to the serotype detected.</p>
