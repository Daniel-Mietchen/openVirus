<p id="Par29">The resulting PCR products were purified with Exosap-IT (GE) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The purified DNA was then sequenced by the Sanger method using the Big Dye Terminator Sequencing Kit (ABI) and DENV serotype specific primers (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) in the ABI 3100 Automated DNA Sequencer (ABI). The double-stranded DNA fragments were sequenced in both directions to generate a consensus double-stranded sequence for each sample. Editing, analysis and alignment of the nucleotides were conducted using version 6.0.7 of Bioedit Sequence Alignment Editor. All nucleotide sequences were aligned using ClustalW
