<p id="Par21">As urban parks are open to the public, infected visitors can contribute to the expansion of several arboviruses. Furthermore, the continuous contact between humans, competent vectors and viruses make these parks high-risk areas for infection by DENV and other arboviruses, raising the question of the relevance of urban green areas in the transmission and maintenance dynamics of arboviruses
