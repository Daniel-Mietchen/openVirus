<p id="Par14">Here, we report natural vertical transmission of DENV in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> for the first time in the city of São Paulo. Specifically, DENV-3 was detected in two pools of male 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>. To date, only three studies have demonstrated natural vertical transmission of DENV-3 in Brazilian populations of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, one in the state of Minas Gerais
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>
 </sup>, another in the state of Ceará
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>
 </sup> and another in Santos (a coastal city in the state of São Paulo)
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>
 </sup>. Despite both DENV-3 positive samples of males of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> showed differences in nucleotide sequences, they exhibited high identity with strains found in the city of Guarujá, SP, Brazil, and Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil, whereas the sequence of the positive control showed similarity with strains of the city of Ribeirão Preto, SP. The differences found between the three sequences indicate that the positive samples were not products of laboratory contamination.
