 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S3</xref>). In fact, DENV-3 circulation was detected in the city of São Paulo in 2010

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>
 </sup>, but this serotype was not identified in this area during the epidemic of 2014
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>
 </sup>. This strengthens the hypothesis that vertical transmission could help maintain viral circulation during interepidemic periods and suggests that there is silent circulation of DENV-3 in green areas of São Paulo, a city with no detected autochthonous cases of infection by this serotype.
