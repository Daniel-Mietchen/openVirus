<p id="Par4">The most common way mosquito females become infected with an arbovirus is by blood feeding on a viremic host, which is known as horizontal transmission

While in endemic areas the ability of DENV to persist in the environment during periods that are unfavorable for horizontal transmission or when there is a low mosquito density is not clearly understood, there are indications that vertical transmission is an important maintenance mechanism for DENV circulation during these periods

 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic>, respectively, under laboratory conditions
