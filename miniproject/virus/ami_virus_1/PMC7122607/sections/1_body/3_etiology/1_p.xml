Noroviruses (NoVs) and rotaviruses (RVs) of group A are the leading causes of viral gastroenteritis. Sapoviruses (SaVs), astroviruses (AsVs), and enteric adenoviruses (AdVs) are other important causes. Candidate agents for whom etiologic relationship has not yet been confirmed are coronaviruses, picobirnaviruses, pestiviruses, toroviruses, and echovirus type 22.
