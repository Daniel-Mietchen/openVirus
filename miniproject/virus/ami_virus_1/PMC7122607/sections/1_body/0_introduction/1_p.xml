According to the World Health Organization (WHO), diarrheal diseases account for 4.1 % of the total DALY global burden of disease of which 88 % is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation, and hygiene. Several waterborne outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis have been reported throughout the world, which may be of particular importance since these outbreaks have the potential to involve large numbers of people and wide geographic areas and, perhaps, to introduce new variants to an area. Here, we have briefly described the viral causes of diarrhea.
