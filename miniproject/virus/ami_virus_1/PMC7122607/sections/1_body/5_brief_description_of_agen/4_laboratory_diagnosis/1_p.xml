    <italic>Agglutination Test:</italic> For detection of adenovirus proteins in stool, latex agglutination tests are available. Though these tests may be useful for diagnosing enteric adenoviruses, they may give false-positive results with nonenteric adenoviruses and are less sensitive and nonspecific extracts of stool can cause a high number of invalid tests.

    <italic>Electron Microscopy:</italic> Noncultivatable enteric adenoviruses can be detected in stool extracts by electron microscopy.

    <italic>ELISA:</italic> Few commercial immunoassays are available for the detection of adenovirus antigen in stool samples. It is the test of choice to detect adenoviruses 40 and 41 in stool (Gleaves et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">1993</xref>). Monoclonal antibodies can be used in both ELISA or IF format for differentiating serotypes 40 and 41 from other adenoviruses.

    <italic>Cell Culture:</italic> Since enteric adenoviruses are difficult to grow in conventional cell lines used for respiratory adenoviruses, these have been referred to as noncultivatable adenoviruses, though these may be cultivated in alternate tissue culture host cell systems, for example, Graham 293 cells.
