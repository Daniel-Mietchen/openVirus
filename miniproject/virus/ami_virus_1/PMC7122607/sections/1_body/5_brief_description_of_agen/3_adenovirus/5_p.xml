 <italic>Epidemiology</italic>: Adenovirus infections occur worldwide and in humans and in a variety of animals. Adenovirus causes 5 % of all infectious diseases in infants and 3 % in the age of 2–4 years (Pacini et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1987</xref>). It is known that adenovirus is the second common agent in infantile gastroenteritis, after rotavirus (Blacklow and Greenherg 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1991</xref>). Faeco-oral transmission is the most important route of transmission in young children. Initial spread can occur by the respiratory route, but feces are a more common source of transmission because prolonged secretion after acute infection occurs through the gastrointestinal tract and the virus is shed both during the acute illness and then intermittently thereafter (Fox et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">1969</xref>). Also, these viruses have been reported to be nosocomially transmitted.
