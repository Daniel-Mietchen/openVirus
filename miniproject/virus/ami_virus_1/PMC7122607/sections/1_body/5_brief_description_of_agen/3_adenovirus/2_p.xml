 <italic>Structure</italic>: Virions are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles, about 70–90 nm in diameter, and contain a linear 36-kb double-stranded DNA core complex. The outer capsid is composed of 252 capsomeres which are of two main types: hexon capsomeres, 240 in number and form most of the capsid surface, and penton capsomeres, 12 in number, one at each vertex of the icosahedron. Pentons contain a penton base, and a projecting fiber, composed of three domains, an N-terminal domain that binds to the penton base, a central shaft important for infection, and a globular C-terminal knob that binds the primary receptor on host cells. Most of the epitopes recognized by group- and serotype-specific antibodies are present on the hexon and fiber proteins.
