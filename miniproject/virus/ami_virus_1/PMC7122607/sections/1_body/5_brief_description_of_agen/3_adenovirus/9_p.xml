 <italic>Clinical features</italic>: The predominant symptom of infections with enteric adenoviruses is watery diarrhea, with a mean duration of 8.6 days (Ad40) and 12.2 days (Ad41) accompanied by fever and vomiting (Van et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1992</xref>). Few children with Ad41 infections may experience prolonged symptoms (greater than or equal to 14 days). A low frequency of respiratory symptoms has also been reported (21 %) (Uhnoo 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1984</xref>). The established adenoviruses may present a different clinical picture, characterized by diarrhea of shorter duration, higher fever, and significantly increased occurrence of respiratory symptoms.
