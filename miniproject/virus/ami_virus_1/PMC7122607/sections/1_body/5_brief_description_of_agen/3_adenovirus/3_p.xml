 <italic>Classification</italic>: Adenoviruses were first isolated from febrile military personnel with a variety of respiratory illnesses, when they were called ARD agents. Since then, four genera have been identified in adenoviruses that cause infection in a variety of hosts.

These six species are further divided into 51 serotypes based on their nucleic acid characteristics and homologies, hexon and fiber protein characteristics, and biologic properties (Jong et al.
