<p>Human coronaviruses have occasionally been implicated in enteric disease, particularly in newborns (Gerna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1985</xref>). The evidence for human coronavirus in enteric disease is primarily based on visualization of coronavirus-like particles (VLPs) by electron microscopy, plus some reports of isolation of virus from children with enteric disease (Gerna et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1985</xref>; Payne et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1986</xref>; Resta et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">1985</xref>). Because other particles in stool specimens (e.g., cellular membranes) can have similar morphology to coronaviruses, electron microscopic detection of coronavirus particles in stools is not diagnostic of infection.
