<p>These viruses are 30–40 nm in diameter and have icosahedral symmetry with triangulation number (T) equal to 3. These have a bisegmented, double-stranded RNA, and the length of the two parts of the genome is 1.7 and 2.5 kb. The capsid protein gene is encoded by the second open reading frame of the larger genomic segment (Chandra 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">1997</xref>). Although the virus has been detected mainly from the stools of gastroenteritis patients and several mammals and birds, the pathogenicity of the virus has not been established.
