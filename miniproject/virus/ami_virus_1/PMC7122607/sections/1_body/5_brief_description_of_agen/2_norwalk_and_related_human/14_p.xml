 <italic>Laboratory diagnosis</italic>: Currently available diagnostic tools cannot detect all the caliciviruses in single, because of genetic and antigenic diversity. The various tools available are as follows:

    <italic>Electron Microscopy</italic>: It is of limited value in routine diagnosis of NV because particles are usually present in low concentration and may be difficult to distinguish from other round, small objects present in stool. Also, the timings of stool collection are important; samples that are collected within 72Â h of onset of diarrhea have the greatest yield. The sapoviruses are easier to detect; these have a Star of David appearance, that is, a six-pointed star with a dark hollow in the center.

    <italic>Immunoassays</italic>: Human calicivirus recombinant virus like particles rVLPs has been produced by expression of capsid proteins in baculovirus vectors. Hyperimmune antisera and now monoclonal antibodies are prepared against these VLPs which are employed in the development of ELISAs that can detect viral antigens in clinical specimens. Few diagnostic kits are commercially available.

    <italic>RT</italic>-PCR: This is the most widely used technique for the detection of noroviruses in clinical samples like feces or vomitus, and contaminated food, water, or fomites. Quantitative real-time PCR has gained importance because it allows rapid detection as well as comparison of viral RNA levels.
