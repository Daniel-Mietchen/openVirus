<p>Caliciviruses have a linear, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome (ranging from 7.3 to 8.5 kb in length) that is organized into two or more ORFs, depending on the genus. All caliciviruses encode a relatively small ORF near the 3′ end that encodes the minor structural protein, VP2. The nonstructural proteins are encoded toward the 5′ region in ORF one and the structural proteins toward the 3′ end of genome. The norovirus and vesivirus have separate ORFs (ORF2) for VP, whereas in sapovirus and lagovirus, the first ORF codes for the nonstructural proteins as well as the capsid protein, which is found in-frame at the end of the nonstructural proteins (Fig.
