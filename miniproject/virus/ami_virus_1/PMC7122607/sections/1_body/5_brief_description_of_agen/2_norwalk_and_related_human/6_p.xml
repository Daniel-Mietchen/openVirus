 <italic>Viral proteins</italic>: 
 <italic>Structural</italic>: Caliciviruses have three structural proteins, the features of which are listed in TableÂ 
 <xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">4.6</xref>. 
 <italic>Nonstructural</italic>: Caliciviruses derive their mature nonstructural proteins by proteolytic cleavage of a large polyprotein encoded in ORF1 that has the viral RNA polymerase (NS7), helicase (NS3), and protease functions (NS6) (Jiang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">1993</xref>). The norovirus and vesivirus have five cleavage sites to produce six mature proteins (NS1 to NS6), while lagovirus and sapovirus have six cleavage sites to produce seven mature proteins (NS1 to NS7). The function of rest of the nonstructural proteins is unknown. Replication cycle is not fully known. Proposed replication cycle is shown in Fig 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">4.5</xref>.
