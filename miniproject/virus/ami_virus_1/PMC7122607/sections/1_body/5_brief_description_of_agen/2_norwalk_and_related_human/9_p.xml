<p>Incubation periods are generally 24–48 h, though it ranges from 18 to 72 h. Virus shedding in stools is maximal over the first 24–48 h after illness. Virus can be rarely detected beyond 72 h after the onset of vomiting or diarrhea by immunoelectron microscopy. However, virus can be detected for up to 3 weeks after resolution of illness using sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay techniques (Graham et al.
