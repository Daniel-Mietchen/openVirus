 <italic>Immunity</italic>: Studies in human volunteers have shown that there are two forms of immunity to noroviruses: one is short term and the other is long term. Short-term immunity is protective, that is, serotype specific and protects against the infecting strain. While long-term immunity deviates from the traditional pattern; persons with higher levels of pre-existing antibody to NV are more susceptible to illness. Specific ABO, Lewis, and secretor blood group phenotypes may also influence susceptibility to NV.
