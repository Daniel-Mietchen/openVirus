 <italic>Classification</italic>: Initially, the acute gastroenteritis viruses were classified on the basis of morphology. For example, NV was the prototype of a group of agents initially called small round-structured viruses (SRSVs). Later, based on molecular biology, most SRSVs were placed in the family Caliciviridae. Family Caliciviridae is now divided into four genera—Norovirus, Sapovirus, Lagovirus, and Vesivirus. Within each genus, species have been defined based on genetic relatedness. For species Norwalk virus (genus Norovirus) and species Sapporo virus (genus Sapovirus), based on relatedness of VP1, capsid protein genogroups have been proposed which are further classified into genotypes (Atmar and Estes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">1994</xref>), most common strains implicated in human disease fall into genogroups GI and GII (Patel et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2009</xref>). The GI genogroup includes the Norwalk virus, whereas the Snow Mountain and Hawaii viruses belong to genogroup GII. Individual strains are designated by Arabic numeral after the genogroup designation: for example, GI.1 (Norwalk) or GII.1 (Hawaii).
