 <italic>Structure</italic>: The Calicivirus virions exhibit icosahedral symmetry. The virions have a single major capsid protein folding into 90 dimers to form a shell domain from which capsomeres protrude that are arch like. These arches are arranged in a way that 32 cup-shaped depressions are visible by electron microscopy, from where the caliciviruses derive their name (Latin: calyx means cup). The Norwalk virus, prototype of calicivirus is nonenveloped, small (27–40 nm), and round virus (Prasad and Rothnagel
