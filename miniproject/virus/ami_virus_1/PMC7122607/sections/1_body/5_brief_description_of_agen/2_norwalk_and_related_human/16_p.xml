    <italic>Outbreak prevention</italic>: Outbreak prevention should be situation specific, such as control of contamination of food and water, reduction in person–person spread by frequent hand washing, and effective environmental decontamination with disinfectants like hypochlorite at 5,000 ppm, hydrogen peroxide–based cleaners, and phenolic-based cleaners.

    <italic>Vaccines</italic>: A role of rVLPs has been suggested as a subunit vaccine. NV VLPs produced in plants have undergone a phase I clinical trial in adult volunteers by the oral route, when they were found to be safe and immunogenic (Tacket et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2003</xref>). Alphavirus vectors, such as Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) (Ball et al. 
    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1999</xref>) virus, are also being tried for norovirus vaccine development. If a vaccine is feasible, it could reduce the incidence of epidemic viral gastroenteritis and would be of special importance to military personnel, nursing home residents, and malnourished infants.
