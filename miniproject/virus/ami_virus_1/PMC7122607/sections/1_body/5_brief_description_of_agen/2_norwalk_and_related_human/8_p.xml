<p>Transmission of calicivirus occurs predominantly by the faeco-oral route, though vomitus (Chadwick and McCann 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1999</xref>) has also been implicated as a vehicle of transmission. The predominant modes of spread are person-to-person contact and food- or waterborne spread. Aerosolization and contamination of surfaces by infected individuals can also lead to exposure.
