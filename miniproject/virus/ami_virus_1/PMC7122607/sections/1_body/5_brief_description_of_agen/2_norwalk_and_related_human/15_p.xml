 <italic>Treatment</italic>: Not generally required because the disease is self-limited. Symptomatic treatment of headache, myalgias, and nausea with analgesics and antiemetics may provide relief. If severe dehydration develops, oral or intravenous therapy is indicated. Bismuth subsalicylate, loperamide, anticholinergic agents, adsorbents, or lactobacillus containing compounds are not recommended.
