 <italic>Clinical features</italic>: The calicivirus gastroenteritis is generally mild and self-limiting that usually lasts 24–48 h, though prolonged infection may be seen in immune-compromised individuals. After an incubation period of around 24 h, the disease has a sudden onset with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, headache, chills, myalgia, or sore throat. Vomiting is more prevalent than diarrhea in children, whereas reverse is true in adults. The stools are typically loose and watery and do not contain mucus and leukocytes or red blood cells. Severe dehydration may occur in predisposed individuals like elderly patients with debilitating health conditions.
