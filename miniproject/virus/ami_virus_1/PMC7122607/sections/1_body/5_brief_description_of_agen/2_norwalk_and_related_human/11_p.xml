 <italic>Pathogenesis</italic>: Reversible histopathologic lesions appear in the small intestine within 24 h after virus challenge like broadening and blunting of villi, shortening of microvilli, vacuolization of the lining epithelium, crypt hyperplasia, and infiltration of lamina propria by lymphocytes and polymorphs. These changes are present during illness and persist for a variable period of time after the illness. The histopathologic changes generally clear within 2 weeks after the onset of illness, although some jejunal changes can be noticed as late as 6 weeks after challenge. Diarrhea induced by the Norwalk virus is associated with a transient malabsorption of D-xylose and fat and with decreased levels of brush border enzymes, including alkaline phosphatase and trehalase. Susceptibility to infection with certain norovirus strains has also been associated with the presence of H blood group carbohydrate antigens, which are also expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells (Hutson et al.
