 <italic>Epidemiology</italic>: Noroviruses and sapoviruses have a worldwide distribution. Infections occur round the year, although the incidence tends to peak during cold weather months in temperate climates. Noroviruses have been associated with infection in all age groups, although most gastroenteritis outbreaks involve mainly older school-aged children and adults. In pediatric populations, importance of noroviruses may be second to that of rotaviruses. Sapoviruses on the other hand are primarily associated with pediatric gastroenteritis, which rarely needs hospitalization. A few outbreaks have been documented due to sapoviruses. Noroviruses are the single most important cause of gastroenteritis outbreaks and account for more than 90 % of outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis and for about 50 % of all-cause outbreaks worldwide (Patel et al.
