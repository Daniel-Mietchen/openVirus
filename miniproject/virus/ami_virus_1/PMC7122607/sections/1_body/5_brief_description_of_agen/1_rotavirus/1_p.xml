 <italic>Structure</italic>: The mature virions are about 100 nm in diameter, are nonenveloped, and possess a triple-layered icosahedral protein capsid composed of an outer layer, an intermediate layer, and an inner core layer. The capsid contains all enzymes for mRNA production. The genome consists of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, each segment codes for at least one protein. The segmented genome allows genetic reassortment during dual infections of cells or susceptible hosts, producing reassortants of mixed parentage which is a source of viral diversity (Estates and Kapikian
