 <italic>Clinical manifestations</italic>: Rotavirus gastroenteritis is more frequently associated with dehydration than is gastroenteritis by other pathogens. The clinical spectrum of rotavirus infection varies from subclinical illness to severe gastroenteritis and potentially fatal dehydration. The illness has an abrupt onset, with vomiting lasting 1–2 days, followed by loose, watery diarrhea that lasts for approximately 5 days, and the stools rarely contain red or white cells. Up to one-third of patients may have a temperature of &gt;39 °C.
