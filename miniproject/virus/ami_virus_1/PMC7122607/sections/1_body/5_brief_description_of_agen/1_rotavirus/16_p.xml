   <p> Virus Isolation: Human rotaviruses can be isolated in cell culture, although this is a slow and laborious process. The cell culture medium must be supplemented with proteases like trypsin or pancreatin. Cell lines in which rotaviruses can be isolated include primary simian kidney cells, intestinally derived cell lines like human colon adenocarcinoma cell line CaCo
    <sub>2</sub>, and MA104.

   <p>Direct examination by electron microscope: It is now not used routinely but can be of use for detecting nongroup A rotaviruses and mixed infections with other enteric viruses.</p>

   <p>Antigen detection: Rotavirus immunoassays are predominantly based on ELISA or latex agglutination principles and use either monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies. The commercial ELISA kits can have a sensitivity and specificity of up to 98 and 100Â %, respectively. Monoclonal G- and P-serotype-specific antibodies to rotaviruses are also commercially available in ELISA format to type the most frequent human rotavirus strains.</p>

    <italic>Identification of dsRNA by RNA-PAGE</italic>: Viral RNA from a specimen can be directly subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then differentiated on the basis of characteristic patterns of bands by silver staining, referred to as electropherotypes. This is of limited potential today, but appearance of an unusual electropherotype could denote a novel strain or a nongroup A virus.

    <italic>PCR</italic>: It is the most sensitive method for detecting group A, B, and C rotaviruses. RT-PCR can be done directly from stool samples and can also be used for P genotyping.
