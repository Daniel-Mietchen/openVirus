<p>The incidence of rotavirus serotypes has varied by geographic location and time. Gene segments that encode the G- and P-proteins can segregate independently. This gives rise to strains with at least 42 different P–G serotype combinations. Of the different serotypes of group A rotavirus identified, only 5 types (G1 through G4 and G9) are common; recently, G8 strains have emerged as important strains in parts of Africa. The four predominant P–G combinations, P[8]G1, P[4]G2, P[8]G3, and P[8]G4, comprise 88.5 % of the strains worldwide (Santos and Hoshino

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2011</xref>) but not in other parts of the world. Group C rotaviruses have been associated with a small proportion of pediatric cases in several countries worldwide (Oseto et al.

Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network (ARSN) performed the first phase of data collection in nine countries and regions over a 2-year period during 2001–2003, when it was known that rotavirus was responsible for overall 45 % diarrhea admissions in the region. G1 was the commonest strain in Hong Kong (49 %) and Vietnam (47 %), G9 in Korea (39 %), Taiwan (37 %), and Thailand (55 %), while G3 was the commonest in China (67 %) (Nelson et al.
