<p>Live, orally administered neonatal human rotavirus strains have been explored as vaccine candidates because they appear to be naturally attenuated. Two naturally occurring human-bovine rotavirus reassortants obtained from asymptomatically infected newborns in Delhi (116E) and Bangalore (I321) have undergone clinical trials. The former has 10 human rotavirus genes and a single gene segment encoding VP4 derived from a bovine rotavirus, whereas the latter has two human rotavirus nonstructural genes and nine bovine rotavirus genes (Glass
