 <italic>Epidemiology</italic>: Worldwide, nearly all children are infected with rotavirus by 3–5 years of age. In developing countries, the incidence of rotavirus diarrhea has varied between 0.07 and 0.8 episodes per child per year (Bresee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>). The incidence is similar in developed countries, implying that this infection cannot be effectively controlled by improvement in sanitation and hygiene. Incidence of disease peaks among children 4 to 23 months of age, but illness in adults is also known. Neonatal infections are often asymptomatic because of protection from maternal immunity, while infections after 3 months of age are more likely to be symptomatic. Reinfections of rotavirus are common, but disease severity decreases with each repeat infection. Therefore, depending on the epidemiologic setting, the proportion of children with rotavirus diarrhea varies, for example, a median of 8 % of all cases of diarrhea in the community, 28 % of outpatient visits, and 34 % of hospitalizations are accounted for by rotavirus infections (Bresee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999</xref>).
