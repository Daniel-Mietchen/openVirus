 <italic>The viral proteins, structural and nonstructural</italic>: Rotavirus has six structural proteins (VP1 to VP4, VP6, and VP7) and six nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to NSP6). The innermost protein shell consists of VP2, arranged in an icosahedral lattice. The VP1 polymerase and VP3 capping enzyme are anchored inside the VP2 shell. The middle layer consists of VP6, which forms thick trimeric pillars in an icosahedral lattice. VP6 is the target of the most abundant antibodies elicited by rotavirus infection, though this antigen is not exposed on the viral surface. The outermost layer consists of a coat glycoprotein VP7 and VP4 spikes, which protrude from the virion. (Estates and Kapikian 2007). The details of the proteins are shown in TableÂ
