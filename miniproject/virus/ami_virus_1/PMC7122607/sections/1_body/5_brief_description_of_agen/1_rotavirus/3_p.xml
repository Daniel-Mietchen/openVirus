 <italic>Classification</italic>: There are seven major groups of rotavirus (A through G); group A and, to a lesser extent, group B and group C are primarily responsible for human gastroenteritis. Group specificity of rotaviruses is determined by the internal structural protein, viral protein 6 (VP6) which is the target of commercial immunoassays (Tang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">1997</xref>). Within each group, rotaviruses are classified into serotypes on the basis of two outer capsid proteins, VP7 (G-protein/glycoprotein) and VP4 (P-protein/protease-sensitive protein) which induce neutralizing antibodies, on the basis of which a binary serotyping system has been developed. Till date, 15 VP7 or G serotypes have been identified. VP4 is a protease-cleaved protein, and serotypes determined by this protein are termed P serotypes. Due to a lack of readily available typing serum or monoclonal antibodies to different VP4 types, 26 different genotypes of VP4 have been identified based on sequence analysis of VP4. These genotypes correlate well with known serotypes, so the genotypes are mentioned in brackets (e.g., P1A[8]) (Estates and Kapikian
