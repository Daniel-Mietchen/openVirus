 <italic>Immunity</italic>: Rotavirus-specific secretory IgA antibodies in the intestine appear only for a short duration during acute infection. These are correlated with a temporary protection against rotavirus disease, and therefore, reinfections with rotaviruses are common. During the acute phase, these antibodies are directed principally against VP2 and VP6 which broaden to include other proteins during the convalescent phase. Serum IgM antibodies also appear during the acute phase which is later replaced by IgG and, to a lesser extent, by IgA antibodies.
