 <italic>Treatment</italic>: Rotavirus disease spontaneously resolves within 1–2 weeks, but to prevent dehydration, appropriate therapy should be instituted early. In children who can take oral fluids, standard hydration solution recommended by the World Health Organization is the therapy of choice. If oral rehydration fails, if the patient is severely dehydrated or patient cannot tolerate oral fluids because of vomiting, intravenous fluids must be administered. Therapeutic role of probiotics, bismuth salicylate, and enkephalinase inhibitors like racecadotril is at present considered to be at an experimental stage. Antibiotics and antimotility agents should be avoided. Early refeeding after rehydration of children is recommended. In chronic symptomatic rotavirus infection in immunocompromised children, orally administered immunoglobulins or colostrums might be considered.
