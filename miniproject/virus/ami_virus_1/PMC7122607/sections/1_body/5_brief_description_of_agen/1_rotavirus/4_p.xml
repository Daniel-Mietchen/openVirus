 <italic>Replication cycle</italic>: Many aspects of replication cycle of rotavirus remain uncertain. The entire cycle occurs within the cytoplasm. The intestinal trypsin enzyme cleaves the rotavirus spike protein VP4 into an amino-terminal fragment, VP8, and a carboxy-terminal fragment, VP5. The VP8 fragment contains a hemagglutination domain, and the VP5 fragment contains a membrane interaction domain. Rotavirus enters the cells using several cell surface receptors. When intracellular calcium concentrations fall, rotavirus virions uncoat, forming double-layered subviral particle (DLP). DLPs are transcriptionally active particles composed of genome, VP1, VP3, and the inner two protein layers, which are assembled in viral factories termed 
 <italic>viroplasms</italic>. The dsRNA transcribes mRNA, the newly transcribed rotavirus mRNA enters two pools, mRNA that remains sequestered within viroplasms is replicated to produce negative-strand RNA which remains associated with the positive strand, while mRNA that escapes viroplasms is translated. The dsRNA segments formed within nascent subviral particles mature by budding through the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, when particles acquire their outer capsid proteins (Mendez et al.
