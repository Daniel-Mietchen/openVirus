 <italic>Pathogenesis</italic>: The astroviruses are confined to mature epithelial cells near the villous tip in jejunum. No inflammation is associated with astrovirus infection. HAstVs have the ability to induce apoptosis in cultured cells. Astrovirus infection may result in decreased intestinal disaccharidase activity and subsequent osmotic diarrhea. Many other mechanisms may be used by these viruses to produce the disease.
