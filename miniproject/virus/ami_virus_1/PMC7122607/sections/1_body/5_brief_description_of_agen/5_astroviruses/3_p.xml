 <italic>Classification</italic>: Astroviruses have been isolated from humans and from a variety of animals and birds. Astroviruses are classified into two genera: Mamastrovirus, which infect mammals including humans, and Avastroviruses, which infect avian species. Human astroviruses (HAstVs) have been classified into eight serotypes, 1 to 8 on the basis of immunofluorescence and plaque neutralization assays, and by immunoelectron microscopy using hyperimmune sera against different culture-adapted strains. Genotypes defined by the amino acid sequence of the carboxyl-terminal region of the structural polyprotein correlate well with the eight HAstV serotypes that have been described (Mendez and Arias
