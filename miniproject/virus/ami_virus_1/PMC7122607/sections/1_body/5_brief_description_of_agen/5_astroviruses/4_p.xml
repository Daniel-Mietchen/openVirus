 <italic>Epidemiology</italic>: Astroviruses were found in less than 1 % of children with diarrhea when less sensitive assays such as electron microscopy were used for diagnosis. The prevalence increased to 2.5–9 % among patients hospitalized with diarrhea, when more sensitive assays like monoclonal antibody assay, enzyme immunoassays, and real-time PCRs were developed (Glass et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1996</xref>). Human astrovirus infections occur worldwide (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab8" ref-type="table">4.8</xref>), and infants and young children are most commonly affected, although adult population may also become infected. The incubation period for astrovirus disease is 1–5 days, and illness lasts 1–5 days in the immunocompetent host, although protracted diarrhea has been associated with serotype 3 strains (Caballero et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2003</xref>). The main route of transmission of astroviruses is faeco-oral, though person-to-person spread, waterborne spread, and fomites have also been implicated in outbreaks of gastroenteritis.
