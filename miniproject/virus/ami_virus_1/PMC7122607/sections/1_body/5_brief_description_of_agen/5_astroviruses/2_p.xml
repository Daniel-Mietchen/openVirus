 <italic>Structure</italic>: Astroviruses are 28–30 nm particles with a smooth margin and a characteristic five- to six-pointed star on the surface (Greek: astron means star) as seen by electron microscope. These are nonenveloped and show icosahedral symmetry. Capsid consists of three proteins of approximately 30 kDa size, which are produced by proteolytic cleavage of a large polypeptide. The genome consists of positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of approximately 7.2 kb, is polyadenylated, and has both 5′ and 3′ nontranslated regions (NTR). It contains three ORFs, ORF1a, and ORF1b codes for nonstructural proteins, protease, and the RNA-dependent polymerase, respectively, while ORF2 encodes capsid proteins (Smits et al.
