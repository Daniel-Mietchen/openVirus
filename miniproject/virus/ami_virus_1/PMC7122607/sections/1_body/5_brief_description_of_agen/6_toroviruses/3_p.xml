<p>The virus has been associated with gastroenteritis in horses (species Berne virus), cattle (species Breda virus), pig (species equine Torovirus), and probably humans (species Human Torovirus). A study from Canada demonstrated an association between torovirus excretion and nosocomial gastroenteritis in pediatric patients. Toroviruses were identified in 72 (35.0 %) of 206 gastroenteritis cases compared with 30 (14.5 %) of 206 controls (P &lt; 0.001). Persons infected with torovirus were more frequently immunocompromised and nosocomially infected and experienced less vomiting and more bloody diarrhea than did those with rotavirus or astrovirus infection. An antibody response to torovirus was seen in more than half of the patients with torovirus in stool (Jamieson et al.
