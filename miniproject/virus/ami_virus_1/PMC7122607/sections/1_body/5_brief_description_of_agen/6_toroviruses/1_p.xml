<p>Toroviruses are 100–140 nm, enveloped viruses of family Coronaviridae that have a single-stranded, positive-sense linear RNA about 28 kb in size, capped, and polyadenylated. The tubular nucleocapsid is tightly coiled into an open torus or donut shape and hence the name “torovirus.” The particles have a fringe of peplomers on their surface that are about 10 nm long. The virion RNA is infectious and serves as both the genome and viral messenger RNA. Genomic RNA encodes for ORF1a, and ORF1b is translated by a frame-shifting mechanism. Resulting proteins pp1a and pp1ab are processed into the viral polymerase (RdRp) and other nonstructural proteins involved in RNA synthesis. Structural proteins are expressed as subgenomic RNAs.</p>
