<p>Till 1970s, the etiology of gastroenteritis remained unknown in most of the cases. In 1972, Kapikian et al. (

In 1973, rotavirus was identified in the duodenal mucosa of children with diarrhea by Bishop et al. using electron microscopy. Later, in 1975, astroviruses were described by Madeley and Cosgrove in the stools of infants hospitalized with diarrhea and in outbreaks of gastroenteritis in newborn nurseries (Madeley and Cosgrove
