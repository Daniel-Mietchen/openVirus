<p>Waterborne viral gastroenteritis is defined as an illness that occurs after consumption or use of water intended for drinking. Contamination of underground water may occur as a result of leakage from septic tanks, flooding after heavy rainfalls, and back siphoning through a cross-connection between a well and a septic tank. Runoff water after heavy rainfall may contaminate surface water sources (Hedberg and Osterholm

Human fecal wastes contain the viruses, and their numbers and distribution in sewage-polluted waters depend both on the burden of viral disease in the population and on the availability of municipal sewage treatment processing like filtration or chlorination of water supply.
