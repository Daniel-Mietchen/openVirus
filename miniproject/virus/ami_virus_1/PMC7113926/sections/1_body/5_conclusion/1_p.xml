<p>To conclude, the clinical profile of the dengue fever cases is changing in different epidemics, even in the same regions and with the period of time. Primary care physician should have a high index of suspicion to detect and timely manage the atypical manifestations of dengue fever as they are no more a rare entity and will continue to rise so long as they are looked for carefully in dengue patients. This study thus indicates the need for a continuous seroepidemiological surveillance for the early and definite identification of the clinical features and atypical manifestations of dengue infection.</p>
