 <xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Retro-orbital pain as a cardinal feature of dengue fever was seen in few (4%), of our patients, while Denys EF 
 <italic>et al</italic>. had reported 16.1%.[
 <xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Burning micturition (8%), hemoptysis (2%), and rashes (0.2%) were not frequent in our study when compared with other studies.[
 <xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Hepatomegaly is highly specific for the development of both dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome. In our study, 31 (7%) patients had hepatomegaly which correlates with a previous study done by Row EK 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In our study, splenomegaly was 5% which is concordant with a previous study reported by Anurag Prasad 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Other less common atypical manifestations were bradycardia [18 (4%)], meningitis [6 (1.2%)], hemoptysis [5 (1%)], acalculous cholecystitis [4 (0.8%)], and acute [pancreatitis 2 (0.4%)]. This differs from other studies where bradycardia, meningitis, hemoptysis, and acalculous cholecystitis were detected in higher percentage of confirmed dengue fever.[
