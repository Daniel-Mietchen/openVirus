<p>Out of 2038 samples of clinically suspected dengue cases, 464 (23%) were found to be positive by ELISA. The majority of the samples were found positive for NS1 antigen 290 (63%), which indicates high sensitivity of the test for early diagnosis of disease, followed by IgG and IgM antibodies, which is similar to a study conducted by Anand 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] In our study, thrombocytopenia was present in 179 (39%) patients &lt;150,000/mm
 <sup>3</sup>, which is slightly less than the study conducted by Ahmed NH 
 <italic>et al</italic>. Recent studies have established HCT &gt; 40% as a prognostic factor for severe dengue.[

 <xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] In our study, we have found raised HCT in 29 (6.2%) patients. Low leucocyte count may be due to virus-induced inhibition of myeloid progenitor cells or due to destruction.[
 <xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] We found that 11% had leucocyte count &lt;5000, almost similar to a study by Chaloemwong J 
 <italic>et al</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] An understanding of the course of disease progression, risk factors, recognition of the warning signs, and look out for clinical problems during the different phases of the disease will enable primary care physicians to manage dengue fever in an appropriate and timely manner to reduce morbidity and mortality.[
 <xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] Primary care physician should impart health education about dengue fever to the rural community regularly, through health camps or interpersonal communication based on health awareness programs.[
 <xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] Thus, atypical presentations should prompt us to investigate for dengue especially during ongoing epidemics so that primary care and management is very important in preventing expanded dengue syndrome.
