<p>Dengue, a common mosquito-borne viral disease, occurs in tropical and subtropical countries especially South and Southeast Asia countries, the Caribbean, Central, and South America, and Africa. Dengue virus (DENV) infection is the most rapidly spreading disease in the world with a 30-fold increase in incidence in the past 50 years.[
 <xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The first dengue fever in India was reported in 1956 from Vellore and the first dengue hemorrhagic fever occurred in Calcutta in 1963.[
 <xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Dengue is caused by one of the four serotypes of DEVN (DENV-1â€“DENV-4) belonging to the family 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] All the four serotypes of the virus have been in circulation and documented in Tamil Nadu.[
 <xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Dengue fever is an acute febrile illness with frontal headache, retro-ocular pain, muscle pain, joint pain, and rash, even though other signs and symptoms could also be present (such as lymphadenopathy, petechiale, nausea, hepatomegaly, and different types of hemorrhagic manifestations).[
 <xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Atypical manifestations are rare and include encephalopathy, encephalitis, seizures, hepatocellular damage, acalculous cholecystitis, myocarditis, pericardial effusion, and severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage.[
 <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] The clinical presentation in dengue depends on the virus strain, as well as the age and immune status of the host.[
 <xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] This study aims to elucidate the salient clinical feature and laboratory findings of serologically confirmed cases of dengue fever. The elucidation of clinical profile is very important for primary care, management, and thus crucial for saving life.
