<p>We were able to recover the complete genome of all viruses from reactions containing on average 10
 <sup>5</sup>, 10
 <sup>4</sup> and 10
 <sup>3</sup> viral copies per reaction both in Illumina- and in MinION-based sequencing (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Note that classical Sanger sequencing would also be possible given the overlap between amplicons. The median viral load reported from patients during the large West-African epidemic in 2014–16 corresponded to ca 10
 <sup>3</sup> viral copies/µL of plasma (interquartile range: 10
 <sup>2</sup>–10
 <sup>6</sup>) [

Because we successfully typed ebolavirus genomes from comparable amounts of cell culture supernatant, the sensitivity of our assay is likely to be compatible with viral loads in most patients, including chiefly symptomatic patients who have relatively higher viral loads than asymptomatic cases [
