<p>During the large West African EBOV outbreak in 2014-16, primer schemes enabling PCR-based full genome characterisation were not available until late in the course of the epidemic (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), partly because of the time necessary to develop and validate suitable assays in the laboratory. In addition, the ability to transfer those protocols between groups remained unclear because most viral genomes produced from that outbreak were obtained by different groups using different protocols containing complex multiplexed PCR reactions and optimised for distinct deep sequencing platforms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, deep sequencing platforms may not produce sufficient numbers of viral reads from some clinical samples without genomic pre-amplification or target enrichment [
 <xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], mainly because the amounts of viral nucleic acid are small compared with the hostâ€™s own nucleic acid in clinical samples [
 <xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. This can result in a lack of genomic coverage to conduct robust genomic surveillance, which is necessary for diagnostic test development, elucidation of transmission chains and monitoring of mutations potentially affecting ebolavirus pathogenesis or transmissibility [
 <xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,
 <xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Advanced diagnostics for emerging viruses such as EBOV are thus urgently needed to support outbreak response in Europe and beyond [
