<p>The reviewers additionally questioned our decision to model these dynamics in a frequency vs. density-dependent context. We feel this assumption was well supported in the current context because plaque assays restrict transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two dimensional space, thus limiting the number of possible infectious contacts for a single cell at all timesteps, in keeping with frequency-dependent dynamics. Intriguingly, because dead cells occupy space in our model, however, this has the effect of reducing the transmission rate in a density-dependent fashion: declines in susceptible and infectious cell density are realized dynamically as declines in their proportions where dead cells fill their place and do not contribute to epidemic dynamics. This effect makes the mean field model more generalizable to the level of the entire organism.</p>
