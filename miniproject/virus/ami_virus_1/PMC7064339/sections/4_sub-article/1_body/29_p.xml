<p>In a simple, density-dependent model with no recovery from infection, R
 <sub>0</sub> will be written as βN/(α + μ), indicating that the pathogen is unable to spread at low population densities. Though our transmission rates are cell-to-cell frequency-dependent, our model is really density -dependent as a result of the inclusion of dead cells as a state variable and, therefore, has cell density thresholds for pathogen invasion. In the supplementary material of this manuscript, we derive the equation for Ps at disease free equilibrium, which is equal to (b-μ)(c+μ)b(c+μ+ε). This configuration of Ps is incorporated into our equation for R
 <sub>0</sub> because a pathogen will not be able to invade a tissue with too high an initial proportion of dead cells (
 <italic>P
  <sub>D</sub>
 </italic>) relative to live cells (
 <italic>P
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic>). Under conditions of no constitutive immunity (ε=0), this equation for 
 <italic>P
  <sub>S</sub>
 </italic>reduces to (b-μ)b which then surfaces in the equation for R
 <sub>0</sub>. Because our system of differential equations was constructed including birth rates, the birth and death rates are incorporated in the formulation of the susceptible proportion at DFE. Thus, a monolayer with a higher death rate than birth rate will be composed of completely dead cells at DFE and, therefore, not be invadable by a pathogen.
