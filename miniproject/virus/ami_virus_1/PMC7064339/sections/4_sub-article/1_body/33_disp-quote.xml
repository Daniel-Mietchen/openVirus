 <p>13) The Discussion should make clear that the question of whether bats in general have constitutively active intracellular immunity is far from resolved. As touched on in the Introduction, this partly depends on definition – does constitutive expression of e.g. interferon-α actually provide constitutive protection? What about other immune genes which seem to be defective (e.g. Xie et al., 2018)? More generally, the immune systems of only a very small fraction of bat diversity (and of non-lab animals in general) has been studied, so it remains unclear how well we can generalise to all bats, or whether bats are truly unusual relative to other wild animals. Where possible the authors should list examples of studies showing constitutive immunity specifically in the species (or close relatives of these) thought to be reservoirs for the highly virulent viruses discussed.</p>
