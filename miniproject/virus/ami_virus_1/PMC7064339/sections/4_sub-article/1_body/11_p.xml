<p>“(a) We hypothesized that model fitting would demonstrate the most significant role for top-down immune processes in bat cell lines described as constitutively antiviral in the literature. We further predicted that the most robust antiviral responses would (b) be correlated with the most rapid within-host virus propagation rates while (c) protecting cells against virus-induced mortality to support the longest enduring infections in tissue culture.”</p>
