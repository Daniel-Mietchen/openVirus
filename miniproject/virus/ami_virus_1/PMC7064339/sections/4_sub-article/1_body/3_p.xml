<p>Finally, in response to your questions above, we have largely relegated the spatial model to the supplementary materials and are here using it only to validate and visualize results from our mean field model fitting. The mean field model demonstrates all of our key takeaway messages from this manuscript, with the added benefit of being generalizable to the whole organism when considered theoretically in our bifurcation analysis. However, since our data (in plaque assay) are spatial, we felt that it was important to simulate the dynamics in a spatial context as well. We find that, in doing this, our key takeaways are reaffirmed and validated. We retain the spatial stochastic videos in our supplementary text because they clearly illustrate how the epidemic wave ‘washes over’ antiviral refugia, which can become infected at later timepoints to sustain transmission. This pattern is seen in the mean field model as well (Figure 5, main text, and Figure 5—figure supplements 1 and 2) but much easier to interpret when visualized spatially.</p>
