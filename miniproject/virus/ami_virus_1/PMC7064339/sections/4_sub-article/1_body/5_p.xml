<p>In the newest version of the manuscript, the original Figure 4 is now Figure 1, showing the fitted infectious time series to these data. In response to this comment, we attempted to fit several versions of the model that incorporated only the natural mortality rate (fitted for each cell line) and the epidemic dynamics of each time series, with no birth rate included in the model. However, these versions of the model were unable to re-capture the extended time series witnessed in the rVSV-EBOV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines, using fitted mortality (μ) and incubation (σ) rates and a fixed, standard infection-induced mortality rate (α= 1/6). Thus, cell turnover was needed in order to recapture the data.</p>
