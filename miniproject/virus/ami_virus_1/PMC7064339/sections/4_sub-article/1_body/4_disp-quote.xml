 <p>2) Another key question the authors should consider is whether the data in Figure 4 really support (or even need) the cell turnover embedded within the formulation of the model? Could the main point of the paper be more clearly made by fitting simpler models more consistent with the short time frame of the experimental data, and concentrating on the initial infection spread and sometime declines, rather than a scenario requiring cell turnover? If the cell cultures were capable of maintaining infection over the longer term, why weren't the experiments run over longer time frames to demonstrate this?</p>
