<p>“Critically, we found that – as hypothesized – (a) bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which (b) allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates (β). These results were supported by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture. Additionally, we (c) demonstrated how the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration and an enhanced probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection.”</p>
