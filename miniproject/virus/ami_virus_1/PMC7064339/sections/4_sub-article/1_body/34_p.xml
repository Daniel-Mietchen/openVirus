<p>Great point â€“ and thank you! We agree that this issue is far from resolved, and, in fact, we believe that our results largely support the opposite conclusion: that constitutive IFN expression functions more like a primed, inducible defense than a constitutive, functional antiviral protein. We have emphasized this debate in the Introduction as well as discussed it in the Results and in the Discussion.</p>
