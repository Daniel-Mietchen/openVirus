<p>Monolayers of each cell line were grown to 90% confluency (~9×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells) in 6-well plates. Cells were maintained in a humidified 37 °C, 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator and cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY), supplemented with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gemini Bio Products, West Sacramento, CA), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies). Cells were tested monthly for mycoplasma contamination while experiments were taking place; all cells assayed negative for contamination at every testing.
