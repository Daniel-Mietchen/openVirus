<p>We undertook qPCR of cDNA to assess expression of the type I interferon genes, IFN-α and IFN-β, and the housekeeping gene, β-Actin, using primers previously reported in the literature (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>). For qPCR, 2 µl of each cDNA sample was incubated with 7 µl of deionized water, 1 µl of 5 UM forward/reverse primer mix and 10 µl of iTaq Universal SYBR Green, then cycled on a QuantStudio3 Real-Time PCR machine under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of: denaturation at 95 °C (5 s), annealing at 58 °C (15 s), and extension at 72 °C (10 s).
