<p>The birth rate, 
 <italic>b,</italic> and natural mortality rate, μ, balance to yield a population-level growth rate, such that it is impossible to estimate both 
 <italic>b</italic> and μ simultaneously from total population size data alone. As such, we fixed 
 <italic>b</italic> at. 025 and estimated μ by fitting an infection-absent version of our mean field model to the susceptible time series derived via Hoechst staining of control wells for each of the three cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). This yielded a natural mortality rate, μ, corresponding to a lifespan of approximately 121, 191, and 84 hours, respectively, for Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>). We then fixed the virus incubation rate, σ, as the inverse of the shortest observed duration of time from initial infection to the observation of the first infectious cells via fluorescent microscope for all nine cell line – virus combinations (ranging 6 to 9.5 hours). We fixed α, the infection-induced mortality rate, at 1/6, an accepted standard for general viral kinetics (

 <italic>c,</italic> the rate of antiviral cell regression to susceptible status, at 0 for the timespan (&lt;200 hours) of the experimental cell line infection trials.
