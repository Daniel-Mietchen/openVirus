<p>We next fit our theoretical model by least squares to each cell line-virus combination, under absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions of immunity. In general, best fit models recapitulated expected outcomes based on the immune phenotype of the cell line in question, as described in the general literature (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The absent immune model offered the most accurate approximation of IFN-deficient Vero cell time series, the induced immune model best recovered the RoNi/7.1 cell trials, and, in most cases, the constitutive immune model most closely recaptured infection dynamics across constitutively IFN-α-expressing PaKiT01 cell lines (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Ironically, the induced immune model offered a slightly better fit than the constitutive to rVSV-MARV infections on the PaKiT01 cell line (the one cell line-virus combination for which we know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play). Because constitutive immune assumptions can prohibit pathogen invasion (
