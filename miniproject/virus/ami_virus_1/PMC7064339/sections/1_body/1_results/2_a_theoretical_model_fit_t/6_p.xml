<p>At equilibrium, the theoretical, mean field model demonstrates one of three infection states: endemic equilibrium, stable limit cycles, or no infection (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Respectively, these states approximate the persistent infection, virus-induced epidemic extinction, and immune-mediated epidemic extinction phenotypes previously witnessed in tissue culture experiments (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Theoretically, endemic equilibrium is maintained when new infections are generated at the same rate at which infections are lost, while limit cycles represent parameter space under which infectious and susceptible populations are locked in predictable oscillations. Endemic equilibria resulting from cellular regeneration (i.e. births) have been described

 <italic>in vitro</italic> for herpesvirus plaque assays (
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Howat et al., 2006</xref>), but, because they so closely approach zero, true limit cycles likely only occur theoretically, instead yielding stochastic extinctions in empirical time series.
