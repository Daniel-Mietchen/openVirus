<p>This paper is an excellent example of how in vitro models of cell-virus interactions can be used to shape and formulate more general and larger-scale hypotheses about epidemiological dynamics. In this case, the choice of bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes enables estimates of different viral propagation rates. The results suggest that if bat cells do have greater constitutive immunity, this could lead to situations in which viruses that do propagate in bats will do so with much greater vigour (and possibly virulence and transmissability) should they 'spill-over' into non-bat hosts. The paper should be of wide general interest to those with interests in emerging disease dynamics and to quantitative biologists interested in the mathematical modelling of in vitro systems.</p>
