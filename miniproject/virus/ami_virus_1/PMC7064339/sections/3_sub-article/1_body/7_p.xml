<p>There is a view that bats (both as individuals and populations) are able to maintain a large number of virus species (often with little or no pathology) that are highly pathogenic outside of this order, and this paper seeks mechanistic reasons for why this might be. Specifically the authors set out to explore whether this might be due to uniquely constitutive immune capabilities of bat cells. To explore this hypothesis, the authors study the dynamics of 3 strains of vesicular stomatitis virus that express different sorts of glycoprotein, in 3 different cell cultures: Vero (non-bat cells with limited antiviral capabilities); Egyptian Fruit Bat cells which demonstrate an idiosyncratic induced interferon response, and Black Fruit Bat cells which constitutively express interferon. Well-mixed and imperfectly-mixed frequency dependent models of the infection dynamics are fitted to the means of these replicated time-series, and the models constructed to reflect the possibly differential anti-viral capabilities of the cell lines. The parameter estimates from the model fitting process lead to the key conclusion that 'induced immune responses favor slower cell-to-cell transmission rates (a proxy for viral replication rates) [â€¦] while constitutive immunity amplifies cellular transmission rates, in conjunction with less rapid antiviral responses.' The authors further conclude that '[i]f hosts with constitutive immune defenses favor evolution of rapidly transmitting viruses, such pathogens are likely to cause extreme virulence in spillover hosts lacking similarly constitutive defenses'.</p>
