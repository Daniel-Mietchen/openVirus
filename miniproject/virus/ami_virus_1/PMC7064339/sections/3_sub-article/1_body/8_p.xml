<p>One reviewer indicates that if the paper has set out to answer the question as to whether the immune phenotype of bats alters the capacity for viruses to persist within them, the answers are not sufficiently clear to merit publication in 
 <italic>eLife</italic>. This is an understandable point of view: it seems that none of the best-fitting well-mixed models are constitutive, and only one of the spatially explicit models is constitutive where we might expect it to be (and one where we wouldn't expect it to fit best). However, I have decided to go with the majority view and provide an opportunity for revision, but the authors should consider carefully whether the essential points below can be met (or convincingly rebutted).
