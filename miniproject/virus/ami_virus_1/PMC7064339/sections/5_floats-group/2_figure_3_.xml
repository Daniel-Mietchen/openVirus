  <title>Two parameter bifurcations of the mean field model, showing variation in the transmission rate, β, against variation in: (
   <bold>A</bold>) the induced immunity rate of antiviral acquisition (ρ) and (
   <bold>B</bold>) the constitutive immunity rate of antiviral acquisition (

     <mi>ε</mi>
    </math>
   </inline-formula>).
  </title>
  <p>Panels show variation in the extent of immunity, from absent (left) to high (right). Branch point curves are represented as solid lines and Hopf curves as dashed lines. White space indicates endemic equilibrium (persistence), gray space indicates limit cycling, and black space indicates no infection (extinction). Other parameter values for equilibrium analysis were fixed at: 
   <italic>b</italic> = .025, μ = .001, σ = 1/6, α = 1/6, 
   <italic>c</italic> = 0. Special points from bifurcations analyses are listed in
