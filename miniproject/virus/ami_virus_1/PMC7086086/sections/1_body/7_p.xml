<p>Korea is now experiencing significant outbreaks and became the most-affected country after China.
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Nation's biggest clusters have connections to Shincheonji religious group in Daegu. Another worrisome cluster has been linked to the patients hospitalized in Daenam Hospital in Cheongdo.
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Viral tests are being run on massive scales in Korea. Thus, we may be able to diagnose more pediatric cases compared to other countries and have a unique opportunity to define the clinical features of COVID-19 in the pediatric population and the role of children in the transmission in child-care settings, schools and the community. Starting from several imported cases from Wuhan in January 2020, subsequent human-to-human transmissions occurred initially among their close contacts and family members. However, as the community spreads progress, we will see more cases among children. Among 3,526 confirmed cases, as of March 1, 2020, 164 children and adolescents under 20 years of age were diagnosed with COVID-19, comprising approximately 4.7% of the total confirmed cases.
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> The percentage of the confirmed child cases in Korea is higher than that in China and has risen from 1.5% to 4.7% in just one week. These findings are worrisome. It is well known that children contribute to the community spread of seasonal influenza by introducing influenza to the family and by disseminating influenza in the community.
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> To mitigate community spread of COVID-19, all school closures are justified in the current situation in Korea. To provide a scientific evidence for the effectiveness of school closures, we should not miss the opportunity to learn children's role in spreading SARS-CoV-2 to the community.
