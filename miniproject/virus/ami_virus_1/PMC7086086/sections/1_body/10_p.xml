<p>This 10-year old girl is the first pediatric case of COVID-19 in Korea. As this is only a single case, we cannot say much about clinical manifestations of childhood COVID-19 and viral load as a whole but can provide a model to pediatricians on which samples to test and what to consider in caring for children with COVID-19.
