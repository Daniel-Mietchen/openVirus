<p>Very little research on COVID-19 in children has been published in China or elsewhere. Most of the COVID-19 cases in children resulted from close contacts with COVID-19 cases or were found among family cluster cases.

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Most of the infected children had mild or difficult to recognize symptoms and some were even asymptomatic. Fever and cough were the most common symptoms, and some had runny nose, or gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, or vomiting. All of the cases improved, and no deaths have been reported so far.
