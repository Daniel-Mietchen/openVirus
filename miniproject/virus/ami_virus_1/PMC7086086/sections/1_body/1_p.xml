<p>Within one month of the first case of COVID-19 in Korea, a 10-year-old girl, who had no travel history outside Korea, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on February 18, 2020. The exposure history and self-quarantine method is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>. The patient lived with her mother, father, and cousin in a multiplex housing unit, and her uncle and aunt lived upstairs. The patient's uncle, who ran a store in Wuhan, arrived in Korea on January 20, 2020, and had self-quarantined in his room from January 29, 2020. During quarantine period, he broke self-quarantine by having meals with his family members. On February 1, 2020, her uncle was confirmed with COVID-19 and was hospitalized in a designated hospital. From February 2, 2020, self-quarantine was resumed by the remaining five family members. Although the patient's father, aunt and cousin stayed in separate rooms, the patient shared the same room with her mother. On February 5, 2020, her mother was confirmed with COVID-19. Because the patient closely contacted her uncle and her mother, she was screened for COVID-19, and three screening tests for severe acute respiratory syndrome severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were all negative on day 1 and day 4 since her uncle's diagnosis (February 1) and day 2 from the last exposure (February 5) to her mother. She remained well without subjective symptoms until the 13th day from the last exposure when she developed slightly elevated temperature of 37.3Â°C, which led to a confirmed diagnosis of her COVID-19 on February 18, 2020. A small amount of sputum for the previous three days was later reported. No other symptoms such as diarrhea or vomiting were reported.
