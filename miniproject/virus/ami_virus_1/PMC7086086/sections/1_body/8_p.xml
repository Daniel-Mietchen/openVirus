<p>It is interesting to note that although this case had mild symptoms only, patchy or nodular consolidations with peripheral ground glass opacities were observed on chest CT. A recent study in China analyzed the CT images of 15 children with COVID-19, 10 of whom were asymptomatic and 5 had fever.
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Among the 15 children, pulmonary inflammatory lesions were observed in 9. Small nodular ground glass opacity was the most common finding and subpleural patchy opacities were also observable, with all lesions limited to a single lung segment. Adults generally have ground-glass and consolidative opacities in both lungs at chest CT.
