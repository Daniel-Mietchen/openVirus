<p>On admission, she was not dyspneic nor cyanotic with a body temperature of 37.7°C. Initial laboratory results were as follows: white blood cell count 4,080/μL (37.3% lymphocytes), hemoglobin 13.5 g/dL, platelet count 251,000/μL, and C-reactive protein &lt; 0.40 mg/dL. Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2 (

Because the RT-PCR was developed for the qualitative assay, the cycle threshold values of RT-PCR could not be converted to viral load kinetics in this report. It is noteworthy, however, that stool samples were positive until the 17th day since symptom onset.
