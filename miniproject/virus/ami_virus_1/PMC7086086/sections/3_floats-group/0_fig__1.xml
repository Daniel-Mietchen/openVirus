  <title>Diagram showing how the family members of the first pediatric patient with COVID-19 were in self-quarantine at home. The patient lived with her parents and her cousin, while her aunt and uncle lived upstairs. Her uncle was quarantined in his room but shared meals at her house (grey table) until he was confirmed with COVID-19. The remaining five family members had been placed in self-quarantine without sharing meals in the dining table (white table). The patient and her mother stayed in the same room until her mother's diagnosis. Individuals in black indicate the confirmed cases and bold line means a quarantine room. The actual floor plan may be different.</title>
