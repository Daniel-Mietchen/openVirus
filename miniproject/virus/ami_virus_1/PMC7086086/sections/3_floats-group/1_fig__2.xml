  <title>Serial viral test results of multiple specimens and chest imaging of the patient. (A) Serial viral test results of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region of the ORF1b gene on real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are shown for multiple specimens according to the onset of symptoms. (B) Chest X-ray shows no infiltrations on admission, day 3 since symptom onset. (C) Chest CT performed on the fourth day since symptom onset demonstrates patchy nodular consolidations with peripheral ground glass opacities in subpleural areas of the right lower lobe in axial and sagittal views of CT.</title>
  <p>CT = computed tomography, SARS-CoV-2 = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.</p>
