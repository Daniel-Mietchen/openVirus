  <p>Complications of infantile respiratory viral infection. (
   <bold>a</bold>) Following acute necrotizing respiratory viral infection, the bronchioles may develop mucosal reparative changes in the form of squamous metaplasia, in this case following parainfluenza virus (H&amp;E, 100×). (
   <bold>b</bold>) In this case, also following parainfluenza virus infection, the bronchioles demonstrate focal constrictive subepithelial fibrosis (constrictive bronchiolitis), part of the spectrum of pathologic features associated with post-viral bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (H&amp;E, 200×). This is a common complication of both adenovirus and influenza virus bronchiolitis
