<p>Clinically, adenovirus is associated with several different syndromes, including keratoconjunctivitis, gastroenteritis with diarrhea, cystitis, and respiratory tract disease. In the respiratory tract, adenovirus is associated most often with bronchiolitis (61 %) or croup symptoms (21 %) and less often pneumonia (14 %) or asthma exacerbation (4 %) (Williams et al.
