<p>Severe AdV infections cause necrosis and destruction of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium, as well as adjacent parenchymal necrosis. Parenchymal necrosis may be widespread in immunocompromised patients, and AdV carries a particularly high mortality in this population due to disseminated disease. Within the respiratory and alveolar-type epithelium, nuclear inclusions appear as diffuse amphophilic material with peripheralization of chromatin (“smudge cells”) or less commonly as eosinophilic central nuclear inclusions with a peripheral halo, similar to that seen in Cowdry A herpes simplex virus inclusions (Hammond et al.
