<p>Coronaviruses have long been appreciated as a significant cause of mild upper respiratory tract infections (CoV types OC43 and 229E), but only relatively recently have been appreciated as an occasional cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children (Canducci et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2008</xref>). Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, increased attention to the coronaviridae family of viruses revealed a new variant discovered in the Netherlands in 2004 (hCoV NL63) and another variant discovered in Hong Kong in 2005 (hCoV HKU1), both causing pediatric bronchiolitis and pneumonia (Brodzinski and Ruddy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). CoV NL63 has been detected in approximately 2â€“9 % of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and approximately 2.5 % of specimens from young children with viral illness with acute wheezing (Smuts et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2008</xref>). CoV is difficult to isolate in cell culture, and molecular methods are most often used for laboratory detection (Kahn
