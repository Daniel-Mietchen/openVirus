<p>Measles virus pneumonia is now rare in the United States due to vaccination programs but is common in developing countries. Young infants who have not yet had scheduled vaccinations are susceptible to primary infection and are at the greatest risk for severe or fatal disease (Hammond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). In immunocompromised hosts, measles virus infection classically results in a giant cell pneumonitis composed of an interstitial pneumonia with large multinucleate syncytial giant cells lining the airspaces. Some giant cells may have intracytoplasmic globular eosinophilic inclusions, reflecting aggregates of cytoplasmic RNA virus. Diffuse alveolar damage and squamous metaplasia are variable features (Radoycich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1992</xref>). In immunocompetent children, necrotizing bronchiolitis is noted, but giant cells are typically sparse, and cytoplasmic inclusions are not apparent (Radoycich et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1992</xref>).
