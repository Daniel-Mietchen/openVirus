Clinically, postinfectious bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome is characterized by obstructive pulmonary function tests and chest CT evidence of bronchiectasis and regional air trapping (“mosaic perfusion”) best seen on expiratory images. Histologically, obliterative bronchiolitis is characterized by fibrous obliteration or constriction of small airways by subepithelial fibrosis (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">17.7</xref>). This finding may be subtle and subject to sampling error on wedge lung biopsy, and connective tissue stains such as trichrome or Movat pentachrome are helpful in eliciting the fibrotic airways within bronchovascular bundles.
