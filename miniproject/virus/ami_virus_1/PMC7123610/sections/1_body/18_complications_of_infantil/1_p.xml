 <italic>Postinfectious reactive airway disease/asthma.</italic> Following acute infection, viruses can cause chronic sequelae, such as postinfectious recurrent wheezing in 40–50 % of RSV, hMPV, and RhV patients. Severe RSV bronchiolitis is associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for asthma in the short term (Papenburg and Boivin
