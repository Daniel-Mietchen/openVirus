<p>Accurate diagnosis and confirmation of a viral etiology are helpful in effectively managing LRTI symptoms. Noninvasive methods of diagnosis include nasal swab, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Nasopharyngeal aspirate has been found to be the most sensitive and specific method, superior to nasal swab, and is the preferred method for initial diagnosis at the point of care (Macfarlane et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>). The nasopharyngeal aspirate can be analyzed by direct immunofluorescence (IF) study, enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA), RT-PCR, and viral culture (Coffin

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2011</xref>; Marcos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>). Culture has previously been regarded as the gold standard; however, the availability of PCR has proven this method to be more sensitive and specific with significantly faster processing times (Marcos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>; Mathisen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2009</xref>). Multiplex PCR assays have also proven very useful in LRTI diagnosis due to simultaneous detection of multiple viral agents, ability to determine viral load, and same day results in a single test (Marcos et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2009</xref>). IF and EIA tests have lower sensitivity (60â€“97 %) compared to PCR techniques but are even more rapid. The simplicity of commercially available EIA kits allows their application at the bedside, yielding results within 10 min, a particularly helpful tool in peak season epidemics (Papenburg and Boivin

Tissue diagnosis of respiratory viral infection is also possible via cytomorphology and immunohistochemistry (IHC); however, this requires invasive procedures, an infrequent diagnostic first step. Antibodies to viral antigens are commercially available for immunohistochemistry for most of the neonatal and infantile respiratory viruses, including RSV, PIV, hMPV, InfV, AdV, HSV, and measles virus (Hammond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). PCR diagnosis also has been applied to formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded lung tissues (Akhtar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1996</xref>). Table
