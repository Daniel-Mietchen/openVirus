<p>Herpes simplex virus pneumonia typically occurs as a congenital infection in newborns. It is most often acquired from infected cervicovaginal secretions during vaginal delivery, followed by a typical incubation period of 9â€“10 days before skin lesions or liver failure are detected. Alternatively, neonatal infection may be acquired from infected oral secretions of parents or other caregivers. Intrauterine infection from maternal viremia is rare. Clinical presentation is typically unsuspected and fulminant, requiring rapid diagnosis and treatment. Mortality is high in the setting of disseminated disease (57 %), and the morbidity in surviving neonates following encephalitis may include seizures, spasticity, blindness, and learning disabilities. Congenital HSV infection is regrettably difficult to predict and prevent, as herpetic vesicles may not be apparent in infected mothers. The histologic features, regardless of organ involved, are characterized by punctate areas of necrosis surrounded by a rim of cells with characteristic intranuclear viral cytopathic effect (Cowdry A or Cowdry B type inclusions) (Fig.
