<p>Histologically, respiratory viruses typically cause a pattern of lymphocytic bronchiolitis, with or without interstitial pneumonitis. Lymphocytic bronchiolitis is recognized by the presence of a circumferential cuff of airway-centered lymphocytes and macrophages, in some cases associated with secondary epithelial necrosis and sloughing, and plugging of bronchioles by fibrin and mucus. Squamous metaplasia of the bronchiolar epithelium and surrounding airspaces may be prominent in the healing phase of injury. Interstitial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates (pneumonitis) may be present, despite the fact that direct viral infection of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes is only variably demonstrated (Coffin

Specific viral cytopathic effect is typically recognizable in congenital HSV and AdV infections, but viral cytopathic effect is rare or absent in most other respiratory viral infections in infants, including RSV, hMPV, PIV, and InfV. In contrast to otherwise healthy children, immunosuppressed neonates and infants (e.g., patients with bone marrow transplant, solid organ transplant, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or primary immunodeficiencies) typically have less inflammatory response and a more florid viral cytopathic effect, similar to that seen in pure culture media. Multinucleated syncytial giant cells with cytoplasmic inclusions should suggest a diagnosis of RSV, hMPV, or PIV, and immunohistochemistry or molecular testing on the tissue would be necessary for confirmation of diagnosis, if the virus has not been detected previously.
