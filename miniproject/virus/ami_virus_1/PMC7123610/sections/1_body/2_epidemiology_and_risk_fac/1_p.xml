<p>Known risk factors for bronchiolitis in neonates include prematurity, young age (less than 3 months), low birth weight, male gender, chronic medical conditions (congenital heart disease, chronic lung disease due to prematurity, trisomy 21, neuromuscular disorders, cystic fibrosis, gastroesophageal reflux, immunosuppression), lack of breast-feeding, preschool or school age siblings, day care enrollment, tobacco exposure, lower socioeconomic status, and crowded living conditions (Tregoning and Schwarze

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2005</xref>). The mechanisms for increased susceptibility in this population include inadequate immunologic defenses against infection, possibly due to a lack of immune experience and diminished transfer or maternal antibodies in utero, incomplete development of the neonatal airways and chest musculature, and decreased cardiopulmonary reserve due to chronic lung disease (Hammond et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2003</xref>; Papenburg and Boivin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). Chronic lung disease and congenital heart disease are both predictors of prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality due to viral bronchiolitis (Papenburg and Boivin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). Epidemiologic data suggests that American Indians and Alaskan Natives have a disproportionately higher mortality rate and hospitalization rate due to bronchiolitis, compared to both African Americans and Caucasians (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2009</xref>; Singleton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2009</xref>). This higher risk in Native Americans may be due to genetic factors or due to higher prevalence of known maternal risk factors including diabetes, alcohol and tobacco usage, and delayed or absent prenatal care (Chang et al.
