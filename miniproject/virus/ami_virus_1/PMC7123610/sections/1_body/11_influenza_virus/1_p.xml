<p>Influenza virus clinically may cause fever (87 %), vomiting (28 %), conjunctivitis (22 %), croup symptoms (41 %), bronchiolitis (22 %), or pneumonia (28 %) (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). In contrast to hMPV, asthma exacerbation is not a typical feature of InfV infection. InfV occurs in individuals across a broad age range during periods of regional epidemics or occasionally as part of a major global pandemic, as in the influenza outbreaks of 1918, 1957, and 1968. The peak incidence is in the winter months in the United States and may induce severe disease in young infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised populations. The virus primarily infects the bronchial and bronchiolar respiratory epithelium, but occasional alveolar epithelial cells can also be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. Classically, InfV infection produces a necrotizing bronchiolitis, peribronchiolar infiltrates, interstitial inflammation, pulmonary edema, and hyaline membranes (diffuse alveolar damage) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">17.5</xref>). Secondary bacterial pneumonia is common in fatal cases (47 %) (Bhat et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2005</xref>; Guarner et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2006</xref>). There are currently four antivirals effective against InfV infection: amantidine, rimantadine, anamivir, and oseltamivir. Vaccination is recommended for infants greater than 6 months old and for pregnant women for protection of their neonates in the first 6 months of life by passive immunity.
