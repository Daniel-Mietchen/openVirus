<p>Bocavirus is a recently identified viral agent of the pediatric airway, discovered in 2005. It is identified in approximately 5 % of previously undiagnosed respiratory viral infections in children. By seroprevalence studies, almost all children are exposed to BoV by 5 years of age and the average age at diagnosis is 13–15 months (Hustedt and Vazquez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). The true role of BoV as a causative agent of respiratory infection has been controversial due to high rates of viral coinfection (Milder and Arnold 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2009</xref>). hMPV and/or BoV are identified in about half of viral coinfections in children (Hustedt and Vazquez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>). Nevertheless, most available studies with controls have shown few or no asymptomatic patients detected with BoV, lending credence that BoV is a true pathogen in children (Brieu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2008</xref>). Similar to other pediatric respiratory viral infections, symptoms of BoV include fever, rhinorrhea, cough, sore throat, and wheezing. Furthermore, BoV has been identified in some patients with gastroenteritis (1–9 %) and as a potential cause of Kawasaki disease (31 %) (Brodzinski and Ruddy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). Peak incidence of BoV is in the winter months, similar to RSV and hMPV. Laboratory diagnosis can be made by EIA method or PCR technology. The mainstay of treatment is supportive care, and there are no available medical therapies at this time.
