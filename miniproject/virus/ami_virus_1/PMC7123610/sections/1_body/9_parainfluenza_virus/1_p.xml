<p>Clinically, PIV causes a clinical syndrome of croup (laryngotracheitis) in the majority of patients (64 %). Less common manifestations include bronchiolitis (28 %), pneumonia (7 %), and asthma exacerbation (2 %) (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). There are four serotypes of parainfluenza virus: PIV1, PIV2, PIV3, and PIV4. PIV1 and PIV2 are seasonal with highest prevalence in the fall months in the United States, whereas PIV3 occurs year-round with peak in the late spring and summer. PIV3 bronchiolitis and pneumonia are typically seen in young infants, less than 6 months of age, whereas PIV1 and PIV2 more often cause upper respiratory tract disease in toddlers and young children (2â€“5 years of age). PIV4 is often asymptomatic and infrequently detected. Mortality for PIV is quite low, except for overwhelming infection in immunocompromised patients. Histopathologic features in the general population are not well described, but animal models of PIV infection demonstrate infection of the bronchiolar epithelium, bronchiolitis, and pneumonitis (Hammond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). Histologically, PIV produces a giant cell pneumonitis and occasional cytoplasmic inclusions in the immunocompromised host, histologically indistinguishable from RSV or metapneumovirus infection (Fig.
