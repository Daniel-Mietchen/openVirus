<p>In fetuses and neonates, cytomegalovirus infection may be acquired vertically during pregnancy. CMV infection also may be latent and emerges as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. In immunocompromised patients, clinical diagnosis of CMV pneumonia requires not only detection of the virus in a respiratory sample but also presence of respiratory symptomatology. Congenital CMV infection manifests as disseminated disease with frequent viral cytopathic effect, classically inducing cytomegaly, large intranuclear inclusions with a peripheral halo, and small granular basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions. CMV pneumonitis may be associated with lymphoplasmacytic inflammation in the alveolar walls.</p>
