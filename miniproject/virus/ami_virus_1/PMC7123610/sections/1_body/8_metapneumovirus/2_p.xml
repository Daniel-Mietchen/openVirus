<p>Clinically, hMPV causes symptoms generally similar to RSV infection, including cough, coryza, and rhinitis in the majority of patients. Clinical diagnoses associated with hMPV include bronchiolitis (59 %), croup (18 %), asthma exacerbation (14 %), or pneumonia (8 %) (Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). Acute otitis media is also common (16â€“50 %) (Brodzinski and Ruddy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). Like RSV, wheezing, prolonged expiration, and hypoxemia are common features (Wolf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2006</xref>). Some studies have shown less severe disease than for RSV, as indicated by shorter duration of symptoms, less frequent oxygen requirement, and less frequent respiratory support and intensive care admission (Papenburg and Boivin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). Hospitalization for hMPV infection is more often associated with underlying medical conditions when compared to RSV infection (54 % vs. 29 %) (Williams 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>). Fatal hMPV infection has been described in immunocompromised patients (Williams
