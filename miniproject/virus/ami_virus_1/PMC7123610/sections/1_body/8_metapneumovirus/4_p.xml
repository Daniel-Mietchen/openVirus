<p>Based on animal studies, hMPV appears to directly infect the bronchial and bronchiolar respiratory epithelium and is associated with peribronchiolar mononuclear infiltrates and intraluminal collections of mononuclear cells and neutrophils (Hammond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>). On lavage specimens, findings include respiratory epithelial cell degeneration and/or necrosis with ciliocytophthoria and round eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, similar to that seen in RSV, PIV, and measles infection. A background of hemosiderin-laden macrophages, abundant neutrophils, and prominent mucus has also been noted (Hammond et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2007</xref>; Vargas et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>). Acute and organizing lung injury (diffuse alveolar damage) has been reported (Papenburg and Boivin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>). There is no currently approved vaccine or specific antiviral therapy for hMPV.
