<p>Enzyme-linked assay methods are available for rapid diagnosis of hMPV. Molecular methods (RT-PCR) are most useful for definitive diagnosis, as viral cytopathic effect is identified in culture in less than half of cases (45 %) and typically takes over 2 weeks to develop, in contrast to RSV which typically demonstrates its characteristic syncytial giant cell cytopathic effect in 3â€“5 days (Papenburg and Boivin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). Viral culture of hMPV also requires special conditions, including specific cell lines and trypsin supplementation (Brodzinski and Ruddy

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). RSV bronchiolitis with hMPV coinfection has been suggested to produce more severe disease, although this has not been supported in other studies (Fouchier et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2005</xref>).
