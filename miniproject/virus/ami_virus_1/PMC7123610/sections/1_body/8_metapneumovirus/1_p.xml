<p>First identified in 2001, hMPV is now recognized to be an important and common cause of respiratory viral infection in infants, accounting for approximately 12 % of all acute respiratory infections in previously healthy young children and 8–20 % of culture-negative viral infections in this population (Hustedt and Vazquez 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2010</xref>; Williams et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2004</xref>). More specifically, hMPV causes 5–15 % of acute bronchiolitis in young children (Kahn

Approximately 75 % of hMPV infections occur in infants less than 1 year of age, and the age at diagnosis tends to be slightly older than infants with RSV infection. Seroprevalence approaches 100 % of the population by 5–10 years of age, in contrast to 2 years of age for RSV (Papenburg and Boivin 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2010</xref>; Brodzinski and Ruddy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2009</xref>). Most cases (75 %) are diagnosed between December and April, with peak incidence in March.
