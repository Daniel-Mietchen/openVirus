<p>Respiratory viral infection in infants differs from that seen in adults. Neonates and infants are predisposed to RSV, hMPV, and PIV, in contrast to RhV, CoV, and InfV, the most common lower respiratory tract viruses in adults. Premature infants are particularly susceptible to these viral infections and carry a higher morbidity and mortality relative to the adult population. Laboratory diagnosis by viral culture, EIA, IF, and multiplex PCR assays are the mainstays of specific diagnosis in infancy, similar to older children and adults. Despite the increasingly recognized prevalence of culture-negative respiratory viruses such as hMPV, BoV, and CoV, RSV remains a central pathogen in respiratory infections in infants and tends to be more severe than these other viruses. Pathologic features in lung biopsy or autopsy vary dependent on the immunologic status of the patient. Immunocompromised infants have more pronounced viral cytopathic effect (giant cells and/or viral inclusions) and relatively little inflammatory response, whereas otherwise healthy infants more often have lymphocytic bronchiolitis or pneumonitis without distinguishing viral cytopathic effect. Immunohistochemistry may be used for confirmation of diagnosis in tissues; however, the more cost-effective and comprehensive method for confirmation of diagnosis currently is the use of molecular diagnostic techniques.</p>
