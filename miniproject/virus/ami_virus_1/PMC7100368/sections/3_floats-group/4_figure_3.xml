  <p>Urban cycle of dengue and Zika virus transmission can be blocked at multiple steps by vaccine elicited immune responses. Both dengue and Zika viruses are transmitted between human through mosquitoes in urban areas, where prevention measures can be applied. By human immunization with universal or pentavalent vaccines that elicit both T cell and B cell responses, especially those that also target NS1antigens, viral transmission in the urban cycle may be blocked and viral diseases can be controlled at multiple steps: (1) Virus transmission to humans and virus replication 
   <italic>in vivo</italic> are inhibited by broadly neutralizing antibodies specific for envelope proteins; these antibodies block virus attachment and virus entry in dendritic cells or other target cells such as monocytes and macrophages; (2) Antibodies specific for NS1 proteins; these can reduce virus induced pathology in human through preventing NS1 hexamers attachment to endothelial cells, because the attachment may trigger the degradation of endothelial glycocalyx components or activate TLR4 pathway to produce vasoactive cytokines, both of which will increase endothelium permeability; (3) Virus replication in human is inhibited by functional CD8 + T cells. Vaccine induced memory CD8 + T cells can be activated by infected cells that present DENV or ZIKV peptides in the context of MHC-I molecules, and activated CD8 + T cells directly lyse infected cells by secreting granzyme B and perforin; (4) Both CD8 + T cell and antibody-producing B cell responses are facilitated by activated CD4 + T helper (Th) cells that secret cytokines such as IFN-Î³, IL-2,IL-4, IL-5, or IL-13; (5) Viral transmission to mosquitoes is inhibited by NS1 antibodies. Mosquitoes acquire both NS1 protein and virus particles during a blood meal from acutely infected patients. The NS1 antigenemia could help virus to replicate in the midgut of mosquitoes, by antagonizing mosquito immunity such as JAK-STAT and ROS pathways. The abundant NS1 antibodies in human plasma of vaccine recipients may bind to NS1 protein and thus neutralize the antagonistic effect of NS1 to mosquito immunity, resulting in restriction of virus propagation in the midgut of mosquitoes.
