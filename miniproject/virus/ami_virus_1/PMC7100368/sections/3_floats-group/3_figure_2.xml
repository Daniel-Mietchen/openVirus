  <p>Designing strategy for flavivirus T cell vaccines. Development of T cell vaccine could be initiated from the prediction of T cell epitopes on Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) (1â€“4). With selected HLA molecules (1) and protein sequences (2), both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell epitopes can be predicted according to the sequences of linear peptides derived from a protein (3), and the affinity of peptides to selected MHC molecules (4). Predicted epitopes were verified in HLA-transgenic mice with synthesized peptides through Elispot or Intracellular cytokine staining assay (5). Verified epitopes were further selected based on their conservation across different strains of viruses (HLA-allotype), population coverage, immunogenicity and processing efficiency, all of which could be calculated online. Some can be tested experimentally. Using these selected epitopes, T cell vaccine can be prepared with two different strategies, one is using antigens which contain most dominant epitopes and have reliable population coverage and sequence conservation (6); the other is to make immunogens with a string of peptides containing epitopes from different genes or strains, thus having higher population and antigen coverage (7). Both kinds of vaccines can be either DNA/RNA or proteins, depending on the T cell subset to be activated.</p>
