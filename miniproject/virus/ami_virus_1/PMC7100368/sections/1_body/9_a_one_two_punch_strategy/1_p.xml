<p>After it is discovered for 70 years, we are still searching for better approaches to defeat dengue viruses. The sudden outbreaks of Zika virus has brought additional difficulties to solve the dengue problem, because the pre-existing ZIKV antibodies have the potential to enhance DENV infection, and antibodies elicited by dengue vaccines also have the potential to augment ZIKV infection. However, as for any other scientific challenges before, the large global outbreak of ZIKV has brought in extensive investigations on flavivirus virology, immunology, vaccinology, vector biology, and new tools to counteract the diseases. To combat mosquito-borne viruses, a one-two punch strategy that combines human preventive vaccine and vector blockade to cut transmission cycles at multiple steps may be necessary (as 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> shows). Compared with other approaches for vector blockade, active immunization with NS1/Î”NS1 in human, is more feasible and has less spillover effect on ecology. Application of B cell vaccines producing broadly neutralizing antibodies may efficiently block virus infection in human and inhibit both vertical and sexual transmission of ZIKV. In addition, T cell vaccine can act in synergy with B cell vaccine to elicit functional T cell responses that inhibit virus replication in human, aiding to protect human from severe disease. At a minimal, incorporating NS1 within both B cell and T cell vaccines will likely to help overcoming the effect of ADE in human, blocking transmission to mosquitos, and providing opportunities for total disease control. However, further experimental evaluation on the feasibility, efficiency and safety of these approaches are necessary.
