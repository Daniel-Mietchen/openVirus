<p>Moreover, to elicit long-term neutralizing B cell memory response is another essential aim for dengue or Zika vaccine. In clinical trial of CYD-TDV, GMT of antibody to each serotype of viruses was measured at 28 days after each immunization, significant increase of GMT level was only observed after the 1st and 2nd immunization, and protection efficacy in recipients accepted all three doses (per protocol analysis) showed no differences with those only vaccinated for the first dose (intention-to-treat analysis) (

Whether B cell memory response elicited by multiple and single doses of CYD-TDV both waned to the same level in the first year is uncertain. For obvious reasons, dengue experienced vaccine recipients have higher GMT than dengue naïve ones, and the formers were better protected from subsequent dengue infections. In an earlier Phase I clinical trial with monovalent CYD-2 vaccine, dramatic decrease of neutralizing antibodies was observed in YF naïve group from 1st to 12th month, whereas YF-immune subjects maintained higher GMTs of antibody responses to dengue virus-2 and heterotypic viruses throughout the first year after immunization, despite the vaccine specific GMT were initially similar for the two groups in the 1st month (

More followed-up studies are needed for confirmation, but it inferred that boosting with heterologous antigens (i.e., vaccinate recipients having prior flavivirus infection) have helped host immunity to focus on a few conserved epitopes to produce stronger and longer cross-reactive broadly neutralization responses, but repetition of immunization with same antigens (i.e., various antibody responses primed in the first immunization were equally boosted in the following two repeated immunization) only elicited various antibodies of weak cross-neutralization and sustained these responses only for a short-term. In fact, this hypothesis is in line with the theory of “original antigenic sin” (

 <xref rid="B211" ref-type="bibr">Zompi and Harris, 2013</xref>). Therefore, to achieve long-term antibody responses by B cells toward selected epitopes corresponding to stronger and broader neutralization, heterologous prime-boost immunization to highlight conserved epitopes might be a useful approach.
