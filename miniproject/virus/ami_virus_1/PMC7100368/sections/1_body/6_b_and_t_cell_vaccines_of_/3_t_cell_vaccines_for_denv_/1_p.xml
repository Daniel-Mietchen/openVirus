<p>In contrast to the extensive attention on B cell responses, T cell immunity produced by flavivirus vaccine had never been carefully examined until a recent retrospective study that investigated why there was a higher efficacy of CYD-TDV in dengue experienced than dengue na√Øve vaccine recipients. As a chimera of Dengue virus and YF-17D vaccine, CYD-TDV mainly elicited YFV specific T cell responses through YFV non-structural proteins, of which reactivity to dengue virus was limited. One hypothesis is that, with prior dengue virus infection, dengue specific memory T cell responses were boosted by YFV cross-reactive epitopes in seropositive recipients and contributed to protection. Indeed, the cross-serotype and cross-complex protection of dengue virus specific T cells has already been reported in mouse models. Specifically, memory T cells can relieve mice from lethal disease in an adoptive transfer model, avoiding ADE effect successfully (
