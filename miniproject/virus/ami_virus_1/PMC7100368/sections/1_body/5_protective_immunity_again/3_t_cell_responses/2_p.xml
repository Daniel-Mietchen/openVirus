<p>Similarly, ZIKV specific CD8 + T cells were also first showed to be protective in a mouse model (

Whether ZIKV CD4 + T cell responses are necessary for virus clearance in primary infection is still controversial, but memory CD4 + T cells elicited by infection or peptide immunization have been demonstrated to protect host from subsequent ZIKV infection (

 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Elong Ngono et al., 2019</xref>). In one cohort study conducted in dengue endemic countries, ZIKV specific CD8 + T cell epitopes were found to be located mainly on C, prM, and E proteins in dengue na√Øve patients, but targeted broadly across the proteome, especially those conserved regions, in dengue experienced patients (
