<p>DENV and ZIKV show high level of structure homology between their envelope proteins, and share 35, 51, and 29% amino acid identity in EDI, EDII, and EDIII, respectively. Thereby, cross-reactivities are frequently observed between antibodies targeting E domain I/II of two viruses, but less so for domain III antibodies (

These antibodies recognize a conserved conformational region on the E dimer which prM interacts with during virus maturation. Another subset is EDE2 antibodies that have broader footprints covering N153 glycosylation site of DENV E proteins, these antibodies can also cross-neutralize ZIKV at high concentrations (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, cross-reactive antibodies EDE1 and EDE2 were isolated mainly from patients of acute secondary DENV infection, whereas A9E and G9E were isolated from DENV na√Øve ZIKV patients at 6 months after the onset of illness. Whether such cross-complex neutralizing B cell responses can sustain long time after recovery from infection is unclear, and whether its frequency increases after a heterotypic secondary infection is also unknown.
