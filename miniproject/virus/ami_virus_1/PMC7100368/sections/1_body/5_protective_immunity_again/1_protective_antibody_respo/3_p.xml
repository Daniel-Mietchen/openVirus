<p>On the contrary, the importance of ZIKV EDIII specific antibodies has been shown directly in some human studies. In one study with a panel of human mAb isolated from four convalescent patients, antibodies to E domain III and quaternary epitopes were found to be the most potent at neutralization (

Additionally, using two cohorts of ZIKV infected individuals from Mexico and Brazil, it was revealed that the levels of antibodies specific for the lateral ridge of ZIKV E domain III were positively correlated with sera neutralization antibody titers (
