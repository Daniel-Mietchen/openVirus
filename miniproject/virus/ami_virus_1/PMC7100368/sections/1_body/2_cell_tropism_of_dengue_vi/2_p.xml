<p>As they disseminate through the circulatory and lymphatic system, dengue virus and Zika virus spread to different tissues and organs. Dengue virus infects primary vascular endothelial cells, splenic macrophage and Kupffer cells in

So far, Zika virus has been found to infect a wide range of cell types, including neural progenitor cells, mature neurons and astrocytes in brain, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, stem-like testicular peritubular cells, primary spermatocytes and spermatogonia in testicles, vaginal epithelium and uterine fibroblast in uterus, and trophoblasts, Hofbauer cells and endothelial cells in placenta (

 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">Qian et al., 2017</xref>). Several investigations indicated Zika virus infects endothelial cells, the key component of blood tissue barriers, a fact that may help to explain how Zika virus crosses blood brain barrier and placental barrier (

 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">Papa et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is still controversial as to whether Zika virus infection alters endothelial barrier integrity. A recent study showed that ZIKV infection of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) increased endothelial permeability (
