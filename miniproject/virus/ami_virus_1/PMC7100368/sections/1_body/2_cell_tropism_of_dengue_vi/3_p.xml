<p>Understanding of ZIKV cell tropism and dissemination across blood tissue barriers will help to better elucidate Zika pathology, and provide opportunity for the development of efficient treatment or prevention strategy. Meanwhile, pathogenic characteristics and tissue tropism should also been considered during development of prophylactic ZIKV vaccine. Its criteria for protective efficacies need to include not only reduced viral load and neuropathology, but also inhibited vertical transmission, and decreased damages to reproductive systems in animal models (
