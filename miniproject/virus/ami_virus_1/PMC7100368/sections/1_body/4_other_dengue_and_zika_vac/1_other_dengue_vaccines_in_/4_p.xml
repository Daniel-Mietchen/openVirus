<p>In contrast to the more rapid progress of live attenuated vaccines into Phase III clinical trials, protein and DNA vaccines are lagging behind in Phase I trials. A subunit dengue vaccine V180 is developed by Hawaii Biotech Inc., and then bought by Merk &amp; Co., Incorporated. This vaccine is comprised of four 
 <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell expressed N-terminal 395aa of envelope proteins (E80) representing four serotype of dengue viruses, and it has been demonstrated to produce neutralizing antibody and provide protection against challenge with multiple serotypes of DENV in murine and non-human primate models (

In a recent Phase I clinical trial, tetravalent E80 vaccines formulated with different adjuvants were shown to be well tolerated in seronegative recipients in Australia, and they elicited tetravalent neutralizing antibodies, albeit of short duration (
