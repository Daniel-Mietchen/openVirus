<p>The most advanced Zika vaccine candidates is a DNA vaccine containing Zika virus prM and E genes (VRC5283) that is being developed by NIAID and tested in Phase II clinical trial. The vaccine plasmid expresses prM and E proteins and forms non-infectious but highly antigenic virus like particles (VLP) 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recipients of this vaccine by needle-free injection on both arms with split-dose showed 100% seroconversion, and generated neutralizing antibody with higher GMT values than those received a single-full dose injection on one arm and those administered the vaccine via needle and syringe injection. It is probably because the needle-free injection has enhanced dispersion field and increases the contact area between antigens and dermal APC (

Another DNA vaccine GLS-5700 (developed by GeneOne/Inovio) containing consensus sequences of ZIKV prM and E genes, delivered via intradermal injection followed by electroporation, produced neutralizing antibodies in 62% participants as measured by the Plaque Reduction Neutralizing Test (PRNT). In addition, adoptive transfer of sera from vaccine recipients protected 92% immune deficient mice from lethal ZIKV challenge (
