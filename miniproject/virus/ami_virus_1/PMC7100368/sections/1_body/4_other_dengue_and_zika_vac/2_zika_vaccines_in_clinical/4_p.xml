<p>Using a similar strategy for DENV-2 vaccine TV003/TV005, recombinant live attenuated Zika vaccine has been constructed with the backbone of attenuated DENV-4 of TV003 (rZIKV/D4delta30), by NIAID, wherein prM and E genes of DEN4delta30 were substituted by the corresponding genes from ZIKV. This vaccine is now in Phase I clinical trial, and might be tested in combination with DENV vaccine TV005 in the future (ID: NCT03611946) (

One of such vaccine, MV-ZIKA, has been developed by Themis Bioscience GmbH and advanced into Phase I clinical trial (ID: NCT02996890).
