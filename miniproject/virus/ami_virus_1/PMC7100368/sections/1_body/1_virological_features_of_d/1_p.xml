<p>Both Dengue virus and Zika virus belong to the genus of 
 <italic>flavivirus</italic> in the 
 <italic>flaviviridae</italic> family, and they have similar genome organization and virion morphology. They both have one single-stranded positive RNA as genome, which contain an open reading frame (ORF) of ∼11,000 nucleotides, flanked by 100 nucleotides at the 5′UTR and 400–500 nucleotides at the 3′UTR. The single ORF encodes a polyprotein of 3000-amino acid that is translationally or post-translationally processed into three structural proteins (C, prM, E) and seven non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS5). Generally, the sequence homology between DENV and ZIKV polyprotein is 55–56%, whereas the homology among four serotype dengue virus polyproteins is 69–72%. The three structural proteins and phospholipid bilayers derived from ER of infected cells form the major architecture of viral particles of ZIKV and DENV, whereas the non-structural proteins (except for NS1) mainly retain intracellular location and participate in viral RNA replication and viral polyprotein processing: NS5 is RNA dependent RNA polymerase and methyltransferase, NS3 is helicase, NS2B/NS3 complex is a serine protease that processes polyprotein at C/pr, NS2A/NS2B, NS2B/NS3, NS3/NS4A, NS4A/2K, and NS4B/NS5 junctions. The NS proteins also interact with host immunity: NS2B/NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 can be antagonists of innate immune responses; NS1 can directly or indirectly cause pathology (

On the surface of the mature virus particles, 90 copies of E homodimers lie flat on the virus membrane, packed in a herringbone array; each E dimer is comprised of two antiparallel monomers whose c-terminal helixes are anchored into the lipid bilayer of virus envelope. As envelope protein directly mediates receptor binding and post-entry membrane fusion, it is mostly outwardly exposed and thus contains most neutralization epitopes. Underneath each dimeric E ectodomains are a pair of M proteins buried in the pockets and holes formed between two E subunits on the viral membrane. Similarly, M proteins are anchored to membrane through c-terminal tans-membrane helixes, complexed with each E protein and modulating conformational change of E to initiate membrane fusion at post-entry stage in a pH dependent manner (

Inside the envelope, the capsids interact with genomic RNA, forming a spherical nucleocapsid, in which ordered structure of capsid surrounding RNA has never been observed in dengue viruses; but a recent study at 9 Å resolution showed structure of immature Zika virus and demonstrated that there was a regular but broken shell of capsid inside the membrane, implying a dynamical morphological alteration during Zika virus maturation (

 <sup>154</sup> of ZIKV envelope protein and Asn
 <sup>153</sup> of DENV envelope protein, these sites may influence virus transmission and pathology through affecting receptor binding and cell tropism (
