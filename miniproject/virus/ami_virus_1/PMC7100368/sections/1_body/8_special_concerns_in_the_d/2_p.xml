<p>At the early stage of vaccine development for these two viruses, the primary aims are to inhibit virus replication in vaccinated animals, and to reduce mortality in lethal infection murine models. However, ZIKV has the ability to infect and replicate in reproductive systems, it can disseminate through sexual and vertical transmission, and it is associated with increased incidence of microcephaly in fetus. It is still unclear what level of viral load is enough to cause vertical or sexual transmission, or induce inflammation in these tissues and placenta, or damage testicle, or contribute to fetal microcephaly. According to the literature, viral clearance might be more difficult in these organs comparing to others (

Therefore, during ZIKV vaccine development, specified criteria for protective efficacies should include reduced neuropathology in adult mice, inhibited vertical transmission to fetus in pregnant animals, and decreased damages to reproductive systems. In contrast, evaluation of DENV vaccine in disease models mainly includes blockage of vascular leakage or hemorrhagic manifestations in mouse model.
