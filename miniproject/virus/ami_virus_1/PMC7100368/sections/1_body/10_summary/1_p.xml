<p>We have reviewed the existing knowledge on epidemiology, molecular virology, and vaccine development of DENV and ZIKV; and updated our understanding on protective immunity against DENV and ZIKV. We have also discussed recent discoveries on the functions of flavivirus NS1 in viral pathogenesis and transmission. Based on such knowledge, we proposed a potential one-two punch strategy that overcomes ADE and defeats Dengue and Zika viruses through a combination of vaccines and vector blockade.</p>
