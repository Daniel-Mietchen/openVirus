<p>As both DENV and ZIKV are transmitted through 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, countermeasures that block the transmission steps of these vectors are important adjuncts to vaccines or antiviral drugs for controlling their infections. In urban areas, through spraying insecticides and clearing up standing water in containers such as discarded tires and plant pots, adult mosquitoes and mosquito larvae can be effectively removed. These approaches had helped to eliminate dengue fever from southern United States in 1920s. However, absolute elimination of mosquitoes from cities was impossible, reintroduction occurred when global travel became frequent and the new vector,
