<p>Leaving the eco-system intact, our investigations on NS1 provided an alternative strategy to block flavivirus-mosquito transmission which is more specific and environmentally friendly. Soluble NS1 hexamers are secreted during virus infection, and a high concentration of plasma NS1 coexists with viremia during the acute phase of disease. We demonstrated that blood meal from infected mice that have NS1 antigenemia can suppress the expression of immune genes (JAK-STAT, ROS) in midgut of mosquitoes, facilitating flavivirus acquisition by mosquitoes. Although transferring NS1 antibody to AG6 mice did not affect the viremia in mice directly, it significantly inhibited DENV-2 transmission from AG6 mice to mosquitoes (

Immunization generated NS1 antibodies might competitively bind to soluble NS1 in blood and prevent NS1 from suppressing the expression of immune genes in midgut of mosquitoes after a blood meal. Furthermore, we demonstrated that NS1 antigenemia also determined ZIKV infectivity in mosquitoes. Specifically, comparing with ZIKV Asian strains that were isolated before recent outbreaks, contemporary strains causing recent epidemics have an alanine-to-valine substitution at the 188th residue in NS1. This mutation results in higher level of NS1 secretion, which subsequently dampens the expression of immune genes in mosquito and is responsible for the enhanced infectivity in mosquitoes. This mechanism helps to explain how ZIKV of Asian lineage acquired the ability to rapidly spread from Asia to America (
