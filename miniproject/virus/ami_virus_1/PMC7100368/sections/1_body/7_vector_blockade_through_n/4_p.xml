<p>Based on these evidence, we had constructed a modified DENV2 sNS1 with deletion of epitopes mimicking autoantigens (ΔNS1), and found that prior immunization with either ΔNS1 or full-length NS1 in AG6 mice significantly helped to neutralize NS1 antigenemia and block the transmission of virus to mosquitoes. Notably, unlike antibodies elicited to full-length NS1, antibodies generated against ΔNS1 did not cross-react with human endothelial cells or human primary platelets. And after infection, viremia in mice immunized with modified-NS1 (ΔNS1) was significantly lower than those of mock or full-length NS1 immunized mice (

In agreement with these results, mice immunized with ΔNS1 showed less vascular leakage and higher survival rate in AG6 mice after DENV-2 challenge, compared to mice that were immunized with full-length NS1 or PBS. Collectively, through antibodies specific to NS1 proteins that have been removed cross-reactive epitopes to autoantigens, we had successfully overcome the adverse effect of NS1 antibodies, blocked virus transmission, inhibited virus replication and protected mice from lethal diseases. Importantly, antibodies to NS1 do not have any risk of inducing ADE.
