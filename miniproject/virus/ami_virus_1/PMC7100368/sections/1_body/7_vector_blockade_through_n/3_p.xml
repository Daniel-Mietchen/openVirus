<p>Besides blockade of viral transmission, NS1 antibodies have been identified to have multiple other roles in immunity and host pathology, some of which are completely opposite. Previously, soluble DENV NS1 was found to contribute directly to vascular leakage through increasing endothelial permeability and degradation of endothelial glycocalyx components, or indirectly through inducing vasoactive cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) via TLR-4 activation (

Because a fraction of NS1 dimer also presents on the surface of infected cells, antibodies also probably target Fcγ-receptors to mediate viral clearance by phagocytosis or initiate complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). Recent investigations show that transferring ZIKV NS1 antibodies from human or vaccinated mice to IFN deficient mice provided protection through Fcγ-receptor mediated pathway (

On the contrary, much evidence also indicated NS1 antibodies being capable of cross-react with coagulation factors and adhesin molecules on platelets and endothelial cells, causing disruption of platelet aggregation and apoptosis of endothelial cells, and thus leading to pathology in DENV infections (
