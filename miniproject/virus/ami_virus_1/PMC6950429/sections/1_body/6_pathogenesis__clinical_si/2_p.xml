<p>The regenerative ability of villi is instrumental in the recovery of the pig. Regeneration speed depends on age of the animals; in adult and fattening pigs, villi are restored in three to four days, while in piglets the process is longer at six to seven days (

Mortality is variable and also depends on the age of animals. In suckling piglets, mortality can attain 100 %, in piglets older than 10 days, it is less than 10%, and in adult and fattening pigs, it falls below 5%. There is no specific treatment other than symptomatic treatment of diarrhoea, however, most growing pigs recover without treatment within 7â€“10 days unless secondary infections occur. Reinfection may occur when the immunity wanes (
