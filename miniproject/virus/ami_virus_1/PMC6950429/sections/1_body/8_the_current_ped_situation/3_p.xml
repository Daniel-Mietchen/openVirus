<p>In Poland, the clinical symptoms of PED have been observed, but until 2014 no studies were conducted to confirm the presence of PEDV. In 2015– 2017, the presence of the virus and/or of specific antibodies was confirmed on several farms in Poland. Samples of blood, faeces, slurry, and intestines were collected in herds in which the clinical symptoms of the disease had previously been observed. So far, virus isolation in Vero cells has not been carried out in Poland and nor has genetic material from positive samples been sequenced. It is foreseen that PEDV might be transferred in the future to Polish swine herds. The severity of PED which occurred in the USA has shown that this disease should be countered with timely preventive measures and early diagnosis. Therefore, the role of the National Veterinary Research Institute in Puławy, Poland, in the diagnosis of PED is of paramount importance in future pig production.</p>
