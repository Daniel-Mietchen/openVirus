<p>Isolation of PEDV from field samples is very difficult. The virus grows in Vero cells (African green monkey kidney). However, its growth there requires the presence of trypsin-supplemented cell culture medium, because this protease plays an important role in cell entry and the release of PEDV virions in Vero cells. Trypsin does this by cleaving the S protein into S1 and S2 subunits, and it enables efficient replication and spread of PEDV

PED viruses cause cell death leading to lysis of infected cells, a change observable under the microscope as a cytopathic effect (CPE) which is characterised by cell membrane vacuolisation and syncytium formation (
