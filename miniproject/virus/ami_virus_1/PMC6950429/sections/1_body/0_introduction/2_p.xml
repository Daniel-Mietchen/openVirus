<p>PED was observed for the first time in 1971 in the United Kingdom. The virus only infected fattening pigs and sows. Subsequently, the disease spread to other European countries. Emergence of a new PEDV strain in China in 2010 caused serious epidemics and this strain rapidly spread worldwide. In the USA, highly virulent strains infected pigs in 31 states between 2013 and 2015, resulting in significant economic losses (

PED is not a notifiable disease in the European Union and is not on the list of diseases reported to the World Animal Health Organization (OIE), therefore the status of this disease is not fully recognised. In the last 10 years, only a few countries have reported clinical cases of PED and/or seropositive animals (
