<p id="Par44">Most of the reported epidemics, disasters and other potential public health emergencies appear to have occurred in the same countries—a few countries have the highest number of epidemics and most of them are in the Central, West and the East African regions. These countries could be categorized as the epicentres of epidemics. The number of events reported was used to classify countries into three priority tiers based on the frequency of epidemics during the period 2016–2018. High priority (tier 1) are those countries that had 10 or more epidemics during the period 2016–2018. These countries also had limited or developing IHR capacities, based on the 2018 IHR annual reporting data (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Moderate priority (tier 2) are those countries that had 5–9 epidemics during the period 2016–2018. Low priority (tier 3) are those countries with fewer than 5 epidemics or had no epidemic recorded or reported through the tracking portals detailed in the methods section (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).
