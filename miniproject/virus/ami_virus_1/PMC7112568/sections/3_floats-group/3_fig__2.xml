  <p>Antibody responses to homologous and heterologous A(H7N9) viruses. Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers (left panel) and neutralizing antibody titers (right panel) against three distinct A(H7N9) viruses in 12 serum samples collected 16–20 months after illness onset from 12 patients from the 2016–2017 epidemic. A/Hong Kong/125/2017 (HK125) is a homologous virus strain, A/Anhui/1/2013 (AH1) and A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016 (GD17SF003) are heterologous virus strains. Triangles, circles and squares show results for each sample, each combination of symbol and color represents one serum sample. Black lines show geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) of each column. The Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test was used for pairwise analyses.</p>
