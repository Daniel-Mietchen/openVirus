<p id="para0023">According to our model, the mean HAI antibody level reached a titer of 40 on day 11 and 80 on day 27 after illness onset (
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> (A)), peaked after three months at a GMT of 290 (
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(B)), and then declined to a titer of 80 (month 11) and 40 (month 22) (
 <xref rid="fig0004" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>(A) and (C)). Neutralizing antibody titers increased slower than HAI antibody titers, reached a small peak on day 103 at a GMT of 17, decreased slightly, and then continued to increase until 35 months after illness onset, while HAI antibody titers decreased throughout this period (Supplementary Fig. 6).
