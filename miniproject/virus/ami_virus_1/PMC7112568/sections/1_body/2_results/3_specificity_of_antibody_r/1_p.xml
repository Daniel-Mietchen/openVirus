<p id="para0020">Antigenic properties of A(H7N9) viruses were evaluated by testing antibody responses against homologous A(H7N9) virus (A/Hong Kong/125/2017) and heterologous A(H7N9) viruses (A/Anhui/1/2013 and A/Guangdong/17SF003/2016) in serum samples collected 16–20 months after illness onset from patients from the 2016–2017 epidemic. These sera reacted with A/Anhui/1/2013 virus at lower titers than with A/Hong Kong/125/2017 virus, with HAI or neutralizing antibody titers that were 2- to 8-fold lower in 10 of 12 samples tested (Supplementary Table 1), and HAI and neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers (GMTs) were 47% and 50% lower, respectively (
