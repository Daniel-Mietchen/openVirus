<p id="para0026">The kinetics of A(H7N9) virus-specific HAI antibody responses during hospitalization in these patients were similar to those described in other studies of A(H7N9) patients.

 </xref> In this cohort, most patients who provided blood samples in hospital had HAI antibody titers ≥40 during hospitalization. In the study by Ma et al., 2 of 25 patients did not have an HAI antibody titer ≥40 during hospitalization or after recovery.

 </xref> Therefore, most, but not all patients with A(H7N9) virus infection who survive severe disease are able to mount detectable HAI antibody levels. The differences in peak time of HAI antibody titers between analyses of GMTs and model analysis might be due to inadequate sampling. The contacts of these virologically-confirmed cases were not investigated by serology in this study. No patient had serologic evidence of A(H7N9) virus re-infection after recovery. Epidemiological investigations of patients who survived A(H7N9) virus infections across five epidemics by our group also found no reoccurrence of A(H7N9) related-illness
