Collecting blood from survivors of severe illness from A(H7N9) virus infection at 1 to 11 months after illness onset should yield convalescent plasma with HAI antibody titer above 80, suitable for convalescent plasma therapy and H-IVIG production. Among the patients enrolled in this study, 64% (18/28) of the severely ill survivors were aged 18â€“65 years old, making them suitable potential blood donors for plasma therapy.

 </xref> However, since A(H7N9) viruses continue to evolve into antigenically distinct strains, regardless of the source of the plasma, it will be important to determine the levels of cross-reactive antibodies in the convalescent plasma against a patient's virus infection to understand whether treatment is likely to be beneficial. Furthermore, administration of convalescent plasma treatment for patients with A(H7N9) virus infection should ideally be done through a controlled clinical trial.
