<p id="para0011">Although promising, there are several safety concerns and practical challenges to using convalescent plasma, including defining the optimal timing for sera collection after recovery from illness, the case-to-case heterogeneity in antibody titers, and the rapid evolution of influenza viruses.

 </xref> Limited understanding of the specificity, kinetics, and duration of antibody responses in humans infected with A(H7N9) viruses therefore currently impedes the development and evaluation of convalescent plasma therapy. Ma et al. described the dynamics of the antibody response to A(H7N9) virus over a year post illness onset in 25 patients,
