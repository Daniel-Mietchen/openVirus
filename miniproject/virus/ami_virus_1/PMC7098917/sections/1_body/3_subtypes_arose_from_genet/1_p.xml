<p>Major attention has traditionally focused on swine as key mammalian “mixing vessels” hosts for the reassortment of influenza viruses from different host species (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). As both α-2,3 sialic acid receptors and α-2,6 receptors residues are distributed throughout its respiratory tract, swine serve as a vehicle for influenza virus genetic reassortment, allowing avian, swine, and human IAVs subtypes to reassort following co-infection. Knowing that both receptors have been found in dog and cat respiratory organs, as revealed by lectin histochemistry analyses (

 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>), dogs and cats could be dually or sequentially infected with avian- and/or mammalian influenza viruses, making them possible hosts for the generation of a viruses with novel genome combinations, with epidemic and/or pandemic potentials.
