<p>In cats no reassortment between avian and mammalian IAVs was thought to occur until recently, where a novel reassortant of the H5N6-subtype influenza viruses was isolated from two cats in eastern China (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). Both viruses were sequenced and genetic analysis showed that these viruses received their genes from three avian subtypes, including H5N6 (HA, NA, PA), H9N2 (PB2, M, NS), and H7N9 (PB1, NP) influenza subtypes viruses isolated in China (

Furthermore, the H5N6 virus was able to replicate to high titer in the lungs of infected in mice without prior adaptation, though it was not lethal, indicating mammalian host adaptation (
