<p>In most canine H3N2 cases reported, genetic analysis showed that all genes of the isolates were closely related to an avian H3N2 IAV, suggesting that the entire genome of the avian influenza virus had been transmitted to dogs with no sign of gene reassortment (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The virus was found to be most widespread in kennels and in meat dog farms, likely due to the close physical contact between infected poultry and dogs in these host-dense environments (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>). From a molecular stand point, most H3N2 canine isolates were found to have at least two mutations in the HA proteins (Ser159Asn and Trp222Leu) that may have facilitated H3N2 influenza A virus jump from birds to dogs (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Furthermore, it is likely that gradual accumulation of mutations throughout the eight gene segments may have resulted in specific adaptation of H3N2 into canids (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), although the evolutionary rate of the NA segment was higher than the seven others (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). This is further supported by the fact that (2012â€“2013) Korean canine H3N2 isolates replicated at higher titer and induced more severe clinical symptoms than 2009 isolates, clearly indicating that the canine H3N2 virus is continuously evolving in the canine population.
