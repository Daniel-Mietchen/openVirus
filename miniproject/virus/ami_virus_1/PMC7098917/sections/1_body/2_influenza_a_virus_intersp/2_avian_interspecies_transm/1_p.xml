<p>Among those determinants in the specificity of IAV for a host, we would highlight the presence of virus receptors on susceptible host cells, especially those to which the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is able to bind. Most avian and human IAVs have preference for specific receptor types having glycans with sialic acid residues in α-2,3 (avian receptor) or in α-2,6 (mammalian receptor) linkages (
