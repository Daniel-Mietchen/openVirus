<p>Canine H3N8 originated after the transfer of an equine influenza virus (EIV), likely through close contact with infected horses (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis of the HA H3N8 viral genomic sequences from horses and dogs highlighted that all canine H3N8 sequences clustered together in a single monophyletic group, distinct from EIV (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). So far, no evidence of reassortment with other subtypes has been reported. A comparison of equine and canine H3N8 sequences highlighted key amino acid residues that may be involved in receptor binding specificity and host cell tropism (

 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>). Interestingly, as for H3N2, structural, and receptor binding analyses support the role of the HA Trp222Leu mutation in facilitating viral interspecies transmission from equine to canine (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). However, CIV-H3N8 has not been found to be phenotypically different from equine H3N8 strains in terms of replicability and infectivity, thus suggesting that cross-species transmission and adaptation of influenza viruses may be rather mediated by subtle changes in virus biology (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). Furthermore, recent analyses of the amino acid sequence from emerging and contemporary CIV-H3N8 isolates, revealed that significant antigenic drift may have occurred. Altogether since its introduction into the canine population, evolution dynamics studies of CIV-H3N8 suggested that it evolved and diverged into multiple lineages (
