<p>Currently, five subtypes of IAV are frequently described in the literature as cause of acute respiratory illness in cats and dogs: H3N8, H3N2, low pathogenic avian influenza virus (LPAIV) H7N2, high pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 as well as the pandemic H1N1 virus, circulating nowadays as the seasonal flu virus in humans (
