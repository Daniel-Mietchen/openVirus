<p>Canine influenza virus (CIV) H3N8 subtype was reported in 2004 in an outbreak of severe respiratory disease in racing greyhounds, although serological evidence suggested it emerged around 1999 (

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The virus has since been considered endemic in the canine population in the US, affecting both racing greyhounds and pets (

 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), but no evidence of continuing circulation of CIV-H3N8 has been reported in these areas, and the risk of emergence appears very low (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>–
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). The CIV-H3N8 subtype appeared to have been primarily maintained in large urban animal shelters, where susceptible animals live in dense population (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>–
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Noteworthy, no CIV-H3N8 infection has been reported since 2016.
