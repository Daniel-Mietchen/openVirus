<p>Around 2006, a novel H3N2 subtype arose in dogs in China and South Korea, and then rapidly spread into several areas of Southeast Asia, where it is now stably circulating in the canine population becoming endemic (and thus referred to as CIV-H3N2) (

Despite local control measures, the virus has continued circulating among the canine population and has spread to several other areas of the country, indicating sustained dog-to-dog transmission in the US, through combinations of multiple incursions into the US from Asia and a series of localized outbreaks and fade-outs (
