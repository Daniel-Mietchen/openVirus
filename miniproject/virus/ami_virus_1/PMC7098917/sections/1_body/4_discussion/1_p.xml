<p>Evidences exist that companion dogs and cats can have a dual role as influenza A virus hosts, by (i) sustaining inter- and intraspecific transmission and (ii) generating novel IAV through recombination. Although most cases of natural cross-species infections have resulted in limited onward transmission in dogs and cats, two influenza subtypes are now continuing to circulate in dogs (CIV-H3N8 and CIV-H3N2). While the role of cats is less clear and less documented, they still appear to be susceptible mainly to avian influenza infections, even though most of them seem to be rather subclinical (reservoirs). This should be a cause of concern, especially for feral and free-roaming cats that tend to have less controls and closer contact with birds and other farm animals. However, it can be also assumed that because of the feline social organization that prevents direct cat-to-cat contact required for viral transmission, the virus may transmits very inefficiently among feline population.</p>
