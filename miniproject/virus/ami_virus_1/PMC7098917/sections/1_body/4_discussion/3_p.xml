<p>In light of reported epidemiological evidences and current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms behind interspecies transmission and genetic reassortment, it seems of significant importance to enhance active surveillance of cats and dogs under the framework of “One World, One Health,” warranting control and prevention of IAV infections as the threat of an influenza pandemic is a concern. Notably, implementing large scale programs of IAV antibody serosurveillance in canine and feline populations may serve as sentinels for monitoring the overall risk of human exposure to emerging zoonotic influenza viruses. Moreover, information on influenza viruses circulating in canine and feline populations is also crucial for the selection of viruses for effective vaccination programs targeting high risks dog populations (

The advent of rapid molecular diagnostic tests such as real-time PCR and unbiased next generation sequencing that can directly detect viral pathogens and combined with specific subtyping (i.e., H3N8 and H3N2 in dogs; H1N1 and H7N2 in cats) should also provide earlier warning and enable a more appropriate outbreak control in case of respiratory illness symptoms in cats and dogs. As the genesis of these emerging viruses is not well-understood, further research aiming at investigating the ecology, evolution and mechanisms of IAV at the human–animal interface will help to better understand which virus pose a serious threat to humans.
