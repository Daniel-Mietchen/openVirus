  <p>Dogs and cats as mixing vessels for influenza A virus. In green and light blue boxes are represented the genomic structure of reassortants that have been reported in dogs and cats, respectively. The host origin of the eight segments of viral RNA are displayed as follows: in gray, human; orange, avian; purple, swine; green, canine. Solid arrows indicate well-described interspecies events, circle arrows indicate gene reassortment events and dashed arrows represent the potential for those novel viral combinations to jump to humans, although no such case has been reported so far. See text for further details.</p>
