<p id="Par39">In the present-day advancements in biotechnology, genetic engineering, gene editing, new-generation sequencing and artificial intelligence (AI), there is a common concern about the risk from likely misuse of deadly pathogens of animal or human origin. Massive destruction is possible with the misuse of some of the highly virulent viruses/bacteria/biotoxins as bioterrorism agents upsetting animal and human health and food security and safety. The biowarfare agents can spread widely through animal to animal which may take heavy economic toll due to morbidity, mortality and loss in production. During wartime, particularly involving army operations in difficult hilly or desert terrains, requiring the use of equines or other animal species for transport purpose, natural outbreak of infectious disease or its deliberate introduction by the enemy may cripple the fighting units.</p>
