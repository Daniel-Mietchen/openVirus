<p id="Par40">Biosecurity is essential for avoiding the disease entrance across the borders or their spread within defined zones and keep the natural resources (water, soil, feed, food) safe for use. Contemporary farming stresses for a more complete tactic for managing diseases that integrates biosecurity and lay more emphasis on prevention and protection from animal diseases. Introduction of high-producing exotic stock on livestock farms often has inbuilt risk of introducing new viral and other diseases. Biosecurity is a must to safeguard animal health and reduce the risk of new pathogen entry or spread. Biosecurity measures combine the modules of ‘external biosecurity’ where force is on averting entrance of transboundary animal diseases (TADs) and ‘internal biosecurity’ where there is focus on stopping disease spread within the country, covering at the zonal and farm level.</p>
