<p id="Par59">To avoid spillover of viruses from research laboratories, strict biosafety and biocontainment procedures need to be followed and adhered to. Viruses can be carried on the hairs of laboratory workers associated with virus research. Hence, as a biosafety precaution, a researcher should not visit an animal farm/unit after working in the laboratory. Similarly, after visiting the experimental or farm animals, one should not visit the laboratory without taking a complete bath with soap and plenty of water. If strict hygienic and biosafety measures are not taken, there are strong chances of transmission of viral infections through farm workers or visitors to animals in rural or urban areas and vice versa.</p>
