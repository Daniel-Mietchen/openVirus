<p id="Par23">Trade of livestock and livestock products, within and between countries, has resulted in enhanced risk of spread of diseases to livestock, poultry and human beings. The occurrence of highly contagious viral diseases of livestock and poultry, namely, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), 
 <italic>peste des petits</italic> ruminants (PPR), classical swine fever (CSF), bluetongue, equine infectious anaemia (EIA), equine influenza (EI), highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus, infectious bursal disease (IBD) and zoonotic diseases such as West Nile fever, Rift Valley fever, SARS-coronavirus, Nipah virus infection, Hendra virus, swine influenza virus A (H1N1) and Crimeanâ€“Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), has compelled to formulate policies and regulatory procedures to prevent the entry of transboundary and exotic diseases on the one hand and interstate spread of livestock diseases through uncontrolled movements of animals for work, migration, grazing, etc., on the other hand, for checking the dissemination of endemic diseases within the country.
