<p id="Par26">After successful eradication of rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) of cloven-footed animals is another OIE-listed important viral disease inflicting heavy economic losses and adversely affecting the trade of livestock and livestock products from India to other countries. Direct losses due to FMD in India have been estimated to the extent of INR 2,30,000 million per annum. Accordingly, to combat FMD, the Government of India (GoI) initiated the FMD Control Program (FMD-CP) in 2003–2004 during the 10th Five Year Development Plan in 56 select districts of seven states having bearing on milk production. The FMD-CP envisaged vaccination of cattle and buffalo population using indigenously produced killed adjuvanted trivalent (O, A and Asia1) vaccine under nationally coordinated and monitored mass vaccination programme following OIE progressive pathway. Encouraged with its success in reducing the incidence of the disease, the programme was expanded to further 221 districts in 14 states in the 12th Plan. Now, since 2016 the entire country has been covered under FMD-CP with the ultimate objective to eradicate the disease by 2040. FAO/OIE have targeted to control FMD by 2035. This will be followed by stopping vaccination and conducting surveillance for freedom from clinical disease followed by freedom from infection. These activities are expected to be over by 2040. The control programme involving six monthly rounds of vaccinations has shown encouraging results as reflected in reduction in the number of outbreaks and incidence of the disease. The number of outbreaks declined from 1911 in 2003–2004 to 149 in 2017–2018 reflecting about 92% drop in FMD incidences. The years 2016–2017 and 2017–2018 were mainly dominated by serotype ‘O’ FMD virus as there were 296, 03 and nil outbreaks due to serotypes ‘O’, ‘Asia1’ and ‘A’, respectively (Anonymous
