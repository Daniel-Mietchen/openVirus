<p id="Par27">Subsequent to the detection of PPR in the southern peninsula in India in the late 1980s, the disease became widespread and endemic by 1995–1996. The disease is estimated to cause global losses between 1.45 billion and 2.1 billion US dollars per year. The disease causes economic losses in India to the tune of INR 11070 million per year (Tripathi et al.

After developing diagnostic facilities and a safe and potent vaccine indigenously by the year 2001–2002, a national control programme on PPR (NCP-PPR) was started in 2010 in five states (Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra) and five union territories (UTs). During February 2014, the programme was extended to all the states and UTs. The aim of the programme is to undertake intense immunization of sheep and goats and their three subsequent generations. With judicial use of vaccine and diagnostics, the NCP-PPR has shown encouraging results in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Chhattisgarh with 75% reduction in the disease incidence (Tripathi et al.
