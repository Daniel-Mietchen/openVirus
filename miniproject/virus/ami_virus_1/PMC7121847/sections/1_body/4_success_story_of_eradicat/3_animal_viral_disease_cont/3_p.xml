<p id="Par25">Equine infectious anaemia (EIA), caused by a retrovirus of Lenti group, is transmitted by blood-sucking insects, including mosquitoes and flies. The virus remains lifelong in latent form in animals which survive from the disease. The disease was reported in India for the first time in 1987 (Uppal and Yadav 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1989</xref>). It can relapse due to immunosuppression on account of stress conditions due to pregnancy, hard work, cortisone therapy or other factors. Such carrier animals are thus potential source of infection for spreading the disease throughout their life. In the absence of a suitable vaccine, the only solution to limit the infection is by destruction of seropositive animals. However, in the absence of proper legislation, the owners did not agree to put down their EIA-positive animals immediately and have to be convinced about the accuracy and validity of the test by repeat tests of the animals on fresh serum samples in the same laboratory or at other laboratories in the same country or abroad. The authors, while confronted with this problem in India, made use of an old observation of a researcher wherein it was shown that an insect after feeding on an EIA-affected equine does not go beyond 200 meters and prefers to come back to the same host for the next blood meal, by isolating the seropositive animal in Coggins test (agar gel precipitation test) more than 200 meters away from other equines before they were put down. This method was employed on hundreds of EIA-seropositive animals and always found effective.
