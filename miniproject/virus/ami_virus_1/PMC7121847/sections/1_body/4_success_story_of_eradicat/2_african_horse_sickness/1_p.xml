<p id="Par22">African horse sickness (AHS) is a devastating, highly infectious, non-contagious, insect (biting midge)-transmitted viral disease of equines. After the detection of the first animal virus (foot-and-mouth disease virus), AHS virus was the second animal virus discovered by John McFadyean at the Royal Vet College London in blood samples from Africa. This virus affects all species of 
 <italic>Equidae</italic> family including horses, mules, donkeys and zebras. In susceptible horse population, the consequence of AHS can be dreadful, resulting in up to 95% mortality. At present as there is no treatment available against AHS virus, vaccination is the only weapon available against this dreaded disease. On 27 May 2014, India touched a major landmark by getting official disease-free status from African horse sickness (peste equine). As per Resolution No. 19 (82nd General Session), India was declared as member country recognized free from African horse sickness according to the provisions of Chap. 12.1 of the Terrestrial Code by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) (82 GS/FR – PARIS, May 2014).
