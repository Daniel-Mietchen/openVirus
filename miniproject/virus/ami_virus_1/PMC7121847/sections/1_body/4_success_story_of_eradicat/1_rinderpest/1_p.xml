<p id="Par19">Rinderpest was once a serious threat to the livestock industry in several regions of the world, especially in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. The infection and death rates in newly exposed naïve population were as high as 95–100% leading to colossal economic losses. A death rate of around 200,000 animals per annum was recorded among the affected bovine population of 400,000 during the first half of the 1950s in India. Throughout the history of mankind, the social, economic and ecological consequences due to rinderpest had been more serious and severe. In India, the presence of rinderpest was confirmed by the Cattle Plague Commission (Hallen et al.

The FAO declared the global eradication of rinderpest on 28 June 2011, marking it as the first ever viral disease of animals eradicated globally about three decades after the eradication of small pox, a viral disease of humans in 1980 (Yadav et al.

In India, dividing the country into four zones based on the epidemiological picture of the disease and adopting strategic and focused vaccinations at interstate and international borders and migration routes of bovines and caprine for creating immune belts, coupled with rigorous clinical and serosurveillance, were of great help in achieving freedom from the infection. With the successful eradication of rinderpest, the livestock sector across the globe became safer and consequently the livings of livestock farmers improved.
