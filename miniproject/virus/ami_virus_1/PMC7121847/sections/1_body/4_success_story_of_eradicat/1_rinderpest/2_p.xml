<p id="Par20">Eradication of rinderpest helped in assuring inclusive growth as it mainly benefitted landless, marginal and smallholder livestock keepers, besides providing much needed animal protein, food and nutrition security and livelihood security. The milk production in India enhanced 2.99 times from the year 1955 to 1995 and further stepped to 4.796 times by 2006. Similarly, the bovine meat production increased by 17.99 times between 1959 and 1995. The income from bovine milk and meat increased to 102.06 and 193.96 times, respectively, between 1950–1951 and 2005–2006. In value terms these benefits amounted to 15563.56 million US dollars in respect of milk and 435,011 million US dollars for bovine meat from the year 1950 to 1996. It is estimated that India gained additional food production valuing 289 billion US dollars from 1965 to 1998 due to reduction in rinderpest incidence. This is one of the greatest contributions of veterinary scientists to crop production and dairy development programmes in India after Independence (Uppal
