<p id="Par50">There are several examples of naturally occurring mild strains of viruses in the host species or other species which have been used as vaccine candidates. Herpes virus of turkeys (HVT) has been successfully used as vaccine against Marek’s disease (a cancerous disease) by administering the vaccine in day-old chicks before they get a chance of infection with the virulent Marek’s disease virus (MDV) from the environment. A naturally occurring mild strain of Ranikhet disease virus isolated from pigs in India had been successfully used as vaccine for providing protection against this disease. Similarly, avirulent infectious laryngotracheitis (ILT) virus isolated from apparently healthy chickens in India probably provides natural immunity to birds against the virulent strain of the virus.</p>
