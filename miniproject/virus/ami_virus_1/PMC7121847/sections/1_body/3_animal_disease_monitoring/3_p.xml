<p id="Par17">The livestock sector in India, known for its magnificent animal wealth, has been recognized as a potential solution for addressing the national nutritional insecurity and an ideal platform for addressing the unemployment problem in women and youth. Livestock rearing is central to the livelihoods and nutritional security of millions of small and marginal farmers and landless agricultural labours across the country. India is blessed with rich livestock resources with diverse species, breeds and strains and impressive production performance. It has the world’s largest bovine dairy herd of around 300 million comprising of cows and buffaloes and stands first in milk production globally since about two decades (1998 onwards). Among the many areas of concern that limit the realization of the full potential of the livestock sector, the rising and unescapable outbreaks of viral diseases among animals are posing considerable challenges to livestock health and production. Although exact estimates due to various viral diseases to livestock industry are not available due to inadequate reporting of the disease outbreaks, the viral diseases are most important as they cause heavy economic losses through morbidity, mortality and other direct and indirect costs on treatment, hygiene, disinfection and sanitary measures; loss in production, reproduction and working capacity of animal; and replacement costs of stock. Unlike bacterial, fungal, parasitic and mycoplasma diseases, non-availability of cost-effective antiviral drug therapy, rapid spread, etc., make the task of their control more difficult.</p>
