<p id="Par15">In India, the ICAR-National Institute of Veterinary Epidemiology and Disease Informatics (NIVEDI), Bengaluru, is responsible for livestock disease informatics, seromonitoring of important livestock diseases, forecasting and forewarning, as well as to assess the economic losses due to animal diseases. An innovative epidemiological software, the National Animal Disease Referral Expert System (NADRES), was developed at the institute as a web-based dynamic and interactive disease relational database supported by geographic information system (

To suit the needs of veterinary epidemiology in India, EpiInfo© software of CDC Atlanta, USA, has been considered. An access-based software for ‘National Livestock Serum Repository’ (India.admasEpitrak – an exclusive epidemiology offline software) has also been created at this institute.
