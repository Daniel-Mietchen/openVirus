<p id="Par58">A common concept is that vaccinated animals pose no risk of spreading the disease to susceptible animals. However, it may not be always so, particularly while using inactivated vaccines and the route of infection is respiratory tract, because inactivated vaccines elicit a poor secretary IgA response which is not adequate to neutralize the virus in the respiratory tract. As a result, the virulent virus if contracted may be harboured in the respiratory tract of the host. Equine influenza and FMD viruses can be cited as examples. The FMD and influenza viruses may persist in the respiratory tract of vaccinated animals due to partial immunity. The FMD virus has been detected in the oesopharyngeal fluid for several months. Similarly, the presence of rabies virus in a few dogs as long as up to 2Â years without showing any symptom necessitated the need to revise the policy of recommending vaccination even after the bite of a person by an apparently normal dog.</p>
