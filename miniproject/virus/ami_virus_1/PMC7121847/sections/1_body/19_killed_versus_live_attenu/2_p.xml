<p id="Par57">When a particular virus affects multiple species, it should be ensured that the attenuated vaccine candidate strain is non-pathogenic to all the susceptible species. In case of FMD virus which affects a number of ruminants and other species, it has been observed that after passage of the virus in cell culture while it became attenuated for one species, it remained pathogenic or became more virulent to other susceptible species. As a result, no safe live vaccine could be developed against FMD.</p>
