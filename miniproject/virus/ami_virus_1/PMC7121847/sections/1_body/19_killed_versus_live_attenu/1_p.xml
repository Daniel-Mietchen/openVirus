<p id="Par56">Both inactivated and live modified vaccines have merits and demerits. While live vaccines induce long-lasting immunity, are easy to produce at a large scale and require freeze-drying and cold chain during storage and transport, there is remote possibility of the attenuated virus to revert back to become virulent; the killed vaccines on the other hand have weak immunogenicity and require frequent booster doses, costly adjuvants and more space for storage and transport. When the incidence of the disease is high and infection is endemic, live vaccines should be preferred. However, killed vaccines may be preferred when the incidence has come down to become negligible after stamping out policy or using live vaccine initially. In case safe live vaccine is not available against a particular virus, the use of killed vaccine is the only alternative left.</p>
