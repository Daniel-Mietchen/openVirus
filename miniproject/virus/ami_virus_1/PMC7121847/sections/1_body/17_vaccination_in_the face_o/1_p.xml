<p id="Par54">The objective of vaccination usually had been prophylactic, i.e. to impart specific acquired immunity in the host against a potent pathogen in advance, in case the host animal or human is exposed to that particular pathogen in the near future. Under field conditions, a question is usually asked: if the host is already showing the symptoms of the disease, in that case, should vaccination be undertaken or not? The simple answer is ‘no’ as the antigen(s) present in the vaccine may make the host more susceptible to the disease as a result of the neutralization of existing humoral antibodies/immunity and diversion of the host immune system to respond to non-immunogenic proteins in the vaccine will weaken the immune response against the vaccine. However, if the disease occurrence (outbreak) is detected in a closed (animal farm) or defined herd and we are able to detect and diagnose in the beginning, vaccination can be attempted with certain conditions. The first author has experienced handling an outbreak in a dairy farm of the institute, having about a hundred cows. On day 1, one cow was reported to be sick with high fever. Examination of the herd revealed that only one cow was having fever as well as lesions of FMD. Only one cow had fever but no lesions in the foot or mouth. Examination of the material collected from the foot-and-mouth lesions of the diseased cow confirmed an FMD virus antigen. The remaining cows in the herd were apparently normal and had no fever or FMD lesions. Two sick cows were separated at the farm. The remaining cows were administered inactivated aluminium hydroxide gel FMD vaccine. The sheds, dung, urine, fodder and feed waste were thoroughly decontaminated with 4% sodium carbonate (Na2 CO3) disinfectant before disposal for a week. The interior of the animal sheds including mangers, floor, walls and roof were also disinfected similarly. The milk was properly boiled before feeding to the suckling calves or discarded. This exercise proved effective as no further case of the disease was detected at the infected farm or in other dairy units or experimental animals maintained at the campus. The success may be attributed to the availability of expertise, diagnostic facilities and vaccine, taking prompt decision and action in dealing with the outbreak. Another situation is with rabies subsequent to the bite of a rabid animal; in that case, vaccination is recommended irrespective of the fact whether the animal had been earlier vaccinated against rabies or not. This type of vaccination practiced in rabies is termed as ‘therapeutic’ vaccination.</p>
