<p id="Par53">Information on the excretion of the virus from body fluids, exhaled air, feathers, etc., is of vital importance in disease management. For example, knowledge that BHV1 virus is excreted intermittently in the semen of bulls can be helpful in using the semen of elite bulls after testing of the semen of the ejaculates found negative by PCR test for freedom from virus. Information that Zika and Ebola viruses may be excreted in the semen for about 6Â months is of vital importance in planning appropriate strategies for control of the disease. Similarly, information on the survival of the virus in nature at ambient temperatures, urine, blood, soil, air, water (tap water, canal water), sewerage, vector (if applicable) and common disinfectants can be used with advantage in disease control strategies.</p>
