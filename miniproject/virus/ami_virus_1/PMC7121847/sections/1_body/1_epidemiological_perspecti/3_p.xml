<p id="Par6">The interactions between the host, pathogen and environment are known to influence the epidemiology of the disease. Numerous factors are known to influence the epidemiology of disease, such as sex; age; nutrition; immune status of the host; climatic conditions (heat, cold, humidity, wind velocity, ambient temperatures); role of vectors; survival of virus in nature; duration and extent of excretion of virus from infected host; reservoirs/carriers of the infectious agent; susceptibility of the pathogen to common disinfectants; reactivation of latent viral infection under immune suppression; vaccination campaigns; presence of naturally occurring attenuated strain of virus in the population; spillover of the infectious agent/virus from their natural niches due to encroachments; developmental projects for laying railway tracts, roads, etc., leading to mixing of human and domestic animal populations with wildlife; ecological changes on account of deforestation and making dams, canals, etc.; antigenic multiplicity/stability of the virus; intimate contact of humans and livestock with wildlife/wildlife products; social/religious customs; and extent of the availability of funding for capacity building.</p>
