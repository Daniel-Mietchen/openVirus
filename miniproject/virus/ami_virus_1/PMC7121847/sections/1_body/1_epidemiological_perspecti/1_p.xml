<p id="Par4">Animal viral diseases inflict heavy economic losses globally in livestock, poultry and humans. The term ‘epidemiology’ originated in the last part of the nineteenth century from the Greek word ‘epidēmia’, meaning ‘the knowledge of the prevalence of disease’. Different definitions have been coined for ‘epidemiology’. The simplest definition describes epidemiology as ‘the scientific study of the spread and control of disease in populations’. In other definitions, it has been described as the ‘branch of medicine which deals with the incidence, distribution, and possible control of diseases and other factors relating to health’ or ‘the study and analysis of the distribution and determinants of health and disease conditions in defined populations’. Epidemiology has been classified as descriptive epidemiology, analytical epidemiology, spatial epidemiology, landscape epidemiology, temporal epidemiology, local and global epidemiology, molecular epidemiology and applied epidemiology. The data collected on the epidemiology of important livestock diseases is of immense use in formulating appropriate disease control and management strategies.</p>
