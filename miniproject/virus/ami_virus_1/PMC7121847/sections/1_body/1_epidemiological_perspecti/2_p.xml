<p id="Par5">The technological advances made in proteogenomics and immunomics have showed the way for understanding the genetic basis of host–pathogen interactions influencing the host immune response. New proteomic approaches including T-cell and B-cell epitope mapping have given a boost to the pace to discover antigen–antibody relationships, thus giving a push to the development of newer diagnostics and vaccines for infectious diseases. Innovations in genomic technologies have paved the way for unravelling interactions between the microorganisms and cells of the innate immune system. The advent of molecular techniques in recent decades has made visible impact on the study of the epidemiology and resultant boost to the understanding of disease dynamics, aetiology, diagnosis and charting of suitable control measures at faster speed. A large number of molecular techniques have been developed and used to address epidemiological concerns. Different techniques are now available for different aspects of investigations (Joshi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2013</xref>). At the core of ‘molecular epidemiology’ is the need for high accuracy and specificity in typing the disease-causing agents; to monitor the spread of pathogens in populations and different species and regions; to trace back the original source of the causal agent; to study variations in the antigenicity, pathogenicity and immunogenicity; to differentiate between enzootic and panzootic infections; to discern the mode of transmission of the causative viral agent from host to host; and to sense the existence of strain variants in the vulnerable population and/or individual, besides addressing other epidemiological parameters and issues (Chakraborty et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2014</xref>; Singh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2017</xref>). Availability of newer innovative molecular technologies in recent years has revolutionized the study of patho-immunobiology and understanding the disease dynamics, leading to better diagnostics and vaccines. Molecular subtyping, being more discriminating, is considered to be better than most of the phenotypic subtyping methods as it is least influenced by the organism’s responses to environmental factors.
