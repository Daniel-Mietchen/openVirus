<p id="Par42">While dealing with the control and management of viral diseases/infections in animal populations, the greatest obstacle is posed by the emergence of antigenic and/or genetic variants of the existing virus types resulting into new types, subtypes, genotypes, clades and lineages, etc. which may not be covered by the existing vaccines in vogue in providing adequate protection leading to vaccine failures. This necessitates redesigning and updating of the vaccines to include the new antigenic variants. Compared to DNA viruses, RNA viruses are more prone to such changes due to their inherent biology, such as segmented genome and possibility of exchange of genes from related virus types resulting into recombination and reassortment. These changes in influenza viruses are described as antigenic drift (gradual minor changes) and antigenic shift (major antigenic alterations). Thus, the need for continuous surveillance and monitoring of virus types in the population and updating of the vaccines becomes a costly and time-consuming proposition. It would be appropriate here to mention the phenomenon of ‘antigenic sin’ in case of influenza viruses where the infection of a new type of virus may give rise/boost up a detectable HI antibody response against a previous heterologous type/subtype infection. Such findings may confuse in arriving at correct diagnosis based on antibody detection alone.</p>
