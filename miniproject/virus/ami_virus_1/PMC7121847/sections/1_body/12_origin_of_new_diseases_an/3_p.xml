<p id="Par45">New viral diseases may arise due to the broadening of the host range of the virus influenced by the genetic makeup of the virus, mutation rates, transmission mechanism such as direct contact transmission or indirect transmission involving vectors (insects, rodents, monkeys, etc.) and reservoir host(s) and the possibility of the new host to acquire receptors of the virus as a result of the coinfection of mammalian or avian hosts with RNA viruses having segmented genome. The best example is provided by influenza viruses when a prevailing human influenza virus and an avian influenza virus coinfect pig, an intermediate host, which has receptors for surface HA antigens of both human and avian viruses. Thus, reassortment of the genetic material of two viruses in the intermediate host could give rise to a new strain that can infect humans leading to pandemics. There have been instances when coinfection of avian virus and influenza viruses of horses resulted in the development of new virulent strains due to genetic shift as a result of genetic reassortment or recombination. The identification of the conditions involving the host, pathogen and the environment, combinations and sequences of events that are likely to change the pattern of infections under a particular set of circumstances, is crucial in understanding and combating viral diseases.</p>
