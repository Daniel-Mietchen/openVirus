<p id="Par43">Another phenomenon faced by the virologists is the encounter/spread of new infections, diseases from their natural niches (mostly forests, mountains) to new territories and new hosts due to climate change or other conditions leading to close contact of humans and animals with the pathogen(s) under changed conditions. A few examples in this regard include the spread of fox rabies in Europe to human inhabitations due to forcing out of foxes from forest areas as a result of their higher population density. Similarly, in India where jackals serve as important wildlife reservoir of rabies virus, the disease spreads to urban cycle at the beginning of the monsoon when the jackals are forced to come out of their dens (due to filling with rainwater) in the foothills of the Himalayas forcing them to move to nearby human habitations/villages, thus coming into contact with stray dogs. Fights between dogs and jackals lead to the transmission of the rabies virus from jackals (sylvatic cycle) to urban cycle. In the case of bluetongue disease of sheep and goats, there is now proven evidence that the rising temperatures due to climate change have facilitated the spread of the
