<p id="Par49">Immunosuppression due to cortisone therapy, stress of work, pregnancy, higher production and toxicity due to heavy metals, aflatoxin and other mycotoxins is known to make animals more susceptible to diseases. These conditions also reduce the immune response to vaccination. As parasitic infection/infestation leads to debility of the host and intracellular protozoon parasites cause immunosuppression of the host, it is advisable to deworm animals about 2–3 weeks before administering the vaccine. After giving PPR vaccine to sheep and goats, the animals should not be transported or moved to long distances for 3–4 weeks to avoid stress.</p>
