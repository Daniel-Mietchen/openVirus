<p id="Par48">Some viruses, including herpes viruses, undergo two phases inside the host, which include the active stage characterized by the multiplication of virus and expression of disease symptoms. In the second phase, i.e. the ‘latent phase’, the nucleic acid of the virus gets integrated with the host cell genome. It is believed that this phase, characterized by the absence of virus multiplication, does no harm to the host. However, whether integration of the virus genetic material/genes with the host genome influences the expression of host genes is a subject for further research. After primary infection, human beta herpesvirus (HHV-6) may establish lifelong latency by integrating with the cellular DNA. The latent virus can be activated under certain conditions, such as immunodeficiency/immunosuppression. Recent studies suggest that HHV-6 is suspected to play a role in the pathogenesis of several diseases of the central nervous system. MicroRNAs produced during active infection and reactivation can prove as biomarkers for this virus. The latent viruses pose challenges in the diagnosis in the dormant phase, control of the disease or establishing disease-free herds.</p>
