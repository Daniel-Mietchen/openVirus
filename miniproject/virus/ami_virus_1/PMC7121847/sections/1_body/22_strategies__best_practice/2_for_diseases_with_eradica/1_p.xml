<p id="Par62">So far only one viral disease of animals, namely, rinderpest, has been eradicated from India as well as globally. Besides this, African horse sickness (AHS) has also been eradicated from India. Thus, India needs to be prepared for tackling both of these diseases in an emergency situation, preferably using non-infectious diagnostics and vaccines, if these diseases re-emerge. There must be availability of modernized laboratories for quick detection of the etiological agent with skilled manpower. There is need to keep biological material of value, such as vaccine strains, virulent viruses for challenge and antisera under strict biocontainments in BSL III and BSL IV facilities with periodic checkup by FAO/OIE experts/national consultants, or destroyed if so decided. There is also a need to have technical competence and preparedness to develop appropriate vaccine using reverse genetic engineering.</p>
