<p id="Par30">In the present scenario of constantly increasing worldwide population, urbanization; globalization; industrialization; mutable lifestyles and food habits; tourism; intensified animal farming; ecological and biodiversity changes; emerging antimicrobial/drug resistance, coupled with lack of effective, safer and cost-effective treatment regimens and vaccines; immunosuppression due to multiple factors; and global warming are resulting in higher susceptibility of the host to the pathogen(s) and vaccine failures. This emphasizes the development of the ‘One World, One Health’ concept using multidisciplinary, regional and international networking to counter economically important, emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases of humans, livestock and poultry. The important infectious diseases/pathogens to be tackled include FMD, PPR, coronavirus, rotavirus, parvovirus, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR), bluetongue, toroviruses, infectious bursal disease (IBD), avian influenza, Newcastle disease (ND), Marek’s disease (MD), avian infectious bronchitis (IB), chicken infectious anaemia (CIA) and hydropericardium syndrome. Additionally, there is a need to counter several pathogens of zoonotic significance including rabies virus, Rift Valley fever, West Nile virus, avian influenza A (bird flu), swine influenza A virus (H1N1), viral encephalitis, Crimean–Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF), Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola and Zika viruses.</p>
