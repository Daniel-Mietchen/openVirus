<p id="Par28">Viral zoonotic diseases of animal origin also pose threat to human welfare and livelihood through morbidity, mortality, reduced nutrition and working capacity. The explosive growth in human population, increasing urbanization, high density of livestock and poultry populations in modern livestock farms, environmental degradation, deforestation, contact with wildlife and climatic changes are some of the factors responsible for emergence of zoonotic diseases in recent decades (Dhama et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2018</xref>). The chances of a spillover of a pathogen from domestic or wildlife species are more in countries where the public health infrastructure is suboptimal and the interaction between humans and animals is more intimate. The hotspots for infectious disease emergence are generally places where wildlife, livestock and human interactions are more frequent. This is best exemplified by the emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia and SARS in Guangdong Province of China. As per a report (Mapping of Poverty and Likely Zoonoses Hotspots, 2012) from the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI), Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania (Africa) and India (Asia) exhibit the highest disease burden of zoonoses, with parallel illness and death. The zoonotic diseases cost US $ 6.7Â billion a year worldwide.
