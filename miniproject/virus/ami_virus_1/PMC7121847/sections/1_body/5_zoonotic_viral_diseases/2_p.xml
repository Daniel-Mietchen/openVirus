<p id="Par29">There are more than 1000 known animal pathogens, of which about 40% pathogens of domesticated livestock species and 70% of domestic carnivores have zoonotic potential. Though at present only 11–18% of zoonotic pathogens from domestic livestock and carnivores are viruses, a significantly high number (55–59%) of emerging zoonotic pathogens are viruses. Approximately, 90 novel human pathogens were discovered during the last 30 years, averaging 3 per year, 66% of which were viruses, and more than 80% of these are RNA viruses. The propensity for emergence of new variants of RNA viruses is very high because of their small and segmented genome, rapid rate of multiplication and polymerase enzymes that lack proofreading capability. As a result, these viruses are more prone to exchange genetic material from related viruses when coinfecting the host by recombination or reassortment events. Pathogens that can infect multiple species and those that find a closely related host species in close proximity can jump species under suitable conditions and may cause the emergence of a new disease which may lead to epidemics/pandemics. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie, caused by prions, are examples of species jumping. Feeding of cows on scrapie-infected sheep offal and meat meals in the UK resulted in the development of BSE or mad cow disease. Subsequently, consumption of beef from BSE-affected cows in people developed another version of this disease, namely, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.</p>
