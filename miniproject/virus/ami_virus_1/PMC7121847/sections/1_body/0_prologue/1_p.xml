<p id="Par2">Ever since the identification of the causative agent of tobacco mosaic disease in plants, as a filterable agent (later named as ‘virus’) by D. Ivanovsky, a Russian scientist in 1892, marking the beginning of the science of ‘virology’, the fascinating field of virology has progressed and benefitted mankind globally. Subsequent to the isolation of the first plant virus, namely, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the first animal virus – foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) virus – was reported in 1897 by Loeffler and Frosch (

In India, animal virology started around 1900 with research work on rinderpest (cattle plague) at the Imperial Bacteriological Laboratory, Mukteswar (now Indian Veterinary Research Institute), Izatnagar/Mukteswar. One of the most important achievements for Indian animal virologists was the development of vaccines that proved efficient and safe. These were used for rinderpest and African horse sickness (AHS) eradication programmes (Yadav
