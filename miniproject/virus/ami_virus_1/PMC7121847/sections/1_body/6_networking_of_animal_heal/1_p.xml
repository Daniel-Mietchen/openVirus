<p id="Par32">The advent of geographical information system (GIS) has proved of great help for efficient disease detection, reporting and recording among populations, cluster analysis, spread of infections and their modelling, assessment of outbreak magnitude and planning of efficient and effective control strategies. The GIS is of immense help for mapping the location of herds/flocks and other related parameters. Use of GIS has greatly facilitated the knowledge of epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and researchers. Multidisciplinary efforts are required to realize the ‘One World, One Health’ concept at global, national and local levels in the overall interest of our society. A number of crucial issues at the global level, such as rapid population growth, emerging antibiotic resistance, climate change and global warming, international trade and travel, food safety, migration of people from rural to urban areas, biosecurity and biosafety concerns, ecotourism and disease surveillance and monitoring, have underlined the importance of networking of these programmes for faster solutions. Increasing risk for the emergence/re-emergence of deadly/debilitating zoonotic diseases including rabies, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, Nipah virus infection, tuberculosis and brucellosis has led to advancement of novel diagnostic techniques and vaccines and contributed immensely to human and animal health impacting global health as a whole. FAO of the United Nations has established linkages with various funding institutions at regional levels in various parts of world through GIS. It ultimately led to engagement of manpower as well as investment for strengthening of veterinary services along with the whole spectrum of disciplines leading to the protection and promotion of animal health.</p>
