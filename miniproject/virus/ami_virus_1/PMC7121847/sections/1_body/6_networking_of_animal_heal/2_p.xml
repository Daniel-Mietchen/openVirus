<p id="Par33">Efficiency of control programme for viral diseases will depend on several factors, such as rapid and accurate diagnosis of the disease, incidence and/or prevalence, molecular epidemiology of the disease to understand antigenic variation at protein or gene level, choice of the diagnostic test and stage of the disease, correct interpretation of the test results and decision regarding undertaking control and preventive measures including vaccination, disinfection, stamping out, type of vaccine (live modified, killed, adjuvanted), adjuvant used in the vaccine and duration of immunity, route of vaccination, extent of humoral and CMI response induced, frequency of booster vaccination, affordability and availability of vaccine and cold chain availability under field conditions. For ease of vaccination and reducing the stress to the animals and the vaccinator in controlling the animals, in future combined vaccines, multiple vaccines – peptide, split, thermostable, and recombinant vaccines – will be more in demand. Similarly, intradermal and pressure vaccination may become a common practice. Vaccination in advance stage of pregnancy should not be practiced to avoid immune tolerance in the newborn. Merits/demerits of in ovo vaccination in poultry also deserve due consideration, as the newborn chicks get antibodies from the mother hen through the yolk.</p>
