<p id="Par55">In classical textbooks, vaccination in the last quarter of pregnancy is not recommended. One of the reasons is the possibility of abortion while using live vaccines. The possibility of the foetus/newborn developing immune tolerance against the vaccine virus was another consideration. Another view held is that vaccination of pregnant animals in late pregnancy diverts the protein synthesis towards immunoglobulins against vaccine antigens rather than synthesizing the proteins required for the development of the foetus. Thus, it is detrimental for the health of the foetus as well as the newborn. However, there is a need to study the immunobiology of vaccination of animals in the last quarter of pregnancy and its possible effect on the foetus/newborn in response to killed as well as live vaccines.</p>
