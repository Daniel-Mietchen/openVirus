<p id="Par38">Institution of appropriate timely biosecurity methods is important for preservation and improvement of animal health in order to minimize the risks from infectious diseases. Lapses in biosecurity in the management of livestock and poultry are often responsible for higher incidence of infectious and zoonotic diseases of animals. This is more so in case of viral diseases of animals and poultry. Close contacts between animals, wildlife and humans will facilitate the spread of viral and other infectious diseases. The emergence of new viral diseases/infections, such as Rift Valley fever, West Nile fever, SARS-coronavirus, Hendra virus, avian influenza A H5N1, Nipah virus, Zika virus and swine influenza A (H1N1) virus, from time to time is a glaring example of zoonotic disease threats adversely affecting animal health and public health, national economies and food and nutrition security globally. Due to breach in the biosecurity, deadly viral diseases like FMD had re-surfaced in countries which were having disease-free status for decades. Disease incursions through imported livestock and poultry, fish and their products in the past in India have been responsible for the introduction of a number of diseases like PPR, bluetongue, IBR, IBD, CIA and classical swine fever (CSF) in India. AHS was responsible in the death of around 3,00,000 equines between 1959 and 1961 in Asia including India and other countries (Kumar

Subsequent to its first occurrence in 1996 in China, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A virus H5N1 has affected more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe, Africa and North America. The virus affected wild birds as well as domestic poultry. Sporadic cases of transmission to humans in close contact of infected birds with sizeable mortality raised pandemic concern of ‘bird flu’. Since the first reporting of H5N1 virus from India and Bangladesh in 2006 and 2007, respectively, both these countries are experiencing outbreaks almost every year. The zoonotic disease outbreaks due to animal pathogens underline their double-sword action on animal human health, livelihoods of livestock farmers and food and nutritional security and safety.
