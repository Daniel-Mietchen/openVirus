<p id="Par7">Viral infections have been identified as an important cause for inflicting huge losses worldwide in food/work/companion animals, including sheep, goats, cattle, buffaloes, equines, camel, yaks, mithun, canines, pigs, poultry and fish. In the last 40 years, the world has witnessed the emergence of a number of new viral diseases in animals, humans and plants in various parts of the world with more severe consequences due to ecological, demographic and climatic changes. While about 60% of the infections are zoonotic, 75% of new viral diseases reported during the last three decades are zoonoses, i.e. transmissible between animals and humans. Interplay of host, pathogen and environment-related factors in the epidemiology of diseases justifies to cover viral and other infections under the ‘One World, One Health’ umbrella. Timely detection and accurate diagnosis of the viral aetiologies allows better selection and adoption of appropriate and timely management practices including prophylactic vaccination of the susceptible population or therapeutic vaccination in the affected livestock population. Therefore, development/standardization of diagnostic techniques which are reliable, time-efficient, cost-effective, sensitive, specific and feasible under field conditions is of utmost importance for prevention, control, eradication, monitoring and forecasting of infectious and contagious diseases (Dhama et al.
