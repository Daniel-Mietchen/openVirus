<p id="Par12">To keep pace with the recent advancements in the diagnostic arena, researchers are working on biosensor-based diagnostic platforms. In this direction, research work on the development of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) optical sensor-based label-free diagnostic assays has been initiated, and biosensor assays for detecting PPR virus and specific antibodies in clinical samples have been optimized recently (Rout et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). The technique is advantageous because it can quantitatively detect the target in real time within less than 10 min and also can automatically analyse a number of samples in high-throughput manner to provide rapid and confirmatory diagnosis of this disease. Efforts need to be directed towards developing this type of label-free biosensor assays for other viral diseases of livestock also.
