<p id="Par14">For accurate and rapid diagnosis, capacity building of diagnostic laboratories adopting GLP, trained human resource, biosafety and containment facility according to the category of the virus being handled in the laboratory are prerequisite for checking spillover of the infectious agents from the laboratory to the environment or posing risk to the laboratory staff, when dealing with zoonotic agents. Development of indigenous diagnostic reagents, kits, vaccines and DIVA test-compliant vaccines is required for cost-effectiveness and better immune response and interpretation of vaccinal immunity and efficacy of mass vaccination campaigns in hand (Rout et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2014</xref>). Harmonization of the diagnostic tests, reagents and SOPs between the laboratories in networking mode is a must exercise to be followed for comparative results. Development of thermo-resistant vaccines will have added advantage in tropical countries having problems in maintaining cold chain in rural areas. Thus, as far as possible, innocuous reagents and reverse genetics should be used for the development of diagnostic tests and/or vaccines.
