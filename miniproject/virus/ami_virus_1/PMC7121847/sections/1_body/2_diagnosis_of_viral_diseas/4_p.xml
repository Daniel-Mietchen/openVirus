<p id="Par10">Further, advances in biomedical instrumentation techniques and nanobiotechnology have led to the development of microarray, biochips and biosensor platforms that have revolutionized the modern-day diagnostics, and fully automated small micro devices have become a reality for providing instant ‘point-of-care’ (PoC) diagnosis (Rout et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2018</xref>). Apart from being very sensitive, specific and quick, these can also be used even if the pathogen has lost infectivity. With these techniques it is possible to differentiate closely related organisms directly from clinical samples. These technologies can be used to pinpoint the origin/evolution of the pathogen, making them very powerful tools for studying epidemiology. The present era also demands highly sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective, labour-friendly and off-the-shelf, pen-side diagnostic assays for diagnosing metabolic disorders and infectious diseases. With a plethora of decisive advantages, the nanodiagnostics are proving to be a promising substitute to in-use diagnostic techniques. The prospective applications of nanodiagnostics are manifold. To name a few, these have an edge in the area of detecting infectious agents, tumours, intracellular and tissue imaging, immunohistochemistry, multiplexed diagnostics and fluoroimmunoassays. The increasing use of quantum dots, decorated gold nanospheres and nanoshells, nanobarcodes and nanobiosensors in the field of diagnostics is quickly taking over diagnostic techniques of the past as these provide accurate, faster and sensitive monitoring and surveillance tools and intensify network approaches assisting greatly in formulating effective disease prevention and control strategies. The microfluidic technology offers as a cost-effective substitute for disease diagnosis in the field.
