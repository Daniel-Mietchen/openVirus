<p id="Par13">Among the antigen/antibody detection-based tests, ELISA and its modifications, namely, DIVA C-ELISA, IC-ELISA, sandwich ELISA, strip ELISA, dot ELISA, immune stick ELISA, liquid-phase blocking ELISA and pen-side diagnostic kits, have advanced the identification and management of viral infections globally. The metagenomic approach has opened a unique method for the detection of hitherto unknown/unexpected infectious viruses, variants of existing viruses and other pathogens. Recently, several new novel viruses, namely, bocaviruses, torque teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and kobuviruses, have been identified in porcine disease syndromes. Nowadays, in veterinary diagnostic virology, the metagenomic approach of detecting viral pathogens is becoming a useful cultivation-independent tool.</p>
