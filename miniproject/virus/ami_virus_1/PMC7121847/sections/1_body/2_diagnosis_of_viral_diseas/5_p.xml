<p id="Par11">The nanodiagnostics have a promising future to shift the paradigm from organized laboratories and skilled personnel to point-of-care testing and lab-on-chip technologies, which are user-friendly and can provide instant diagnosis right at the doorstep of livestock owners. One of the prerequisites for developing any farmer-friendly diagnostic assay is to use the reagents that do not require any cold chain facilities. In this direction, colloidal nanogold particles fabricated with either antigens or antibodies have been used for developing field diagnostic assays for animal diseases. The immuno-comb assay has been developed for rapidly detecting PPR virus-specific antibodies in serum samples. Similarly, colloidal gold particles fabricated with antibodies have been used to detect the PPR virus in a lateral flow assay. Both these diagnostics can be used at the doorstep of farmers without requiring the use of any sophisticated instrumentation. Recently, peptide, nucleic acid and colloidal gold nanoparticle-based visual diagnostic assay has been developed for Newcastle disease virus.</p>
