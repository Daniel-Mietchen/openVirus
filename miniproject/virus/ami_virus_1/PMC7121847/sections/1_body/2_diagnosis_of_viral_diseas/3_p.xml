<p id="Par9">Advances in molecular biology and recent knowledge of virus pathogenesis have paved the way for the development of highly sensitive and specific nucleic acid-based detection systems for many viral diseases. By using advanced state-of-the-art modern tools, the detection of animal pathogens has become more reliable and rapid. Molecular tools and techniques are commonly used nowadays for detection, differentiation, characterization, monitoring, pathogenicity study, and analysis of epidemiological status to assess the genomic relationship or variations and tracing the probable origin of viral pathogens. The nucleic acid- and antigen detection-based molecular techniques are gaining preference over the conventional diagnostic tests based on demonstration of specific antibody in the serum or antigen(s) in the tissues of the host species. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and its variations (RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR with TaqMan, multiplex real-time PCR, nested RT-PCR, q-PCR, RAPD-PCR, REP-PCR), RFLP, RISA, SNP, SNR, VNTR, AFLP, polymerase spiral reaction (PSR), PCR-ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), sensor-based microarray DNA chips, immuno-biosensors, next-generation sequencing (NGS), mass spectrometry, genomic hybridization, nucleic acid probes, sequence-based typing, single nucleotide polymorphism, nucleotide sequencing, phylogenetic analysis and whole genome sequencing are used with precision. Techniques like real-time reverse transcription PCR (RRT-PCR) have made it possible for real-time detection and allowing confirmation of virus within a couple of minutes.</p>
