<p id="Par8">For the diagnosis of animal viral diseases, both conventional and molecular tools as well as new-generation diagnostic techniques are employed. Apart from observing clinical signs, postmortem lesions and histopathology, isolation and identification of the viral agent employing 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> cell culture techniques and embryonated chicken eggs, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> isolation in the host animals and demonstration of the virus particles by electron microscopy or viral proteins/nucleic acid in tissue sections or infected cells using immunofluorescence/immunoperoxidase technique are also utilized. Other conventional tests include haemagglutination, haemagglutination inhibition (HI), haemadsorption, haemadsorption inhibition (HADI), agar gel immunodiffusion, counterimmunoelectrophoresis, enzyme immunoassays, latex agglutination test (LAT), etc. These conventional disease diagnostic techniques are time consuming and laborious, and some of these even require 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> systems. Moreover, it is difficult to differentiate antigenic variants and virulent strains from classical strains by conventional methods. Therefore, it has been emphasized time and again to develop newer diagnostics with improved sensitivity and specificity which can also differentiate newly evolved pathogen types from classical or vaccine strains (Dhama et al.
