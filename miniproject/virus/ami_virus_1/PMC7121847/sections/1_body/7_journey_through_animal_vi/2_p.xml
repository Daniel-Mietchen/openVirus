<p id="Par35">Vaccine discovery, though initially made by chance due to keen observation or hit and trial method, later became a deliberate attempt to combat infectious diseases. In initial times the whole organisms were applied in scarified wounds to give the host an opportunity to mount an immune response against an infectious agent. But later more specific and safer killed or attenuated live organism-based vaccines became important in vaccine research even though the vehicles added to make the vaccines more immunogenic were causing serious health problems in the individuals given the vaccines. Availability of desired vaccines against the lethal, wasting and debilitating diseases has backed immensely the attainment of successful public health programmes. As of now, scientific challenges still exist to develop safer, effective and reliable vaccines that boost protection against the pathogens of major significance. With the recent advancement in the field of immunology and vaccinology, modern biotechnological innovative approaches are becoming available to counter such diseases.</p>
