<p id="Par36">To ameliorate these problems, recombinant DNA technology-based vaccine research gained strength and advanced the idea of gene delivery as vaccines using shotgun method, replication-defective live virus vector vaccine, single-copy virus vaccine and split, peptide and edible vaccines have been researched. Thus, vaccinology has traversed through three successive phases/eras. The first one was with initial stages using scabs or infective material of related diseases in animals to prevent re-infection. The second era started with the advent of cell culture or chicken embryo-based techniques and introduction of inactivated and attenuated viruses as vaccine, whereas the inclusion of rDNA technology in vaccine production made them to advance to the third era. The innovative technologies have transformed the concept of vaccine development and will go a long way in the generation of safer and more effective vaccines. Scientific advancements and their application will certainly provide better-quality health-based products. Based on cost-effectiveness, vaccination still remains a high priority for the prevention and control of animal diseases. These advancements in vaccine development will meaningfully lessen the prevalence of diseases in man and animals. An ideal vaccine is expected to have minimum threshold of the antigenic (immunogen) mass devoid of extraneous antigens and capable of inducing solid and long-lasting immunity.</p>
