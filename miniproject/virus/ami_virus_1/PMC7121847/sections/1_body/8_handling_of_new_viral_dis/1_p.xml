<p id="Par37">When an exotic viral disease struck a country for the first time, it may initially affect one animal, few animals or a large number of animals. The strategy to be adopted for containing the outbreak will depend on the nature of the virus, its spread, risk assessment and country legislation on disease control and prevention. Thus, there is a need to develop strategic plans for the prevention and control of exotic and transboundary animal diseases on case-to-case basis. Examples of such viral diseases from Indian perspective include African swine fever; transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in pigs; swine vesicular disease; Rift Valley fever; West Nile fever; Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE); Western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE); Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis (VEE); AHS; FMD virus types ‘C’, ‘SAT I’, ‘SAT II’ and ‘SAT III’; Nipah virus; Hendra virus; SARS-coronavirus; and prion diseases – bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) and scrapie.</p>
