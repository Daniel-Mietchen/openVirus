 <p>Begomoviruses of the 
  <italic>Geminiviridae</italic> are usually transmitted by whiteflies and rarely by mechanical inoculation. We used tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), a bipartite begomovirus, to address this issue. Most ToLCNDV isolates are not mechanically transmissible to their natural hosts. The ToLCNDV‐OM isolate, originally identified from a diseased oriental melon plant, is mechanically transmissible, while the ToLCNDV‐CB isolate, from a diseased cucumber plant, is not. Genetic swapping and pathological tests were performed to identify the molecular determinants involved in mechanical transmission. Various viral infectious clones were constructed and successfully introduced into 
  <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, oriental melon, and cucumber plants by 
  <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>‐mediated inoculation. Mechanical transmissibility was assessed via direct rub inoculation with sap prepared from infected 
  <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>. The presence or absence of viral DNA in plants was validated by PCR, Southern blotting, and in situ hybridization. The results reveal that mechanical transmissibility is associated with the movement protein (MP) of viral DNA‐B in ToLCNDV‐OM. However, the nuclear shuttle protein of DNA‐B plays no role in mechanical transmission. Analyses of infectious clones carrying a single amino acid substitution reveal that the glutamate at amino acid position 19 of MP in ToLCNDV‐OM is critical for mechanical transmissibility. The substitution of glutamate with glycine at this position in the MP of ToLCNDV‐OM abolishes mechanical transmissibility. In contrast, the substitution of glycine with glutamate at the 19th amino acid position in the MP of ToLCNDV‐CB enables mechanical transmission. This is the first time that a specific geminiviral movement protein has been identified as a determinant of mechanical transmissibility.
