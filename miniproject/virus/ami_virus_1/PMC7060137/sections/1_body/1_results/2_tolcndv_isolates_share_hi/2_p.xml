<p>The ToLCNDV‐OM isolate, originally obtained from a diseased oriental melon, could be mechanically transmitted to its host plants. In contrast, the closely related ToLCNDV‐CB isolate, originally collected from cucumber with symptoms, failed to infect 
 <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, oriental melon, or cucumber plants by mechanical sap inoculation. Similar to ToLCNDV‐OM, the ToLCNDV‐CB isolate was found to have a bipartite genome consisting of DNA‐A (2,738 nt) and DNA‐B (2,695 nt). Pairwise sequence comparisons of the ToLCNDV‐CB genome with the ToLCNDV‐OM, ToLCNDV‐severe (nonmechanically transmissible), and ToLCNDV‐potato (mechanically transmissible) genome sequences available in GenBank were conducted to determine their genetic relationships. The whole‐DNA‐A‐genome sequences of the ToLCNDV isolates shared from 92.8% to 96.5% nucleotide identity, and those of DNA‐B shared from 84.4% to 92.3% nucleotide identity. The amino acid sequences encoded by DNA‐A or DNA‐B were highly similar, with the lowest similarity found among AC4 (88.1%–91.5%) of DNA‐A and BC1 (88.7%–97.2%) of DNA‐B (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>). ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐CB showed 96.5% identity of their DNA‐A sequences and 92.3% of their DNA‐B genomes. In addition to their high sequence similarity, the two isolates were found to induce similar symptoms and present very similar host ranges (Figure
