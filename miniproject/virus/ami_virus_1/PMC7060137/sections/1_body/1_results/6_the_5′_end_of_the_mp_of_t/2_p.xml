<p>The comparison of MP amino acid sequences between ToLCNDV‐CB and ToLCNDV‐OM (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-sup-0002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) revealed that the two MPs were highly similar, differing only by four amino acid residues in the N‐terminal region and another four in the C‐terminal region (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). To identify the critical amino acid residue(s) involved in mechanical transmissibility, chimeric 
 <italic>MP</italic> genes were constructed through the combination of portions of two viral MP‐encoding genes and tested for infectivity (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The pCB1B::OM
 <sub>5′</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> clone was constructed in the DNA‐B backbone of ToLCNDV‐CB by substituting the 5′ fragment of the 
 <italic>MP</italic> gene with its ToLCNDV‐OM counterpart. pCB1B::OM
 <sub>3′</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> was generated by replacing the 3′ end of ToLCNDV‐CB 
 <italic>MP</italic> with its ToLCNDV‐OM counterpart. Similar approaches were used to construct pOM1B::CB
 <sub>5′</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> and pOM1B::CB
 <sub>3′</sub>
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic>. Combined with the corresponding DNA‐A infectious clone, all four constructs induced symptoms in 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> after agroinoculation (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>).
