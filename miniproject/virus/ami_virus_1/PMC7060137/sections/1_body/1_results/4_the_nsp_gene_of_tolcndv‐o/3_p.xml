<p>To determine the roles of NSP and MP in mechanical transmission, two infectious clones, pCB1B and pOM1B, containing a single copy of the DNA‐B genomes of the respective ToLCNDV isolates and 832‐bp  intergenic region (IR) tandem repeats, were generated (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>a). As controls, the three test species were agroinoculated with pCB2A + pCB1B or pOM2A + pOM1B, which resulted in a high disease incidence. Sap extracted from 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> infected with pOM2A + pOM1B, but not with pCB2A + pCB1B, also induced symptoms on the test plants (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b).
