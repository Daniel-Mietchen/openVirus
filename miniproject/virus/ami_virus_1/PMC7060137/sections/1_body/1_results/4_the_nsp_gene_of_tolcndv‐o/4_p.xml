<p>To confirm the role of NSP in mechanical transmission, two infectious clones, pCB1B::OM
 <italic>
  <sub>NSP</sub>
 </italic> and pOM1B::CB
 <italic>
  <sub>NSP</sub>
 </italic>, were generated by exchanging the NSP‐coding genes of two ToLCNDV isolates and tested for infectivity. The agroinoculation of the test plants with pCB2A + pCB1B::OM
 <italic>
  <sub>NSP</sub>
 </italic> or pOM2A + pOM1B::CB
 <italic>
  <sub>NSP</sub>
 </italic> resulted in symptoms on all three plant species (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Sap extracted from 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants infected with pOM2A + pOM1B::CB
 <italic>
  <sub>NSP</sub>
 </italic> mechanically infected all three plant species, and viral DNA was detectable by PCR using gene‐specific primers (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b,c). However, sap prepared from 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves infected with pCB2A + pCB1B::OM
 <italic>
  <sub>NSP</sub>
 </italic> failed to induce symptoms, and viral DNA was not detected in the test plants after rub inoculation. Thus, a role of NSP in mechanical transmissibility was ruled out in this study.
