<p>Sequence alignment has shown that the 
 <italic>NSP</italic> genes of ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐potato (both mechanically transmissible isolates) are 39 nt shorter than that of the ToLCNDV‐severe isolate, which is not mechanically transmissible (Chang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). To determine whether the addition of 39 nt at the 5′ end of the 
 <italic>NSP</italic> gene of ToLCNDV‐severe plays a negative role in mechanical transmission, the pOM1B::

 <sub>ins39</sub> clone (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a), containing an extra 39‐nt fragment from the 
 <italic>NSP</italic> gene of the ToLCNDV‐severe isolate, was constructed in the DNA‐B genome of ToLCNDV‐OM. The agroinoculation of test plants with pOM2A + pOM1B::

 <sub>ins39</sub> produced visible symptoms on two plant species following rub inoculation (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0002" ref-type="fig">2</xref>b), indicating that the addition of the 39 nt had no negative effect on mechanical transmissibility. The presence of ToLCNDV‐OM DNA‐A and DNA‐B in the mechanically infected plants was also confirmed by PCR using DNA‐specific primers. The DNA‐B primers amplified the expected 772‐bp fragment from pOM2B and 811‐bp fragment from pOM1B::
