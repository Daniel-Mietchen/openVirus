<p>Protein sequence analysis using the predictor of natural disordered regions (PONDR) revealed that the N terminus of the MP of ToLCNDV‐OM was probably a disordered region and that the counterpart in ToLCNDV‐CB was an ordered region (Figure

 <sub>(19E→G)</sub> amino acid sequence (ToLCNDV‐OM mutant), which differed only at the 19th (glycine, G) residue from that of ToLCNDV‐OM, was an ordered region. The deduced pCB1B

 <sub>(19G→E)</sub> amino acid sequence (ToLCNDV‐CB mutant), containing glutamate (E) instead of glycine at the 19th position, was a disordered region. The results suggest a close relationship between the 19th glutamate and the tertiary structure of MP in the ToLCNDV OM isolate. However, sequence alignment of MP sequences available in the database revealed that glutamate as the 19th residue was not conserved among ToLCNDV isolates. Both the ToLCNDV‐severe isolate (nonmechanically transmissible) and the ToLCNDV‐potato isolate (mechanically transmissible) exhibited glutamate as the 19th amino acid residue, indicating that glutamate alone is not sufficient to determine mechanical transmissibility.
