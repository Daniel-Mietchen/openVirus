<p>Oriental melon plants that were inoculated with ToLCNDV infectious clones developed visible symptoms at 7–10 dpi. After mechanical transmission, Southern blot analysis was performed to determine the viral titres present in oriental melon cotyledons at 0, 5, 10, and 14 dpi using a ToLCNDV‐OM 
 <italic>MP</italic> probe (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>a). Viral DNA in the form of open circular (oc) and supercoiled (sc) double‐stranded DNA as well as single‐stranded DNA (ss) could be detected in all plants immediately after sap inoculation (0 dpi). Surprisingly, viral DNA was barely detectable or undetectable at 5 dpi in all oriental melon plants except those inoculated with pCB2A + pCB1B

PCR analysis of samples prepared from apical leaves also identified the expected amplicons only in plants inoculated with the infectious constructs that were mechanically transmissible (data not shown).
