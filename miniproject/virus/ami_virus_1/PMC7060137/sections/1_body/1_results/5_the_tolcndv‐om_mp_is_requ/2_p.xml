<p>To determine the role of the ToLCNDV‐OM movement protein in mechanical transmission, two infectious clones were generated. The pCB1B::OM
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> clone was generated by replacing ToLCNDV‐CB 
 <italic>MP</italic> with ToLCNDV‐OM 
 <italic>MP</italic>. The other clone, designated pOM1B::CB
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic>, was generated by replacing ToLCNDV‐OM 
 <italic>MP</italic> with ToLCNDV‐CB 
 <italic>MP</italic>. Agroinoculation of three plant species with pCB2A + pCB1B::OM
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> or pOM2A + pOM1B::CB
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> resulted in symptoms at 7 dpi. Sap extracted from 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> plants infected with pCB2A + pCB1B::OM
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> mechanically infected the test plants (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) and viral DNA propagated, as demonstrated by PCR using gene‐specific primers for 
 <italic>NSP</italic>, 
 <italic>MP</italic> or IR (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c). However, sap prepared from 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves infected with pOM2A + pOM1B::CB
 <italic>
  <sub>MP</sub>
 </italic> failed to induce symptoms, and the virus was not detected after rub inoculation, indicating the involvement of the ToLCNDV‐OM 
 <italic>MP</italic> gene in mechanical transmission.
