<p>Because ToLCNDV‐CB was unable to infect oriental melon and 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> by mechanical sap inoculation, infectious clones of ToLCNDV‐CB DNA‐A and DNA‐B amplified via the rolling circle amplification (RCA) method were independently constructed in the binary vector pCAMBIA1304 (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) for further tests. Each clone contained two copies of the respective DNA sequences, and they were thus designated pCB2A (DNA‐A) and pCB2B (DNA‐B). The pCB2A and pCB2B infectious clones were successfully introduced into 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, oriental melon, and cucumber by agroinoculation, resulting in visible symptoms (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Viral symptoms including curling, puckering, and mosaic appeared on 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves 5–7 days post‐inoculation (dpi) and on oriental melon and cucumber leaves 7–10 dpi. However, sap prepared from diseased 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves inoculated with pCB2A and pCB2B failed to induce symptoms in any of the test plants after rub inoculation. The ToLCNDV‐OM infectious clones pOM2A and pOM2B, constructed in our previous study (Chang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), were also introduced into 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, oriental melon, and cucumber by agroinoculation and induced symptoms at similar rates and with similar magnitudes to those induced by the ToLCNDV‐CB clones. Sap prepared from the ToLCNDV‐O‐infected 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves also resulted in symptoms on the test plants following rub inoculation at incidence rates ranging from 40% to 85% (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). Viral DNA‐A and DNA‐B in the plant leaves with symptoms were monitored by PCR amplification using genome‐specific primers, resulting in products with similar intensities.
