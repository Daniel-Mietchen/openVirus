<p>To determine whether DNA‐A or DNA‐B plays a role in mechanical transmission, a combination of DNA‐A and DNA‐B from ToLCNDV‐CB and ToLCNDV‐OM was tested for infectivity via mechanical sap inoculation. When the test plants were infected with the pCB2A + pOM2B or pOM2A + pCB2B pseudorecombinants by agroinoculation, most developed symptoms at rates ranging from 83.3% to 100% (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). When sap extracted from diseased 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves infected with pCB2A + pOM2B was rub inoculated onto the test plants, many of them also developed symptoms at rates (37% to 73%) comparable to those in plants inoculated with pOM2A + pOM2B. In contrast, sap extracted from 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> infected with pOM2A + pCB2B failed to induce symptoms on the test plants after rub inoculation (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>b), indicating a role of DNA‐B from the ToLCNDV‐OM isolate in mechanical transmissibility. The presence of both DNA‐A and DNA‐B in sap‐inoculated plants was further confirmed by PCR using genome‐specific primers (Figure
