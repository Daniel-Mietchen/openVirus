<p>Sequence alignment of ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐CB MPs revealed four amino acid differences (3rd, 6th, 8th, and 19th) in the N‐terminal region (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0004" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). Site‐directed mutagenesis was performed to identify the specific amino acid residue(s) that are essential for mechanical transmissibility. Eight infectious clones, each containing a specific mutation of these four amino acids, were constructed and tested for infectivity (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0005" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Agroinoculation and rub inoculation assays revealed that infectious clones pCB1B

However, ToLCNDV‐CB became mechanically transmissible when the 19th amino acid was changed from glycine (G) to glutamate (E), as demonstrated by the pairing of pCB1B
