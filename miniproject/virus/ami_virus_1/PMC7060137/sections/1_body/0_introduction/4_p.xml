<p>The mechanisms underlying mechanical or nonmechanical transmissibility among related viruses of the same genus are of significant interest from the point of view of evolution and epidemics. The identification of the viral determinants associated with mechanical transmissibility is a critical step towards mechanistic studies. Begomoviruses have a single‐stranded circular monopartite (DNA‐A like) or bipartite (DNA‐A and DNA‐B) genome (Fauquet 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). The DNA‐A genome encodes proteins required for virus replication and encapsidation, whereas DNA‐B encodes proteins responsible for viral movement between subcellular and intercellular compartments as well as pathogenicity (Krenz 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0024" ref-type="ref">2012</xref>). Although the DNA‐B genomes of some begomoviruses have been implicated in mechanical transmission (Levy and Czosenk, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>; Wege and Pohl, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), the specific viral proteins involved in this aspect remain largely unknown.
