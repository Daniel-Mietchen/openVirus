<p>The mechanisms of the mechanical transmission of begomoviruses have not received much attention, because many of them are transmitted by whiteflies. The new ToLCNDV‐CB isolate, recently identified from a cucumber plant with symptoms, shares high genome sequence similarity with the ToLCNDV‐OM isolate. Unlike ToLCNDV‐OM, the ToLCNDV‐CB isolate cannot be transmitted to host plants by sap inoculation. In this study, genetic and pathological approaches were employed to identify the molecular determinants responsible for the mechanical transmission of ToLCNDV‐OM. Gene swapping and point mutations revealed that the 19th amino acid residue at the N‐terminus of the MP of DNA‐B plays a critical role in mechanical transmission. The results also showed that the NSP‐coding region plays no role in mechanical transmission.</p>
