<p>ToLCNDV is transmitted by whiteflies in nature. However, greenhouse tests have revealed that some ToLCNDV isolates can be mechanically transmitted by rub inoculation while others cannot. The ToLCNDV‐OM isolate, originally identified from a diseased oriental melon plant, can infect oriental melon, pickling melon, bottle gourd, cucumber, zucchini, and luffa via mechanical sap inoculation (Chang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). The ToLCNDV‐potato isolate can also be transmitted to host plants via mechanical inoculation (Usharani 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">2004</xref>). In contrast, the ToLCNDV‐severe and ToLCNDV‐cucumber isolates, which share a very similar genome organization and size with oriental melon and potato isolates, cannot be mechanically transmitted to their hosts (Padidam 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>; Samretwanich 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0036" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>). The divergent modes of mechanical transmissibility among ToLCNDV isolates may be due to the high genomic recombination and mutation rates of geminiviruses, which could lead to the emergence of a new isolate with different transmission abilities or host ranges (Chatchawankanphanich and Maxwell, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0006" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). New viral variants are often more pathogenic or can exhibit a wider host range than previously existing variants (Arguello‐Astorga 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0002" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>; Duffy and Holmes, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">2008</xref>). For example, tomato yellow leaf curl Thailand virus (TYLCTHV) is mechanically transmissible and has spread widely to become a predominant strain in Taiwan (Tsai 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0039" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). In contrast, an endogenous tomato leaf curl Taiwan virus (ToLCTWV), which is not mechanically transmissible, has become less common in the region.
