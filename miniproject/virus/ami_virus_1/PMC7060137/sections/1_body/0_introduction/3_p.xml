<p>One of the most important factors contributing to viral epidemics is the mode of transmission. Comprehensive knowledge of viral transmission mechanisms and their potential modifications during viral evolution may lead to the development of more effective preventive measures. Begomoviruses are usually transmitted by whiteflies (
