<p>DNA‐B contains both the 
 <italic>NSP</italic> and 
 <italic>MP</italic> genes. 
 <italic>NSP</italic> encodes a protein that is presumably responsible for the transportation of single‐stranded or double‐stranded DNA between the cytoplasm and the nucleus. 
 <italic>MP</italic> encodes a protein required for cell‐to‐cell movement. Although 
 <italic>NSP</italic> has been reported to be required for begomovirus virulence (Hussain 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0048" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>), a role of this gene in mechanical transmissibility was ruled out by testing the infectious clone pOM1B::
 <italic>NSP</italic>
 <sub>ins39</sub> in the present study. This clone carries an extra 39‐nt fragment from a nonmechanically transmissible isolate (ToLCNDV‐severe) at the 5′ end of ToLCNDV‐OM 
 <italic>NSP</italic>, and together with pOM2A it failed to infect 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> and oriental melon via sap inoculation. Further substitution of 
 <italic>NSP</italic> between ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐CB also ruled out the possible involvement of 
 <italic>NSP</italic> in mechanical transmission because swapping 
 <italic>NSP</italic> between these two isolates did not alter the mode of transmissibility.
