<p>In addition to MP, CP may be involved in mechanical transmissibility in ToLCNDV‐OM as demonstrated in BGMV, another member of the 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> genus. The BGMV CP has been demonstrated to be required for both mechanical and whitefly transmissions (Azzam 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0003" ref-type="ref">1994</xref>). A BGMV mutant with a defective CP fails to induce symptoms on sap inoculation, but an infection develops after the mutant is biolistically bombarded into leaf cells because biolistic inoculation can deliver the virus directly into the host nucleus. Thus, CP is required for the localization of BGMV to the nucleus. Intriguingly, the CP of two geminiviruses, mungbean yellow mosaic virus (MYMV) and ACMV, have been reported to contain a nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Unseld 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">2001</xref>; Guerra‐Peraza 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>), suggesting the involvement of CP in nuclear localization. Therefore, the difference in mechanical transmissibility between ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐CB may result from the interactions of CP and MP, which was shown not to be required for the mechanical transmission of ToLCNDV in the present study.
