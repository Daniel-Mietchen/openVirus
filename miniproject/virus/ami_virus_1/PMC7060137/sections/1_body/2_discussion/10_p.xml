<p>In conclusion, genetic experiments have clearly demonstrated that the glutamate residue at the 19th position in the N terminus of the MP of the ToLCNDV‐OM DNA‐B genome is required for mechanical transmission. Our genetic evidence also ruled out the involvement of NSP in mechanical transmission. It is very likely that MP interacts with host proteins to enable the mechanical transmission of ToLCNDV‐OM. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in the mechanical transmission of viruses could contribute to the development of more efficient strategies to manage diseases caused by begomoviruses.</p>
