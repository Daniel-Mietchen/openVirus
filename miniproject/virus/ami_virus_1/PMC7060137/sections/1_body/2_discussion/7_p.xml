<p>MP has also been implicated in intra‐ and intercellular trafficking by interacting with host proteins (Jeske, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>), which could lead to different modes of transmission as seen in different ToLCNDV isolates. AbMV MP can interact with host kinases and affect the development of symptoms and the accumulation of viral DNA in host cells (Kleinow 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). Studies have identified histone H3 (Zhou 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0049" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>), synaptotagmin (SYTA) (Lewis and Lazarowitz, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>), and the 70 kDa heat shock protein cpHSC70‐1 (Krenz 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>) as proteins that can interact with the MP of begomoviruses. Histone H3 is probably required for the assembly of the MP‐nucleoprotein complex in the nucleus. SYTA is required for cell‐to‐cell trafficking and systemic infection. The cpHSC70‐1 protein regulates the MP conformation at the cell periphery and localization to chloroplasts.
