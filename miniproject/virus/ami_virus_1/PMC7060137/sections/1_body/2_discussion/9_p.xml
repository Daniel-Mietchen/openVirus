<p>For systemic infection, ToLCNDV must be loaded into the phloem sieve tube system for long‐distance movement. ToLCNDV‐OM is able to propagate and travel through mesophyll cells, the bundle sheath, and eventually the phloem after sap inoculation, which is very rare for a geminivirus (Wang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0043" ref-type="ref">1996</xref>). In contrast, ToLCNDV‐CB apparently has to rely on the stylet of its insect vector to reach the phloem. After sap inoculation, ToLCNDV‐CB is unable to move beyond its inoculation foci, for which there may be many possible explanations. ToLCNDV‐CB may trigger plant defence, fail to manipulate plasmodesmata, and be unable to replicate. A time‐course study of viral accumulation by Southern blotting (Figure 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-fig-0006" ref-type="fig">6</xref>) revealed that ToLCNDV‐OM DNA is barely detectable or undetectable at 5 dpi in oriental melon plants and can be detected again at 10 and 14 dpi, suggesting the suppression of plant defence during the early stages of virus–plant interactions. ToLCNDV‐OM, but not ToLCNDV‐CB, might be able to overcome host defence reactions and, thus, infect the host systemically after sap inoculation.
