<p>Although the glutamate residue at the 19th position of the ToLCNDV‐OM MP plays a critical role in mechanical transmission, glutamate alone is seemingly not sufficient to determine mechanical transmissibility. Sequence alignment revealed that the MPs of both the ToLCNDV‐severe (nonmechanically transmissible) and ToLCNDV‐potato (mechanically transmissible) isolates also exhibited glutamate at the 19th position, suggesting the presence of other factors or determinants that may contribute to the mechanical transmission of ToLCNDV‐OM. This assumption is supported by findings obtained using PONDR VL‐XT. PONDR plots can be used to visualize regions within disordered regions and to determine potential binding sites in proteins (Oldfield

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). PONDR analyses suggested that the N terminus of ToLCNDV‐OM MP is a disordered region; a switch from glutamate to glycine at the 19th amino acid position changes the prediction to an ordered region. Moreover, the N terminus of ToLCNDV‐CB MP is predicted to be an ordered region; however, the sequence is predicted to be a disordered region after the substitution of glycine with glutamate at the 19th amino acid.
