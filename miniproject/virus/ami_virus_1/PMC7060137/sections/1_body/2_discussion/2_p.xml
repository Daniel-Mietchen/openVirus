<p>Begomoviruses are often transmitted by whiteflies and are rarely mechanically transmissible by rub or sap inoculation (Wege and Pohl, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0044" ref-type="ref">2007</xref>). Only a few known species in the 
 <italic>Begomovirus</italic> genus have been reported to be mechanically transmissible to their natural hosts (Gilbertson

 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">1995</xref>). In the present study, genetic and pathological approaches were applied to identify the molecular determinants involved in mechanical transmissibility in a ToLCNDV‐OM isolate originally collected from a diseased oriental melon. Unlike ToLCNDV‐OM, the closely related ToLCNDV‐CB isolate is not mechanically transmissible to oriental melon, cucumber or 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> via sap inoculation. The two ToLCNDV isolates show strong nucleotide sequence identity for both DNA‐A (96.5%) and DNA‐B (92.2%), and exhibit very similar host ranges. Genetic evidence indicates that DNA‐B of ToLCNDV‐OM plays a critical role in mechanical transmissibility, consistent with findings for TYLCTHV and abutilon mosaic virus (AbMV) (Wege and Pohl,
