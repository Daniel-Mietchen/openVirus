<p>Viral MPs are required for both cell‐to‐cell and long‐distance movements. Studies on AbMV, another geminivirus, have suggested that a so‐called “pilot domain” (amino acid residues from 1 to 49) of MP is responsible for the transportation of the virus to cell periphery or nucleus (Zhang 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0047" ref-type="ref">2002</xref>). Two models have been proposed to explain the functions of MP in geminiviruses (Rojas 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>; Jeske, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0020" ref-type="ref">2009</xref>). For phloem‐limited begomoviruses such as AbMV and cabbage leaf curl virus (CaLCuV), MP is thought to attach to the NSP‐bound viral DNA and form a complex that localizes along the plasma membrane or is transferred to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata. For mesophyll‐invading begomoviruses, MP is thought to take over viral DNA from NSP after being exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and deliver it to adjacent cells. Most nonmechanically transmissible begomoviruses have been reported to be phloem limited because they can be introduced into the phloem translocation stream through the stylets of insects and become systemic (Czosnek 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0008" ref-type="ref">2017</xref>). One of the reasons that ToLCNDV‐CB fails to be mechanically transmissible and to initiate systemic infection after sap inoculation may be its inability to travel beyond the site of inoculation. ToLCNDV‐CB is probably a phloem‐limited virus because this isolate is unable to propagate in the mesophyll after sap inoculation, as demonstrated by Southern blot and in situ hybridization analyses. In contrast, ToLCNDV‐OM is capable of replicating in mesophyll after sap inoculation.
