<p>Genetic evidence derived from a series of mutations has revealed that MP in DNA‐B contains the key determinant required for mechanical transmission in ToLCNDV‐OM. The exchange of MPs between ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐CB revealed that an infectious clone carrying ToLCNDV‐OM MP, but not ToLCNDV‐CB MP, was able to induce symptoms on three test plant species after sap inoculation. Moreover, it appears that the N terminus of DNA‐B MP contains the elements required for mechanical transmissibility. Sequence alignment revealed that ToLCNDV‐OM and ToLCNDV‐CB MPs share 97.2% similarity, differing in only eight amino acids, four of which are located in the N terminus, while the other four are located at the C terminus. The involvement of the C terminus was ruled out by DNA‐B swapping assays. The evaluation of a series of point mutations revealed that glutamate at the 19th amino acid position at the N‐terminal end of MP is critical for the mechanical transmission of ToLCNDV‐OM. Point mutations affecting the 3rd, 6th, or 8th amino acid residue of ToLCNDV‐CB or ToLCNDV‐OM did not affect the mechanical transmissibility of either isolate. Moreover, ToLCNDV‐CB, which is not mechanically transmissible, became mechanically transmissible when a point mutation at the 19th amino acid of MP caused a change from glycine (G) to glutamate (E). In contrast, changing the 19th amino acid from glutamate to glycine in ToLCNDV‐OM rendered the virus nonmechanically transmissible, which might be due to the characteristics of the amino acids, as glycine is nonpolar and glutamate is negatively charged.</p>
