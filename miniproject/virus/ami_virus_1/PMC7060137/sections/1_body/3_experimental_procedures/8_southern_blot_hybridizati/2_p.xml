<p>After mechanical inoculation, the cotyledons of oriental melon were harvested at 0, 5, 10, and 14 dpi and subjected to DNA isolation. DNA (5 μg) was subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel and transferred to a nylon membrane (PerkinElmer) via the alkaline transfer method, and hybridization was performed on the full‐length 
 <italic>MP</italic> of ToLCNDV‐OM. The probe was labelled by α‐[
 <sup>32</sup>P]dATP. The hybridization and detection of the probe were performed according to the methods described by Kon 
 <italic>et al. </italic>(
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">2003</xref>). DNA isolated from the apical leaves of oriental melon agroinoculated with ToLCNDV‐OM (pOM2A + pOM1B) or ToLCNDV‐CB (pCB2A + pCB1B) was used as a positive control.
