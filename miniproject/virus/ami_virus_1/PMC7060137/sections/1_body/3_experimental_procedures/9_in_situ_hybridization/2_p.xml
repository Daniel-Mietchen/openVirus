<p>Tissue fixation and in situ hybridization were performed following the protocol described by Takeda 
 <italic>et al. </italic>(
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0038" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>) with some modifications. 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves at 5 dpi were collected, cut into small pieces, and fixed in solution containing 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, and 5% formaldehyde (FAA) for 2 hr at room temperature. Leaf samples were soaked in 30% ethanol for 20 min and then in sterile water twice for 20 min each. The samples were soaked in Tris‐EDTA (TE) buffer (100 mM Tris‐HCl, 50 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 30 min and treated with 2 μg/ml proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were next washed with phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) (140 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na
 <sub>2</sub>HPO
 <sub>4</sub>, and 1.8 mM KH
 <sub>2</sub>PO
 <sub>4</sub>, pH 7.4) and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at 4 °C. The samples were washed with PBS again and incubated in hybridization solution for 20 min. The DNA probe was labelled and detected using a Digoxigenin (DIG)‐High Prime DNA Labeling and Detection Starter Kit I (Roche). The samples were incubated in hybridization solution containing a DIG‐labelled 
 <italic>MP</italic> probe (200 bp) at 50 °C overnight. The detection of the probe was performed via an immunological assay using alkaline phosphatase‐conjugated DIG antibodies followed by nitroblue tetrazolium and 5‐bromo‐4‐chloro‐3‐indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) colour development. Samples were photographed under a Zeiss light microscope equipped with AxioVision Rel 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss).
