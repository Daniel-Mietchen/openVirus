 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">2010</xref>). ToLCNDV‐CB (accession numbers MK883715 and MK883716) was originally isolated from a diseased cucumber in Thailand. The sequences of ToLCNDV‐OM (accession numbers GU180095 and MK883714), ToLCNDV‐severe (accession numbers U15015 and U15017) and ToLCNDV‐potato (accession numbers AY286316 and AY158080) were retrieved from the GenBank database of NCBI. Sequence alignment was conducted with the ClustalW algorithm of the MegAlign program available in Lasergene 7 software (DNASTAR).
