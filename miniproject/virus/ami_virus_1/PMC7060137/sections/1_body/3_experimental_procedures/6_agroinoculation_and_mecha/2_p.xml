<p>Infectious clones were individually transformed into 
 <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> C58 by using a GenePulser II electroporator (Bio‐Rad). Agroinoculation was conducted according to the procedure described by Llave 
 <italic>et al. </italic>(
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">2000</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, 0.5 ml of an overnight bacterial culture was recultured in 10 ml of Luria Bertani (LB) medium (pH 5.6) containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 2‐
 <italic>N</italic>‐morpholino‐ethanesulfonic acid (MES, 10 mM), and acetosyringone (AS, 0.04 mM) at 28 °C for 16 hr on a shaker set at 200 rpm. The bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min and resuspended in 10 ml of an infiltration solution (10 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.15 mM AS, pH 5.6). Agrobacteria carrying the infectious DNA‐A or DNA‐B constructs were co‐injected in equal amounts into the leaves of 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic>, oriental melon (
 <italic>C. melo</italic> “Silver Light”) or cucumber (
 <italic>C. sativus</italic> “Vantage”). After agroinoculation, 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves with symptoms (c.1 g) were collected and ground in 0.01 M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) (1:20, wt/vol). The resultant sap was inoculated onto 
 <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> leaves or cotyledon explants of oriental melon and cucumber plants by rubbing with carborundum powder. All inoculated plants were kept in a greenhouse at 25–28 °C to observe symptom development.
