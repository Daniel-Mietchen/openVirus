<p>DNA was extracted from plant leaves following the method described by Lin 
 <italic>et al. </italic>(
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">2011</xref>). PCR was performed in a 25 μl reaction containing 100 ng DNA, 20 each of the primers at nM, 0.05 mM dNTPs, 0.25 U Pro 
 <italic>Taq</italic> Plus DNA polymerase (Protech Technology) and buffer. The conditions used for amplification were as follows: one cycle at 95 °C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 50–67 °C depending on the specific primer pairs used (Table 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) for 1 min and 72 °C for 1 min, with a final cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis in a 0.8% agarose gel. Sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 3730 automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) available at the Biotechnology Center, National Chung Hsing University (Taichung, Taiwan).
