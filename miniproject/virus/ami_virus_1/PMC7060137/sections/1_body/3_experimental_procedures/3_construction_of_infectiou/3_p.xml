<p>A 39‐nt fragment was amplified by PCR using the primers FJJ2009‐26, FJJ2009‐27, and FJJ2009‐32, corresponding to sequences from the 
 <italic>NSP</italic> gene of the ToLCNDV‐severe isolate (Hussain 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, 
 <xref rid="mpp12917-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">2005</xref>). The amplicon was fused with the ToLCNDV‐OM DNA‐B fragment digested with 
 <italic>Nco</italic>I and 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I, and the resultant fragment was cloned into 
 <italic>Nco</italic>I and 
 <italic>Nhe</italic>I‐digested pGANP to create pOM2B::
