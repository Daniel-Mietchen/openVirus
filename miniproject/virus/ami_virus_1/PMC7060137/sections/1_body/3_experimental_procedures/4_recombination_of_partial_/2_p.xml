<p>Four infectious clones, each containing a chimeric MP, were constructed in the backbone of pOM1B or pCB1B. The

  <sub>MP</sub>

 <italic>Eco</italic>RV fragment (3′ end MP, 817 bp) of pCB1B was replaced with its counterpart from pOM1B to generate pCB1B::OM

 <italic>Hin</italic>dIII‐
 <italic>Pst</italic>I fragment and 
 <italic>Pst</italic>I‐
 <italic>Eco</italic>RV of pOM1B were replaced with the counterparts from pCB1B to create pOM1B::CB
