  <p>The tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV)‐OM movement protein (MP), but not nuclear shuttle protein (NSP), is required for mechanical transmission. (a) Schematic illustration of the pCB1B and pOM1B infectious clones carrying a single copy of the DNA‐B genome of the CB or OM isolate, respectively. Four additional constructs, pCB1B::OM

    <sub>NSP</sub>
   </italic>, pCB1B::OM
   <italic>
    <sub>MP</sub>
   </italic>, and pOM1B::CB
   <italic>
    <sub>MP</sub>
   </italic>, were produced by swapping the 
   <italic>BV1</italic> (encoding NSP) or 
   <italic>BC1</italic> (encoding MP) gene between two ToLCNDV isolates. The primers used for construction are indicated above each genome. (b) 
   <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic>, oriental melon, and cucumber plants after mechanical inoculation with pCB2A + pCB1B, pOM2A + pOM1B, or other infectious clones, as indicated, developed viral symptoms (O) or exhibited no symptoms (X) at 10–12 days post‐inoculation. The viral inoculum used for mechanical sap inoculation was prepared from 
   <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> with symptoms after agroinoculation with an appropriate combination of the clones. Symptoms were observed exclusively in plants inoculated with the constructs carrying the ToLCNDV‐OM 
   <italic>MP</italic> gene. (c) PCR detection of viral DNA in plants after mechanical inoculation with pCB2A + pCB1B (lanes 1, 7, and 13), pCB2A + pCB1B::OM
   <italic>
    <sub>NSP</sub>

   <italic>
    <sub>MP</sub>
   </italic> (lanes 3, 9, and 15), pOM2A + pOM1B (lanes 4, 10, and 16), pOM2A + pOM1B::CB
   <italic>
    <sub>NSP</sub>
   </italic> (lanes 5, 11, and 17), or pOM2A + pOM1B::CB
   <italic>
    <sub>MP</sub>
   </italic> (lanes 6, 12, and 18). Specific primers were used to amplify the 
   <italic>NSP</italic>, 
   <italic>MP</italic>, or intergenic region (IR) fragment from the OM or CB isolate. Amplicons were obtained only from plants inoculated with the constructs carrying the ToLCNDV‐OM 
   <italic>MP</italic> gene
