  <p>The addition of 39 nucleotides of the 
   <italic>NSP</italic> gene of the tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV)‐OM has no effect on mechanical transmissibility. (a) Physical map of the pOM1B::
   <italic>NSP</italic>
   <sub>ins39</sub> infectious clone constructed in the ToLCNDV‐OM DNA‐B genome (pOM1B) by adding an extra 39‐nt fragment (indicated by a pink box) from the 
   <italic>NSP</italic> gene of the ToLCNDV‐severe isolate by PCR using two overlapping primers (FJJ2009‐26 and FJJ2009‐27). A recognition site for the 
   <italic>Nco</italic>I endonuclease was incorporated into FJJ2009‐26 to facilitate cloning. Other primers used for cloning and the location of the intergenic region (IR) are also indicated. (b) Symptoms of 
   <italic>Nicotiana benthamiana</italic> and oriental melon after sap inoculation with wild‐type ToLCNDV‐OM (pOM2A + pOM2B) and the 
   <italic>NSP</italic> mutant (pOM2A + pOM1B::
   <italic>NSP</italic>
   <sub>ins39</sub>) at 10 days post‐inoculation. The viral inoculum used for mechanical sap inoculation was prepared from 
   <italic>N. benthamiana</italic> with symptoms after agroinoculation with an appropriate combination of the clones. (c) Detection of viral DNA using PCR. Specific primers (Table 
   <xref rid="mpp12917-sup-0004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>) were used to amplify DNA‐A (upper panel) and DNA‐B (lower panel). An 772‐bp fragment representing the DNA‐B genome of the wild‐type virus was amplified from plants mechanically inoculated with pOM2A + pOM2B (lanes 1 and 3). A 811‐bp fragment representing the DNA‐B genome of pOM1B::
   <italic>NSP</italic>
   <sub>ins39</sub> was amplified from plants inoculated with pOM2A + pOM1B::
   <italic>NSP</italic>
   <sub>ins39</sub> (lanes 2 and 4)
