<p>The objective of this study was to investigate HCV epidemiology in populations with LRDs in MENA by (1) estimating the population‐specific pooled mean HCV antibody prevalence (henceforth, HCV prevalence) in populations with LRDs; (2) identifying the predictors and trends of HCV prevalence in these populations and sources of between‐study heterogeneity; (3) assessing the correlation between HCV prevalence in the general population and in populations with LRDs; and (4) calculating the frequency and diversity of HCV genotypes in populations with LRDs. This study was performed as part of the MENA HCV Epidemiology Synthesis Project,
