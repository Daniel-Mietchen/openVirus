<p>Using the genotype subdatabase from the Synthesis Project database (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we determined the frequency of each genotype in populations with LRDs. Individuals with untypeable genotypes were excluded. Individuals with mixed genotypes contributed separately to each genotype frequency. The Shannon Diversity Index was used to evaluate the diversity of genotypes.
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0040" ref-type="ref">40</xref> Assuming maximal genotype diversity (i.e., equal contribution of all seven genotypes
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0041" ref-type="ref">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0042" ref-type="ref">42</xref>) provides the largest Shannon Diversity Index score at 1.95.
