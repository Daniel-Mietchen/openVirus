<p>Meta‐analyses were performed to pool HCV prevalence measures in populations with LRDs in Egypt, Pakistan, other MENA countries (excluding Egypt and Pakistan), and all MENA countries collectively. Meta‐analyses were performed when there were three or more prevalence measures, each of which with a sample size of 25 participants at minimum. DerSimonian‐Laird random‐effects models
