<p>Despite these limitations, a large volume of studies were identified on HCV infection in populations with LRDs, and this enabled diverse analyses and informative inferences. Notably, the meta‐regression analysis explained 49% of prevalence variation, highlighting that country (reflecting background HCV prevalence) and liver disease form (reflecting the role of HCV infection in each disease‐specific etiology) were strong predictors of HCV antibody positivity in LRD populations (Table
