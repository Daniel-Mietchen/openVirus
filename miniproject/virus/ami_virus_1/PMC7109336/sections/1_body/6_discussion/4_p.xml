<p>The launch of the national treatment program in Egypt in 2014 has put this country on track for HCV elimination by 2030, if not earlier, with a cumulative total of at least 1.5 million people being treated.
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0046" ref-type="ref">46</xref> It will probably be several years before the impact of this program on the course of the epidemic in Egypt will be clearly visible. This is the largest HCV epidemic worldwide; it became generalized at a high level following decades of population‐wide parenteral antischistosomal therapy campaigns and other health care practices

As treatment is scaled up in MENA, both HCV antibody prevalence and viremic rate in LRD populations could be used as proxies to track the progress in treatment coverage.
