<p>This study identified several gaps in evidence. The number of studies varied by country, with no studies identified for eight out of 24 MENA countries (Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>). There was large heterogeneity across identified studies. Sample size of studies varied, but there was no evidence of a small‚Äêstudy effect that would affect our findings (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The comparison of HCV prevalence in populations with LRDs to that in the general population was assumed indicative of the etiological role of HCV in the LRDs. The latter may better apply to some LRDs, such as liver cancer, rather than others, such as liver disease, where additional factors could be cofounding the association. The study is overall of a descriptive nature with the clinical implications of some of its findings being straightforward, such as the need for LRD screening in specific settings, while others, such as the scale of required health intervention, are less evident and require further evidence. We based our population classification on how authors described the populations in their original studies, therefore overlap across LRD categories cannot be ruled out in the case of misclassification (for example, suspected viral hepatitis versus acute viral hepatitis). Only eight HCV RNA studies were identified, all of which were before the launch of DAA treatment programs (Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), and the viremic rate was similar to that in different populations in MENA.
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0035" ref-type="ref">35</xref> Accordingly, the estimated viremic rate may not be representative of the rate currently in populations with LRDs in the region.
