<p>HCV appears to play a major, if not dominant, role in different liver disease forms in Egypt and Pakistan but much less so in the other MENA countries. HCV infection appears to be the main driver of HCC, cirrhosis, and other liver disease forms, reflecting the severe nature of the epidemics that have affected these two nations. Despite the rollout of interventions since the discovery of this virus, there is no evidence for a decline in HCV prevalence in LRD populations in MENA, but there is evidence of an increasing role for this infection in liver diseases in Pakistan. Of the different disease forms, the role of HCV infection appears highest for HCC and cirrhosis. Remarkably, we identified a strong association between HCV prevalence in the general population and HCV prevalence in LRD populations.</p>
