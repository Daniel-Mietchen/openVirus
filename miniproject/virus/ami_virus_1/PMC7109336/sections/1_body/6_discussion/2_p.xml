<p>HCV antibody positivity in liver diseases was found to be highest for HCC, followed closely by cirrhosis (Table

 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>), strikingly indicating a steadily growing role for this infection in liver diseases in this nation. Remarkably, there was a strong association between HCV prevalence in the general population of any country and the prevalence in LRD populations, highlighting how the role of this infection in liver diseases is a reflection of its background level in the general population. Moderate genotype diversity was observed in MENA as a whole. The most common genotypes were genotype 4 (44%) and genotype 3 (35%), which reflect the major epidemics in Egypt and Pakistan, respectively.
