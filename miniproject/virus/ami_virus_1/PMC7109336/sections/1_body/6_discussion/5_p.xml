<p>The presence of HCV infection in patients with viral hepatitis in Pakistan was found to be higher than that in Egypt (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>), despite higher HCV prevalence in all other LRD populations in Egypt (Tables 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref> and 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). This finding may be explained by the fact that HCV prevalence in patients with viral hepatitis may reflect recent HCV incidence rather than older prevalent infections and incidence has been declining rapidly in Egypt
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> but persists at high levels in Pakistan.
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref>, 
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> This finding also supports recent evidence of a rapid decline in the role of HCV in acute hepatitis in Egypt
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0051" ref-type="ref">51</xref> but the persistence of this role in Pakistan.
 <xref rid="hep41491-bib-0052" ref-type="ref">52</xref> The weaker association between HCV prevalence in the general population and that in patients with viral hepatitis (Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>), unlike other LRD populations, attests to prevalence in this population reflecting incidence rather than prevalence.
