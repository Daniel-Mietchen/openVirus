<p>In populations with LRDs in MENA (Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>), genotype 4 was the most common (44.2%), largely because of Egypt. This was followed by genotype 3 (34.5%), largely because of Pakistan; genotype 1 (17.0%); genotype 2 (3.5%); genotype 6 (0.5%); and genotype 5 (0.3%). Genotype 7 was not found in any LRD population. Genotype diversity was moderate for MENA as a whole (Shannon Diversity Index,Â 1.19 out of 1.95 [61.1%]).
