<p>The pooled mean HCV prevalence measures in the general population across MENA countries are shown in Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6</xref>, and results of the correlation analyses are presented in Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. There were positive strong correlations between HCV prevalence in the general population of each country and HCV prevalence in each LRD population of each country; the PCC was 0.862 for patients with multiple LRDs, 0.816 for patients suspected of having an LRD, 0.727 for patients with HCC, 0.628 for patients with liver disease, and 0.605 for patients with cirrhosis. The only exception was that of patients with viral hepatitis, who had a PCC of 0.147 and a nonsignificant association (
 <italic>P</italic> = 0.198). Overall, correlation analysis using the SCC confirmed the PCC findings and ranged between 0.448 for patients with viral hepatitis and 0.819 for patients suspected of having an LRD.
