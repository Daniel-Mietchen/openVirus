<p>Results of the univariable and multivariable meta‐regressions are shown in Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>. In the univariable analysis, there was evidence for both population type and country as predictors of HCV prevalence (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.1), and these were included in the final multivariable analysis. Year of data collection or year of publication had no effect on observed prevalence. Similarly, no small‐study effect was found; study sample size did not have an effect on observed prevalence.
