<p>In the multivariable analysis, the strong evidence for population type and country as predictors was confirmed (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). Relative to patients with viral hepatitis, patients with HCC, cirrhosis, or liver disease were all found to have a higher AOR at 6.1 (95% CI, 3.7‐10.2), 5.7 (95% CI, 3.1‐10.2), and 3.2 (95% CI, 1.9‐5.6), respectively. Relative to other MENA countries, Egypt and Pakistan both had a higher AOR at 8.1 (95% CI, 4.9‐13.2) and 5.3 (95% CI, 3.4‐8.5), respectively. The model explained 48.6% of the variability in HCV prevalence.
