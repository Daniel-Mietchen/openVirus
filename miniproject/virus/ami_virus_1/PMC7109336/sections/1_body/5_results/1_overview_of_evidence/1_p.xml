<p>Analyses were based on studies retrieved from the Synthesis Project database, as described in Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref>. All studies on HCV prevalence are reported in Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1</xref>. HCV prevalence measures in populations with LRDs were available for 16 of the 24 MENA countries. The number of HCV prevalence measures varied by country (Fig. 
 <xref rid="hep41491-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>), with Pakistan contributing the largest number (n = 76), followed by Egypt (n = 53). HCV RNA positivity measures (Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>) were available for only six countries. Genotype frequency measures (Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>) were available for only nine countries, with most data being from Egypt and Pakistan.
