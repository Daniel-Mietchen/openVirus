<p>The HCV viremic rate varied across studies (Supporting Table 
 <xref rid="hep41491-sup-0001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2</xref>), ranging from 43.5% to 93.0%, with a median of 70.2%. The pooled mean estimate for the viremic rate across MENA was 75.5% (95% CI, 61.0%‐87.6%), indicating that three quarters of those antibody‐positive individuals are chronically infected. There was evidence for heterogeneity in viremic rate measures (
