The pathogenic agent, CSFV, is a member of the genus <italic>Pestivirus</italic> of the family <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and is hosted naturally only by domestic pigs and wild boars. The positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome of CSFV is 12.3 kb in length, and it is composed of one long open reading frame followed by two non-translated regions, one on each side (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). Field strains of this virus have been found to belong to various genotypes. Thanks to the application of live attenuated vaccines in experimental immunisations and/or accurate epidemiological surveillance (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), CSF has been controlled or completely eradicated from domestic pigs in some countries and regions, such as Australia, New Zealand, North America, and Western Europe (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). However, it still has a large effect on swine production in Asia, South America, Eastern Europe, and parts of the former Soviet Union (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Experimental prophylactic vaccination with live attenuated vaccines (such as C-strain vaccine) and a non-vaccination eradication policy have proved to be effective ways to limit CSF epidemics (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). CSFV antigens have played an important role as vaccine components in the prevention and control of CSF (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) and it is important to produce CSFV in substantial quantities for research not only on vaccines but also on diagnosis of and treatment methods for CSFV infection. CSFV has been cultured <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell lines including porcine kidney cells (PK15, CPK, and SK6) and porcine, bovine, and sheep testicular cells (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Among these lines, PK15 and ST cells are widely used for the</p><p>production of CSFV in laboratories worldwide. As Wang <italic>et al</italic>. described, CSFV did not induce cytopathic effects in cultured cells, and the virus titres, defined as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID<sub>50</sub>) per millilitre obtained from PK15 cell cultures, were usually low and in proportion to the number of cells infected by the virus (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). It is reported that there is heterogeneity in the PK15 cell population as high- and low-permissiveness to CSFV replication, and not all the cells of a PK15 population are available to be infected by the virus (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>We aimed to achieve a homogeneous PK15 cell line of high susceptibility to CSFV infection.

The CSFV strain (SD19-15, subgenotype 2.1b) used in this study was isolated previously (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). PK15 cells were purchased from the Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology of China (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM, Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China), 50 U/mL of penicillin (Gibco), and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml of streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p><bold>Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay</bold>. Cells in an exponential phase of growth were harvested and seeded for an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Monolayers of PK15 cells were incubated with CSFV. The infected cells were washed with phosphate buffered solution containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) and fixed with cold acetone and methanol (1:1) for 20 min at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C, and then allowed to air dry. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk at 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min, the fixed cells were incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies (kindly provided by Prof. Gaiping Zhang) for 60 min at 37 &#x000b0;C in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed three times with PBST, and the fixed cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ZSGB biotechnology, Beijing, China). Finally, the cells were visualised using AEC substrate (ZSGB biotechnology) and examined under a light microscope.</p><p><bold>Preparation of feeder cells</bold>. Peritoneal macrophages (PM) were used as feeder cells, after being obtained according to a previously published protocol (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Briefly, Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mL of thioglycolate. The peritoneal exudate was collected after 72 h and diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells at density of 10<sup>5</sup> cells/100 &#x003bc;L were transferred into 96-well plates for 2 h. After removal of non-adherent cells, the medium was replaced, and the remaining cells were cultured for five days in the atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p><bold>Cloning of PK15 cells by limiting dilution</bold>. Well-grown PK15 cells were trypsinised and collected. Then, 100 &#x003bc;L of cells were transferred to 96-well plates precoated with PM feeder cells at a density of 5 cells/mL; seeding an average of 0.5 cells/well ensured that some wells received a single cell. Cells were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 7&#x02013;14 days. When cell growth in the bottom of the wells was 50% confluent, the subclones from each plate were transferred into new 96-well plates and incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for several days. The cloning procedure was repeated from the beginning until a stable single cell line was established, and the PK15 clones with high susceptibility for CSFV (and hence suitability for its replication) were identified by the IPMA method described above.</p><p><bold>CSFV titration</bold>. Monolayers of the three types of PK15 cells were incubated with a series of 1:10 diluted CSFV solutions. Forty replications of each titre were set up, as well as a negative control. The cells were cultured at 37&#x000b0;C for 48 h, and the titres of CSFV (TCID<sub>50</sub>) replicated in each type of PK15 cells were detected by the IPMA method.</p><p><bold>Growth characteristics of the screened PK15 cells</bold>. The screened PK15 cells were passaged to the 60<sup>th</sup> generation; each generation of the cells was collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. The cells that were passaged to the 60<sup>th</sup> generation were thawed, and the growth curves of these cells were tracked using cell counting at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post seeding. Six replications at each time point were set and the parent PK15 cells were used as control cells.</p><p><bold>Evaluation of CSFV replication ability</bold>. The screened PK15 cells were seeded into 96-well plates, and monolayers of the cells were incubated with a series of 1:10 diluted CSFV solutions. IPMA was used to detect the titres of CSFV that replicated in each type of the PK15 cells.</p><p>To accurately compare the CSFV replication abilities, a quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the CSFV copy numbers in the collected cultures. Briefly, the CSFV-infected cells were incubated for the indicated hours, and the cultures were harvested and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C for further analysis. Total RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus (catalogue number 9108, TaKaRa Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesised (PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit, TaKaRa Bio), and quantitative measurements were performed with Fast qPCR Mix (catalogue number RR430, TaKaRa Bio). The ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to perform the quantitative PCR reaction, and the CSFV copy number was determined by referring to a standard curve. The sets of primers used to amplify a 157 bp fragment of CSFV E2 gene for quantitative PCR were designed using a previous report as a guide (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p><bold>Statistical analysis</bold>.

It is reported that in a PK15 cell culture infected with porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), about 20% of PK15 cells comprised the group susceptible to the virus (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). It is proven that the lower virus titres which are generated from cells infected with CSFV are related to the heterogeneity of the cell line. There are many reports about the proliferation characteristics of CSFV in different cells, but there had been no cell line that could significantly enhance the propagation of CSFV <italic>in vitro</italic> before this research. In this study, we developed a homogeneous PK15 cell line (PK15-1A6) which showed high susceptibility to CSFV infection and could generate CSFV in high titres, and limiting dilution cell cloning was the approach which gave success. According to previous reports, this technique has been employed to generate high- and low-permissive cells to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus from the MA-104 cell line (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) and to PCV2 from the PK15 cell line (<xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Our results showed that the high-permissive PK15-1A6 showed higher proliferation ability as determined by the cell number when compared with the parent PK15 cells or the PK15-3B1 clone. Further studies need to be conducted to identify whether the rate of virus replication is correlated with the growth rate of the cell line.</p><p>Through the whole study, we screened monoclonal PK15 clones that had different proneness to CSFV infection and further confirmed the heterogeneity of the parent PK15 cell line. The PK15-1A6, PK15-3B1, and PK15 parent cells are different in cell proliferation rate, susceptibility to CSFV infection, and virus production. The study found that the PK15-1A6 cell clone is more susceptible to CSFV infection than the parent PK15 cells. Therefore, the PK15-1A6 cell clone will be more advantageous for CSFV replication <italic>in vitro</italic>, production of vaccines, and diagnostic and research applications. Further studies will be conducted to learn the mechanism of the differences in susceptibilities to CSFV infection among PK15-1A6, PK15-3B1, and PK15 parent cells.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
