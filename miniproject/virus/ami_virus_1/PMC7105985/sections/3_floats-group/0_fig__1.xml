 <caption>
  <p>The percentages of CSFV-infected cells in the parent cell line and cloned PK15 cells. A – mock-infected PK15 cells (negative control); B – high-permissive (clone 1A6); C – low-permissive (clone 3B1); D – infected parent PK15 cells; E – percentages of positively stained cells. The cells were infected with CSFV and stained with CSFV-specific monoclonal antibodies (400×). Five visual fields were randomly selected to be photographed in each group. The percentages of positively stained cells in the photos were counted and shown as mean ± SD. * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01</p>
