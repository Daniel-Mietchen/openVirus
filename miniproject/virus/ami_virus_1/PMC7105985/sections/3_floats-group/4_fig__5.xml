  <p>The synthesis of CSFV genome in parent PK15 cells and PK15-1A6 (HP) and PK15-3B1 (LP) cell lines. The genomic RNA extractions from infected cells were quantitated by RT-PCR (amplification of partial E2 gene). The copy numbers of CSFV were determined by referring to a standard curve. ** P &lt; 0.01</p>
