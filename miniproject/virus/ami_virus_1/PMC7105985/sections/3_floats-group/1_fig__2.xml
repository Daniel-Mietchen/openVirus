 <caption>
  <p>Growth curves of parent PK15, clone PK15-1A6, and PK15-3B1 cells. The cells were trypsinised and counted at 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post seeding. The data represent the mean Â± SD of three independent experiments performed. The differences between the number of parent cells and that of PK15-1A6 cells are shown above the squares. The differences between the number of parent cells and that of PK15-3B1 cells are shown below the triangles. * P &lt; 0.05, ** P &lt; 0.01</p>
