<p>CSFV infection causes a highly contagious disease and the swine industry suffers severe economic losses on its account (

Systematic prophylactic vaccination with live attenuated vaccines (such as C-strain vaccine) and non-vaccination eradication policies have proved to be effective ways to control CSF epidemics, vaccination demonstrating itself to be the most effective way to prevent and control CSF (

 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). To achieve a homogeneous PK15 cell line which could generate CSFV in high titres and facilitate research on vaccines, diagnostics, and therapies for CSF, a stable high-permissive cell line for CSFV infection is needed. After an extensive literature review, we found that no study had been conducted clarifying the efficiency and heterogenicity of a PK15 cell population when infected by CSFV.
