<p>Through the whole study, we screened monoclonal PK15 clones that had different proneness to CSFV infection and further confirmed the heterogeneity of the parent PK15 cell line. The PK15-1A6, PK15-3B1, and PK15 parent cells are different in cell proliferation rate, susceptibility to CSFV infection, and virus production. The study found that the PK15-1A6 cell clone is more susceptible to CSFV infection than the parent PK15 cells. Therefore, the PK15-1A6 cell clone will be more advantageous for CSFV replication 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, production of vaccines, and diagnostic and research applications. Further studies will be conducted to learn the mechanism of the differences in susceptibilities to CSFV infection among PK15-1A6, PK15-3B1, and PK15 parent cells.
