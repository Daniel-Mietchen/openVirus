<p>We aimed to achieve a homogeneous PK15 cell line of high susceptibility to CSFV infection. At the same time, we actively pursued the generation of CSFV in high titres. In this study, the growth curves and the virus titrations in the new cell lines PK15-1A6 and PK15-3B1 were measured and compared.</p>
