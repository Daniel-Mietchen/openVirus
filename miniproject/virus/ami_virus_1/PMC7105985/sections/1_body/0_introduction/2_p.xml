<p>production of CSFV in laboratories worldwide. As Wang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. described, CSFV did not induce cytopathic effects in cultured cells, and the virus titres, defined as 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) per millilitre obtained from PK15 cell cultures, were usually low and in proportion to the number of cells infected by the virus (
