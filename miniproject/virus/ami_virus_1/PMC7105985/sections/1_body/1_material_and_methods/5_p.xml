 <bold>CSFV titration</bold>. Monolayers of the three types of PK15 cells were incubated with a series of 1:10 diluted CSFV solutions. Forty replications of each titre were set up, as well as a negative control. The cells were cultured at 37Â°C for 48 h, and the titres of CSFV (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) replicated in each type of PK15 cells were detected by the IPMA method.
