 <bold>Immunoperoxidase monolayer assay</bold>. Cells in an exponential phase of growth were harvested and seeded for an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA). Monolayers of PK15 cells were incubated with CSFV. The infected cells were washed with phosphate buffered solution containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) and fixed with cold acetone and methanol (1:1) for 20 min at −20°C, and then allowed to air dry. After blocking with 5% non-fat milk at 37 °C for 30 min, the fixed cells were incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies (kindly provided by Prof. Gaiping Zhang) for 60 min at 37 °C in a humidified chamber. Cells were washed three times with PBST, and the fixed cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (ZSGB biotechnology, Beijing, China). Finally, the cells were visualised using AEC substrate (ZSGB biotechnology) and examined under a light microscope.
