<p>To accurately compare the CSFV replication abilities, a quantitative real-time PCR was performed to detect the CSFV copy numbers in the collected cultures. Briefly, the CSFV-infected cells were incubated for the indicated hours, and the cultures were harvested and stored at −80°C for further analysis. Total RNA was isolated using RNAiso Plus (catalogue number 9108, TaKaRa Bio, Kusatsu, Japan). The first-strand cDNAs were synthesised (PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit, TaKaRa Bio), and quantitative measurements were performed with Fast qPCR Mix (catalogue number RR430, TaKaRa Bio). The ABI 7500 real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) was used to perform the quantitative PCR reaction, and the CSFV copy number was determined by referring to a standard curve. The sets of primers used to amplify a 157 bp fragment of CSFV E2 gene for quantitative PCR were designed using a previous report as a guide (
