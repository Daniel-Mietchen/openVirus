 <bold>Cloning of PK15 cells by limiting dilution</bold>. Well-grown PK15 cells were trypsinised and collected. Then, 100 μL of cells were transferred to 96-well plates precoated with PM feeder cells at a density of 5 cells/mL; seeding an average of 0.5 cells/well ensured that some wells received a single cell. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 7–14 days. When cell growth in the bottom of the wells was 50% confluent, the subclones from each plate were transferred into new 96-well plates and incubated at 37°C for several days. The cloning procedure was repeated from the beginning until a stable single cell line was established, and the PK15 clones with high susceptibility for CSFV (and hence suitability for its replication) were identified by the IPMA method described above.
