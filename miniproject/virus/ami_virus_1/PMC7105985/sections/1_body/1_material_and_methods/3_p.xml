 <xref rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_ref_013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Briefly, Kunming mice were intraperitoneally injected with 5 mL of thioglycolate. The peritoneal exudate was collected after 72 h and diluted in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Cells at density of 10
 <sup>5</sup> cells/100 Î¼L were transferred into 96-well plates for 2 h. After removal of non-adherent cells, the medium was replaced, and the remaining cells were cultured for five days in the atmosphere with 5% CO
