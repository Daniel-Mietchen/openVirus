 <bold>Growth characteristics of the screened PK15 cells</bold>. The screened PK15 cells were passaged to the 60
 <sup>th</sup> generation; each generation of the cells was collected and stored in liquid nitrogen. The cells that were passaged to the 60
 <sup>th</sup> generation were thawed, and the growth curves of these cells were tracked using cell counting at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post seeding. Six replications at each time point were set and the parent PK15 cells were used as control cells.
