<p>We also detected the CSFV titres in the infected cells by quantitative real-time PCR and compared the replication curves. The results showed that significantly higher CSFV copy numbers were detected in the PK15-1A6 clone than those in the parent PK15 cells or the PK15-3B1 clone at all time points (P &lt; 0.01) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_fig_005">Fig. 5</xref>). At 48 hpi, the CSFV copy number generated in PK15-1A6 cells had increased to 10
 <sup>8.89</sup> copies/mL, which was much higher than those in the parent PK15 (10
 <sup>6.13</sup> copies/mL) and PK15-3B1 cells (10
 <sup>5.79</sup> copies/mL).
