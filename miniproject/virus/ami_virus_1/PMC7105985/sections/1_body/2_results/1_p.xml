 <bold>Cloned PK15 cell line highly permissive to CSFV infection</bold>. In order to achieve a substantially homogeneous high-permissive PK15 cell line, the limiting dilution method was used first to obtain single cells, which were drawn from the heterogeneous parent PK15 cells that contained cell populations with different susceptibilities to CSFV infection. Then, each cell clone derived from a single cell was infected with CSFV and was screened to test its susceptibility to CSFV infection by the number of IPMA-positively stained cells thereafter. Two clones of PK15 cells (PK15-1A6 and PK15-3B1) were screened, of which PK15-1A6 showed more positive cells and higher susceptibility to CSFV infection, while PK15-3B1 showed fewer positive cells than the parent PK-15 (
