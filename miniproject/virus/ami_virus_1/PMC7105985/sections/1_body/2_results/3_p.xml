 <bold>CSFV multiplication in the screened cells</bold>. We used the IPMA method to evaluate the CSFV multiplication in the infected PK15-1A6 cells, PK15-3B1 cells, and parent cells. CSFV was serially passaged in the parent cell line and two derivative clones. The virus in the supernatant and cells was collected and stored at −80°C until the susceptibility was determined. A mean virus titre of 10
 <sup>6.85</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL was detected in PK15-1A6 cells, which was significantly higher than the titre of 10
 <sup>4.74</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL produced from the parent PK15 cells (P &lt; 0.01) and the 10
 <sup>3.63</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL generated from PK15-3B1 cells (
