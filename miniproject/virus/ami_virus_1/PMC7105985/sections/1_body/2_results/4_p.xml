 <bold>Replication of CSFV in the screened cells</bold>. To compare the influence of cell susceptibility on the replication of CSFV in PK15 cells with high or low susceptibility, cells infected with CSFV were fixed and tested using the IPMA method at different time points. IPMA positive cells were identified as early as 12 h post infection (hpi) in the PK15-1A6 clone and the parent PK15 cells, while no positive cells were found in the PK15-3B1 clone until 18 hpi (
