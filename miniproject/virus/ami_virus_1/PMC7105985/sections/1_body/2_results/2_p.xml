 <bold>Characteristics of the screened PK15 cells</bold>. The screened PK15-1A6 cells were cultured and detected to ascertain the stability of their high permissiveness to CSFV infection. The cell line still presented good cellular morphology and a steady high permissiveness to CSFV infection after 60 passages. To further characterise the growth of PK15-1A6, PK15-3B1, and the parent cells, their growth curves were depicted. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="j_jvetres-2020-0020_fig_002">Fig. 2</xref>, the high-permissive PK15-1A6 showed more potent proliferation ability as determined by the number of cells when compared with the parent PK15 cells or the PK15-3B1 clone. The PK15-3B1 clone showed the slowest growth rate (
