<p>Working on yellow fever virus, M. Hoskins, G.M. Findlay and F. MacCallum discovered the phenomenon of interference in 1935: if an avirulent virus was injected into an experimental animal, the animal was protected from the consequences of infection by a virulent strain when it was applied within the next 24Â h, i.e., before the onset of an immune response. In 1957, Alick Isaacs and Jean Lindenmann showed that interferon is responsible for the interference effect. It is species-specific, inducible and belongs to a group of substances that are known as cytokines today. Interferons play an important role in the primary, non-specific defence against viral infections and in stimulating the immune system. The observation that antiviral interferon preparations also have tumour-inhibiting effects was surprising. Generally, cytokines are synthesized when a suitable inducer binds as a ligand to its receptor on the cell membrane, thus triggering specific signal transduction processes in the cell (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_8).</p>
