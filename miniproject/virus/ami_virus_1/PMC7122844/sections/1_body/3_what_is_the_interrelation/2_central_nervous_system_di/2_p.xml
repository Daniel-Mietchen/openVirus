<p>The exploration of its pathogenesis revealed that most slow virus infections are caused by pathogens which are usually associated with other diseases. Slow virus infections principally affect the central nervous system and are caused, for example, by measles virus and JC polyomavirus. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis is probably caused by mutations in measles virus genes, which lead to the emergence of defective virus particles (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15). In progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy, which is triggered by JC polyomavirus, the virus seemingly enters the brain very early and persists there for a long time before the disease breaks out as a result of damage to the immune system (e.g., by infection with HIV; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Infections with HIV can also be considered as a slow virus disease. Similarly, prion diseases also progress along the lines of a slow virus infection, but they are caused by non-viral pathogens and have a fundamentally different pathogenesis (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_21).</p>
