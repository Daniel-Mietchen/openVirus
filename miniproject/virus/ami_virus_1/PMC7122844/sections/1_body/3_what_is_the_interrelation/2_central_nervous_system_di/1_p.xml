<p>The term “slow virus infections” was initially coined by Björn Sigurdsson for maedi disease of sheep in Iceland in 1954. Maedi–visna virus causes respiratory symptoms in a slow and progressive disease after very long incubation and latency periods. Maedi–visna virus thus became a model for a range of pathogens that cause diseases with a similar protracted course (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18).</p>
