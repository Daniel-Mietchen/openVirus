<p>As mentioned above, Shope had already described that carcinomas arise from papillomas by a two-stage or multistage process. The development of cervical carcinoma caused by human papillomaviruses and that of primary liver cancer caused by hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B virus are similar. Even Epstein–Barr virus exerts its tumorigenic effect in a complex way: the viral DNA is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma tumour cells and in various lymphomas (African Burkitt’s lymphoma). The cells are infected and immortalized, but do not produce infectious virus particles. Furthermore, chromosomal translocations are found in B-cell lymphomas (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). However, malignant transformation develops in a multistep process by interaction with other factors, such as malaria, which contributes to a chronic stimulation of cells.</p>
