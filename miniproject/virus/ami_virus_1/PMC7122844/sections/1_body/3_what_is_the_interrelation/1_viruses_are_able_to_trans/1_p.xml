<p>As early as in 1911, it was demonstrated that Rous sarcoma virus can cause cancer. In 1959, Margarete Vogt and Renato Dulbecco observed the transformation from benign to malignant cells after infection with murine polyomavirus in vitro. After animals had been inoculated, these cells generated tumours. Shortly afterwards, it was also discovered that Rous sarcoma virus can transform cells in vitro. Thus, tumour virus research became a driving force of virology. It has enriched the realm of cancer research with decisive impulses both in conceptual and in methodological terms. Experiments with the oncogenic polyomavirus also showed that its dissemination within mouse populations can be followed by serological methods. This aroused the hope that it would be possible to reduce cancer development to viral agents and to study its nature using the classical methods of epidemiology such as virus isolation and antibody detection. In particular, the study of oncogenic retroviruses in animal systems provided seminal insights into the molecular processes that lead to carcinogenesis (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). By investigating oncogenic retroviruses in 1970, Howard Temin and David Baltimore discovered reverse transcriptase â€“ an enzyme that transcribes the single-stranded RNA of retroviruses into double-stranded DNA. After integration of the viral genetic information into the genome of the host, these viruses lose their individual existence. A few years earlier, Temin had described that an inhibitor of DNA synthesis prevents replication of Rous sarcoma virus, which should not be the case in a typical RNA virus. The integration of a viral genome, which is then present as a provirus, has been associated with tumour development. This event interrupts the continuity of the genome of the cell, as cellular and viral genes can be amplified and destroyed, or their expression can be activated by recombination with viral promoters.</p>
