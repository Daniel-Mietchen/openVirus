<p>Research on the molecular processes that occur in infections with papillomaviruses, hepatitis B virus and retroviruses has led to the development of vaccines which induce protection against the respective viral infection and are capable of preventing the development of cancer as a long-term consequence. The vaccination strategy in Southeast Asia that was initiated and promoted by the WHO 25 years ago has led to a significant decrease of primary liver carcinoma, which is caused by hepatitis B virus infections (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In veterinary medicine, vaccines against feline leukaemia virus have proved that cats are protected against infections by this exogenous retrovirus and that tumour formation can be prevented (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_18). The detailed investigation of the molecular biology and pathogenesis of human papillomavirus infections by the research group of Harald zur Hausen at the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) paved the way for the development of appropriate vaccines. These have been available for several years and protect against infections with the highly oncogenic papillomaviruses: they prevent the possible development of cervical carcinoma – one of the commonest cancers in women (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_10, 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). In September 2008, Harald zur Hausen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work concerning the role of papillomaviruses in cervical cancer.</p>
