<p>Attempts have been made to develop antiviral chemotherapeutic agents since about 1960. In retrospect, this search can be divided into three stages: the first successful experiments for therapy of a viral infection were performed by Josef Wollensak and Herbert E. Kaufman around 1960 in herpetic keratitis. They used substances that inhibit viral replication in vitro and were known from experimental cancer therapy. However, the selectivity of these substances, i.e., their ability to selectively influence viral and not cellular processes, was only slight because of the high cytotoxicity of the compounds. After the discovery of virus-coded enzymes such as thymidine kinases, DNA polymerases and proteases, it was possible to address the development of specific inhibitors. Antiviral drugs such as amantadine against influenza A virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16) and adenine arabinoside and acyclovir (acycloguanosine) against herpes simplex virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19) were found by targeted empiricism, i.e., by attempting to find a compound that selectively influences viral reproduction among many compounds with similar effects. The achievement of Gertrude Elion and her staff to use acyclovir as a systemically applicable and selective antiviral drug in herpes encephalitis was an important milestone in chemotherapeutic research. She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988 for her work. After the development of DNA sequencing techniques, the experimental chemotherapy of viral infections entered its third stage. Virus-encoded enzymes were discovered such as the retroviral protease and neuraminidase of influenza viruses, and it was possible to build structural models of enzymes by comparison with proteins of similar functions and known three-dimensional structures. This allows one to identify potential active centres and to develop compounds, also known as “designer” drugs, which accommodate within the active centres and inhibit the viral enzymes. That means deviating from purely empirical research, and is a first step towards a more rational development of antiviral compounds (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_9).</p>
