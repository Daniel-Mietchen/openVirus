<p>Taken from epidemiology, the “Evans postulates” are a worthy supplement (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_11). They show the aetiological importance of a pathogen for a clinical picture if, among others, the pathogen is significantly more frequent in an exposed group and the disease in this population is commoner than in a non-exposed group. Similarly, an immune response should be detectable in the affected collectives. The Evans postulates are valuable particularly for multifactorial infectious diseases, such as canine kennel cough and porcine circovirus infection (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20).</p>
