<p>Koch noted that the postulates do not comply in all cases. He acknowledged that there are healthy and long-term carriers and that a normal flora of facultative pathogenic bacteria exists. In the realm of virology, not all pathogens comply with these postulates. Positive examples are measles virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15), human poxviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19), canine and feline parvoviruses (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_20) and classical swine fever virus (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_14). With regard to viral diseases, Charles River proposed modifications of the postulates in 1937. The exceptions concern preferentially latent or persistent viral infections and the fact that tissue and organ damage or tumour formation cannot always be reproduced as consequences of infection.</p>
