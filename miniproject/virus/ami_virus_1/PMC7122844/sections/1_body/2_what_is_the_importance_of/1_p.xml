<p>The study of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of infectious diseases raises the fundamental question of how can it be proved that an illness is caused by infection with a bacterium or a virus. Robert Koch derived four postulates from his work with anthrax bacteria between 1882 and 1890, which his teacher Jacob Henle had previously developed as a hypothesis from the study of so-called miasma and contagions, i.e., the animate or inanimate disease and infection agents:
 <list list-type="order">
  <list-item>
   <p>A pathogen must be detected in all cases of a certain disease, but it must be absent in healthy organisms.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The pathogen must be cultivable on culture media or in suitable cell cultures in the form of pure cultures.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>Healthy animals must develop the same disease after inoculation of the pathogen.</p>
  </list-item>
  <list-item>
   <p>The causative agent must be reisolated from the infected animals.</p>
  </list-item>
 </list>
