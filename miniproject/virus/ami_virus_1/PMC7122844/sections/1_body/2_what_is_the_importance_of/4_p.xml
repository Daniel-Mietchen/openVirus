<p>The further development of virological and immunochemical detection methods in recent years has allowed the use of additional criteria for the causal relationship between a virus and a disease. These include the detection of a specific humoral or cellular immune response against the pathogen, i.e., IgM or IgG antibodies and specific stimulatable lymphocytes, and the detection of viral proteins, enzyme activities, DNA or RNA by in vitro and in situ methods. The specific detection of viral nucleic acids in tissues is especially important for the aetiological correlation between persistent viral infections and cancer. The fulfilment of Kochâ€™s postulates or their modifications is still essential for the development of aetiological relationships between the pathogen and the host.</p>
