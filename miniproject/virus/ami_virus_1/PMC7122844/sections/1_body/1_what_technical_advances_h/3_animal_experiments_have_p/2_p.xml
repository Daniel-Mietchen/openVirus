<p>In the framework of animal experiments, Erich Traub made an important observation while studying the virus of lymphocytic choriomeningitis in Princeton in 1935: when pregnant mice were infected with the virus, the virus was transferred to the embryos; mother animals became sick from meningitis, and produced protective antibodies in the further course of the disease. By contrast, the newborn mice remained healthy, but secreted large quantities of the virus for life without developing a specific immune response against the pathogen. This discovery was the first example of an immune tolerance induced by a virus, but the general significance of this phenomenon was not recognized, and the now popular term was not coined (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16). Later, lymphocytic choriomeningitis was shown to be an immunologically related disease. The restriction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes by certain genetically determined types of MHC proteins was demonstrated for the first time in this model by Rolf M. Zinkernagel und Peter C. Doherty in 1974. The above-mentioned experiments of Traub evidenced also for the first time the intrauterine transmission of a virus. This raised the question of similar ways of infection in humans. In fact, after a severe rubella epidemic in Australia in 1941, Sir Norman Gregg observed embryopathies when pregnant women were affected by the infection. As demonstrated later, these malformations were the result of intrauterine transmission of rubella virus.</p>
