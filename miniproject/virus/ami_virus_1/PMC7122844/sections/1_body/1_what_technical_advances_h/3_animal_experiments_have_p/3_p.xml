<p>In 1947, coxsackievirus was discovered after transmission of virus-containing stool extracts into newborn mice (Coxsackie is a small town in the US state of New York). Later in New York, Ludwik Gross isolated murine leukaemia virus from blood cells. Besides the importance for tumour virus research, these observations aroused interest in the question concerning the basis of the high susceptibility of newborn animals to viral infections, and suggested investigations on the innate resistance of an organism to infections as well as the time and the causes of its formation.</p>
