<p>The study of viruses and their attributes was particularly difficult because they, in contrast to bacteria, could not be propagated in artificial culture media. However, it could be ascertained that some of the pathogens isolated from diseased people were transmissible to animals, in which they were able to reproduce. For example, human herpes simplex virus was transmitted from human skin blisters to the cornea of rabbits by Wilhelm Grüter in Marburg in 1911. The extraordinary susceptibility of ferrets allowed the isolation of influenza A virus by Christopher Andrews, Wilson Smith and Patrik Laidlaw from pharyngonasal fluid of a sick person for the first time in 1933. Animal experiments also provided many insights into the pathogenesis of viral infections from another point of view. Richard E. Shope discovered rabbit papillomavirus in 1935, and thus the first tumour virus, which – as was later shown – contains a DNA genome. He suspected that such a virus could exist in a latent form as a provirus in the organism. In addition, the discovery that skin cancer can develop from benign skin papillomas is attributed to him. Hence, malignant tumours develop in two or more steps – nowadays a universally accepted notion. Shope further observed that the incidence of cancer differs in different rabbit breeds, and thus genetic traits of the host also influence the development of cancer.</p>
