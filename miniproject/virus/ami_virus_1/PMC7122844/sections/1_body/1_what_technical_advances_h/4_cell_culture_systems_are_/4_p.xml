<p>In 1928, Hugh B. and Mary C. Maitland had already introduced the method of tissue culture, in which the cells of small tissue pieces were cultivated in serum-containing liquid media and infected with viruses. Successful viral replication was then demonstrated in animal experiments or by detecting the presence of inclusion bodies. When antibiotics became available in the 1940s, it was then possible to largely prevent bacterial contaminations in cultures, which led to much simpler handling in this method. Polioviruses were cultivated in embryonic human cells of fixed kidney tissue fragments, and thereby cellular alterations were easily identifiable. This diagnostically valuable cytopathic effect drove the development of virology forwards. It was the basis for the plaque test that was developed by Renato Dulbecco and Marguerite Vogt in 1952, which rendered possible, for the first time, the quantitative determination of the number of infectious particles in cell culture. The capability to cultivate polioviruses under controlled conditions in vitro was the basis for the development of the two polio vaccines: the inactivated vaccine developed by Jonas E. Salk and the live vaccine with attenuated, i.e., weakened polioviruses, developed by Albert B. Sabin. Both vaccines are still in use today. Later, vaccines against measles, rubella and mumps were also produced following the principle applied by Sabin.</p>
