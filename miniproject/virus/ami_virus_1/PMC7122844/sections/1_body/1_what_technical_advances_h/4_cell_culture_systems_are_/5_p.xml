<p>By using the method of cell culture, it was possible to cultivate even yellow fever virus, vaccinia virus and rabies virus in vitro. Wallace P. Rowe isolated adenoviruses from cultures of human tonsil tissue after a long cultivation period in 1953. A further development of viral cultivation in vitro provided the method of co-cultivation, which consists in the addition of indicator cells to the tissue cultures, which indicate viral replication by the occurrence of a cytopathic effect. In this manner, the existence of herpes simplex virus was verified in latently infected human dorsal root ganglia in 1971, whereas direct virus detection was not possible at that time. Until then, it had generally been assumed that in the course of viral infections the pathogen would be eliminated completely from the body by the resulting antibodies. The occurrence of herpes blisters as recurrent disease in people with antibodies – known as herpes immunological paradox – refuted that notion (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Ernest W. Goodpasture had previously suggested that the trigeminal ganglia should contain a “latent” form of the virus. After such a virus had been detected by co-cultivation, it was recognized that there are a number of infections with latent or persistent viruses, which – independently of the illness symptoms – are excreted either intermittently (e.g., herpes simplex virus) or permanently (such as Epstein–Barr virus). The primary isolation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1 was also accomplished by co-cultivation of lymph node biopsy material from an AIDS patient with suitable T lymphocytes.</p>
