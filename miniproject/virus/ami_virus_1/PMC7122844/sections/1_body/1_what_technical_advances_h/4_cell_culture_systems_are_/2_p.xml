<p>In the 1930s, it was found that embryonated chicken eggs are appropriate for the propagation of some viral species. Between 1918 and 1920, a pandemic emerging viral disease, Spanish flu, claimed more than 20 million lives, i.e., more than in the First World War. After cultivation of the virus responsible in embryonated chicken eggs in 1933, their haemagglutinating properties were discovered in 1941 (i.e., their ability to agglutinate red blood cells), thereby laying the basis for the development of haemagglutination tests to detect viruses. Another important step in the history of modern virology was the development of the first ultracentrifuges, which became available at about the same time. They made possible the sedimentation and concentration of the minute virus particles. However, the breakthrough in the elucidation of the pathogenetic mechanism of influenza viruses was only possible by the development of molecular biological techniques that allowed the investigation of the genetic material of this pathogen, which exists in the form of single-stranded RNA. Its sequencing revealed the genetic reasons for the previously not understood ability of influenza viruses to change their antigenic properties at periodic intervals (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_16).</p>
