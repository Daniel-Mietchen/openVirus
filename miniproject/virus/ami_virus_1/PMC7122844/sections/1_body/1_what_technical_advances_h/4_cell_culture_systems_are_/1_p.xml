<p>Laborious and time-consuming experiments were initially the only way to prove the existence of viruses: therefore, there simpler methods were sought. One way involved the observation of so-called inclusion bodies in virus-infected tissues, which were soon judged as an indication for proliferation of the pathogen; as we now know, inclusion bodies are the accumulation of viral proteins and particles in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. The first inclusion bodies were discovered by Dimitri I. Ivanovski; at the same time, Guiseppe Guarnieri discovered similar deposits in cells infected with smallpox virus, then in 1903, Adelchi Negri found inclusion bodies in ganglion cells of rabid animals, which were later named after him. Thus, there were at least simple dye detection methods for some viral diseases. However, virus culture methods became available later.</p>
