<p>Because of their small size, viruses remained occult to humans for long time. The resolution of the light microscope, which was constructed by Ernst Abbé around 1900, was not sufficiently high to visualize these pathogens; this was only possible with the electron microscope, which was developed by Helmut and Ernst Ruska in 1940. With its aid, the structure of a virus was solved for the first time; that of tobacco mosaic virus. Even obtaining (indirect) evidence of such minute agents, which are not cultivable on artificial media, was impossible before the development of bacteria-proof ultrafilters. They finally allowed the existence of many viruses to be evinced: Walter Reed described yellow fever virus as the first human pathogenic virus in 1900, followed by rabbit myxoma virus and rabies virus in 1903; avian leukaemia virus was discovered by Vilhelm Ellermann and Oluf Bang in 1908, Karl Landsteiner and Emil Popper found poliovirus in 1909 and Peyton Rous discovered Rous sarcoma virus in 1911, which is named after him and represents the first virus associated with the induction of cancer diseases (in this case in the connective tissue of poultry), a notion that had already been suspected by the French bacteriologist Amédée Borrel in 1903.</p>
