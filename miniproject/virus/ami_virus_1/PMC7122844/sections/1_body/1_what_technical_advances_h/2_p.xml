<p>Even bacteria can be infected by ultrafilterable and transmissible agents, as discovered by Frederik Twort and Felix d’Herelle in 1916 and 1917. They especially noticed the striking ability of these agents to lyse bacteria and, therefore, called them bacteriophages – according to the Greek word 
 <italic>phagein</italic>, which means “to eat”. The exploration of the nature of bacteriophages has provided virology with important findings and impulses both in methodological and in conceptual terms. Many of the steps that characterize a viral infection were first discovered in experiments with bacterial viruses: such processes include attachment and penetration, the reproduction-cycle-dependent regulation of gene expression that results in early and late synthesized proteins, and lysogeny, which is associated with the existence of prophages.
