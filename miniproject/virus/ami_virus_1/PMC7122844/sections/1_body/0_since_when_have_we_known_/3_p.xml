<p>Knowledge of this vaccination spread very rapidly from England to the European continent and the USA. The term “vaccination” is derived from the Latin 
 <italic>vacca</italic>, which means “cow”. Vaccinations were soon prescribed by law and this led to a gradual reduction of the dreaded disease. In the former German Reich, a first vaccination law was enacted in 1871. However, it still took about 100 years until a human, Ali Maov Maalin, was naturally infected with smallpox (in Somalia) for the last time (in 1977), after the WHO had conducted a worldwide vaccination programme. Today, the disease is considered eradicated.
