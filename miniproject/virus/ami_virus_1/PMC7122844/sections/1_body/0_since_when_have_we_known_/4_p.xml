<p>On a similar basis, i.e., without precise knowledge of the nature of the pathogen, Louis Pasteur developed a vaccine against rabies (10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_15) in Paris in 1885. He transmitted the disease intracerebrally to rabbits in 1882, seeing the causative agent rather in unknown and invisible microbes. As he demonstrated, the pathogen lost its disease-inducing properties by continuous transmission in these animals. In this way, Pasteur achieved the basis for a vaccine virus (
 <italic>virus fixe</italic>), which, in contrast to the wild-type pathogen (
 <italic>virus de rue</italic>), was characterized by a constant incubation period. Rubbed and dried spinal cord of rabbits that had been inoculated with the 
 <italic>virus fixe</italic> was no longer infectious, but caused (initially in dogs) protection against rabies. For the first time, in 1885, Pasteur inoculated a 9-year-old Alsatian boy named Joseph Meister with this material. The boy had been bitten by a rabid dog 2Â days before, and finally survived, by virtue of the protective effect induced by the vaccine.
