<p>However, it can be retrospectively documented that as long as 3,000 years ago – without knowledge of the nature of the pathogens – practices were implemented which today would be described as vaccinations against viral diseases. In ancient China, India and Egypt, devastating smallpox epidemics must frequently have occurred; Pharaoh Ramses V – as his death mask shows – most likely died of an infection of smallpox virus. As observed at that time, people who had survived the disease were spared from the disease in further epidemics; therefore, they had to have developed some kind of protection caused by the first disease – they were immune. This protective status could also be induced artificially; when dried scabs of smallpox were transmitted to healthy people, they were at least partially protected against smallpox – a measure that we now denominate variolation (the medical term for smallpox is “variola”; 10.1007/978-3-642-20718-1_19). Historical descriptions indicate that smallpox was used as a biological weapon at that time. In the eighteenth century, it was discovered in England and Germany that overcoming milker’s nodule disease, which is triggered by a virus related to smallpox, confers protection against genuine smallpox. Edward Jenner must have been aware of these observations in 1796 when he transmitted swinepox and cowpox material, as a sort of vaccine, initially to his first-born son and later to James Phipps, a young cowherd. Both boys remained healthy following exposure to the human pathogenic smallpox virus by inoculation of smallpox pus; in fact, a protective effect was generated by this first deliberate “virological experiment”.</p>
