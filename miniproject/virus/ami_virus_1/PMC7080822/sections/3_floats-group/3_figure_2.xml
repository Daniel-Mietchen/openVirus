  <p>Characterization of recombinant avian influenza virus (AIVs). Four recombinant AIVs engineered by reverse genetics (RG-AIVs) containing eight gene segments from H6N1 (NS0702) or with substitution of the NS gene derived from other H5N2 viruses (NS683, NS1680, and NS1031) were rescued. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Plaque formation ability and average plaque size were indicated. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The expression level of NS1 and NP in mock (-) or infected Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) or DF-1 cells was analyzed by Western blot. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Cellular distribution of NS1-eGFP enhanced green fluorescent protein in 293 cells was detected at 24 h after transfection by fluorescence microscopy, at 400× magnification. The image in white boxes on the top raw was further enlarged and shown in the lower panel. Nucleus was indicated in blue by DAPI staining. * indicates significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in plaque size relative to parental virus (NS0702).
