  <p>Growth kinetics of reassortant avian influenza virus (AIVs) in cells. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> DF-1 or 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Madinâ€“Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were infected with one of four reassortant viruses at a 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI), and the yield of viral progeny was determined at 12, 24, 36, and 48 h post infection (hpi) by standard plaque assay [plaque-forming units (PFUs)/ml). The mean yields and standard error of triplicate experiments are displayed. *Indicates a significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) between yield of the progeny and parental virus (NS0702).
