  <p>Expression of cytokines in DF-1 cells infected with reassortant avian influenza virus (AIVs). Chicken DF-1 cells were infected by reassortant AIVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Total RNA was extracted at 
   <bold>(A)</bold> 6 and 
   <bold>(B)</bold> 12 hpi for detection of cytokine expression (IFN-α, IFN-β, and TNF-α) by qRT-PCR and normalized with mock infection. *Indicates significant difference (
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) in cytokine expression relative to parental virus (NS0702); black and red indicate significantly higher and lower expression, respectively.
