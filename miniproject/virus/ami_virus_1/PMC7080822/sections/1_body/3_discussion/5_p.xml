<p>Of the three representative H5N2 strains, NS1031 gene is derived from the HPAI virus (A/goose/Taiwan/01031/2015). As NS1 is one of the virulent determinants, one might expect that the reassortant virus bearing NS1031 could possess a higher infection efficiency than the other recombinant viruses. Surprisingly, NS1031 gene substitution leads to attenuation of the reassortant RG-AIV. It has been shown that the HA gene of H5N2 virus emerging in 2015 was classified into the clade 2.3.4.4 of HPAIV, and with penta-basic-amino-acid HA0 cleavage site PLRERRRKR/GLF (

Hence, it is likely that HA facilitates viral dissemination and is predominantly attributed to the high pathogenicity of the parental virus A/goose/Taiwan/01031/2015. On the other hand, substitution of NS gene might also render a poor coordination between NS1 with its viral counterparts, such as viral RdRp complex. It is well described that in addition to eliminating anti-viral responses, NS1 also modulates gene expression and viral genome activity

 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Twu et al., 2007</xref>) or with the viral RdRp complex (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Marion et al., 1997</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Robb et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, we demonstrated 
 <italic>via</italic> mini-genome assay that NS0702 and NS628 proteins significantly enhanced RdRp activity, whereas NS1031 did not contribute to viral genome activation (

Moreover, this result also indicated the possible genetic incompatibility of the reassortant NS1031 virus. The RG-AIV system in this study was based on an A/chicken/TW/0702/2013 (subtype H6N1) backbone; the internal genes of this H6N1 virus are similar to those of the Mexican-like H5N2 viruses, including A/chicken/TW/683/2013 and A/chicken/TW/683/2012 (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2014</xref>); whereas the clade 2.3.4.4 H5N2 virus, A/goose/TW/01031/2015, is genetically distant from A/chicken/TW/0702/2013 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1B</xref>), with internal genes reassorted from various AIV subtypes from different continents (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al., 2016</xref>). Since 2015, these different lineages of H5 viruses and H6N1 virus have circulated the fields of Taiwan, but the reassorted viruses derived from clade 2.3.4.4 H5Nx viruses and the endemic Mexican-like H5N2 or H6N1 virus have not yet been identified. Mismatch between NS1 and the viral RNP complex composed of vRNA, RdRp, and NP might result not only in inefficient vRNA synthesis (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>) but also in inadequate control of the host immune response in infected cells (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">White and Lowen, 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that mismatch between the NS segment and viral RNP resulted in attenuation of NS1031 infections in this study, and these incompatible chimera viruses may not become a dominant type of virus in nature relative to their parental viruses.
