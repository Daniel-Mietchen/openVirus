<p>In light of the diversity of AIVs in recent outbreaks, NS variation may play a pivotal role in the distinct characteristics of AIVs independent from the new HA and NA subtypes. Previous studies of avian influenza in Taiwan have mainly focused on epidemiology, and little is known about the contribution of individual protein function on virulence or host adaptation. To investigate the impact of NS1, we engineered reassortant viruses with the NS segment derived from contemporary Taiwanese H5 strains in the backbone of an enzootic H6N1 virus by reverse genetics. Of the three local H5N2 viruses selected for this study, two viruses, despite different pathogenicity, contain internal genes derived from H6N1 lineage, whereas one HPAIV consists of internal genes of a variety of phylogeny and with unusual virulence in waterfowl (
