<p>The genome of AIV is composed of eight viral RNA (vRNA) segments (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">McGeoch et al., 1976</xref>). The non-structural (NS) segment encodes NS protein 1 (NS1) and NS2 [also known as nuclear export protein (NEP)], which are translated from spliced NS transcripts (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Palese and Shaw, 2007</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dubois et al., 2014</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2016a</xref>). NS1 is a multifunctional protein that impacts both viral infection and cellular biosynthesis (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Ayllon and Garcia-Sastre, 2015</xref>). Extensive studies demonstrate its major role in modulation of host anti-viral response and, in particular, on counteracting interferon (IFN) (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">García-Sastre, 2001</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2002</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hale et al., 2008</xref>). NS1 binds double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and interacts with protein kinase R (PKR) in a manner that ultimately leads to suppression of PKR activation (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Min and Krug, 2006</xref>). Moreover, NS1 interacts with the 30-kDa cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (F30) and inhibits the 3′ processing of IFN-α/β pre-mRNA (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Noah et al., 2003</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">Twu et al., 2006</xref>). Previous studies have also demonstrated that exchange of NS segments affects viral replication, pathogenicity, and host adaptation in HPAI viruses (HPAIVs) (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Ma et al., 2010</xref>); and deletion of NS1 attenuates the virulence of H5N1 viruses (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Steel et al., 2009</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Shi et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, NS1 plays a critical role in host adaptation and pathogenesis of influenza viruses.
