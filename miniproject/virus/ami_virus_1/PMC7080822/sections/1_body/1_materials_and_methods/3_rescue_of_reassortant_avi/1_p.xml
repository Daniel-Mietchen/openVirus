<p>HEK293T cells (2 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well, 24-well plate) were transfected with the mixture of pDZ plasmids containing eight gene segments (seven genes of A/chicken/Taiwan/0702/2013 and the NS derived from a different viral strain) by Lipofectamine 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, United States). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were harvested and overlaid onto MDCK cells for amplification of the progeny viruses. Three single plaques of reassortant viruses were isolated and further propagated in SPF eggs. Genome sequences of the purified viruses were validated by automated sequencing.
