<p>As described previously (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2019</xref>), cells transiently expressing the target proteins were fixed with 1.875% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.5% NP-40, and then incubated with anti-NS1 (sc-130568, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibody or anti-NP antibody (ab20343, Abcam) for 1 h. Cells were further incubated with corresponding secondary antibodies conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen) for an additional 1 h at room temperature. Washing (PBS containing 1% FBS) was conducted between each step for a total of six washes. Subsequently, cells were treated with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Invitrogen) at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml for nucleic acid counterstaining. Images were acquired by confocal microscopy (FV1000, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) with Olympus FV10-ASW 1.3 viewer software.
