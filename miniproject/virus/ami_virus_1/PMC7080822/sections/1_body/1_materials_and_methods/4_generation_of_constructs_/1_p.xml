<p>Two sets of constructs were generated for expression of NS1 proteins with fusion of either a FLAG-tag or enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) at its C-terminus. PCR was used to amplify the coding region of the four NS1 variants. The resulting PCR fragments were subsequently treated with two restriction enzymes, 
 <italic>Eco</italic>RI
 <italic>/Kpn</italic>I and 
 <italic>Bgl</italic>II/
 <italic>Not</italic>I, for cloning into vector pCMV14 (Sigma-Aldrich) or GFP-pcDNA3.1 (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">Tseng et al., 2015</xref>), which express FLAG-tag and eGFP, respectively. Human PKR fused with an HA-tag was amplified, treated with 
 <italic>Bam</italic>HI/
 <italic>Xho</italic>I, and then ligated with vector pcDNA6 linearized with the same set of enzymes (
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2019</xref>). The components of RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex [PA, PB1, PB2, and nucleoprotein (NP)] in A/chicken/Taiwan/0702/2013, the parental virus, were individually amplified by PCR and cloned into vector pCMV14 (Sigma-Aldrich) linearized with 
 <italic>Kpn</italic>I and 
 <italic>Not</italic>I.
