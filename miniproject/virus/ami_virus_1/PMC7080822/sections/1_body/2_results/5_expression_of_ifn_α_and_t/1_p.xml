<p>Regulation of cytokine expression of RG-AIVs was also investigated in human cells. Human A549 cells were infected with reassortant viruses at a MOI of 0.1, and the expression levels of IFN-α and TNF-α mRNA were measured by qRT-PCR at 6 hpi. The results showed that cells infected with NS1031 expressed higher levels of IFN-α and TNF-α than those infected with parental virus (
