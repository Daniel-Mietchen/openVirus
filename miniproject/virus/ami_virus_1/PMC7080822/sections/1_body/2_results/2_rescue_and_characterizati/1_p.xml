<p>To characterize the contribution of NS1 variants to viral replication, four reassortant H6N1 AIVs engineered by reverse genetics (RG-AIVs) were generated in the genetic background of A/chicken/Taiwan/0702/2013 (H6N1) carrying the NS segment of different H5 viral strains. The RG-AIVs were named according to the origin of the NS gene, that is, NS0702 (A/chicken/Taiwan/0702/2013), NS683 (A/chicken/Taiwan/683/2012), NS1680 (A/chicken/Taiwan/1680/2013), and NS1031 (A/goose/Taiwan/01031/2015). Of note, the four representative viruses were classified into distinct clades; eight genetic segments of NS0702 originated from the endemic H6N1 virus isolated in 2013, the same year as the HPAI H5N2 A/chicken/Taiwan/1680/2013 (NS1680); whereas A/chicken/Taiwan/683/2012 (NS683) and A/goose/Taiwan/01031/2015 (NS1031) originated from the endemic Mexican-like HPAIV H5N2 isolated in 2012 and clade 2.3.4.4 H5N2 isolated in 2015, respectively (
