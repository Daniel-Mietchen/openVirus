<p>Non-structural gene substitution affected plaque formation of RG-AIV on MDCK cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In particular, NS1031 plaques were significantly smaller than those of the other three RG-AIVs. Furthermore, the expression level of NS1 and NP proteins in NS1031 RG-AIV-infected MDCK and DF1 cells was lower than that of cells infected by the other three viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). As indicated in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>, NS1 was predominantly localized in the nucleus, except NS1031, the majority of which can be detected in nuclear, cytoplasm, or both nucleus and cytoplasm in 3, 18, and 31 of the 52 positive staining cells, respectively.
