<p>Since December 2003, the LPAI H5N2 has caused repeated epidemics in poultry farms in Taiwan. In 2012, the Mexican-like LPAI H5N2 evolved to HPAI. In early 2015, poultries in Taiwan suffered from infections of the clade 2.3.4.4 H5 HPAIVs, rather than the endemic Mexican-like H5N2 viruses. Sequence analysis revealed that the NS gene of these new viruses shared a distinct phylogenetic relationship with the endemic H6N1 and H5N2 viruses (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S1</xref>). Moreover, sequence alignment indicated that the similarity of the NS1 protein sequence between the four viruses was as low as 90.6% (A/chicken/TW/0702/2013 vs. A/chicken/TW/1680/2013), and the coding region of NS1680 was shorter than that of the other three NS1, namely, NS683, NS0702, and NS01031 (
