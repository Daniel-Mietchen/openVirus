<p>The NS gene encodes two proteins, namely, NS1 and NS2, by alternative splicing. As with NS1, sporadic sequence variations were noted in the NS2 coding region (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS1">Supplementary Figure S4</xref>). Nonetheless, the conserved residues responsible for the key function of NS2 (ref), including nuclear export signal, were conserved. NS2 facilitates the nucleocytoplasmic export of viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) (

 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Shimizu et al., 2011</xref>); therefore, we investigated the NS2 function of these four RG-AIVs by monitoring the cellular localization of RNP. Although the majority of RNP remained in the nucleus, it also readily distributed to cytoplasm of cells infected with the four RG-AIVs, including NS1031, at 24 hpi (
