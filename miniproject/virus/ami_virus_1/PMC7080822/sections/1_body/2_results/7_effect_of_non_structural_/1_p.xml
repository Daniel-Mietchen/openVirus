<p>In addition to serving as an IFN antagonist, accumulating evidence indicates a modulatory role of NS1 on cellular and viral gene expression (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2010</xref>; 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Kuo et al., 2016b</xref>). We exploited a mini-genome reporter assay to determine the possible role of NS1 on viral RdRp activity. Expression of NS0702 and NS683 proteins, as compared with EV, significantly enhanced viral genome replication activity, whereas NS1031 did not have a synergic effect on RdRp function (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8B</xref>, NS0702 markedly reduced the GFP level, whereas NS1031 played no role on such an effect (
