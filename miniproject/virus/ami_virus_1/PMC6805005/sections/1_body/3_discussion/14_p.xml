<p>This systematic review has three important weaknesses. First, due to scale, a completely independent two-reviewer system was not used for abstracting most of the data and for evaluation of aspects such as reproducibility. Second, we did not formally search for preprint manuscripts as part of the literature searching phase of the systematic review, only assessing whether eligible manuscripts had corresponding preprints. We may have therefore missed important research that had been posted but not yet peer-reviewed. Lastly, we had to restrict the time frame for publications to consider in the review. This restriction again led to missing studies, some of which may have already been published but not yet posted in EMBASE or MEDLINE. An additional challenge with our systematic review was that we did not provide a specific definition of “forecasting” and “prediction” to reviewers (to avoid an overly strict eligibility criteria). This led to collection of data on phenomena such as R
 <sub>0,</sub> which is an estimate as opposed to a forecast or prediction that could be potentially validated with data.
