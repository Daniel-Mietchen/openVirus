<p>Our results also identified the need for improved sharing of computational code to permit full result reproducibility. Shared model code could also be adapted by other researchers during time-sensitive epidemics. An important caveat here is that appropriate expertise and rigorous validation should be exercised before the use of model code developed by others, in the same fashion as other biomedical research fields which frequently disseminate code-based research tools in their publications (for instance, pathogen genomics and bioinformatics).</p>
