<p>Our review also provided a unique analysis of the funding sources and author affiliations of the published ZIKV prediction and forecast efforts across the ZIKV pandemic. These results indicated a range of stakeholders, and a diverse source of funding streams, including NGOs. We note that while academia contributed to the greatest volume of published studies, our search strategy would not have captured in-house models developed by US federal agencies or other unpublished models which may have provided direct operational support. Our data also suggested that the Government sector was the leading funder of all Zika prediction and forecasting studies during this period. Despite being a major stakeholder in ZIKV forecasts (e.g. prediction of whether it may have been feasible to plan a Phase III vaccine study in Latin America), we did not find evidence of pharmaceutical industry funded forecasting studies, although our search would not have identified unpublished models.</p>
