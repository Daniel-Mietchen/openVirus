<p>The leading data types for the examined studies were conventional case counts, vector, demographic, climate, and transport data. This finding reflects not only the availability but also the importance of such data. Case count data in particular are often hard to access but critical to many modeling approaches. Rapid sharing of case count data during international public health emergencies, as well as open, curated, rapidly accessible baseline demographic, human mobility, climate, and environmental datasets are essential to quickly leverage modeling and forecasting efforts [

The lack of behavioral components in these models is concerning given the importance of these factors on disease dynamics [

Second, real-time internet-based data-streams, such as social media and internet search engine data, were used in a minority of ZIKV prediction studies identified in this systematic review. The limited use of internet ‘big data’ in the models suggests that either these data are of lower value for epidemic forecasting or that methods have yet to be developed to efficiently extract important information from them. Such data streams may be more commonly used in forecasting in the future as their strengths and weakness become clearer [
