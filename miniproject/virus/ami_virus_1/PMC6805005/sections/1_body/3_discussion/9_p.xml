<p>The variable quality in sharing model code and methodological detail shown here does suggest that epidemic model reporting consensus guidelines, which establish a minimum standard for the reporting of epidemic modeling, may be valuable. A recent review of the modeling efforts for the Ebola epidemic also called for standardization of modeling practice [
