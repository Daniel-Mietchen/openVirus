<p>Our systematic review did not delve deeply into modeling approaches, but did identify a preponderance of deterministic as opposed to stochastic models. Both categories of models have pros and cons and their use is often informed by the specific question being addressed, in addition to data availability [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Deterministic models may generally be easier to produce, but they may have limitations for intrinsically stochastic processes like epidemics, such as underestimating uncertainty, although deterministic models can also be implemented to estimate uncertainty [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Uncertainty is particularly important in this context where uncertainties are generated by the epidemic itself, data collection, and analytical approaches. Moreover, forecasts are ideally used to inform the mobilization of resources to save lives, a context in which clearly characterizing uncertainties is paramount. This is also a clear area for improvement in model output reporting; only 43% of studies entirely reported estimates of uncertainty. However, studies which did not present, say a credible interval around a forecasted phenomenon, may still have incorporated uncertainty in other ways which were not captured by the data abstraction tool, for instance a scenario analysis or incorporating uncertainty around parameters in a deterministic model.
