<p>In contrast to existing reviews on models developed during the ZIKV pandemic, which described specific contributions of modeling [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>], this systematic review focused on capturing lessons that could improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks. Extending an approach used by Chretien et al. in their evaluation of Ebola models, we focused on aspects of the studies that likely are particularly relevant to their usefulness during an outbreak [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. This included modeling methods and input data, timeliness and accessibility of the publications, reproducibility (e.g. provision of data and code), and the communication of uncertainty.
