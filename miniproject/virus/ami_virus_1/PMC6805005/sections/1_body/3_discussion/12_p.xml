<p>We identified two modifiable bottlenecks in the dissemination of results. First, delays from acceptance to journal publication were generally minimal (median 15 days), but a quarter of the evaluated studies had greater than 24 days delay from journal acceptance to publication. Immediate posting of accepted papers, as practiced by many journals, could cut this time down substantially. Second, we found that only 30% of studies were made available as preprints prior to peer review despite endorsements of preprints by major public agencies, funders, and journals. Those posted were available a median of 119 days prior to peer-reviewed publication. An analysis of preprints for all Zika publications over a similar time period found similar publication delays but much lower overall preprint use compared to the studies analyzed here (3.4% versus 30%) [

This greater adoption may indicate a changing preprint culture which was also reflected by our finding that preprint posting did not have a demonstrable effect on the impact factor of the journal in which the study was published, and we suggest that pre-prints be more frequently used in future public health emergencies, echoing other similar recent arguments [
