<p>Our systematic review identified a large number of Zika models that predicted a wide range of epidemiological and ecological phenomena. The most commonly predicted phenomena were spatial spread, R
 <sub>0</sub>, epidemic dynamics, microcephaly burden, and vector competence. Notably few of the studies modeled the impact or cost-effectiveness of interventions, sexual transmission risk, or GBS burden. Not surprisingly, the majority of the studies were set in the Americas where most of the cases were reported during the pandemic. Notably one of the global gaps for understanding ZIKV dynamics is Africa, where ZIKV was discovered, is endemic, and poses a risk of future epidemics [
