<p>Genomic data were absent from these published models. During the pandemic, sequencing platforms were employed to generate data critical to diagnostic and countermeasure development [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>], but our systematic review revealed that these data were not incorporated into prediction frameworks during the first year of ZIKV pandemic. This may reflect that early molecular epidemiology studies aimed to reconstruct the invasion and evolution of ZIKV rather than forecasting future changes [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Some phylodynamic studies were published after the time period of the systematic review, with interesting results highlighting the possibility for phylogenetic data to provide unique insight into epidemic dynamics and possibly forecasting [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>]. The relative delay of these studies (relative to those using other data sources) echoes a similar time lag of phylogenetic studies during the 2015 Ebola epidemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. The lack of phylogenomic studies captured by this review also suggests that substantial bottlenecks still exist in using these data sources in epidemic response, despite advances in mobile near “real-time” sequencing technologies [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. In the future, as new methods are developed, and genomic data become more readily available, the use of these data will likely become more common in prospective forecasting frameworks.
