<p>We conducted a literature review using EMBASE and MEDLINE (PubMed) to identify all potentially eligible studies, which predicted or forecasted phenomena of the ZIKV pandemic. In MEDLINE we performed a highly sensitive search solely using the term “Zika.” A complementary search in EMBASE used a more specific ontology: “Zika AND (forecasting OR prediction OR model OR modeling OR modelling OR risk OR estimating OR dynamics) NOT mouse.” Both database searches were limited to articles published as of March 1, 2017, and the MEDLINE searches were restricted to publications released between February 1, 2016 and March 1, 2017. We used this end date to capture those models published during a time-frame of major operational relevance (that is, during the early, peak, and waning phase of the Americas epidemic). We complemented these database search results with ‘grey literature,’ including hand-searched bibliographies of major Zika epidemiological review articles [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and contacting experts in the field of Zika modeling to identify any studies which may have been missed by the above search strategies.
