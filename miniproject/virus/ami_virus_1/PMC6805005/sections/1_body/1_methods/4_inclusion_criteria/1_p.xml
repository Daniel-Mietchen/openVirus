<p>We included studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated any epidemiological or ecological phenomena about the Zika pandemic (including studies regarding previous outbreaks and epidemics, and regions outside the Americas), including but not limited to spatial spread risk, host and ecological range, disease and complication burden, economic impact transmission, and other epidemic dynamics. We didnâ€™t require studies to explicitly present a future phenomenon risk, and we included time agnostic estimations of key epidemic parameters (for instance R
 <sub>0</sub>) and other phenomena.
