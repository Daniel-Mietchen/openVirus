<p>Data were abstracted from the full texts by 12 reviewers (single-reviewer abstraction) across the domains of (i) objectives and study population, (ii) methodology and reproducibility, (iii) accessibility, timeliness, and other bibliometrics of eligible studies, and (iv) author affiliation and funding sources (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007451.s002">S1 Table</xref>). In addition, the availability of preprint manuscripts was assessed using the pre-print search webtool 
 <italic>search</italic>.
 <italic>bioPreprint</italic> [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], a server which identifies preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, F1000Research, PeerJ Preprints, and Wellcome Open Research. Additionally, we manually searched arXiv and bioRxiv archives to confirm pre-print availability. These pre-print repositories are distinct from the advanced electronic publications made available by most journals after acceptance and peer review. Such ‘grey literature’ review extended beyond the cut-off date for the main literature database searches. A two-reviewer approach was used to ascertain whether eligible studies were made available as pre-print. From the abstracted data, descriptive analyses (medians, IQR, ranges, and proportions), and limited hypothesis testing were performed using Stata version 13.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).
