<p>Over 90% of the studies included authors with academic affiliations (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Government affiliated authors participated in a minority of studies, although this may simply reflect “in-house” operational models not being published through journals. Among studies with identifiable funding sources, funding was divided among several sources, though the most common was the United States government, which funded or partially funded 50% of the studies (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). However, many of those studies and others had a variety of funding sources, 85% had at least one non-U.S. government source. Non-governmental organizations were the second most common source, being included in 35% of the studies.
