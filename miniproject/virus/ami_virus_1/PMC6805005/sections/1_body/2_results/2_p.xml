<p>Only 40% of studies made all relevant source data entirely accessible, while more than 20% of the eligible studies did not make any source data available either directly (e.g. an associated data repository) or indirectly (e.g. a citation or web-link) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The visual display of model output was at least partly clear and accurate in 95% of the studies. Over a third of the studies did not present estimates of prediction uncertainty. Approximately half of the studies did not entirely present methods with a level of detail to allow reproducibility. Over 60% of the studies did not provide any computational code used for the analyses. We classified more models as deterministic (76%) as opposed to stochastic. It should be emphasized we only ultimately evaluated whether a model was deterministic versus stochastic.
