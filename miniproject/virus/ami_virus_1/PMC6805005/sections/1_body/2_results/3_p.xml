<p>The large majority of published manuscripts were freely accessible (e.g. without a paywall), although 4% were published with paid access only (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Less than one third of manuscripts were posted on rapid preprint servers (e.g. bioRxiv) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref099" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>], prior to publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The median time from journal submission to e-journal publication was 93.5 days, with the maximum time greater than 1 year. This included delays after manuscript acceptance, 25% of the studies had delays of more than 24 days between acceptance and publication (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). Most of the prediction studies were published late in the epidemic, well after the peaks in reported Zika cases (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007451.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Submitting manuscripts to preprint servers made results available earlier by a median of 119 days (maximum 331 days, IQR 30â€“177 days) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). This shift led to more results being available close to the time of the 2016 South America and Central America epidemic peaks and prior to the epidemic peak in the Caribbean and the 2017 peak in Central America (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007451.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Comparing the impact factor of journals accepting studies which were posted as preprints (versus the impact factor of those journals accepting studies which were not posted as pre-prints), there was no significant difference (median impact factor 4.37 vs. 4.45 respectively; p = 0.84 by Mann-Whitney U test).
