<p>While the WHO PHEIC status was lifted in November 2016 and the neotropical Zika pandemic has waned, the forecasting activities during the pandemic have not been systematically examined, particularly whether the studies were published in a manner and time-frame that was actionable during the Zika pandemic [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Such an exercise is critical, not only due to the ongoing risk of Zika globally [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007451.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], but also to inform modeling efforts for future major epidemics. We therefore undertook a systematic review to identify all published ZIKV prediction and forecasting studies during a time period which encompassed the PHEIC period and the peak and waning phase of the epidemic in the Americas. The first aim of this systematic review was to identify all published models that predicted, forecasted, or simulated any ecological or epidemiological phenomenon about the Zika pandemic and describe the predicted phenomena, the range of data sources used, and the modeling methods employed. This first aim sought to characterize the methods and data employed to answer key questions during the epidemic and to identify potentially underutilized data or methods. The second aim was to evaluate key scientific characteristics of these studies, including (i) accessibility and timeliness of the publication, (ii) reproducibility of the methods and access to the statistical code and data, and (iii) clarity of the presentation of the prediction results, including uncertainty in prediction estimates. The third aim was to describe the funding structure and major contributing sectors, such as government, industry, non-governmental organizations, or academia, behind these publications.
