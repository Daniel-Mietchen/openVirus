    "Most of the diseases caused by viral infection are found to be fatal, and the diagnosis is difficult due to confusion with other causative agents. So, a highly efficient molecular-based advance detection technique, i.e., loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method, is developed for diagnosis of viral infections by various workers. It is based on amplification of DNA at very low level under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specifically designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. This technique is found to be superior than most of the molecular techniques like PCR, RT-PCR, and real-time PCR due to its high specificity, sensitivity, and rapidity. Major advantage of LAMP method is its cost-effectiveness as it can be done simply by using water bath or dry bath. Here, in this review information regarding almost all the effective LAMP techniques which is developed so far for diagnosis of numerous viral pathogens is presented."
