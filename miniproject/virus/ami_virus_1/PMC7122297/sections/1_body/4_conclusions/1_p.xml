<p>Compared with RT-PCR and real-time PCR, LAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity. The higher sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP reaction is attributed to continuous amplification under isothermal conditions employing six primers recognizing eight distinct regions of the target. Additionally, the higher amplification efficiency of the LAMP reaction yields large amounts of by-product (pyrophosphate ion) leading to a white precipitate of magnesium pyrophosphate in the reaction mixture. Since the increase in turbidity of the reaction mixture—according to the production of precipitate—correlates with the amount of DNA synthesized, real-time monitoring of the LAMP reaction can be achieved by real-time measurement of turbidity. The LAMP assay has emerged as a powerful gene amplification tool for the rapid identification of microbial infections and is being increasingly used by various investigators for the rapid detection and typing of emerging viruses, including WNV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), dengue, and JEV.</p>
