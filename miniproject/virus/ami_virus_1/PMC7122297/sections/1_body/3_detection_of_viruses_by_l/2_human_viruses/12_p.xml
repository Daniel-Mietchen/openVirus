<p>Varicella (chickenpox) is a common and highly contagious disease in childhood that is caused by primary infection with varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The virus infects the dorsal root ganglia after primary infection, and its reactivation leads to shingles (zoster) in older individuals. In 1995, universal varicella immunization was started in the United States with VZV Oka (vOka strain) vaccine. Molecular analysis of the VZV genome (obtained from vesicular regions) used to discriminate the vOka strains and wild-type strains was based on restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the viral genomes from isolated viruses (La Russa et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR95">1992</xref>). But this method had limited general clinical use because the virus had to be isolated from the vesicular region. PCR methods were used to overcome this problem, PCR which can detect single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations in open reading frame 38 (ORF38), ORF54, and ORF62 had been developed to distinguish the vOka and wild-type strains (Argaw et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>; Quinlivan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR139">2005</xref>). Higashimoto et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2008</xref>) developed LAMP method to distinguish between the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccine (vOka) strain and wild-type strains. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (nucleotide [nt] 105705 for VR-1 VZV LAMP and nt 106262 for VR-2 VZV LAMP) located in the open reading frame 62 gene were selected as LAMP targets. The detection limits of both LAMP methods were 100 copies per reaction, which is higher than that of the previously reported VZV LAMP method (Okamoto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR120">2004</xref>), and also this method can detect viral DNA directly from swab samples without need of DNA extraction.
