<p>Novel H1N1 (letters refer to haemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins on the surface of the virus; the numbers refer to slight variations in the forms of each protein) 2009 pandemic virus affected individuals worldwide and caused over 18,138 deaths since its initial outbreak in March 2009. Comparative study of sequences available into public databases suggests that since April 2009 a range of genetic variation has arisen in H1N1 viruses (Zhang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR183">2009</xref>). To eradicate the probability of false-negative results due to mutations in these genes, the RT-LAMP method was designed by Hiromoto et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2000</xref>) and Welman and Arora (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR174">2000</xref>) in order to detect the gene encoding the matrix protein, a type-specific antigen of influenza virus (highly conserved and undergoes less evolutionary change). Out of 57 pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus-positive samples identified by virus isolation only one false-negative result was obtained when the clinical samples were tested with M-specific RT-LAMP. There are two possible explanations for the failure of the amplification. It was worthy to note that, as the M segment of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus is phylogenetically close to the avian-like swine lineage, one might be concerned about cross-reactivity when using the M-specific RT-LAMP with other avian-origin influenza viruses. However, unlike swine influenza, avian influenza A viruses do not commonly circulate in humans, and therefore the chances of this potential misinterpretation are low. On the other hand, learning from previous experiences during H5N1 outbreaks, any avian-origin influenza virus detected in a human specimen indicates a cross-species infection, which means that special precautions need to be taken. Hence, any possible lack of specificity related to the M-based nucleic acid assay should not pose a particular problem for its routine use, and any human sample with a risk of being infected by avian influenza should also be tested using an H5N1-specific assay to obtain a definite diagnosis (Carr et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2009</xref>). The sensitivities of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specific RT-LAMP assay and a TaqMan real-time reverse transcription PCR assay performed with the SW H1 primer/probe set (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR177">2009b</xref>) were compared by testing ten-fold serial dilutions of in vitro-transcribed target RNA (from 100 to 104 copies) in quadruplicate. Both assays were equally sensitive, and the detection limit was ten copies of target RNA per reaction volume. All the positive amplifications by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specific RT-LAMP assay were achieved in less than 40 min. The pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specific RT-LAMP assay targets only the HA gene, so this RT-LAMP method has difficulty with the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 viruses which have HA genes that are difficult to amplify even by rRT-PCR. This may be a limitation of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specific RT-LAMP method. This limitation could be overcome by combining the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus HA-specific RT-LAMP assay with conventional RT-PCR for the matrix gene of influenza A virus (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR176">2009a</xref>) or by designing influenza A virus consensus RT-LAMP assay primers and performing the two RT-LAMP assays together. Based on above facts and data, there is an urgent need for the development of an easy, accurate, and simple method for the diagnosis of this novel pandemic virus (Lee et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2010</xref>). Lee et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR99">2010</xref>) developed M-specific reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification for detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. Based on validation by virus isolation, the specificity and sensitivity of this M-specific RT-LAMP assay were 100 % and 98.25 %, respectively. A newly emerged pandemic human influenza virus 2009 which is a triple reassortant including segments from swine, avian, and human influenza viruses (Garten et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2009</xref>; Shinde et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR154">2009</xref>; Smith et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR158">2009</xref>) has spread throughout the world. Kubo et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">2010</xref>) developed an HA-specific LAMP assay for the detection of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus with 100 % specificity and 97.8 % sensitivity. This method was also considered as a novel molecular method for diagnosis of pandemic influenza in resource-limited settings.
