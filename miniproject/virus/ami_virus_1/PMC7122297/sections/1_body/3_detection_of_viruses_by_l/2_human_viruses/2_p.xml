<p>Mumps virus was circulating throughout the world, but in the United States the acceptance of MMR combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella has reduced the number of patients suffering from mumps (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1998</xref>; Peltola et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR131">1994</xref>). Mumps patients having high vaccine coverage are prone to suffering from secondary vaccine failure (SVF) (Pugh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR138">2002</xref>). Due to this critical problem, rapid detection of mumps virus by a fast diagnostic technique was necessary. Therefore, Okafuji et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR119">2005</xref>) developed a fast LAMP assay for detection of mumps virus genome with a detection of 0.1 PFU along with the same sensitivity as RT-nested PCR within 60 min only. Similarly, Yoshida et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR181">2008</xref>) developed RT-LAMP assay for mumps virus with a detection limit of 0.12 PFU/μl. According to a WHO report, approximately two billion people are infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and more than 350 million have a chronic HBV infection. Molecular diagnostic assays have provided insight into the pathogenesis and natural history of HBV infection and have facilitated detection of drug resistance (Lok et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR102">2001</xref>; Corden et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2003</xref>). Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is responsible for hepatocellular carcinoma (a liver disease) in approximately 350–400 million people all over the world (Dienstag 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2008</xref>). Cai et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2008</xref>) detected hepatitis B virus by RtF-LAMP and determined the lower detection limit of LAMP by Probit analysis at the 95 % detection level (210 copies/ml). So, RtF-LAMP was more precise in detecting low titers of the virus which makes it more useful than real-time PCR in clinical applications. Moslemi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR112">2009</xref>) also detected hepatitis B virus by LAMP method and observed that PCR sensitivity was up to 40 particles, while the LAMP sensitivity test was verified up to four particles.
