<p>In the early stages of ocular manifestations, clinical differentiation between patients of retinitis associated with CMV and other herpesvirus infections is often difficult (Knox et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">1998</xref>). Viral retinitis is commonly caused by herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), HSV-2, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and occasionally by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Madhavan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2004</xref>). It is very important to differentiate CMV retinitis from HSV and VZV retinitis early in the course of infection because the therapeutic agent to be used for treatment differs from virus to virus (Madhavan et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR106">2004</xref>). So LAMP assay was developed for their differentiation. Reddy et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR141">2010</xref>) developed a simple and cost-effective LAMP assay for the rapid detection of CMV DNA in patients infected with viral retinitis. It is highly sensitive as its lower detection limit is ten copies of CMV DNA per microliter. Also it is a time-saving technique; the time required for amplification and detection of the product is about 75 min by the LAMP assay, whereas that for PCR is 4 h.
