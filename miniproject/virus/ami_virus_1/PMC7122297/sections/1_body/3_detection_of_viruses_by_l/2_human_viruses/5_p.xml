<p>Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common infectious disease in young children and infants and is characterized by fever, ulcers in the mouth, and vesicles on the hands and feet. Two enteroviruses, i.e., human enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16), are responsible for this disease. Schmidt et al. (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">2011</xref>) developed an RT-LAMP assay targeting the VP3 gene of EV71 and further evaluated with 40 clinical stool samples collected during the epidemics of HFMD in Guangxi province of China in 2009. This assay was found to be more sensitive and accurate, so it may become a useful alternative in resource-limited hospital laboratories and rural clinics for diagnosis of EV71. The sensitivity of the EV71-specific RT-LAMP is 0.01 PFU per reaction mixture, which is similar to the rRT-PCR assay. Based on 40 clinical samples from suspected HFMD cases, 92.9 % diagnostic sensitivity was achieved with the RT-LAMP assay.
