<p>Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a major causative agent of lower respiratory tract infections in children and adults worldwide. Children born preterm or with underlying cardiopulmonary disorders are at specially high risk of developing severe and lethal RSV respiratory tract infections (American Academy of Pediatrics

For RSV detection, primers were designed according to the highly conserved nucleotide sequence located in the matrix protein region of the nucleoprotein region. RT-LAMP can detect viral RNA in 10
