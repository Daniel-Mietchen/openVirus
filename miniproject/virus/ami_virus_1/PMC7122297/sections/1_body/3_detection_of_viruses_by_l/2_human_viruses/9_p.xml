<p>In recent years, emergence or reemergence of severe arboviral hemorrhagic fevers caused by mosquito-borne viruses such as dengue virus and chikungunya (CHIK) virus has been frequently reported in the Indian subcontinent. Parida et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR125">2007</xref>) developed a rapid and real-time detection of chikungunya virus by RT-LAMP assay. RT-LAMP assay correctly identified 21 additional positive borderline cases from acute-phase patient serum samples that were missed by conventional RT-PCR (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) with a detection limit of 20 copies. Humans infected with CHIK virus produce an illness often characterized by sudden onset of fever, headache, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, rash, myalgia, severe arthralgia, and polyarthralgia (typical clinical sign of the disease is very painful). Self-limiting symptoms last from 1 to 10 days.
