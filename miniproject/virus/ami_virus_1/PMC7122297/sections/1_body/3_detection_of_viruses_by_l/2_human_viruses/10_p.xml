<p>The most common cause of childhood viral encephalitis is Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in the world, causing an estimated 50,000 infections and 10,000 deaths annually. Several serological tests, such as the hemagglutination inhibition test, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), serum neutralization techniques, and dot enzyme immunoassay, had been used for the detection of antibody for JEV infection (Burke et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1982</xref>; Soloman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR160">1998</xref>). For many years, the hemagglutination inhibition test had been employed, but this has various practical limitations. Besides being cumbersome, it requires paired serum samples and therefore cannot give an early diagnosis. In 2006, Toriniwa and Komiya standardized RT-LAMP for the rapid detection and quantification of JEV by targeting the E gene, but still the application of this novel gene amplification system for the clinical diagnosis of JE patients during epidemic situations needs to be established through evaluation with a large number of clinical samples (Toriniwa and Komiya 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR166">2006</xref>). Further, Parida et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR124">2006</xref>) also developed LAMP assay for detection of JEV, but this time particular importance is given to the substantial reduction in time required for the confirmation of results by RT-LAMP assay (in 30 min compared to 3â€“4 h in the case of RT-PCR). The RT-LAMP assay demonstrated exceptionally higher sensitivity compared to that of RT-PCR, with a detection limit of 0.1 PFU.
