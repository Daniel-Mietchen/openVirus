<p>Nie (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR116">2005</xref>) developed reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification of DNA for the detection of potato virus 
 <italic>Y.</italic> Coat protein (CP) gene was selected for designing the primers in such a way that a loop could be formed and elongated during DNA amplification. LAMP assay was found to be 10-fold more sensitive than conventional PCR.
