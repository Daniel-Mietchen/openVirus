<p>Banana streak virus (BSV) is a significant cons-traint to banana production and genetic improvement. Therefore, Peng et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR132">2012</xref>) developed an assay for rapid detection of banana streak virus by loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay in South China. LAMP assay could detect as low as 1 pg/Î¼l template DNA. Test results of all field samples collected from different regions of South China showed that LAMP is more sensitive than PCR.
