<p>Wheat yellow mosaic as one of the most devastating soilborne disease of winter wheat (
 <italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) was first reported in Japan in the 1920s and China in the 1960s (Sawada 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR149">1927</xref>; Kusume et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR94">1997</xref>) which spread continually in Japan and China (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR171">1980</xref>; Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2000</xref>). A soilborne pathogen, i.e., wheat yellow mosaic virus (WYMV), was the causal agent responsible behind this disease, and it is transmitted by the fungus-like organism polymyxa graminis (Inouye 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1969</xref>). Several common methods were used to detect WYMV, and ELISA was found as a reliable and suitable method for detecting high-throughput WYMV (Hariri et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1996a</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">b</xref>; Geng et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>), but the sensitivity of ELISA might not be sufficiently high to detect low concentrations of WYMV; plus virus-specific antiserum is required for ELISA assay. Zhang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR184">2011</xref>) developed RT-LAMP as a rapid detection method for wheat yellow mosaic virus. RT-LAMP could detect WYMV from total RNA diluted up to 10
 <sup>−5</sup>, while RT-PCR detected only up to 10
 <sup>−3</sup>. So, RT-LAMP was 100 times more sensitive than conventional reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
