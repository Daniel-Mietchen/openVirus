<p>Tsutsumi et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR167">2010</xref>) developed RT-LAMP for the detection of potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd-S). Potato spindle tuber viroid (PSTVd) is a species of the genus 
 <italic>Pospiviroid</italic> in the family Pospiviroidae that occurs in China (He et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">1987</xref>), Europe, and so on. PSTVd infects potatoes (
 <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic>), tomatoes (
 <italic>Lycopersicon esculentum</italic>), and other 
 <italic>Solanum</italic> spp. (Singh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR157">1973</xref>). PSTVd causes stunting, smaller and elongated tubers, and yield losses of potatoes (Pfannenstiel and Slack 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR134">1980</xref>). The occurrence of PSTVd has not been recorded in Japan, except a temporary occurrence in a greenhouse in Fukushima Prefecture in 2008. As a result of investigation of its cause, it could be thought to originate from imported tomato seeds. Sensitivity for PSTVd-S was determined from extracted DNA of infected potato leaf and serially diluted up to 10
 <sup>−4</sup> times with sterilized water. It was possible to detect PSTVd from the extracted total nucleic acid diluted 10
 <sup>−3</sup> in RT-LAMP method and diluted to 10
 <sup>−2</sup> times in RT-PCR method. RT-LAMP method was ten times higher sensitive than RT-PCR method.
