<p>The most commonly known peach viroid is peach latent mosaic viroid (PLMVd) which causes a vast majority of natural infections (except leaf symptoms) but long time is required for the onset of symptoms. So a sensitive, accessible, reliable, cost-effective, and fast diagnostic method is in demand to control PLMVd spread and the production of healthy and of high-quality propagation material. Boubourakas et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>) developed an RT-LAMP protocol for the detection of PLMVd with a detection limit of 10
 <sup>âˆ’5</sup>. RT-LAMP products were confirmed for the presence of corresponding sequences of the selected target by subjecting a portion of the amplified products to the restriction enzyme analysis (Kubota et al.
