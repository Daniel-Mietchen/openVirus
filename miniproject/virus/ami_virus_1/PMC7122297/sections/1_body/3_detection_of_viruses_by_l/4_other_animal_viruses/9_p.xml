<p>Swine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) is a kind of single-stranded RNA virus, which produces villous atrophy and enteritis, leading to the serious financial loss to the whole pig industry. The traditional detection methods including virus isolation, virus immunodiagnostic assays, and PCR tests have shortcomings such as precise instruments requirement, demand of elaborate result analysis, high cost, and long detection time, which prevent these methods from being widely used (Reynolds and Garwes

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR144">2005</xref>; Denac et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1997</xref>; Paton et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR128">1997</xref>). TGEV can be detected by using loop-mediated isothermal amplification with the detection limit of about 10 pg RNA which is ten times more sensitive than that of PCR and having no cross-reaction with other viruses (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>) and found that the most conserved fragment of 187 bp was found in the nucleocapsid protein gene which showed highly homology among different TGEV strains/isolates (more than 97 %) and low homology among other similar viruses (less than 52.5 %). LAMP could not only qualitatively detect the TGEV but also quantitatively analyze the virus. It was concluded that real-time fluorescence LAMP for quantitatively detection of TGEV was established by adding 1X SYBR Green I in the LAMP reaction.
