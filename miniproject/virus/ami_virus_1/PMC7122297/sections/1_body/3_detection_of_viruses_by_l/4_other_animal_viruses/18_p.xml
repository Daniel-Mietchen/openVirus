<p>Last year in 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2012</xref>, Foord et al. developed hendra virus detection using loop-mediated isothermal amplification. Hendra virus (HeV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus endemic in Australian Pteropus bats (fruit bats or flying foxes). Although bats appear to be unaffected by the virus, HeV can spread from fruit bats to horses, causing severe disease. Human infection results from close contact with the blood, body fluids, and tissues of infected horses. HeV is a biosecurity level 4 (BSL-4) pathogens, with high fatality rate in humans and horses. Current assays for HeV detection require complex instrumentation and are generally time-consuming. Analytical sensitivity and specificity of the HeV-LAMP assay was equal to a TaqMan assay developed previously.
