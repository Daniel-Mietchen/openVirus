<p>African swine fever virus causes a viral hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in pigs but persistently infects its natural hosts, warthogs, bushpigs, and soft ticks, with no disease signs (Viruses of Animals, George Durrell

Pseudorabies virus causes Aujeszkyâ€™s disease in pigs and is extensively studied as a model for basic processes during lytic herpesvirus infection. Bovine herpesvirus-1 causes bovine infectious rhinotracheitis and pustular vulvovaginitis. The avian infectious laryngotracheitis virus is phylogenetically different from these two viruses. A large variety of influenza A viruses infect wild aquatic birds. Major economic losses in poultry production are due to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) which also threatens human health. For rapid AIV detection, new assays would be designed that can be carried out with a minimum of specific equipment as compared to conventional methods. Although RT-LAMP was markedly more vulnerable to reduce the detection limits because of strain-specific sequence variation than subtype-specific real-time RT-PCR. Because of simplicity, LAMP proves to be a promising technology for AIV diagnosis (Notomi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR118">2000</xref>; Parida et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>). Real-time RT-PCR also represents the gold standard for AIV RNA detection as it is considerably more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR (Pasick 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR127">2008</xref>). All RNA samples tested specifically positive in the real-time RT-LAMP were also assayed for sensitivity and compared with real-time RT-PCR. All AIV-targeted RT-LAMP assays developed so far have been compared with conventional RT-PCR, and sensitivity was calculated on the basis of infectivity, not taking into account the amount of RNA copies (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2008</xref>; Imai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2006</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2007</xref>; Jayawardena et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81">2007</xref>). Chen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2010</xref>) diagnosed H9 avian influenza virus by using reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with a detection limit of ten copies per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was observed from the samples of other related viruses including H5N1, H3N2 subtype of AIV, and Newcastle disease virus. Again in 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR114">2011</xref>, Nagatani et al. detected RNA of influenza virus by reverse transcription LAMP using a USB-powered portable potentiostat.
