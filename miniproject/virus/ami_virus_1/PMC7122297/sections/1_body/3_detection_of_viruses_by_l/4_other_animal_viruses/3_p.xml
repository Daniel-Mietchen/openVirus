 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">2006</xref>). So, it was quite urgent and necessary to control causative virus responsible behind this veterinary infection. Chen et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2011</xref>) successfully detected foot-and-mouth disease viral RNA by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification method with the detection limit of 10 copies, whereas RT-PCR detected 100 copies per reaction.
