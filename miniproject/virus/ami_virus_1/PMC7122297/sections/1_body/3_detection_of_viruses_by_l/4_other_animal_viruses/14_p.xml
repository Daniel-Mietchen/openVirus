<p>Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic mosquito-borne virus with tripartite negative-strand RNA genome composed of a large segment (L), encoding the viral transcriptase, a medium segment (M), coding for the two external glycoproteins (GN and GC), and an S segment, which codes for the nucleocapsid protein (N) and a nonstructural protein (NSs) (Schmaljohn 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR150">1996</xref>). The virus causes explosive outbreaks in animals and humans (Durand et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2003</xref>) and has been observed in Egypt, in Mauritania, and more recently in the Arabian Peninsula (Bird et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>). Domestic animals are sensitive to RVFV infection and amplify the virus to high titers (Zeller and Bouloy 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR182">2000</xref>). Among cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and camels, infection causes fever and anorexia. Peyrefitte et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR133">2008</xref>) also developed a real-time reverse transcription LAMP for rapid detection of Rift Valley fever virus. The assay is highly sensitive and comparable to real-time RT-PCR, with a detection limit of ~10 RNA copies per assay.
