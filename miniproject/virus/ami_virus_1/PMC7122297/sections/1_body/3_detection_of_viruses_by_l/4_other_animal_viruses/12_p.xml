 <italic>.</italic> With a DNA template extracted from PemoNPV-infected shrimp, the LAMP-LFD detection limit was 0.1 pg, whereas one-step PCR and nested PCR followed with gel electrophoresis was 1 pg. Fang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>) developed for predicting viruses accurately by a multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal amplification chip. Multiplex gene assay is a valuable molecular tool not only in academic science but also in clinical diagnostics. An octopus-like multiplex microfluidic loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mμ LAMP) assay was proved a robust approach for predicting viruses for the rapid analysis of multiple genes in the point-of-care format. It has ability of analyzing multiple genes qualitatively and quantitatively as it is highly specific, operationally simple, and cost-/time-effective with the detection limit of less than 10 copies/μl in 2 μl quantities of sample within 0.5 h. A multiplex microfluidic LAMP chip for differentiating three human influenza A substrains and identifying eight important swine viruses had been successfully developed.
