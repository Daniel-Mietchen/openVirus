In total, 72 out of 184 cloacal swab samples from poultry were identified as positive by LAMP, whereas 45 out of 184 were identified as positive by conventional PCR test. Liu (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR100">2011</xref>) reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification for the rapid detection of infectious bronchitis virus. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a major cause of disease in domestic fowl and causes an acute, highly contagious disease of the respiratory tracts and sometimes urogential tracts (King and Cavanagh 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">1991</xref>). The result indicated detection limit of IBV RT-LAMP was 10 copies/tube. In addition, the reaction time of RT-LAMP method is 45 min, which is more rapid than conventional RT-PCR, and the reaction only needs a laboratory water bath. Kiatpathomchai et al. (

 <italic>P. vannamei</italic> (collected from shrimp farms) by LAMP assay, and the sensitivity of RT-LAMP appears to be ten times more than RT-PCR. Wang et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR172">2011</xref>) detected infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) in one simple step by reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) and further identified the very virulent strain from non-vvIBDVs with a simply post-amplification restriction enzyme analysis. A set of two inner, two outer, and two loop primers were designed on the basis of sequence analysis to target the VP5 gene and showed great specificity with no cross-reaction to the other common avian pathogens. Detection limit was determined by both color change inspection and agarose gel electrophoresis was 28 copies viral RNA, which was almost as sensitive as a real-time RT-PCR previously developed.
