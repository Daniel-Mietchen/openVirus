<p>Duck virus enteritis is a serious disease among farmed and free-living ducks (Anatidae) and a constant threat to the commercial duck industry in China. Ji et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">2009</xref>) developed LAMP method by using set of four specific primers designed to recognize six distinct genomic sequences of UL6 protein from duck plague virus (DPV). The optimum reaction temperature and time were verified to be 61.5 °C and 60 min, respectively. Marek’s disease viral genome in chicken feathers can be easily detected by LAMP with detection limit of ten copies of the MEQ gene in the MD viral genome along with ten times higher sensitivity than the traditional PCR methods (Angamuthu et al.
