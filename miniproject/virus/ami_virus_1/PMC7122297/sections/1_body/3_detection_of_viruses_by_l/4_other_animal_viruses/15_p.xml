<p>Newcastle disease is a highly contagious viral infection of poultry caused by a paramyxovirus called avian paramyxovirus type 1 (APMV-1), one of the nine serotypes of the virus identified (Alexander and Manvell 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1997</xref>). Pham et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR135">2005</xref>) developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification for rapid detection of Newcastle disease virus. The detection limit of both methods, i.e., PCR as well as LAMP, was 0.5 pg or 9 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> copies/reaction determined by using a serial ten-fold dilution of the plasmids.
