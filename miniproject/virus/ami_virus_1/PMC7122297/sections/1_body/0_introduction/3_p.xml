<p>To overcome all above limitations in viral diagnosis, a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method was developed as an alternative method for viral detection. LAMP is a powerful and novel nucleic acid amplification method that amplifies a few copies of target DNA with high specificity, efficiency, and rapidity under isothermal conditions, using a set of four specially designed primers and a DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity (Notomi et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>; Tomita et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR165">2008</xref>). When detecting the RNA genome of a pathogen such as an RNA virus, LAMP has been merged with reverse transcription (RT) into RT-LAMP to allow nucleic acid amplification (Soliman et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR159">2009</xref>). This technique requires only simple and cost-effective equipment amenable to use in clinical laboratories (Enomoto et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2005</xref>). Compared to PCR and real-time PCR, the LAMP has the advantages of reaction simplicity and detection sensitivity. It has been claimed that the LAMP method can detect as few as 100 copies of DNA template in blood samples, equal roughly to 5 parasites/Î¼l (Han et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2007</xref>). This sensitivity is notably higher than any known immunochromatography-based RDTs, which are recommended by WHO as part of the global malaria control strategy (Long
