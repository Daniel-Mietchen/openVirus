<p>Several methods such as viral antigen, genomic sequences, and/or antibodies are used for the detection of viral infection. Viral isolation and serological assays are standard methods of viral diagnosis. Both viral isolation and serological testing require substantial time to obtain accurate final results. On the other hand, use of histological and biochemical methods for virus detection may sometimes fail to detect the virus antigen during the early stages of infection. Among various conventional methods, viral culture and antigenic detection (immunological detection) methods of viral detection are often costly, time-consuming, and less sensitive. Parida (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR126">2008</xref>) suggested that nucleic acid amplification is one of the most valuable tools in virtually all life science fields, including application-oriented fields such as clinical medicine in which diagnosis of infectious diseases, genetic disorders, and genetic traits is based on this novel method. Several amplification methods, namely, nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), self-sustained sequence replication (3SR), strand displacement amplification (SDA), as well as polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been invented in past days (Chan and Fox

PCR is one of the conventional methods which are affordable, but it has some intrinsic limitations such as the requirement of rapid thermal cycling, insufficient specificity, and low-amplification efficiency (Mori et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR109">2001</xref>). Nested PCR and multiplex PCR have been developed to address the need for rapid identification of viruses to serotype level with more accuracy (Ratcliff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2007</xref>). Another novel technique, i.e., real-time PCR, is developed which in turn brought true quantization of target nucleic acids out of the pure research laboratory and into the diagnostic laboratory (Espy et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2006</xref>). Mackay et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR105">2002</xref>) reported quantitative PCR (QPCR) assays as most established assay for the detection of viral load and therapy monitoring. Nucleic acid-based assays or real-time quantitative assay might eventually replace virus isolation and conventional RT-PCR as the new gold standard for the rapid diagnosis of virus infection in the acute-phase samples (Ratcliff et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR140">2007</xref>). Besides, all these nucleic acid amplification methods have several intrinsic disadvantages of requiring either a high-precision instrument for amplification or a complicated method for detection of amplified products. The high cost of instruments required for performing the real-time assays restricted its use to laboratories with good financial resources (Parida et al.
