<p id="Par29">There is an even more interesting, and insidious twist to this story. Bacteria have special little bits of DNA called plasmids. Since bacteria are not sexual organisms, they cannot exchange genetic material through sex like we, other animals, and many plants do. Instead, they trade these little plasmids. They can trade this genetic material within or among species. Thus, antibiotic resistance can move among different species of bacteria.</p>
