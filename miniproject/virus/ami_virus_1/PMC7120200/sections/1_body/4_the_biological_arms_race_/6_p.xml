<p id="Par19">The ideas of humans evolving resistance to diseases, and of diseases becoming more effective at infecting people, lead to some of the major points in Jared Diamondâ€™s book 
 <italic>Guns, Germs, and Steel</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. He suggests that successful invading cultures are those that have evolved to be resistant to a larger array of diseases and as they evolve this resistance, the diseases become more virulent (infective) in order to spread. This evolution can lead to a situation where people are no longer killed by a disease, and some of them become disease carriers. Such a group of people will bring these diseases with them upon colonizing a new area. The disease that is not lethal to the colonists could be quite lethal to the colonized people that have no evolutionary experience with it.
