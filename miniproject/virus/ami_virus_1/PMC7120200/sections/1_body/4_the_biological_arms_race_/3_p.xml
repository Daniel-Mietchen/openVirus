<p id="Par16">In the case of human diseases, this arms race leads to a situation where humans are constantly adapting to their diseases, and the diseases are constantly evolving to take advantage of their hosts more effectively. To make things more complex, a disease that can jump from host to host, such as the flu that can move from pigs to humans, can escape the evolved defenses of one host by moving into another. We will consider this more completely when considering diseases arising from other animals. Sometimes these crossover diseases are too successful; in this case, the disease can completely kill off its new host leading to extinction of the disease itself. It is certainly a worst-case scenario that such a disease would arise in humans.</p>
