<p id="Par15">The Red Queen Hypothesis describes this arms race. The Red Queen from Lewis Carrolâ€™s 
 <italic>Alice in Wonderland</italic> needs to run as fast as she can just to stay in place. This hypothesis suggests that organisms need to evolve as fast as they can to keep up with the organisms with which they interact because they are evolving as well. This is a case of feedback, as both members of the interaction need to keep evolving to survive.
