<p id="Par26">It was not until the discovery of antibiotics and vaccinations that humans really started to free themselves of some of the worst diseases in history, at least temporarily. People started looking for chemical agents to destroy bacteria once science confirmed that they caused diseases. Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin in 1928, and in 1942, Howard Florey and Ernst Chain developed the drug penicillin in an easily produced and administered form. Yet, humans still did not win the evolutionary battle between bacterial disease and humankind. When Fleming gave his Nobel acceptance speech in 1945, he noted that bacteria could develop that were resistant to penicillin if exposed to less than lethal concentrations. Within 2 years of the advent of clinical use of penicillin, clinicians had noted antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections in human patients.</p>
