<p id="Par27">Antibiotic resistance is a classic case of evolution. A very low proportion of bacteria in a population have the ability to survive exposure to the antibiotic. There is a low level of mutation leading to very small differences in the DNA in each bacterium. By chance, one or a few have a mutation that allows them to escape death from the antibiotic. These bacteria reproduce and soon take over the entire population.</p>
