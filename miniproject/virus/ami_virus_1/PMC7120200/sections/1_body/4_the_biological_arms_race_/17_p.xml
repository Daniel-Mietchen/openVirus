<p id="Par30">A recent spread of antibiotic resistance illustrates the problem [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The antibiotic colistin represents a last-ditch compound used to treat infections that are resistant to multiple antibiotics. The gene mcr-1 started showing up in bacterial infections in hospitals around the world, and this gene makes bacterial infections resistant to colistin. The antibiotic colistin had seen limited use in humans because it has bad side effects. However, swine farmers use it. Researchers sequenced isolates of colistin-resistant bacteria from 31 countries, and the genetic data suggested the gene arose in a pig farm in China in 2006. It took less than 12 years for disease-causing bacteria containing the gene to move from livestock to humans globally.
