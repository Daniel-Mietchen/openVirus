<p id="Par32">Controlling the expansion of resistance to new and existing antibiotics requires an understanding of evolution. Taking a full course of antibiotics to be certain the drug completely clears the infection, only using antibiotics when they are necessary, and not allowing livestock producers to use antibiotics added to feed solely to increase growth rates of healthy animals are all necessary to decrease the probability that bacteria will become resistant to antibiotics. Cooperation not to overuse antibiotics, leading to antibiotic resistance, is necessary to control this threat. This cooperation needs to be worldwide given the propensity of diseases and antibiotic resistance to spread rapidly around the world. This is an evolutionary “arms” race, with bacteria rapidly evolving ways to resist antibiotics and humans developing new weapons against bacteria. We need science to win the “arms race” by coming up with novel antibiotics to stop diseases resistant to the current antibiotics. Otherwise, we end up back where humanity has been for most of its history, at the mercy of bacterial infection.</p>
