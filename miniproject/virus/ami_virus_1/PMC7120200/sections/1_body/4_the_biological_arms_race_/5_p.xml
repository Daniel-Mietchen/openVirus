<p id="Par18">The process of evolution is not “nice,” because the very basis of natural selection is that some organisms die and others that are better adapted survive. When a novel deadly disease arises, it may not kill all the people that it infects, but could kill most and only the lucky few who survive can reproduce and pass their offspring resistance to the disease. Likewise, if humans become very resistant to a disease either through evolution or by technology (e.g., an effective vaccine), it might die out.</p>
