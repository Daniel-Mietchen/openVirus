<p id="Par21">When Europeans encountered the indigenous peoples of the Americas, they gave them their diseases. These diseases probably moved across the American continents faster than the Europeans invaders did. The resulting wave of diseases could have killed even more people than the Black Death of Europe. We will never know exactly, because there are no written records and no accurate methods to estimate the exact causes of death of the pre-European human population in the Americas. However, archeologists have found evidence for a large crash in American Indian populations across both North and South America after first contact with Europeans; the estimates are 57% mortality. These estimates are based on genetic methods that can be used to indicate drastic population reductions (from all causes) in the past [
