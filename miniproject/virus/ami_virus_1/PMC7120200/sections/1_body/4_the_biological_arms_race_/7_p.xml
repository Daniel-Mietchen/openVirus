<p id="Par20">European colonization of the Americas is a prime example of this form of migration and conquering other groups of people. Agriculture and technology made possible the large populations and cities in Europe and Asia. People living in dense urban environments, and trade routes connecting those groups of people across vast areas, created the perfect breeding grounds for new diseases to develop. Living in close proximity to domestic animals further stimulated the emergence of new diseases. The huge land mass of these two connected continents (and a modest connection to Africa as well) meant that there were many locations for diseases to develop then spread across the continents. Exposure to repeated waves of diseases allowed Europeans to develop immunity to those diseases while still chronically harboring many of them.</p>
