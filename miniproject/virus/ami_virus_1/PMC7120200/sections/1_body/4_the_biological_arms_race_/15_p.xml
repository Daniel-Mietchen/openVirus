<p id="Par28">Bacteria are particularly well suited to rapid evolution because their populations are so huge and grow so quickly that the chance that one cell has a mutation that makes it resistant is high, even though the chance that each individual cell is resistant is extremely low. There are about 100,000,000,000,000 (a hundred trillion) bacteria associated with each human. This is about 1000 times as many as there are stars in our galaxy, or 100,000 times as many as all the people on Earth.</p>
