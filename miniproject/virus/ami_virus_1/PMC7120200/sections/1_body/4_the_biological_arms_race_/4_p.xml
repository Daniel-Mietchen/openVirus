<p id="Par17">Humans have an immune system that can protect against most invasive diseases, but once an invader evolves a mechanism to skirt the human immune system, it can infect people everywhere. Infections will occur as long as humans do not evolve a way to keep the disease from reproducing or find a way to avoid exposure to the disease. Evolution to evade human immune defense is why viruses that cause colds move though human populations so readily. The group of cold viruses has evolved a way to swap genetic information, continuously creating new viruses. There are around 100 strains of cold virus, and each person gets a cold roughly twice a year. Thus, it would take you 50 years to go through all the cold virusesâ€¦ and in that time new viruses could evolve.</p>
