<p id="Par14">Our bodies and our species are engaged in ongoing arms races against our diseases, just as all other species are in a biological arms race with their diseases. In the short-term, our immune systems learn to recognize and fight diseases. In the long-term, humans have evolved defenses against the diseases. For each defense humanity has evolved, the diseases have evolved ways to get around the defense.</p>
