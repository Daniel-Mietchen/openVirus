<p id="Par64">In June of 1993, members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult sprayed anthrax from the top of an eight-story building in the heart of Tokyo. Fortunately, the disease did not take hold. The strain they used was not very deadly, and they had problems with a sprayer so the dispersion of the disease was not as effective as they had hoped. This group had previously set up multiple laboratories and had experimented with the toxin for botulism, cholera, and Q fever (a dangerous bacterial disease carried by livestock). They also previously sponsored a trip to the Democratic Republic of Congo that was an attempt to bring back an isolate of Ebola. This apocalyptic cult eventually released the chemical weapon Sarin in the Tokyo subway killing 12 people and sickening thousands.</p>
