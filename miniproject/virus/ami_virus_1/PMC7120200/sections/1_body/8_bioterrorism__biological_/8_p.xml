<p id="Par66">We should consider motives in this discussion as well. A terrorist who wanted to kill many people but wanted to discriminate victims would not only need to create a disease but also vaccinate or protect all the people they did not want to die. While a few doses of a disease placed appropriately could quickly spread around the world, creating many doses of vaccine is a far more daunting and expensive task. Thus, it seems unlikely that any of the major terrorist groups would be able to create a disease and vaccinate large numbers of people before releasing the disease without being detected first. Such a task is not completely out of the question for a small country such as North Korea.</p>
