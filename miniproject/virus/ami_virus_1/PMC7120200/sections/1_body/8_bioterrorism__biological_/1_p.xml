<p id="Par59">In late 2011 and early 2012, two laboratories, one at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA, and the other at Erasmus MC in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, found out how to make avian flu (H5N1) transmissible in ferrets. This research ignited a firestorm of controversy because the deadly virus could also spread among humans much more easily. The researchers submitted the work for publication but journals held up the release of the papers because of fears that people with bad intent (bioterrorists or countries willing to employ biological warfare) could use the information to transform this and other viruses to more deadly forms. Ultimately, the journals published the work, as eventually the information would get out. This is the way science works, once the general concept for an important idea is out, somebody else is certain to replicate the experiment. Thus, information on how to create a deadly disease is ever more available.</p>
