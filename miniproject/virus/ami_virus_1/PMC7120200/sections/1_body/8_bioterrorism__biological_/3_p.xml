<p id="Par61">In 1979, the Sverdlovsk military facility accidentally released anthrax causing 100 human deaths. Soviet researchers probably isolated this highly virulent strain of anthrax from rodents in the Soviet city of Kirov. The facility had likely accidentally released the bacterium at least once previously. Anthrax is able to survive as dry spores, and Soviets were presumably producing it to arm biological weapons.</p>
