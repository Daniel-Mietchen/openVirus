<p id="Par60">Accidental release from existing research facilities is also a concern. The deadliest diseases known to humanity are stored and researched in containment facilities found around the world. Smallpox has killed people for at least 3000 years, and following vaccination, it was completely eradicated from human populations in the 1970s. A number of laboratories still keep cultures. In 1978, one person died from exposure to the virus in a British laboratory. After that, scientists transferred all cultures to two laboratories, one in Russia and one in the United States. Entire generations have reached adulthood with no exposure to the disease; if smallpox was ever released by accident or on purpose (a scientist with PhD-level training could potentially re-create it from the known genetic sequence), it could cause massive mortality.</p>
