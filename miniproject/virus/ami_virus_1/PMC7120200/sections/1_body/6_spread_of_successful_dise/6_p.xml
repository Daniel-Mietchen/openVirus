<p id="Par42">Bush meat refers to wild animals killed by people for protein. As people move into more remote areas, they hunt wildlife to satisfy their protein needs. There is a particularly high chance of disease transmission from animals to humans when people butcher wild animals and make contact with fresh blood and organs from these animals. Human populations are growing and moving into more wild areas, particularly in the tropics.</p>
