<p id="Par40">New diseases are more likely to arise when there is opportunity for them to take hold. Stressed or unhealthy people are more likely to contract and transmit diseases than healthy individuals. We now have a greater absolute number of disease-prone malnourished people on Earth than at any time in history. People who live in cities, particularly the poor, are under constant stress from crowded living conditions, unhealthy environments, and the pressure to survive. A greater proportion of people live in cities now than any time in history, and the total number of people living in cities is also greater.</p>
