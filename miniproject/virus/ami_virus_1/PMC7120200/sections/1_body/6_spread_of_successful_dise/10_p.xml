<p id="Par46">Organ transplants from other species into humans could also lead to transmission of novel diseases. The most common species considered for organ transplants into humans are apes and pigs. Both these groups of animals carry viruses that may be harmless to them but cause extreme disease in humans. Such transplants are very rare currently, but given that the majority of people on organ transplant lists are not able to obtain an organ before they die, it is likely such transplants will increase as research progresses on ways to accomplish such transplants successfully.</p>
