<p id="Par39">People move from city to city and around the globe more quickly and more frequently than ever. Many diseases have an incubation time of days to a week. Historically, long-distance travel across oceans took months. If somebody with a deadly disease boarded a boat, it could kill all the people on the boat, or they would be over the disease and no longer infective before they reached their destination. Thus, conditions are more conducive than ever for the spread of a new deadly disease around the world.</p>
