<p id="Par37">The study of epidemics is essential to understanding how diseases spread from one organism to another. Diseases can be passed from person to person, from animals to people, or from the environment to people. A firm set of general principles of the conditions under which harmful diseases will emerge, some of them already referred to here, are now widely agreed upon by epidemiologists. These general principles, in addition to a number of unique behaviors in humans, lead to the conclusion that the probability of global disease is increasing drastically.</p>
