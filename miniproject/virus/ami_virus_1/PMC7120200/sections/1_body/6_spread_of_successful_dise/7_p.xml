<p id="Par43">Most new human diseases come from wild animals. As people stress natural ecosystems, the probability for such transmission could increase because we displace other animals from their natural habitats causing them to move longer distances, and they are more susceptible to disease because of the stress induced by human pressure. There is also a demand for live exotic meat in some Asian countries in particular. In this case, merchants bring caged animals into dense markets in close contact with other animals and many people. These are perfect conditions for a novel disease to spread from infected animals to livestock and people.</p>
