<p id="Par44">More people in the world are now immune compromised than ever, offering another reservoir for diseases. Around 40 million people are HIV positive and may become immune compromised. In areas where medical care is available, these people are receiving quite a few antibiotics leading to increased antibiotic resistance evolving in bacterial diseases. In addition, recipients of transplanted organs are generally immune compromised because drugs given to them to avoid rejection of the transplants also halt immunity to disease.</p>
