<p id="Par41">Novel diseases arise when humans come in contact with animals that can transmit diseases to humans (zoonotic diseases) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. We already have dozens of diseases that come from animals. We grow ever more animals to feed people as increasing population and standard of living increases demand for meat. We grow these animals under crowded conditions. Oftentimes we breed the animals for maximum growth, and they are genetically similar, conditions that can lead to greater disease susceptibility. We raise many pigs and birds in huge numbers in close proximity. Most diseases that arise in birds are not transmissible to people. However, they are more transmissible to pigs. Once the bird diseases establish in pigs, they are more likely to evolve ways to be infectious to humans.
