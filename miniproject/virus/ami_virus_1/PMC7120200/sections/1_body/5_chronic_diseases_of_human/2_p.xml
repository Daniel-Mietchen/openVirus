<p id="Par34">Diarrhea causes 15% of global deaths in children under 5 years of age even though it is treatable with access to basic medical care and many cases are preventable with clean food and water. Pneumonia causes even more childhood deaths (18%). Essentially all of these deaths occur in developing countries. Vaccines against some bacteria that cause pneumonia can help, and access to antibiotics for bacterial cases can help cure the disease. Inoculations against measles and whooping cough (pertussis) can also help reduce mortality as these diseases can lead to pneumonia. Malnourished children are more susceptible as well as those are that are exposed to indoor air pollution (smoke from cooking fires) . Only about 1/5 of the children with bacterial pneumonia even have access to antibiotics. Solutions are obvious and not tremendously expensive. Still the solutions to these diseases require global cooperation and a concerted effort.</p>
