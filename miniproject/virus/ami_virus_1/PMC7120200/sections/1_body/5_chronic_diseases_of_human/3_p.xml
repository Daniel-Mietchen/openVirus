<p id="Par35">There is good news; child mortality rates continue to fall, and diseases are decreasing worldwide [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, in undeveloped countries, rates are still high and not declining rapidly enough. The following interventions could reduce childhood disease (in parentheses) by over 40%: (1) breastfeeding (diarrhea, pneumonia, neonatal sepsis), (2) insecticide-treated nets (malaria), (3) additional food for infants 6â€“12 months old (diarrhea, pneumonia, measles, malaria), (4) zinc supplements (diarrhea, pneumonia), (5) sanitary delivery (childbirth deaths), (6) Hib vaccine (pneumonia), and (7) clean water (diarrhea, pneumonia). Oral rehydration therapy, antibiotics, and antimalarial therapy could reduce deaths by another 31%. None of these steps seems that difficult.
