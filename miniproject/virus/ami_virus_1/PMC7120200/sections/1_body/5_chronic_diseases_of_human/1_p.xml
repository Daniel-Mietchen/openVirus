<p id="Par33">We live in a world where millions of people die each year from preventable diseases. These diseases often only cause temporary illness to people in developed countries. For example, in developed countries, we do not generally consider diarrhea a fatal disease, and we successfully treat most severe cases with hydration and chemical therapy. In bad cases, intravenous fluids can prevent dehydration. Likewise, many cases of pneumonia can be treated, particularly bacterial-caused cases that are treatable with antibiotics. However, pneumonia is the top cause of death, diarrhea the second, and malaria and problems with childbirth are the next two top killers of children when considered worldwide.</p>
