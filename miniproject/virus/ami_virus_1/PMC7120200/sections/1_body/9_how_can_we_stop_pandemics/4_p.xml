<p id="Par71">Several historic agreements are present to stop the use of biological and chemical warfare and terrorism. The 1925 Geneva Protocol, the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, the 1976 Environmental Modification Convention, and the 1993 Chemical Convention all strove to have all countries agree to not develop or use chemical or biological weapons [

The United Nations is developing other treaties. Measures might include careful accounting of the reagents that molecular biologists can use to produce diseases and barring companies from providing DNA or RNA synthesis for particular sequences known to be associated with disease organisms. Careful international monitoring of biological laboratories capable of handling pathogenic microbes is also necessary, as well as protecting the laboratories that hold the deadliest human diseases. All of these require modest cost, but a substantial degree of international cooperation . For example, if even one country allows synthesis of dangerous virus sequences and will sell those to individuals, control elsewhere is pointless.
