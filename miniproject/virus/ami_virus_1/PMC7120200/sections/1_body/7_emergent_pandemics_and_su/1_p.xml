<p id="Par48">One of the worst worldwide pandemics was the “Spanish” flu that started in 1918. It killed about 3% of the world population and infected about 1/6 of all people. The bubonic plague in the 1300s infected about 1/4 of the Earth’s human population and killed an estimated 13%. The “swine” flu (H1N1) started in 2009 and infected about 1/4 of humanity but killed less than a hundredth of 1% of our population. Scientists have traced the first widespread series of cases of HIV/AIDS to 1981, but the disease probably jumped into humans in the early 1900s. Since then, about 1% of people on Earth are living with HIV, and about 1.5 million people per year die because of AIDS. About 2% of the human population deaths each year is from AIDS-related causes worldwide. Waves of disease are a regular occurrence throughout human history and becoming more common.</p>
