<p id="Par50">Disease epidemics that do not kill a large proportion of the human population are common. In the 1700s there were 13 epidemics and in the 1800s 12, with 5 pandemic influenza epidemics in the 1900s. The data suggest that roughly every 10–20 years, there are epidemics with some mortality that infect a quarter to a third of the world’s population.</p>
