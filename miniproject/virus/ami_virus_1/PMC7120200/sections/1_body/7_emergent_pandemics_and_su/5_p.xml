<p id="Par52">We studied the consequences of the fungal disease killing all adult frogs leading to loss of all the tadpoles in Panamanian mountain streams. Scientists had already documented that the disease was moving through North America to South America through Central America. The disease kills frogs in high-elevation areas and moves through lower-elevation areas without killing most animals. We knew that the area we were working in was going in the direct path of the disease, so we set up a before-after experiment to understand the effects.</p>
