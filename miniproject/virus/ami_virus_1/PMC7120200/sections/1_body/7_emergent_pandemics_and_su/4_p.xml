<p id="Par51">You could argue that disease has not wiped out humans yet, so it will not in the future. Unfortunately, science has documented cases where diseases cause the extinction of an entire species. For example, people have inadvertently moved a fungal disease around the world that kills amphibians (frogs and salamanders). This disease is leading to numerous species extinctions globally. I have seen the effects of this disease first hand in Panama.</p>
