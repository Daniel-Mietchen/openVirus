<p id="Par53">On our first visit to the mountain stream, there were frogs everywhere. We needed to be careful not to step on them as we walked the trails. Each square yard of stream bottom had up to a hundred tadpoles. Twenty frog species used the streams for reproduction, and many of these species were entirely restricted to cooler areas with high altitude on this particular volcanic mountain. From sunset to sunrise, the jungle was a riot of frog choruses. There were fantastically colored adult frogs including the stunning black and white Panamanian Golden Frog, a species that has special meaning for Panamanians. We made our measurements on the stream, and enjoyed the frogs.</p>
