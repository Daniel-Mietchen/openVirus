<p id="Par54">Two years later the disease had swept through as it progressed through the country from Costa Rica. When we drove up to the stream for the “after disease infection” experiment, it was immediately clear that it was different. Hoping against hope, I went down to the stream, but there were no tadpoles and no adult frogs on the banks. It was very quiet and sad. The stream had dense growths of algae because no tadpoles were eating it and the absence of the tadpoles fundamentally changed the way the stream functioned. In the end, maybe 100 species will go extinct from this disease.</p>
