<p id="Par4">These two stories illustrate two huge problems related to disease. First, I discuss disease as a major ongoing cause of mortality in developing countries, particularly for children. Next, the potential for a pandemic disease that kills a large portion of the population is covered. As we shall see, a massive pandemic is becoming ever more probable based on predictions arising from simple scientific principles. I start the chapter with some basic biological information because this information is necessary to understand how diseases develop and how humanity might be able to control them. Once again, taking the bias out of confirmation with increased understanding of accurate scientific information improves clarity with respect to causes and solutions of problems.</p>
