<p id="Par5">Diseases have probably existed since soon after the first life evolved. All organisms known today have diseases. These infections harm bacteria, fungi, protozoa, plants, and animals. Many of our diseases have their own diseases. Disease is an inescapable feature of human life. Humans can contract communicable diseases from bacteria, fungi, helminthes, protozoa, viruses, and prions. A little biology, my favorite subject, is required to understand how they cause disease, how novel diseases can arise, and why some of them are so difficult to control.</p>
