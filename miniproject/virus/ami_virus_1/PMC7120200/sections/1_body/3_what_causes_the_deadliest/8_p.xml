<p id="Par12">A very small number of bacteria, relative to the total millions of species on Earth, can cause significant disease in humans. Of these, some do so incidentally and can live indefinitely in the environment without ever interacting with a human in any way. However, a few can only live in animals and can lead to debilitating if not fatal diseases. Intermediate between these two strategies are the bacteria that opportunistically cause disease in humans, but can live freely without an animal host.</p>
