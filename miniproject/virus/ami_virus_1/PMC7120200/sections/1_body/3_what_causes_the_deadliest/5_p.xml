<p id="Par9">Of the diseases caused by protozoa, malaria is one of the top diseases causing death and suffering in the world. Mosquitoes carry this disease, and it is common in tropical areas worldwide. As global warming increases temperatures, mosquitoes will move into formerly colder climates, spreading malaria to new areas. There are over 200 million cases and a half million deaths each year from malaria. This is one of the major scourges of humanity, and it is a difficult disease to prevent and cure. More research is essential to control this disease.</p>
