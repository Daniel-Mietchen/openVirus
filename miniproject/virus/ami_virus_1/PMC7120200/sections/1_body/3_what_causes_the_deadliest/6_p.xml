<p id="Par10">Prions are strange disease agents that arise from proteins that cause other proteins to change shape and become ineffective. The mad cow disease is probably the best known of these diseases. This prion-caused disease arose when meat producers in Europe fed animals neural material (brain and spinal tissues) from other cattle. Cannibalism is not natural for cattle, but the practice arose because it stimulated growth when animals consumed waste by-products from other slaughtered cattle. Some of the sick animals had a protein in their brains that was defective and could infect the brains of other cattle when ingested. If people unknowingly eat beef contaminated with some of this infected neural tissue, they also become infected. The defective protein causes human neural proteins to lose their function slowly over time. People have died from this and related prion diseases. However, this number is small relative to other diseases and I will not consider it further.</p>
