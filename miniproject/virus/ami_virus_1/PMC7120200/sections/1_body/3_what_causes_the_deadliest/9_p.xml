<p id="Par13">Viruses, like prions, are not individual life forms. They are more like information parasites that completely rely on their hosts for reproduction. Viruses take advantage of the fact that we use DNA as the blueprint containing the information we use to make all cellular components and RNA to translate that information from DNA into the structure and machinery of the cells (proteins). Viruses subvert the cellâ€™s reproductive machinery for their own nefarious purposes: the reproduction and dispersal of more viruses. All viruses, unlike bacteria, must take advantage of living cells with DNA to reproduce. Viral diseases include HIV, smallpox, polio, hepatitis, influenza, Ebola, and rabies. Viral diseases also infect and kill millions of people per year.</p>
