<p id="Par11">Some of the worst diseases of humankind are bacterial, including the Black Death ( plague), tuberculosis, cholera, salmonella, and coliform diseases. While antibiotics allow treatments for many of these diseases, they still infect and kill millions of people each year. Bacteria are very simple cells and can completely replicate themselves if provided the basic vitamins and compounds they require. The vast majority of bacteria are harmless to humans and even beneficial. For instance, if we did not have bacteria that decompose dead animals and plants, the Earth would rapidly fill with these and there would be no resources left for the living.</p>
