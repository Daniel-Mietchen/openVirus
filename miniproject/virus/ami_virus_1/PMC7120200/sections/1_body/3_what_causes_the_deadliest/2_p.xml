<p id="Par6">Helminthes are simple animals, little microscopic worms. These animals often lack digestive systems, as they take nutrition directly from their hosts. They have complex life cycles and can inhabit several hosts. Evolution has stripped these animals down to only the basics required for living off others. Schistosomiasis is the most common helminth disease, causing widespread suffering. Initial infection can cause fever, chills, and liver and spleen enlargement. Chronic infections can lead to liver or kidney failure, bladder cancer, heart failure, and other symptoms. This disease is difficult to treat and causes major suffering in the world; at any one time, over 200 million people are infected, mostly in Africa. This disease is a major cause of suffering, but we donâ€™t know enough to eradicate it. We have studied most tropical diseases far less than those influencing populations in wealthier temperate countries. Worldwide cooperation in study of all major diseases is required to decrease the amount of suffering related to helminth diseases.</p>
