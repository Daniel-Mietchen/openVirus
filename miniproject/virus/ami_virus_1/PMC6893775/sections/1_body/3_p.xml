<p>Looking into the future there is a realistic possibility that other morbilliviruses, besides RPV, may be eradicated. Kreidl et al. discussed methods for identifying susceptible sub-populations during measles vaccination campaigns [
 <xref rid="B10-viruses-11-01036" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], which may provide a useful tool in countries where vaccination rates are dropping due to misplaced fears about vaccine safety. The other hope for eradication is peste des petits ruminant virus (PPRV), with the OIE and FAO recently launching a global strategy for eradication. To that end, Eloiflin et al. identified a number of mutations within the PPRV live attenuated vaccine which may help to understand the molecular nature of attenuation [
