<p>Jo and colleagues investigated the origin of canine distemper virus (CDV) strains responsible for epidemics in seals, identifying a novel clade, with ancestral origins, as the causative strain [

This focus on morbillivirus infections in marine mammals was also addressed in two reviews by Kennedy et al., and Ohishi et al., who summarised the mechanistic evidence that is helping researchers to understand the genetic determinants of host range and pathogenesis [

 <xref rid="B3-viruses-11-01036" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. One of the key factors determining host-range is the capacity of various morbilliviruses to use cognate and non-cognate host SLAM proteins to enter cells. Indeed, Fukuhara et al. identified a number of important host restrictions at this virus-host interface [

 <xref rid="B5-viruses-11-01036" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In related work, Mu√±oz-Alia et al. compared antibody mediated neutralisation of MeV and CDV to identify factors constraining the evolution of new morbillivirus serotypes [
 <xref rid="B6-viruses-11-01036" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In recent years there has also been much focus on the identification of novel morbilliviruses, in related mammalian hosts. Sieg et al. reported the identification of a new genotype of the recently identified feline morbillivirus, greatly expanding our understanding of the diversity of this virus in nature [
