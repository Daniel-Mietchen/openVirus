<p>Morbilliviruses are important pathogens, to the point that they have shaped the history of human and animal health. Measles virus (MeV) is well recognised as one of the most significant killers in the history of human viral diseases, while viruses like rinderpest (RPV) have played a critical role in shaping veterinary care, vaccination and eradication strategies. Accordingly, these viruses have been the focus of intense research and various aspects of their virology are well understood and well characterised, for instance how MeV receptor usage determines the tropism and progression of disease. In this Special Issue we gathered a range of primary data and review articles to reflect the diversity of ongoing research on morbilliviruses.</p>
