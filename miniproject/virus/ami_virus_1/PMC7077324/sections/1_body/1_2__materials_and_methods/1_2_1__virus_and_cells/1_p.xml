<p>CHIKV M-30 (KF 590566.1) was isolated from the acute serum (4 days from illness) of a 6 year-old female child examined in our previous study who had dengue fever in Myanmar in [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00169" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These viruses were propagated in 
 <italic>Aedes albopticus</italic> mosquito cell line C6/36 and the culture fluids were used after a few passages. C6/36 cells were maintained in minimum essential medium supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum. The cells were grown at 28 Â°C. Stock viruses of the CHIKV M-30 and S-27 strains were prepared in C6/36 cells. All experiments using live CHIKV were performed in a biosafety level 3 laboratory at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, Nagasaki University, according to the standard BSL3 guidelines.
