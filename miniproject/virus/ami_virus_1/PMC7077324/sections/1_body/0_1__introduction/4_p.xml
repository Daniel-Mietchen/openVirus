<p>Interestingly, our preliminary experiments show that in human cell lines, the ECSA genotype M-30 strain (M-30), which was isolated from a clinical patient, replicated at a significantly higher rate than the African genotype strain S-27 (S-27) (unpublished data). From these observations, we suggest that comparisons of the pathogenic properties of the M-30 and S-27 infections may provide valuable clues to elucidate the specific pathogenicity of the ECSA genotype.</p>
