<p>In conclusion, our observations raise the concern that the pathogenesis of ECSA may be explained by a complex mechanism. Thus, we suggest that the elucidation of the precise mechanism of the pathogenesis of ECSA requires a multistep approach, including the identification of the host factors such as metabolic activity and IFN responses and the determination of viral factors based on the viral genome specific to M-30 using the infectious cDNA technique.</p>
