<p>The interferon response is the first line of defense against viral infections, suppressing the replication of viruses and their spread [
 <xref rid="B26-viruses-12-00169" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Similarly to other alphaviruses, CHIKV replication caused a dramatic shutoff of host gene expression, resulting in the suppression of innate immunity [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00169" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our results show that interferon responses played a critical role in preventing lethal infections of CHIKV because IFN responses of deficient A129 and AG129 mice exhibited lethal infections, but immunocompetent mice did not. Further, our results show that the M-30 infection was more resistant to the protective effects of type-II IFN responses than the S-27 infection because low titer infections of M-30, but not S-27, induced 100% lethality in A129 mice. Thus, we suggest that determining the specific viral gene product(s) of M-30 relating to type-II IFN responses would be useful in identifying the viral factors against type-II IFN responses in CHIKV infections in vivo. Further studies, such as in vitro analyses using some cultured cell lines, may provide further clues to interpreting the mechanism of different pathogenicities relating to the IFN responses observed in M-30 and S-27 infections in mice.
