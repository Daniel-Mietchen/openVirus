<p>These observations show that the M-30 and S-27 infections caused 100% fatality in A129 and AG129 mice, although clinical signs relating to weight change were different. Based on these results and the results relating to the A129 mice, it is suggested that type-II IFN responses exert potential protective effects against the fatal S-27 virus but not M-30 infections. In other words, the M-30 infection induces resistant responses to type-II IFN effects compared with the S-27 infection.</p>
