<p>Following low titer infections, fatalities of M-30- and S-27-infected mice were 100% and 26.7%, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>D). The average survival times of fatal mice were 4.0 ± 0.33 and 9.8 ± 4.2 days, respectively. Of note, the weights of M-30-infected mice were not reduced during disease progression, whereas fatal cases of S-27-infected mice exhibited higher weight loss, similarly to those with high titer infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). The surviving mice infected with the S-27 virus showed slight weight reductions and then recovered (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>E). Consequently, the individual weights of fatal mice when they died were significantly different (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.0032) between the M-30 and S-27 infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>F).
