<p>We first attempted to infect immunocompetent mice such as C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice with CHIKV. However, these mice did not exhibit any apparent clinical signs and none of them died. Therefore, we then attempted to infect type-I and/or type-II IFN function deficient mice which are sensitive to viral infections.</p>
