<p>A129 mice that lacked the functions of a type-I IFN receptor were infected with high titer (10
 <sup>5</sup> pfu) or low titer (10
 <sup>2</sup> pfu) of M-30 and S-27 and their clinical courses were observed (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>). Following infection with high titer infections of M-30 and S-27, all mice died (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>A). Their survival times were 4.2 ± 0.57 and 5.4 ± 0.98 days, respectively. The survival times of M-30-infected mice were approximately one day shorter than those of S-27-infected mice, although they were not statistically different. Interestingly, the weight of M-30-infected mice was not reduced by the time the mice died, whereas S-27-infected mice exhibited weight reductions (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>B). Consequently, individual weights when the mice died were significantly different (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) between M-30 and S-27 infections (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00169-f001">Figure 1</xref>C).
