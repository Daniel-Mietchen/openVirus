<p>The case fatality rate (CFR), is a measure of the ability of a pathogen or virus to infect or damage a host in infectious disease and is described as the proportion of deaths within a defined population of interest, i.e. the percentage of cases that result in death [
 <xref rid="b13-ophrp-11-74" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. CFRs confers the extent of disease severity and CFR is necessary for setting priorities for public health in targeted interventions to reduce the severity of risk [
 <xref rid="b14-ophrp-11-74" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Initial studies reported an estimation of 3% for the global CFR of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="b15-ophrp-11-74" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Estimating CFR from country-level data requires assessment of information about the delay between the report of the country-specific cases and death from COVID-19, as well as underestimating and under-reporting of death-related cases, which may not be known. Given the importance of CFR and recovery rate (RR), in this current study the CFR and RR of different countries during a COVID-19 ongoing pandemic was observed using up-to-date country-level data.
