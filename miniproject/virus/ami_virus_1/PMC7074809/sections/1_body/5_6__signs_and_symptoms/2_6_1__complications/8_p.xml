<p>Patients with SSPE have unusually high measles antibody titers in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid. The measles virus is thought to spread to the brain during the acute rash when other endothelial cells are also infected. A trans-synaptic transmission of the virus has also been hypothesized recently. Contrary to the measles virus infection of non-neuronal cells, however, in this district, there is no immediate cytopathic effect but of viral persistence. To this process, they can be responsible for the modifications of the viral proteins M-H-F. In fact, it has been described how in the presence of some antibodies to measles it is possible to modify the expression pattern of the virus genes. This could explain the reason for the higher incidence of SSPE in children infected under one year old when there are still circulating maternal antibodies [

Furthermore, host factors, such as defective cellular immunity and the consequent poor capacity of specific antibodies to limit the viral intracellular multiplication, are also postulated to play a role in the pathogenesis of SSPE [
