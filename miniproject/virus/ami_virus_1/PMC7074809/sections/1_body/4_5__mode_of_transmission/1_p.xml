<p>The contagiousness period is difficult to define, since the measles RNA can be detected for long periods, even months, in blood, urine, and nasopharyngeal mucosa after the onset of the rash, but the infectious period is maximum in the phase in which the virus replicates mainly in the upper respiratory tract (nasopharyngeal), rather than in the lower respiratory tract (tracheobronchial).

 <xref rid="B25-microorganisms-08-00276" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The high levels of viremia associated with the phase characterized by greater intense coughing coryza and therefore droplets favor the transmission of viruses [
 <xref rid="B1-microorganisms-08-00276" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. It has to be kept in mind that the contagiousness of measles is among the highest among viruses and MV can be maintained in human populations only through uninterrupted transmission chains since it does not cause known latent or persistent infectious states, nor is it detectable in animal reservoirs [
 <xref rid="B27-microorganisms-08-00276" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Measles is characterized both by seasonal epidemics (mainly in winter due to the presence of social risk factors, such as crowded enclosed places, schools opening, etc.), and by longer cycles, even more years, due to the increase in sensitive non-immunized guests during previous outbreaks [
 <xref rid="B9-microorganisms-08-00276" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. There are studies showing that another important factor impacting on the cyclicality and duration of the epidemics is the birth rate [
 <xref rid="B28-microorganisms-08-00276" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In recent years, cases of measles transmissibility have also been highlighted among vaccinated patients (even with two doses) following the sharp drop in vaccination coverage, although it must be said mainly in cases of immune system abnormalities [
