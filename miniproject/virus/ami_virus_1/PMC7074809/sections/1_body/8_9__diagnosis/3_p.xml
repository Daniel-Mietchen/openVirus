<p>Still remaining in the context of complications, the diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis is instead commonly made by the typical clinical picture. No test is pathognomonic: Cerebrospinal fluid examination usually reveals a lymphocytic pleocytosis and raised protein levels both greater than those typically found in multiple sclerosis. The cerebrospinal fluid oligoclonal band presence is less common in acute disseminated encephalomyelitis than in multiple sclerosis. Computed tomography images may be of little significance while the brain magnetic resonance imaging showing the presence, in the T2-weighted sequences, of multiple hyperintense areas that have characteristically indistinct margins and assume the contrast medium is useful for diagnosis (magnetic resonance imaging performed too early may be not very characteristic) [
