<p id="Par3">The patient was originally from Colombia, but he had moved to the USA for his undergraduate and graduate education. He had not been to South America for more than 2 years. His trip to Southeast Asia included 10 days in Thailand, 4 days in Cambodia, 6 days in Laos, and 1 day in Hong Kong. His American girlfriend accompanied him on the trip and did not develop similar symptoms. While on vacation, they rode elephants, hiked through a jungle, and slept on a beach. They also swam in a waterfall and encountered local monkeys, though he did not recall any bites or scratches from a monkey. He drank mostly bottled water, but he ate local sushi and drank fruit juices purchased from street vendors. He denied any local sexual contacts. He used insect repellent intermittently during his trip but suffered many mosquito bites. He felt well throughout the majority of the trip.</p>
