<p id="Par2">A 31-year-old man became sick on the last day of his 3-week-long trip to Southeast Asia with sudden onset of fever, arthralgia, and headache. He attributed his symptoms to exhaustion and boarded a plane back to the United States (USA), but the symptoms persisted. The following day he also had several loose, non-bloody stools which were self-limited. Three days after departing Hong Kong, he presented to his Student Health Center for evaluation. Prior to his trip, he had not visited a travel clinic or received malaria prophylaxis.</p>
