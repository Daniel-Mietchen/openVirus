<p id="Par6">An infectious diseases consultation service was requested by the Student Health Clinic provider. The differential diagnosis for a returning traveler from Southeast Asia with a febrile illness of a relatively short incubation (maximum 21 days) is summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">17.1</xref>. It includes mosquito-borne infections (malaria, dengue fever, Zika virus, chikungunya virus, and Japanese encephalitis), mite-borne scrub typhus (

Acute retroviral syndrome (human immunodeficiency virus [HIV]) and secondary syphilis would usually be in the differential diagnosis as they may cause similar symptoms, but these diagnoses were less likely in view of the patientâ€™s reported sexual history. More commonly encountered viral causes of fever and arthralgias, such as seasonal influenza, mononucleosis, and parvovirus, were also considered. Other rickettsial diseases (such as Flinders Island spotted fever in Southeast Asia) may present with similar symptoms, but a prominent diffuse rash would be expected. Tularemia and ehrlichiosis can also cause fever, arthralgia, and rash, but these diseases are not endemic in either Southeast Asia or Chicago.
