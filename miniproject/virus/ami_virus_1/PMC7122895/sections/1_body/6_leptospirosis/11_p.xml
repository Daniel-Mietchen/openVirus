<p id="Par18">Treatment of leptospirosis is primarily doxycycline 200 mg daily for 7 days [

 <italic>Leptospira</italic> isolates from several of the most commonly affected regions in the world identified no instances of doxycycline or tetracycline resistance, although higher MICs were noted with

 <italic>Leptospira</italic> is susceptible in vitro to most penicillins, macrolides, cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Severe leptospirosis often is treated with intravenous penicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin, but treatment may be complicated by the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, similar to that associated with other spirochete infections including syphilis and relapsing fever [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Studies of serologic biomarkers in leptospirosis patients have shown that cytokines such as TNFÎ±, IL-6, IL-8, and PTX3 may be positively correlated with mortality from the infection [

   <p id="Par19">Consider leptospirosis as a potential diagnosis in a returning traveler with fever, myalgia (calf, spinal, and abdominal muscles), arthralgia, conjunctival suffusions, and sometimes a rash, diarrhea, and/or jaundice, the CBC may show leukocytosis or a left shift, thrombocytopenia; hyperbilirubinemia without significant transaminitis is present in most patients.</p>

   <p id="Par20">Leptospirosis is a zoonotic pathogen that poses a significant health risk to native populations of and travelers to endemic regions and is contracted by exposure of mucous membranes or skin breaks indirectly to freshwater contaminated by animal urine or directly to infected animals (especially rodents, dogs, and cattle).</p>

   <p id="Par21">Severe jaundice and acute renal injury are poor prognostic indicators of outcome in severe leptospirosis (Weil disease), and bleeding may be prominent (skin, GI, and lungs).</p>

   <p id="Par22">Pulmonary hemorrhage and ARDS are seen in severe cases, sometimes without icterus.</p>

   <p id="Par23">MAT is the reference standard test for diagnosis of leptospirosis; testing capabilities for leptospirosis are limited in endemic regions.</p>

   <p id="Par24">Leptospirosis can be prevented in travelers by avoiding exposure to contaminated freshwater and taking doxycycline weekly when this is unavoidable (such as after flooding).</p>

   <p id="Par25">Empiric treatment of mild leptospirosis is a course of oral doxycycline.</p>
