<p id="Par16">Diagnosis of leptospirosis is complicated by the lack of a cost-effective and simple diagnostic test. Of existing diagnostic tests, the microcapsule agglutination test (MAT) is considered to be the gold standard. However, the test requires the maintenance of live 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic> cultures and technical expertise, and may take several days to result [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], which is often not practical in areas of the world most affected by leptospirosis. In addition, the MAT does not differentiate between past infection and active infection or between different serovars of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>. The lateral flow test and latex agglutination test are older immunoassays routinely used to detect 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>-specific antibodies, but they are less specific than the MAT [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. PCR-based tests have also been developed to help distinguish between different serovars of 
 <italic>Leptospira</italic>, but they are similarly infeasible in countries with limited resources.
