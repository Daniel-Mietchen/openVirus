 <p id="Par1">A 31-year-old man presented to the Student Health Center for evaluation 3 days after departing Hong Kong. On the last day of his 3-week-long trip to Southeast Asia, he developed sudden onset of fever, arthralgia, and headache. He initially attributed his symptoms to exhaustion, but the symptoms persisted. He also had several loose, non-bloody stools, a problem that resolved without intervention.</p>
