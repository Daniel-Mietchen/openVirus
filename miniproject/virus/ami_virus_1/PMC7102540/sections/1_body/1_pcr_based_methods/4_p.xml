<p id="p0045">Even so, massive efforts are invested to improve the real-time RT-PCR assay. Since the RT-PCR methods are prone to contamination and require time-consuming sample handling and post-PCR analysis, van Elden et al. [
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] described a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR that can easily be implemented in the routine diagnostic setting for the detection of HCoV. Moreover, to further improve the sensitivity, Yip et al. [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] designed a real-time quantitative RT-PCR assay for SARS-CoV with the use of 2 TaqMan probes, instead of 1 probe. This simple modification using dual TaqMan probes for quantification has wide applications in areas in which ultrasensitivity is critically required, with the SARS-CoV detection limit of 1 copy RNA per reaction.
