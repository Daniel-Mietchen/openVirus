<p id="p0050">In clinical detection, the lack of safe and stable external positive controls (EPC) could become a serious problem in the diagnosis of coronavirus and plenty of attention has been focused to address this problem. However, such problems could be well avoided in real-time RT-PCR assays where EPC is an important component. Yu et al. [
 <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] developed a real-time RT-PCR assay in which the armored RNA was used as EPC to detect the SARS-CoV, with a detection limit of 10 copies/μL. Meanwhile, the rapidly mutating nature of coronaviruses highlights the need for accurate detection of genetically diverse coronaviruses. Therefore, to improve the ability to detect coronavirus precisely and reduce the risk of eliciting false-negative results caused by genome sequence variations, researchers have established multiplex real-time RT-PCR methods with favorable sensitivity for multitarget detection of coronavirus. Hadjinicolaou et al. [
 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] developed a real-time RT-PCR assay using mismatch-tolerant molecular beacons to distinguish between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains. The assay incorporated four beacons, targeting four genes in addition to an internal positive control. It was validated using clinical samples, which exhibited target detection ability and specificity with detection limit of 5 copies per reaction.
