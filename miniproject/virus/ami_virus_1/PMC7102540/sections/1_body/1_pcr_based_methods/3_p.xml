<p id="p0040">Real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR) detection is currently favored for the detection of coronavirus because of its advantages as a specific, and simple quantitative assay. Moreover, real-time RT-PCR is more sensitive than the conventional RT-PCR assay, which helps much for the diagnosis in early infection [
