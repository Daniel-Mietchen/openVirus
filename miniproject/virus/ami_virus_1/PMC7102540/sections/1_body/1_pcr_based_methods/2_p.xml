<p id="p0035">PCR is an enzymatic method to produce numerous copies of a gene by separating the two strands of the DNA containing the gene segment, marking its location with a primer, and using a DNA polymerase to assemble a copy alongside each segment and continuously copy the copies. It is widely used to amplify minute quantities of biologic materials so as to provide adequate specimens for laboratory study. Owing to its large range of applications, high sensitivity and high sequence specificity, the PCR-based method has become a routine and reliable technique for detecting coronaviruses [

Afterwards, the PCR is performed and followed by the detection of PCR product through specific detection methods or instruments. Among these, gel visualization and sequencing after PCR are the conventional methods for the detection of coronaviruses [
