<p id="p0105">Currently, the diagnosis of COVID-19 mainly relies on the detection of the coronavirus RNA. It is of great importance to select appropriate detection methods. However, each of the methods described above has its own unique advantages and inevitable disadvantages. PCR is widely used for virus identification with high sensitivity and specificity, but its analysis requires various equipment and educated analysts, which is only possibly accomplished by a well-established laboratory. LAMP is an ultrasensitive nucleic acid amplification method that can often detect small numbers of DNA or RNA templates within roughly an hour, but the requirement for high temperatures still limits its applicability. As for the microarray, the high cost inevitably limits its further application in the detection of coronaviruses. Therefore, it is still necessary to develop more effective and practical methods to overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods in the future.</p>
