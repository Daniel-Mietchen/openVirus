<p id="p0110">To date, considerable efforts have been made to improve the detection of coronavirus and a variety of improved or new approaches have been developed. In practical applications, several methods are usually combined to avoid the drawbacks of using single method as much as possible. In short, with the rapid development of new technologies and methods, we believe that there will be more excellent and efficient detection methods developed in the future, which would provide scientists/clinicians with more choices. At the same time, only by balancing the advantages and disadvantages of various detection assays according to specific purposes can we obtain the most economical and optimal option.</p>
