<p id="p0080">Meanwhile, LAMP shows optimal performance at around 65 °C, which always limits its applications. Cai et al. [
 <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] developed a version of LAMP that used phosphorothioated primers (PS-LAMP) to enable more efficient hairpin formation and extension at the termini of growing concatamers, which therefore worked at much lower temperatures. The sensitivity and selectivity for amplicon detection with PS-LAMP at 40 °C were comparable with a regular LAMP reaction at 65 °C.
