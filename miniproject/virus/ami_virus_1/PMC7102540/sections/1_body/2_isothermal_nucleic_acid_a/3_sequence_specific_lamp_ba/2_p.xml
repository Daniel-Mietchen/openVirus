<p id="p0070">However, if the methods rely on nonspecific signal transduction schemes, such as the fluorescence dyes intercalation into any double-stranded DNA amplicons, or solution turbidity due to the release of pyrophosphates during polymerization, the possibility of unexpected signals derived from primer dimer or non-primer reactions cannot be excluded [
 <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. A sequence-specific and robust method for monitoring LAMP and other isothermal amplification reactions that can readily separate true signal from nonspecific noise would address this problem. Shirato et al. [
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] improved the RT-LAMP assay by using a quenching probe (QProbe) to monitor signal, which has the same performance as the standard real-time RT-PCR assay in the detection of MERS-CoV. Additionally, Huang et al. [
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] established a nucleic acid visualization technique that combines RT-LAMP and a vertical flow visualization strip (RT-LAMP-VF) to detect MERS-CoV. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, two loop primers (LF and LB) involved in isothermal amplification are labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) and biotin, respectively. After amplification, the amplicons labeled with biotin can bind to colloidal gold particles conjugated with streptavidin to form a complex which is subsequently captured by an anti-FITC antibody coated on the text line of the strip (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B), thus presenting a colored line that is visible to the naked eye. In this instance, MERS-CoV RNA can be detected with a detection limit of 10 copies/μL.
