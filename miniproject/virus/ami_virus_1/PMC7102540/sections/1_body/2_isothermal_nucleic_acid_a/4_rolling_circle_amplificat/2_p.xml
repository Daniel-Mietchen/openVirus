<p id="p0085">The rolling circle amplification (RCA) has attracted considerable attention in nucleic acid determination [

 <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In isothermal conditions, RCA is capable of a 10
 <sup>9</sup>-fold signal amplification of each circle within 90Â min. An efficient assay for the detection of SARS-CoV by RCA was set up in both liquid and solid phases [
 <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], and presented preliminary results on a small number of clinical respiratory specimens. The main advantage of RCA is that it can be performed under isothermal conditions with minimal reagents and avoid the generation of false-positive results, which is frequently encountered in PCR-based assays.
