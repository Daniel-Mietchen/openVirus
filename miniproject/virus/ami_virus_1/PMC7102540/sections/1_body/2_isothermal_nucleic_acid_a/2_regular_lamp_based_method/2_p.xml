<p id="p0055">The LAMP is a novel isothermal nucleic acid amplification method with high efficiency. It is commonly used for the amplification of DNAs and RNAs, which exhibits great sensitivity and high specificity as a result of its exponential amplification feature and 6 different target sequences identified by 4 different primers simultaneously, respectively [
