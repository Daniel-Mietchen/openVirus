<p id="p0065">Amplification can be detected as the precipitation of magnesium pyrophosphate or fluorescence dye. This enables the methods to be carried out in real time by monitoring the turbidity of the pyrophosphate or fluorescence, which has effectively overcome the limitations of the endpoint detection [

 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], which is capable of detecting as few as 3.4 copies of MERS-CoV RNA, and is highly specific, with no cross-reaction with other respiratory viruses. Thai et al. [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] developed a one-step single-tube accelerated real-time quantitative RT-LAMP assay monitored by real-time measurement of turbidity in a photometer for the early and rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV. In clinical samples, the assay was found to be 100-fold more sensitive than conventional RT-PCR with a detection limit of 0.01 plaque forming units (PFU).
