<p id="p0060">Gel electrophoresis is commonly used to analyze the amplified products for an endpoint detection. Poon et al. [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] reported a simple LAMP assay for SARS diagnosis and demonstrated the feasibility of using this technology for detection of SARS-CoV. The ORF1b region of SARS-CoV was chosen for SARS diagnosis and amplified by LAMP reaction in the presence of 6 primers, then the amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. The detection rates and the sensitivity for SARS-CoV in the LAMP assay are similar to those of conventional PCR-based methods. Pyrc et al. [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] successfully applied LAMP to the detection of HCoV-NL63 which was conducted by agarose gel electrophoresis with favorable sensitivity and specificity in cell cultures and clinical specimens. Notably, the detection limit was found to be 1 copy of RNA template per reaction.
