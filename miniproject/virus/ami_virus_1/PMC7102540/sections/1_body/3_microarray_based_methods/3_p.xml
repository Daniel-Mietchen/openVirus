<p id="p0095">Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] designed a 60mer oligonucleotide microarray according to the sequence of TOR2 and successfully applied it to the detection of SARS coronavirus in clinical samples. However, considering the rapid mutation of SARS-CoV, Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] developed a microarray to detect 24 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mutations among the spike (S) gene of SARS-CoV with 100% accuracy in sample detection. Since coronavirus may lead to a sudden outbreak, it is of great significance that diagnostic assays are able to detect a wide range of coronaviruses and are be deployable at or near the point of care (POC). Therefore, Luna et al. [
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] designed a nonfluorescent low-cost, low-density oligonucleotide array for detecting the whole coronavirus genus with a sensitivity equal to that of individual real-time RT-PCR, and Hardick et al. [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] evaluated a novel, portable, and near-POC diagnostic platform based on the microarray chip, the Mobile Analysis Platform (MAP), which has a good performance in identifying virus and acceptable detection limit.
