<p id="p0090">The microarray is a detection method with rapid and high throughput. For this method, the coronavirus RNA will first produce cDNA labeled with specific probes through reverse transcription. Then these labeled cDNAs will be loaded into each well and hybridize with solid-phase oligonucleotides fixed on the microarray, followed by a series of washing steps to remove free DNAs. Finally, the coronavirus RNA can be detected by the detection of specific probes. Due to its superiority, the microarray assay has been widely used in the detection of coronavirus [
