<p id="p0030">With the advance in molecular biology technology, nucleic acid detection methods have developed rapidly and become a revolutionary technology for virus detection. Especially, the method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is characterized by rapid detection, high sensitivity and specificity, which has been regarded as the "gold standard" for virus detection. Novel PCR-based methods also have been reported to enhance both the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. Besides, several molecular tests which employ non-PCR-based methods, such as isothermal nucleic acid amplification (loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and nucleic acid sequence-based amplification), were developed for the detection of coronavirus RNA. In this work, we reviewed various approaches currently available for detection of coronavirus. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers to develop rapid and accurate detection techniques.</p>
