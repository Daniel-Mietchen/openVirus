 <p>The recent pneumonia outbreak caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in China, poses a great threat to global public health. Therefore, rapid and accurate identification of pathogenic viruses plays a vital role in selecting appropriate treatments, saving peopleâ€™s lives and preventing epidemics. This review summarizes the currently available detection methods for coronavirus nucleic acid. It is anticipated that this will assist researchers and clinicians in developing better techniques for timely and effective detection of coronavirus infection.</p>
