When the Athenian navy was dispatched later against Sparta, it was also heavily affected by the disease: one-quarter of 4,000 soldiers died, including the commander Pericles and his two sons. The symptoms described by Thucydides involve high fever, facial erythema, pustular rash to ulcers on the skin (sometimes gangrenes), bleeding from gums, tongue and throat, conjunctivitis, cough, sneezing, runny nose, diarrhoea, severe vomiting, dehydration, sleeping distress; and some of those who survived lost their toes and fingers, vision or memory. According to the symptoms and some epidemiological features, as the most probable cause of this epidemic could be regarded epidemic louse-borne typhus, while plague is improbable; additional alternative hypotheses have included ergotism or smallpox; some authors also considered (but as much less probable causes) abdominal typhus, malaria, dengue, WN fever, Ebola haemorrhagic fever, CCHF, gastrointestinal anthrax or brucellosis. (In our opinion, a combination of epidemic typhus with ergotism is a feasible hypothesis). In any event, this outbreak contributed significantly to the decline of Athens.</p><p>224 BC, China: the first major epidemic of plague reported.</p><p>First century, SUSRUTA (a Brahmin priest in India) and COLUMELLA (an educated Roman farmer): the spread of fevers is caused by &#x0201c;biting flies&#x0201d;.</p><p>100, RUFUS from Ephesus: a description of bubonic plague in Libya, Egypt and Syria (here was plague known since third century BC).</p><p>541&#x02013;546: 1st plague pandemic (&#x0201c;Justinian&#x0201d;, Byzantine Caesar) started in Egypt, continued in Palestine, Syria, Constantinople, and engulfed the whole known world including Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, England), central Asia and China (an estimated 100 million persons succumbed out of about 142 million contracting the disease).</p><p>1321, Florencia: &#x0201c;<italic>Statuti sanitari</italic>&#x0201d;: rule of the city how to behave when there occurs an epidemic.</p><p>1346&#x02013;1352, 2nd plague pandemic (&#x0201c;The Black Death&#x0201d;) in Europe &#x02013; it started already in about 1330 in central Asia, where almost entire populations of Tatars and Saracens had succumbed. During the siege of the Genoan fortress of Caffa (today&#x02019;s Theodosia) in the Crimea, Tatars catapulted the cadavers of their soldiers that had succumbed to plague within (the first &#x0201c;biological warfare&#x0201d;); Genoan merchants escaped the fortress but spread the plague to Constantinople and Messina. The ensuing pandemic engulfed the whole Italy, Dalmatia, France, England and Norway in 1348; then Germany and Moravia in 1349; and Poland, Russia (for instance in Smolensk died all citizens except for five persons) in 1350&#x02013;1351. In Europe, one-quarter of inhabitants succumbed (about 25 million), and an estimated 25 million died in Asia [the pandemic probably considerably contributed to the fall of the Mongolian empire] and Africa earlier; 1361, 1371 and 1380&#x02013;1382 saw follow-up outbreaks in Europe.</p><p>1348, Venezia: &#x0201c;<italic>Magistrato della Sanit&#x000e0;</italic>&#x0201d;: probably first hygienic office for control of plague and other diseases.</p><p>Fifteenth century, a new epidemic of plague in Germany, France and Russia.</p><p>1490, Granada: during the siege of the town kept by Maurs, a total of 17,000 Spanish soldiers succumbed to epidemic louse-borne typhus.</p><p>1493&#x02013;1495, Haiti &#x02013;
