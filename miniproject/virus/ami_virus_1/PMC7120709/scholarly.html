In some historical data it is difficult to differentiate between the year of discovery and the year of its publication.</p> <p>Eighteenth century BC, Babylonian codex Eshuna: â€œmad dogsâ€� (most probably rabies).</p> <p>Fourth century BC, Talmud: notes on mad dogs in Israel.</p> <p>1320 BC, Bible: a description of a plague epidemic among the Philistines (enlarged lymphatic nodes, overpopulation of â€œmiceâ€� at the same time).</p> <p>556 BC, China: a description of rabies.</p> <p>435 BC, HIPPOKRATES: â€œ<i>Epidemion</i>â€� (the causes of diseases are in environment).</p> <p>429â€"426 BC, THUCYDIDES: the â€œplague of Athensâ€� killed about one-quarter (75,000â€"100,000) of the citizens of Athens during the siege by the Spartan army (the â€œPeloponnesian warsâ€�, 431â€"404 BC) while not affecting besieger, and for 3 additional years thereafter. When the Athenian navy was dispatched later against Sparta, it was also heavily affected by the disease: one-quarter of 4,000 soldiers died, including the commander Pericles and his two sons. The symptoms described by Thucydides involve high fever, facial erythema, pustular rash to ulcers on the skin (sometimes gangrenes), bleeding from gums, tongue and throat, conjunctivitis, cough, sneezing, runny nose, diarrhoea, severe vomiting, dehydration, sleeping distress; and some of those who survived lost their toes and fingers, vision or memory. According to the symptoms and some epidemiological features, as the most probable cause of this epidemic could be regarded epidemic louse-borne typhus, while plague is improbable; additional alternative hypotheses have included ergotism or smallpox; some authors also considered (but as much less probable causes) abdominal typhus, malaria, dengue, WN fever, Ebola haemorrhagic fever, CCHF, gastrointestinal anthrax or brucellosis. (In our opinion, a combination of epidemic typhus with ergotism is a feasible hypothesis). In any event, this outbreak contributed significantly to the decline of Athens.</p> <p>224 BC, China: the first major epidemic of plague reported.</p> <p>First century, SUSRUTA (a Brahmin priest in India) and COLUMELLA (an educated Roman farmer): the spread of fevers is caused by â€œbiting fliesâ€�.</p> <p>100, RUFUS from Ephesus: a description of bubonic plague in Libya, Egypt and Syria (here was plague known since third century BC).</p> <p>541â€"546: 1st plague pandemic (â€œJustinianâ€�, Byzantine Caesar) started in Egypt, continued in Palestine, Syria, Constantinople, and engulfed the whole known world including Europe (Italy, Spain, France, Germany, Denmark, England), central Asia and China (an estimated 100 million persons succumbed out of about 142 million contracting the disease).</p> <p>1321, Florencia: â€œ<i>Statuti sanitari</i>â€�: rule of the city how to behave when there occurs an epidemic.</p> <p>1346â€"1352, 2nd plague pandemic (â€œThe Black Deathâ€�) in Europe â€" it started already in about 1330 in central Asia, where almost entire populations of Tatars and Saracens had succumbed. During the siege of the Genoan fortress of Caffa (todayâ€™s Theodosia) in the Crimea, Tatars catapulted the cadavers of their soldiers that had succumbed to plague within (the first â€œbiological warfareâ€�); Genoan merchants escaped the fortress but spread the plague to Constantinople and Messina. The ensuing pandemic engulfed the whole Italy, Dalmatia, France, England and Norway in 1348; then Germany and Moravia in 1349; and Poland, Russia (for instance in Smolensk died all citizens except for five persons) in 1350â€"1351. In Europe, one-quarter of inhabitants succumbed (about 25 million), and an estimated 25 million died in Asia [the pandemic probably considerably contributed to the fall of the Mongolian empire] and Africa earlier; 1361, 1371 and 1380â€"1382 saw follow-up outbreaks in Europe.</p> <p>1348, Venezia: â€œ<i>Magistrato della SanitÃ </i>â€�: probably first hygienic office for control of plague and other diseases.</p> <p>Fifteenth century, a new epidemic of plague in Germany, France and Russia.</p> <p>1490, Granada: during the siege of the town kept by Maurs, a total of 17,000 Spanish soldiers succumbed to epidemic louse-borne typhus.</p> <p>1493â€"1495, Haiti â€" HispaÃ±ola: first description of yellow fever (dengue?).</p> <p>1528, Naples: 14,000 French besiegers succumbed to epidemic (louse-borne) typhus.</p> <p>1542, Hungary: 30,000 people died from epidemic typhus.</p> <p>1545, Mexico: an epidemic of haemorrhagic fever â€œcocolitztliâ€� (aetiology has remained unexplained).</p> <p>1546, FRACASTORO: â€œ<i>De contagione et contagiosis morbis et eorum curatione</i>â€� â€" first theory of infectious diseases caused by germs (â€œ<i>seminaria morbi</i>â€�); he described three modes of infection (<i>contagiosis morbis</i>) â€" <i>per contactum; per fomites</i> (indirectly â€" via clothes, bedding, things); <i>ad distans</i> (via air).</p> <p>1554, AGRICOLA: a treatise on plague (â€œ<i>De peste libri III</i>â€�).</p> <p>1575â€"1577, an epidemic of plague in Italy (Milan and Venezia 70,000 victims, etc.).</p> <p>1585, Milan: a pact between Milan and Swiss cities for control of plague (commerce etc.).</p> <p>1606â€"1620, big outbreaks of plague in Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy.</p> <p>1647â€"1648, an extensive epidemic of yellow fever in the Caribbean â€" Little Antilles (Barbados â†’ St. Cristof â†’ Guadeloupe), Yucatan and Cuba (e.g., in Havana one-third of citizens died); the disease was imported from West Africa during the slave trade (viraemic slaves and infected <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquitoes on ships).</p> <p>1648â€"1649, Prague: a major epidemic of plague in the city besieged by Swedish soldiers at the end of the Thirty-Yearâ€™s War.</p> <p>1653â€"1654, plague in southern, western and northern (Sweden) Europe with a great number of victims (e.g., London 60,000; Genova 50,000; Amsterdam 50,000).</p> <p>1675â€"1684, another extensive epidemic of plague in Europe (central) spreading from Poland to Moravia, Bohemia (13,000 victims in Prague alone), Austria, Germany etc.: schools and churches were closed and public religious services forbidden; <i>magistri sanitatis</i> (directors of health) and plague regulations (including obligatory notification of sick and dead persons) were installed in many towns; preventive measures were fixed for physicians, priestsâˆ’confessors, and friars attending patients and dying persons; quarantine was imposed on foci of infection.</p> <p>1709, plague in Poland, Hungary and Russia.</p> <p>1713â€"1715, plague in Vienna (Austria), spread to Prague (Bohemia) by an infected tailor, and later to Moravia (Olomouc);
