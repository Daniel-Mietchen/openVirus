<p>1346–1352, 2nd plague pandemic (“The Black Death”) in Europe – it started already in about 1330 in central Asia, where almost entire populations of Tatars and Saracens had succumbed. During the siege of the Genoan fortress of Caffa (today’s Theodosia) in the Crimea, Tatars catapulted the cadavers of their soldiers that had succumbed to plague within (the first “biological warfare”); Genoan merchants escaped the fortress but spread the plague to Constantinople and Messina. The ensuing pandemic engulfed the whole Italy, Dalmatia, France, England and Norway in 1348; then Germany and Moravia in 1349; and Poland, Russia (for instance in Smolensk died all citizens except for five persons) in 1350–1351. In Europe, one-quarter of inhabitants succumbed (about 25 million), and an estimated 25 million died in Asia [the pandemic probably considerably contributed to the fall of the Mongolian empire] and Africa earlier; 1361, 1371 and 1380–1382 saw follow-up outbreaks in Europe.</p>
