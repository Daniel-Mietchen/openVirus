<p>1904–1905, DUTTON and TODD (Kenya), KOCH (east Africa), ROSS and MILNE (Uganda) elucidated the aetiology of African recurrent fever (spirochete 
 <italic>Borrelia duttoni</italic>) and proved experimentally its vector (
 <italic>Ornithodoros moubata</italic>, including TOT) and susceptibility of monkeys to this disease (Dutton and Todd infected themselves at autopsy of the monkeys, and Dutton died due to the infection); this disease had already been known to Livingstone (as “human tick disease”) in 1857.
