<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) developed a list of diseases and pathogens to be prioritized for research and development under the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint for emerging infections. Diseases were prioritized on the basis that they pose a public health risk due to their epidemic potential and that they have no, or insufficient, countermeasures against them [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. The WHO furthermore conducts an annual review of the Blueprint priority list [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa, MERS-CoV, Nipah, and Rift Valley fever (RVF) viruses were among the viruses listed in 2018 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. That same year alone, six of the 10 priority pathogens listed in the WHO R&amp;D Blueprint caused outbreaks [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. “Disease X” is also listed: It represents the fact that a serious international epidemic could be caused by a pathogen currently unknown to cause human disease, toward which it is important to enable cross-cutting R&amp;D preparedness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].
