<p>Vaccines are a powerful tool with substantial potential to prevent and control outbreaks of EIDs. However, a key issue is to be able to manufacture and test a safe and efficacious vaccine for the immediate threat within a very short time frame. Prior to CEPI’s establishment, vaccine development efforts for EIDs were fragmented, with no sustainable mechanism to support successful projects across the vaccine development life cycle nor to coordinate work toward the highest-priority global epidemic risks. CEPI was created to fill these gaps and to stimulate, finance, and coordinate the development of vaccines against EIDs, especially in cases where market incentives alone were failing to drive needed development.</p>
