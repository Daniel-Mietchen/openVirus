<p>From its creation, CEPI developed a business plan to advance vaccine candidates to the PoC stage (by supporting phase I and II clinical trials) to enable clinical efficacy testing (phase III) during outbreaks. It is also CEPI’s intent to contribute to technical and institutional platforms that can accelerate the R&amp;D response to EIDs. CEPI will continue to coordinate closely with the WHO and to work together with the international community to advance vaccine candidates against EIDs with epidemic potential, to establish and maintain investigational stockpiles of promising candidates, and to implement scientifically robust trials of these candidates during outbreaks.</p>
