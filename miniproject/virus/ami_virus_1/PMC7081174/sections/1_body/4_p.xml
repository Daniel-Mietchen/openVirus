<p>Vital signs—temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure—help us assess a patient's health status, triage the patient to appropriate care, determine potential diagnoses, and predict recovery. Given the increasing frequency of emerging infectious diseases that are geographically linked, is it time to add a “fifth vital sign”? A simple, targeted travel history can help us put symptoms of infection in context and trigger us to take a more detailed history, do appropriate testing, and rapidly implement protective measures. An expanded set of vital signs may signal a lurking communicable infection and flag potential risks to health care personnel and other patients. Furthermore, electronic health records can integrate travel history with computerized decision support to suggest specific diagnoses in febrile returning travelers (
