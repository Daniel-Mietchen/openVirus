<p>In the first 6 weeks of the current epidemic, the number of cases of COVID-19 has surpassed those of SARS and MERS during the course of those epidemics, raising questions about strategies to control the spread of infection. A major strategy has focused on “macro” public health responses, such as travel restrictions, public gathering and school closures, and city quarantines. However, experience with other respiratory viruses suggests that travel restrictions have a limited effect. Mateus and colleagues (
 <xref rid="r1-0643" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>) found that such restrictions decreased new cases of influenza by only 3% and delayed but did not prevent influenza epidemics. Similarly, Errett and colleagues (
 <xref rid="r2-0643" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) identified minimal evidence to support the effectiveness of travel bans as a control measure for emerging infectious diseases. Read and colleagues (
 <xref rid="r3-0643" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>) suggest that, because only 5% of infections have been identified, even a travel reduction that is 99% effective may reduce the epidemic outside Wuhan province by no more than 24.9%. Other investigators (
 <xref rid="r4-0643" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>) estimate that almost 59 000 cases occurred in Wuhan and 3500 in other regions of China before the travel ban was implemented. Hence, the ban may simply reduce the progression of the outbreak by only 3 to 5 days within China. Finally, a recent report (
 <xref rid="r5-0643" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>) suggests that 46% of cases would be missed by airport-based screening because of COVID-19's incubation period, the spectrum of symptoms, and the time during the incubation period in which persons may fly. Available data specific to COVID-19 suggest that screening and restricting travelers may have a limited effect on containment.
