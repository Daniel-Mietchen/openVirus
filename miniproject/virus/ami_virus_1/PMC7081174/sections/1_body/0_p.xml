<p>The international community has witnessed the emergence of novel coronavirusâ€“associated respiratory diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 to 2003 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 to 2013. In 2014, Ebola emerged in western Africa, where it had not previously been seen. Now, 18 years after SARS, we are in the midst of an epidemic known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the novel SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). With these infections come significant morbidity and mortality, tremendous health care disruptions and resource use, and collateral economic and societal costs.</p>
