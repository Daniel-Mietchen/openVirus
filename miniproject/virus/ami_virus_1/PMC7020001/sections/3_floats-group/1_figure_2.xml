  <p>Model of axonal transport and neuron-to-neuron or neuron-to-non-neuronal cells propagation. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Murine primary mixed neuronal cultures (PMNC) grown in Xonachip microfluidic compartmentalized chambers. These devices allow fluidic isolation of axons by establishing a volume difference between cell bodies (1) and axonal end (3) compartments and the high fluidic resistance of the microchannels (2) (where the axons grow) produces a sustained flow that counteracts diffusion. The blue dotted lines are there to separate the three different parts of the microfluidic device. This situation blocks the migration of free virus through the microchannels and makes it possible to use this system in viral infection studies in neuronal cultures. PMNC were infected in the cell body portion (1) and viral S glycoprotein (yellow/green) and neuronal marker (MAP2 protein; red) detection was performed on fixed cells at 24 hpi. Data are indicative of viral antigens and/or viral particles going from cell body (1) through the axon in the microchannel (2) and then towards the axonal end portion (3). (
   <bold>B</bold>) Electron microscopy images of infected PMNC grown on Aclar-33C embedding film (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and infected at an MOI of 0.03 for 48 h at 37 °C. Sliced embedded samples (EPON RESIN 828; Polysciences Inc., Warrington, PA, USA) observed with a Hitachi H 7100 electron microscope show viral particles (white arrows) in both cell bodies and axons at 48 hpi. 
   <bold>Upper panel</bold> is a complete neuron (magnification 5000×), 
   <bold>left lower panel</bold> is a representative neuronal cell body (magnification 10,000×) and 
   <bold>lower right panel</bold> is a representative axonal portion (magnification 20,000×). Pictures were taken with an AMTXR-111 camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Woburn, MA, USA). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Model of HCoV-OC43 propagation (neuron-to-neuron or neuron-to-non-neuronal cells) based on our data [
   <xref rid="B269-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>] and adapted from Tomishima and Enquist [
   <xref rid="B291-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>]. In this model, solid arrows represent fully assembled virus transport and dashed arrows represent subvirion assemblies [
