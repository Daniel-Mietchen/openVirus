  <p>Non-invasive imaging of viral neuroinvasion and dissemination within the CNS in living infected mice and associated clinical scores. A recombinant HCoV-OC43 harboring a luciferase reporter gene [
   <xref rid="B292-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">292</xref>] was injected intra-nasally (I.N.) into mice. Virus spread was assessed by bioluminescence imaging (BLI) with the Xenogen VIVO Vision IVIS 100 imaging system (Perkin-Elmer) in infected anaesthetized mice placed in a light proof specimen chamber after intraperitoneal injection of 
   <sc>d</sc>-luciferin. Images were taken with a CCD camera mounted in a light-tight imaging chamber, using the acquisition software Living Image version 4.3.1 (Caliper-LifeSciences). Evaluation of associated clinical scores: (levels 0 to 4: 0 is asymptomatic; 1 is mice with early hunched back; 2 is mice presenting slight social isolation, weight loss and abnormal gait; 3 is mice presenting total social isolation, ruffled fur, hunched back, weight loss and almost no movement; and 4 is mice moribund or dead (presented elsewhere; [
   <xref rid="B266-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]), indicate that only mice with a positive signal at both the level of the brain and spinal cord were evaluated to be at level 2 to 3.
