  <p>Illustration of the principal route of infection used by HCoV-OC43 for neuroinvasion in the central nervous system (CNS). (
   <bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of intranasal injection of HCoV-OC43 in susceptible mice. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Histological examination of decalcified whole head allows to visualize virus spread in the CNS at 3 dpi. 
   <bold>Left top panel</bold> represents the nasal cavity and 
   <bold>right top panel</bold> represents a higher magnification of infected olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) in the neuroepithelium. 
   <bold>Bottom panel</bold> represents viral dissemination in several regions of the brain from the olfactory bulb to the brainstem. The inset on the right represents a zoomed image of the area delimited by the red frame in left panel. The red arrow indicates the enlarged region in the red frame. In all regions of the brain, neurons are the main target of infection. Detection of viral S glycoprotein (green) and cell nucleus (DAPI; blue). Magnification is 20× and 63× for 
   <bold>upper panels</bold> and 4× for the 
   <bold>bottom panel</bold>. (
   <bold>C</bold>) Corresponding schematic representation of intranasal infection in humans. HCoV may infect the ORN, pass through the neuroepithelium and gain access to the olfactory bulb (OB) and eventually to other regions of the brain. The blue arrows indicate the direction of viral spreading. Schematic representations were assembled using the Motifolio Neuroscience Toolkit 2007.
