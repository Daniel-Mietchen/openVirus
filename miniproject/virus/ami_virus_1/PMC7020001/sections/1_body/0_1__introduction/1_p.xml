<p>The central nervous system (CNS), a marvel of intricate cellular and molecular interactions, maintains life and orchestrates homeostasis. Unfortunately, the CNS is not immune to alterations that lead to neurological disease, some resulting from acute, persistent or latent viral infections. Several viruses have the ability to invade the CNS, where they can infect resident cells, including the neurons [

 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, their incidence in clinical practice is difficult to evaluate precisely [
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. For instance, in cases of viral encephalitis involving the most prevalent viruses known to reach the CNS (mainly herpesviruses, arboviruses and enteroviruses), an actual viral presence can only be detected in 3 to 30 cases out of 100,000 persons. Considering all types of viral infections, between 6000 and 20,000 cases of encephalitis that require hospitalization occur every year in the United States, representing about 6 cases per 100,000 infected persons every year. As the estimated charge for each case lies between $58,000 and $89,600, an evaluation of the total annual health cost is of half a billion dollars [
