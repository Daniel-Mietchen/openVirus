<p>Very common worldwide, viral infections of the respiratory tract represent a major problem for human and animal health, imposing a tremendous economic burden. These respiratory infections induce the most common illnesses [
 <xref rid="B7-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide, causing critical problems in public health, especially in children, the elderly and immune-compromised individuals [

 <xref rid="B12-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Viruses represent the most prevalent pathogens present in the respiratory tract. Indeed, it is estimated that about 200 different viruses (including influenza viruses, coronaviruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, metapneumoviruses, such as human metapneumovirus A1, as well as orthopneumoviruses, such as the human respiratory syncytial virus) can infect the human airway. Infants and children [
 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as well as the elderly represent more vulnerable populations, in which viruses cause 95% and 40% of all respiratory diseases, respectively [
 <xref rid="B11-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Among the various respiratory viruses, some are constantly circulating every year in the human populations worldwide, where they can be associated with a plethora of symptoms, from common colds to more severe problems requiring hospitalization [

 <xref rid="B20-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, in addition to the many “regular” viruses that circulate and infect millions of people every year, new respiratory viral agents emerge from time to time, causing viral epidemics or pandemics associated with more serious symptoms [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], such as neurologic disorders. These peculiar events usually take place when RNA viruses like influenza A, human coronaviruses, such as MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, or henipaviruses, present in an animal reservoir, cross the species barrier as an opportunistic strategy to adapt to new environments and/or new hosts. These zoonoses may have disastrous consequences in humans [
