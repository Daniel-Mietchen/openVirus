<p>Another source of concern when considering human respiratory pathogens associated with potential neuroinvasion and neurovirulence is the 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> genus, which comprises hundreds of different serotypes, including polioviruses (PV), coxsackieviruses (CV), echoviruses, human rhinoviruses (HRV) and enteroviruses (EV). This genus constitutes one of the most common cause of respiratory infections (going from common cold to more severe illnesses) and some members (PV, EV-A71 and -D68, and to a lesser extent HRV) can invade and infect the CNS, with detrimental consequences [

Although EV infections are mostly asymptomatic, outbreaks of EV-A71 and D68 have also been reported in different parts of the world during the last decade. EV-A71 is an etiological agent of the hand–foot–mouth disease (HFMD) and has occasionally been associated with upper respiratory tract infections. EV-D68 causes different types of upper and lower respiratory tract infections, including severe respiratory syndromes [
