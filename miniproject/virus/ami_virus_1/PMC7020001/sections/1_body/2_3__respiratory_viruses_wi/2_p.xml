<p>An additional highly prevalent human respiratory pathogen with neuroinvasive and neurovirulent potential is the human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Discovered at the beginning of the 21st century in the Netherlands [
 <xref rid="B128-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>], it mainly causes respiratory diseases in newborns, infants and immunocompromised individuals [
 <xref rid="B129-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. During the last two decades, sporadic cases of febrile seizures, encephalitis and encephalopathies (associated with epileptic symptoms) have been described. Viral material was detected within the CNS in some clinical cases of encephalitis/encephalopathy [

 <xref rid="B131-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,

 <xref rid="B134-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>] but, at present, no experimental data from any animal model exist that would help to understand the underlying mechanism associated with hMPV neuroinvasion and potential neurovirulence.
