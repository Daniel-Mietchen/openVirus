<p>Last but not least, human coronaviruses (HCoV) are another group of respiratory viruses that can naturally reach the CNS in humans and could potentially be associated with neurological symptoms. These ubiquitous human pathogens are molecularly related in structure and mode of replication with neuroinvasive animal coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="B176-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>] like PHEV (porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus) [
 <xref rid="B177-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>], FCoV (feline coronavirus) [

 <xref rid="B179-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>] and the MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) strains of MuCoV [
 <xref rid="B180-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>], which can all reach the CNS and induce different types of neuropathologies. MHV represents the best described coronavirus involved in short- and long-term neurological disorders (a model for demyelinating MS-like diseases) [

 <xref rid="B182-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>,
 <xref rid="B183-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>]. Taken together, all these data bring us to consider a plausible involvement of HCoV in neurological diseases.
