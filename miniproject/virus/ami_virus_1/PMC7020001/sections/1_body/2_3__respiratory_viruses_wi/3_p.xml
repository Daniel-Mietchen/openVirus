<p>Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) are both highly pathogenic zoonotic members of the 
 <italic>Henipavirus</italic> genus and represent important emerging viruses discovered in the late 1990s in Australia and southern Asia. They are the etiological agents of acute and severe respiratory disease in humans, including pneumonia, pulmonary edema and necrotizing alveolitis with hemorrhage [

 <xref rid="B138-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Although very similar at the genomic level, both viruses infect different intermediate animal reservoirs: the horse for HeV and the pig for NiV as a first step before crossing the barrier species towards humans [
 <xref rid="B135-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. In humans, it can lead to different types of encephalitis, as several types of CNS resident cells (including neurons) can be infected [

 <xref rid="B140-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. The neurological signs can include confusion, motor deficits, seizures, febrile encephalitic syndrome and a reduced level of consciousness. Even neuropsychiatric sequelae have been reported but it remains unclear whether a post-infectious encephalo-myelitis occurs following infection [

 <xref rid="B143-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. The use of animal models showed that the main route of entry into the CNS is the olfactory nerve [
 <xref rid="B144-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>] and that the Nipah virus may persist in different regions of the brain of grivets/green monkeys [
 <xref rid="B145-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>], reminiscent of relapsing and late-onset encephalitis observed in humans [
