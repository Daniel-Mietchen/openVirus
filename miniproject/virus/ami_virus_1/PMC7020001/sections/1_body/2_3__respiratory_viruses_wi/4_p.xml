<p>Influenza viruses are classified in four types: A, B, C and D. All are endemic viruses with types A and B being the most prevalent and causing the flu syndrome, characterized by chills, fever, headache, sore throat and muscle pain. They are responsible for seasonal epidemics that affect 3 to 5 million humans, among which 500,000 to 1 million cases are lethal each year [

 <xref rid="B148-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>]. Associated with all major pandemics since the beginning of the 20th century, circulating influenza A presents the greatest threat to human health. Most influenza virus infections remain confined to the upper respiratory tract, although some can lead to severe cases and may result in pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [

 <xref rid="B152-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>]. Several studies have shown that influenza A can be associated with encephalitis, Reye’s syndrome, febrile seizure, Guillain–Barré syndrome, acute necrotizing encephalopathy and possibly acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) [

 <xref rid="B158-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">158</xref>]. Animal models have shown that, using either the olfactory route or vagus nerve, influenza A virus may have access to the CNS and alter the hippocampus and the regulation of neurotransmission, while affecting cognition and behavior as long-term sequelae [
