<p>Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a member of the 
 <italic>Orthopneumovirus</italic> genus [
 <xref rid="B112-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>], infects approximately 70% of infants before the age of 1 and almost 100% by the age of 2 years old [
 <xref rid="B113-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>], making it the most common pathogen to cause lower respiratory tract infection such as bronchiolitis and pneumonia in infants worldwide [

 <xref rid="B114-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Recent evidence also indicates that severe respiratory diseases related to RSV are also frequent in immunocompromised adult patients [

 <xref rid="B115-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] and that the virus can also present neuroinvasive properties [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Over the last five decades, a number of clinical cases have potentially associated the virus with CNS pathologies. RSV has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients (mainly infants) and was associated with convulsions, febrile seizures and different types of encephalopathy, including clinical signs of ataxia and hormonal problems [

 <xref rid="B126-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Furthermore, RSV is now known to be able to infect sensory neurons in the lungs and to spread from the airways to the CNS in mice after intranasal inoculation, and to induce long-term sequelae such as behavioral and cognitive impairments [
