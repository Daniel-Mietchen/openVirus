<p>In the human airways, HCoV infection may lead to the disruption of the nasal epithelium [
 <xref rid="B250-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>] and, although they bud and are released mostly on the apical side of the epithelial cells, a significant amount of viruses is also released from the basolateral side [
 <xref rid="B251-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. Thus, although HCoV infections are, most of the time, restricted to the airways, they may under poorly understood conditions pass through the epithelium barrier and reach the bloodstream or lymph and propagate towards other tissues, including the CNS [

 <xref rid="B252-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">252</xref>]; this was also suggested for other respiratory viruses that can reach the human CNS, namely, RSV [
