<p>Making use of our in vivo model of HCoV neuropathogenesis, relying on the natural susceptibility of mice to HCoV-OC43—the most prevalent strain among endemic HCoV [

Although we must interpret data obtained in rodents with all the caution dictated by the use of a non-human host, it is likely that the underlying mechanisms described will have relevance to the human situation or at least provide leads to investigate neurotropic HCoV in humans.
