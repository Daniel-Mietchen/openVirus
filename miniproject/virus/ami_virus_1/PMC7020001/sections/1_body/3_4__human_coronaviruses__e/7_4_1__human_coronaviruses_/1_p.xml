<p>Over the years, like SARS- and MERS-CoV, the four endemic HCoV have also been identified as possible etiological agents for pathologies outside the respiratory tract. Indeed, myocarditis, meningitis, severe diarrhea (and other gastrointestinal problems) and multi-organ failure [

Recent investigations on HCoV as enteric pathogens demonstrated that all HCoV strains can be found in stool samples of children with acute gastroenteritis; however, no evidence of association could yet be clearly demonstrated with disease etiology [
