<p>In susceptible mice, HCoV-OC43 has a selective tropism for neurons in which it is able to use axonal transport as a way of neuron-to-neuron propagation [
 <xref rid="B269-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>]. These results, together with data harvested with the use of microfluidic devices (Xona microfluidic), helped to elaborate a putative model of propagation adapted from Tomishima and Enquist [
 <xref rid="B291-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">291</xref>], in which infectious HCoV-OC43 could either be assembled in the cell body or at different points along the axon using the anterograde axonal transport to propagate between neurons or from neurons to glial cells surrounding neurons in the CNS (

 <xref rid="B294-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">294</xref>], we are now showing that the rate and success of virus propagation towards the spinal cord, in part through the neuron-to-neuron pathway, correlates with the exacerbation of neurovirulence (
