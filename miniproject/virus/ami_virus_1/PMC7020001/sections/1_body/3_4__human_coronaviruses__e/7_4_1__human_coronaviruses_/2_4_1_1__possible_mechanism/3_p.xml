<p>The second form of any viral spread towards the CNS is through neuronal dissemination, where a given virus infects neurons in the periphery and uses the machinery of active transport within those cells in order to gain access to the CNS [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Although the olfactory bulb is highly efficient at controlling neuroinvasion, several viruses have been shown to enter CNS through the olfactory route [

 <xref rid="B260-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">260</xref>]. After an intranasal infection, both HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV were shown to infect the respiratory tract in mice and to be neuroinvasive [

 <xref rid="B265-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">265</xref>]. Over the years, we and others have gathered data showing that HCoV-OC43 is naturally neuroinvasive in both mice and humans [

 <xref rid="B266-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">266</xref>]. Experimental intranasal infections of susceptible mice also indicate that, once it has invaded the CNS, the virus disseminated to several regions of the brain and the brainstem before it eventually reaches the spinal cord [

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00014-f001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the olfactory route, which is clearly the main route of neuroinvasion used by HCoV-OC43, as well as the early steps of subsequent neuropropagation within the CNS in susceptible mice and recapitulates the suggested equivalent pathway in humans. Nevertheless, our data suggest that HCoV-OC43 may also invade the CNS from the external environment through other pathways involving other cranial peripheral nerves [
 <xref rid="B269-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">269</xref>], reminiscent of what was shown for other human respiratory viruses such as RSV and influenza virus [
 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Therefore, on the one hand, an apparently innocuous human respiratory pathogen such as the HCoV may reach the CNS by different routes and induce short-term illnesses, such as encephalitis. On the other hand, it may persist in resident cells of the human CNS and may become a factor or co-factor of neuropathogenesis associated with long-term neurological sequelae in genetically or otherwise predisposed individuals.
