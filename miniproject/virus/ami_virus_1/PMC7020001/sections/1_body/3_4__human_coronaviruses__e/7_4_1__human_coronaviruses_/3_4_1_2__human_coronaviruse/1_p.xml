<p>Because of their natural neuroinvasive potential in humans and animals, a possible association between the presence of ubiquitous human coronaviruses in the triggering or exacerbation of neurological human pathologies has often been suggested over the years. It is now accepted that HCoV are not always confined to the upper respiratory tract and that they can invade the CNS [

 <xref rid="B270-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>]. As other viruses listed herein, HCoV are neurotropic and potentially neurovirulent. Even though no clear cause and effect link has ever been made with the onset of human neurological diseases, their neuropathogenicity is being increasingly recognized in humans, as several recent reports associated cases of encephalitis [

 <xref rid="B283-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">283</xref>], long-term persistence and newly recognized neuropathogenesis, HCoV disease burden could currently be underestimated. This suggest that better surveillance, diagnoses and deepened virus–host interactions studies are warranted in order to gather more knowledge that will make possible the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or treat occurrences.
