<p>Although possible, human-to-human MERS-CoV transmission appears inefficient as it requires extended close contact with an infected individual. Consequently, most transmission have occurred among patientsâ€™ families and healthcare workers (clusters of transmission). A more efficient human-to-human transmission was observed in South Korea, during the 2015 outbreak of MERS-CoV [

Even though it has propagated to a few thousand people and possesses a high degree of virulence, MERS-CoV seems mostly restricted to the Arabic peninsula and is not currently considered an important pandemic threat. However, virus surveillance and better characterization are warranted, in order to be prompt to respond to any change in that matter [
