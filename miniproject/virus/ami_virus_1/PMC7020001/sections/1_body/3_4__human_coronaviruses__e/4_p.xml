MERS-CoV most probably originated from bats before infecting an intermediary reservoir (the dromedary camel), and also represented a zoonotic transmission to humans. Phylogenetic analyses suggest that there have been multiple independent zoonotic introductions of the virus in the human population. Moreover, nosocomial transmission was observed in multiple hospitals in Saudi Arabia [
