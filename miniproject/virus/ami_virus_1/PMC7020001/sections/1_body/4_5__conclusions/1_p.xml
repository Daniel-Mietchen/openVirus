<p>In their famous review on CNS viral infection, published a few years ago, Koyuncu et al. [
 <xref rid="B35-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] insisted that, under the right conditions, all viruses can have access to the CNS. What “under the right conditions” means certainly represents a subject of debate among virologist and physicians. Nevertheless, as stated in the introduction of this review, viral factors (mutations in specific virulence genes), host factors (immunodepression, age) or a mixture of both (underlining the importance of virus–host interactions), are all good candidates to refer to if one intends to find the beginning of an explanation. A fast and accurate diagnosis would certainly improve prognosis for patients with a suspected CNS infection. Identification of a specific virus provides relevant information on how to treat a patient; therefore, the development of modern technologies, such as high throughput sequencing (Next Generation Sequencing) are warranted as it represents a potentially unbiased marvelous tool for rapid and robust diagnosis of unexplained encephalitis or other types of encephalopathies or neuronal manifestations, especially in the context where more traditional techniques have failed to identify the etiological agent [

 <xref rid="B322-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>]. Therefore, although our attention is mainly on a few different viruses such as HSV, arboviruses and enteroviruses, it may now be the time to look at CNS viral infection from another perspective. These viruses truly represent an important proportion of CNS viral infection associated with encephalitis, meningitis, myelitis and long-term neurological disorders. Nevertheless, accumulating evidence in the scientific literature strongly suggest that many other viral candidates could be underestimated in that matter.
