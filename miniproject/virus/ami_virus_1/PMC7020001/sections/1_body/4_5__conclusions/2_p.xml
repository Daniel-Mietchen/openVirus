<p>Several human respiratory viruses are neuroinvasive and neurotropic, with potential neuropathological consequences in vulnerable populations. Understanding the underpinning mechanisms of neuroinvasion and interaction of respiratory viruses (including HCoV) with the nervous system is essential to evaluate potentially pathological short- and long-term consequences. However, viral infections related to diseases that are rare manifestations of an infection (like long term chronic neurological diseases), represent situations where Koch’s postulates [

These criteria certainly represent a pertinent tool to evaluate the involvement of human respiratory viruses as a factor that could influence long-term human neurological diseases. To continue the gathering of epidemiological data is justified to evaluate the clear cause and effect link between neuroinvasive respiratory viruses and short- and long-term human neurological diseases. Understanding mechanisms of virus neuroinvasion and interactions with the central nervous system is essential for different reasons. First, to help better understand potentially pathologically relevant consequences of infection, and second in the design of novel diagnostic and intervention strategies that will help uncover potential “druggable” molecular virus–host interfaces highly relevant to symptoms of various neurological diseases with a viral involvement.
