<p>Recently, a very interesting manuscript produced by Bookstaver and collaborators underlined the difficulties of precisely deciphering the epidemiology and identifying the causal agent of CNS infections [
 <xref rid="B70-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. These difficulties are mainly due to the tremendous variation in the symptoms throughout the disease process and to the myriad of viruses that can cause CNS infections. As stated in their report, these authors underlined that the clinical portrait of viral infections is often nonspecific and requires the clinician to consider a range of differential diagnoses. Meningitis (infection/inflammation in meninges and the spinal cord) produces characteristic symptoms: fever, neck stiffness, photophobia and/or phonophobia. Encephalitis (infection/inflammation in the brain and surrounding tissues) may remain undiagnosed since the symptoms may be mild or non-existent. Symptoms may include altered brain function (altered mental status, personality change, abnormal behavior or speech), movement disorders and focal neurologic signs, such as hemiparesis, flaccid paralysis or paresthesia. Seizures can occur during both viral meningitis and encephalitis [

Furthermore, viral encephalitis may also be difficult to distinguish from a non-viral encephalopathy or from an encephalopathy associated with a systemic viral infection occurring outside the CNS. Considering all these observations, it is therefore mandatory to insist on the importance of investigating the patientâ€™s history before trying to identify a specific viral cause of a given neurological disorder [
