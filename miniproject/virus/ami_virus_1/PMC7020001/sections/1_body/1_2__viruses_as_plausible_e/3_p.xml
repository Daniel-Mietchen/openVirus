<p>Although the CNS seems difficult for viruses to penetrate, those pathogens that are able to do so may disseminate and replicate very actively and will possibly induce an overreacting innate immune response, which may be devastating. This situation may lead to severe meningitis and encephalitis that can be fatal, depending on several viral and host factors (including immunosuppression due to disease or medications) that may influence the severity of the disease. </p>
