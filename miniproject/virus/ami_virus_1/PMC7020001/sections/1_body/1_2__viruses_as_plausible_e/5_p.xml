<p>In humans, a long list of viruses may invade the CNS, where they can infect the different resident cells (neuronal as well as glial cells) and possibly induce or contribute to neurological diseases [
 <xref rid="B74-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>], such as acute encephalitis, which can be from benign to fatal, depending on virus tropism [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], pathogenicity as well as other viral and patient characteristics. For instance, 30 years ago, the incidence of children encephalitis was as high as 16/100,000 in the second year of life, while progressively reducing to 1/100,000 by the age of 15 [
 <xref rid="B76-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. More recent data indicate that, in the USA, the herpes simplex virus (HSV) accounts for 50–75% of identified viral encephalitis cases, whereas the varicella zoster virus (VZV), enteroviruses and arboviruses are responsible for the majority of the other cases in the general population [
 <xref rid="B4-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Several other viruses can induce short-term neurological problems. For example, the rabies virus [

 <xref rid="B88-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>] affect millions of individuals worldwide and are sometimes associated with encephalitis, meningitis and other neurological disorders. The presence of viruses in the CNS may also result in long-term neurological diseases and/or sequelae. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) induces neurodegeneration [

 <xref rid="B91-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>], which lead to motor dysfunctions and cognitive impairments [
 <xref rid="B92-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a demyelinating disease [
 <xref rid="B93-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>] associated with reactivation of latent polyoma JC virus (JCV) [

Other examples of rare but devastating neurological disorders are measles inclusion body encephalitis (MIBE), mostly observed in immune-compromised patients, and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) that appears 6–10 years after infection [
