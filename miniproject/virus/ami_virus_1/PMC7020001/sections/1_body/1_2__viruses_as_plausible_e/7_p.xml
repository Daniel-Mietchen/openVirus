<p>Including the few examples listed above, more than one hundred infectious agents (much of them being viruses) have been described as potentially encephalitogenic and an increasing number of positive viral identifications are now made with the help of modern molecular diagnostic methods [

However, even after almost two decades into the 21st century and despite tremendous advances in clinical microbiology, the precise cause of CNS viral infections often remains unknown. Indeed, even though very important technical improvements were made in the capacity to detect the etiological agent, identification is still not possible in at least half of the cases [

 <xref rid="B111-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Among all the reported cases of encephalitis and other encephalopathies and even neurodegenerative processes, respiratory viruses could represent an underestimated part of etiological agents [
