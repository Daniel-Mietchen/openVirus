<p>Like all types of viral agents, respiratory viruses may enter the CNS through the hematogenous or neuronal retrograde route. In the first, the CNS is being invaded by a viral agent which utilizes the bloodstream and in the latter, a given virus infects neurons in the periphery and uses the axonal transport machinery to gain access to the CNS [

 <xref rid="B39-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In the hematogenous route, a virus will either infect endothelial cells of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) or epithelial cells of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) in the choroid plexus (CP) located in the ventricles of the brain, or leukocytes that will serve as a vector for dissemination towards the CNS. Viruses such as HIV [

 <xref rid="B60-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>] are also sometimes found in the blood and, being neuroinvasive, they may therefore use the hematogenous route to reach the CNS. As they invade the human host through the airway, the same respiratory viruses may use the olfactory nerve to get access to the brain through the olfactory bulb [

 <xref rid="B63-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. On the other hand, these viruses may also use other peripheral nerves like the trigeminal nerve, which possesses nociceptive neuronal cells present in the nasal cavity [
