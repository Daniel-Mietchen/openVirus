<p>Yet, with the exception of HIV, no specific virus has been constantly associated with specific human neurodegenerative disease. On the other hand, different human herpes viruses have been associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and other types of long-term CNS disorders [

 <xref rid="B104-viruses-12-00014" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>], long-term neurodegenerative disorders may represent a “hit-and-run” type of pathology, since some symptoms are triggered by innate immunity associated with glial cell activation. Different forms of long-term sequelae (cognitive deficits and behavior changes, decreased memory/learning, hearing loss, neuromuscular outcomes/muscular weakness) were also observed following arboviral infections [
