<p>Epithelial cells that line the respiratory tract are the first cells that can be infected by respiratory viruses. Most of these infections are self-limited and the virus is cleared by immunity with minimal clinical consequences. On the other hand, in more vulnerable individuals, viruses can also reach the lower respiratory tract where they cause more severe illnesses, such as bronchitis, pneumonia, exacerbations of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and different types of severe respiratory distress syndromes [

Besides all these respiratory issues, accumulating evidence from the clinical/medical world strongly suggest that, being opportunistic pathogens, these viruses are able to escape the immune response and cause more severe respiratory diseases or even spread to extra-respiratory organs, including the central nervous system [
