   <bold>The interpretation criteria of 2019-nCoV nucleic acid test results</bold>. RT-PCR was used to detect 2019-nCoV. (a) A positive result of RT-PCR: a standard ‘S’-shaped curve for the amplification curves of 
   <italic>ORF1ab</italic>, 
   <italic>N</italic> gene, and internal standard control (IC) and a Ct (cycle threshold) value of less than 35. (b) A multiple PCR combined with capillary electrophoresis fragment analysis positive result of 2019-nCoV. (c) An uncertain result: a standard ‘S’-shaped curve and Ct value of less than 35 for IC, no amplification curve of 
   <italic>ORF1ab</italic> with unrecognizable Ct value, but a standard amplification curve and Ct value of more than 35 of 
   <italic>N</italic> gene. When an uncertain result occurs, the test should be done again or done by a different method detection. (d) The interpretations of 2019-nCoV RT-PCR results: only when the fluorescent amplification of 
   <italic>ORF1ab, N</italic> gene/
   <italic>E</italic> gene, and IC are all simultaneously positive can the result be reported as 2019-nCoV detection positive. (e) A negative result: standard ‘S’-shaped curve and Ct value of less than 35 for IC, but no amplification curve for 
   <italic>ORF1ab</italic> and 
   <italic>N</italic> gene with their Ct value unrecognizable.
