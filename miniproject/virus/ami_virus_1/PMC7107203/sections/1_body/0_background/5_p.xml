 </xref> Like with other epidemics, health systems need to respond quickly and accurately to control the spread of the virus. Here, we describe our understanding of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and our experience with other coronavirus-related diseases in West China Hospital. Based on this, we aim to establish a precision medicine approach to managing Wuhan coronavirus pneumonia, starting from accurate and rapid recognition of individuals infected by 2019-nCoV. It will facilitate decision-making by health care workers with necessary clinical information, laboratory detection, and imaging findings. The approach consists of the following four parts: screening, diagnosis, preventive control, and treatment of 2019-CoV pneumonia (
