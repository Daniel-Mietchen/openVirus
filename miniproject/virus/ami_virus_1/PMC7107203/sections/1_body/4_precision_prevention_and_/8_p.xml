<p>People in close contact with patients or with those suspected of 2019-nCoV infection should be examined immediately if they experience respiratory symptoms, such as fever, or related symptoms. Even if their test result is negative, they should be temporarily isolated at home for 14 days after the last contact with confirmed patients—since 14 days is the disease maximum incubation period.
