<p>Quality control of specimen collection is vital to the diagnostic procedure. Collection of appropriate specimens from suspected cases and their close contacts as early as possible is a cornerstone of RT-PCR testing. The WHO recommends sampling from the lower respiratory tract

   <p>(i) Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be collected using a fiber bronchoscope by clinicians or respiratory therapists. After 100–300 mL of sterilized saline being injected into the bronchia, the liquid is collected by negative pressure (∼100 mm Hg) with sterile containers. The total volume (pooled aliquots) retrieved should be &gt;5 mL and at least 30% of the instilled volume (

   <p>(ii) Sputum from deep in the lung collected in the morning in sterile containers is optimal for testing. Patients with a low sputum volume should be provided with aerosol inhalation using a 0.9% NaCl solution at 25°C (
