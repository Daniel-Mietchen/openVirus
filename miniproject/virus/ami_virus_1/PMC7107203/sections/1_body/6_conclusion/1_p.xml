 </xref> Although many questions, such as detailed pathogenic characteristics, remain unanswered, from what we know about other coronavirus infections, the behavior of 2019-nCoV is not unusual. To reduce the incidence of infection as well as prevent nosocomial infections, we have been working to establish a precision medicine approach for screening, diagnostic, in-hospital preventive control, and treatment for individual patients. With this approach, West China Hospital identified 14 infected patients immediately, each of whom was treated according to the approach developed by the multi-disciplinary medical team. By the time this paper was published, one patient was clinically cured (negative nucleic acid test result for throat swab), while other patients' vital signs remained stable. Since then, the precautionary measures for prevention, control, and quarantine have been implemented and no cases of human-to-human transmission or infection of the medical staff have happened in our hospital.
