<p>In the developed countries where SARS-CoV-2 is currently spreading, the survival of children with severe morbidities, immune disorders, cancer, or transplant is much higher than other countries (including China) due to high-standards of medical care. We could suspect that the infection of compromised children carried out by peers, potential asymptomatic carriers, could lead to serious consequences. Although fatal cases have not yet been reported in the pediatric population, we cannot exclude that the vulnerable children have not been infected yet. To prevent the contagion of children at increased risk, a better understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 among children is necessary.</p>
