<p id="Par24">However, there is at least one crucial difference between fires and epidemics: how readily the two systems can be monitored and measured. Whereas the effects of fires can often be seen with the naked eye, public health records contain information on only the largest outbreaks. As a result, although ecologists can study the past effects of numerous fires, both large and small, epidemiologists rely primarily on data from rare, population-spanning events. Why does this matter? At the phase transition, between local outbreak and global pandemic, the proportion infected can be scale free, meaning measuring only the large outbreaks leads to immeasurably large bias. Mathematical epidemiologists have developed models that can inform policy that saves lives, but the need remains for more refined instruments to gather empirical observations and test those models.</p>
