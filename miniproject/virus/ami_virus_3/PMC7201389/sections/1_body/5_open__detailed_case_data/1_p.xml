 <bold>Bernardo Gutierrez and Moritz U. G. Kraemer.</bold> Making accurate assessments about the spread of infectious diseases relies on the availability of robust epidemiological data, a scarce commodity during growing epidemics and when resources are scarce. Official statistics are usually presented as aggregated data (for instance, newly reported confirmed cases by day) and tend to be shared on a limited basis, restricting access to the data by the scientific community at large. Although such information is important in tracking outbreaks, it does not include the tremendous detail of epidemiological information that is available across different platforms, such as news outlets, social media and official government health reports. Furthermore, epidemiological reporting standards vary considerably across these platforms and contain varying degrees of detail, making automated data collection challenging.
