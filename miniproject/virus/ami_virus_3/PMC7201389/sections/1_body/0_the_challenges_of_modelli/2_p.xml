<p id="Par16">Peculiar to the field of computational epidemiology is the distinction between two different kinds of work: ‘peace time’ research when there are no health emergencies or threats, and what we call ‘war time’, when there are emergencies like the COVID-19 epidemic. During war time, we have to work with limited data, a constantly changing landscape and a lot of assumptions. The work must often be tactical, and what has been produced the day before often must be completely revised the day after because a new piece of information has arrived. At the same time, the challenges faced during infectious disease threats set the questions and problems for the rigorous and foundational research that allows the field to advance after the emergency is gone.</p>
