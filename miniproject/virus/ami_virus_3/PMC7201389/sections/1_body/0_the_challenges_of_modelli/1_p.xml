 <bold>Alessandro Vespignani.</bold> Although there are inherent limitations to predictions in complex socio-technical systems, in recent years mathematical and computational models have successfully forecasted the size of epidemics and have been used to communicate the risks of uncurbed infectious disease outbreaks. Mathematical and computational models are ideal as forecasting tools and can also provide situational awareness when we lack good data, or define counterfactual scenarios that help disentangle the impact of pharmaceutical interventions and public health policies.
