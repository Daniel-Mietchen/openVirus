 <bold>James O. Lloyd-Smith.</bold> As with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) before it, the epidemiology of COVID-19 has been punctuated by conspicuous superspreading events, in which an infected person transmits the virus to many more people than average. The average transmissibility of a pathogen is quantified by its basic reproduction number,

Yet biological, social and environmental factors — aided by a good dose of happenstance — give rise to significant individual variation around this average. This holds true for all pathogens to varying degrees, but evidence suggests that the emerging coronaviruses causing SARS, MERS and COVID-19 are systematically prone to superspreading
