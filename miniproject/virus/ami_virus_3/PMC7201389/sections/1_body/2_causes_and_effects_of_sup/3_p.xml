<p id="Par21">Physicists can help by working to learn the causes of superspreading events. Many involve alternative modes of spread, such as airborne transmission, but inferring such mechanisms from imperfect data in complex environments raises many technical challenges. There are also unsolved mathematical and statistical problems in untangling the influences of individual biological variation and dynamic social contact networks that govern transmission opportunities. By understanding these causes, we can better target interventions to decelerate the spread of COVID-19.</p>
