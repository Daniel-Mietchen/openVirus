This variation matters most when case numbers are small (early in the pandemic, or after successful outbreak suppression if the population remains susceptible), as countries try to prevent establishment of community transmission. Health officials must guard against complacency, recognizing that many importations will fade out by chance but a minority will ignite outbreaks that expand with shocking speed.
