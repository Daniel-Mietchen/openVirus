<p id="Par18">We took two approaches to the analysis. The first exploited natural variation in the distribution of COVID-19 cases, and in the type and timing of interventions. On the basis of statistical tests of association carried out with general linear models, we found that the unprecedented Wuhan city travel ban (affecting 11 million people) slowed the dispersal of infection to other cities by 3 days

 </sup>, delaying epidemic growth elsewhere in China. We found, too, that Chinese cities that pre-emptively implemented control measures — such as suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings — reported in the first week of their outbreaks one-third fewer cases than cities that started control later. Our second approach to analysis built these findings into a dynamic mathematical model, from which we calculated that China’s national emergency response prevented hundreds of thousands of cases that we otherwise expected to see during the first 50 days of the epidemic.
