 <bold>Joseph Wu, Kathy Leung and Gabriel M. Leung.</bold> Rapid and reliable assessment of the clinical severity of pandemic pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is a top priority in pandemic response. In particular, characterization of the infection–fatality risk (the probability of dying among infected individuals) and symptomatic case–fatality risk (the probability of dying among those who develop symptoms) relies on accurate estimates of the true epidemic size. Reported case counts are inevitably biased by the proportion of infections that are symptomatic, care-seeking behaviour and the availability of tests. Although these biases could be partially addressed by developing transmission models to analyse all available epidemiological and clinical data, a synergistic and complementary solution is to use seroepidemiological studies. These use measurements of antibody response across a population to infer infective exposure to (and, by extension, immunity against) the pandemic pathogen, and provide the most direct and reliable data for estimating true epidemic size. Integrating seroepidemiological data into transmission models can greatly reduce the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of clinical severity and transmission dynamics. At the time of writing, serological tests for COVID-19 are being developed and validated. Long-term longitudinal serological follow-up of recovered individuals is crucial for characterizing the underlying immunodynamics. For instance, it can reveal the strength and duration of protective immunity and thus the probability of reinfection. As such, large-scale serosurveys should be conducted regularly and prospectively planned over the course of the different waves of the pandemic and beyond to provide serological data from different age groups.
