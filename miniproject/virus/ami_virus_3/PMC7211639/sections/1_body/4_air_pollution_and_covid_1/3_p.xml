<p id="p0095">The link between severe viral respiratory diseases, which cause infection in 10–20% of the population and air pollution, is well established (
 <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">Iuliano et al., 2018</xref>). A number of the studies already above discussed corroborate this statement. As commented, air pollutants such as PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and PM
 <sub>10</sub>, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide and ozone, can affect airways through inhalation, exacerbating the susceptibility to respiratory virus infections, as well as the severity of these infections (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007</xref>). In relation to this, 
 <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">Frontera et al. (2020)</xref> recently hypothesized that an atmosphere with a high content of air pollutants, together with certain climatic conditions, might promote a longer permanence of the viral particles in the air. It would favor an indirect diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, in addition to the direct diffusion individual to individual. 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Martelletti and Martelletti (2020)</xref> have noticed how the Italian Northern Regions, which are the most affected by COVID-19, match those areas showing also the highest concentrations of PM
 <sub>10</sub> and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. These authors have suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could find suitable transporters in air pollutant particles. In addition, in a linear relationship, the viruses would survive longer and could become more aggressive in an immune system already aggravated by the air pollutants themselves. Individuals residing in zones with high concentrations of air pollutants are more prone to develop respiratory diseases (
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">Marquès et al., 2020</xref>) and suitable to viral infections (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Pollution impairs the first line of defense of upper airways, mainly cilia (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Cao et al., 2020</xref>). Based on this, 
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Conticini et al. (2020)</xref> have investigated whether communities living in polluted area such as Lombardy and Emilia Romagna were more predisposed to die of COVID-19, due to their worse previous health status caused by air pollution. It has been concluded that the usual high concentrations of air pollutants in Northern Italy should be considered an additional co-factor of the high level of lethality recorded in that area. In China, 
 <xref rid="bib83" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al. (2020)</xref> have investigated the relationship between the concentrations of six air pollutants (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, CO, NO
 <sub>2</sub> and O
 <sub>3</sub>) and daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in 120 cities of that country. Significant positive associations of these pollutants with COVID-19 confirmed cases, were found. However, SO
 <sub>2</sub> levels were negatively associated with the number of daily confirmed cases. Anyhow, the results of that study also support that air pollution can be an important factor in COVID-19 infection. In the same line, 
 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Ogen (2020)</xref> has assessed the contribution of a long-term exposure to NO
 <sub>2</sub> on coronavirus fatality. For that purpose, 3 databases were combined: the tropospheric concentrations of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, the atmospheric condition (expressed by the vertical airflow), and the number of fatality cases. Data from the Sentinel-5P showed two main NO
 <sub>2</sub> hotspots over Europe: Northern Italy and Madrid metropolitan area, regions in which the mortality caused by COVID-19 has been particularly high. In contrast to these results, 
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Bontempi (2020)</xref>, for the first time, analyzed the PM
 <sub>10</sub> situation in Lombardy (Italy) from February 10 to March 27, 2020, several days before the sanitary emergency explosion. The available data about PM
 <sub>10</sub> concentrations and infections cases in Lombardy and Piedmont were analyzed and showed that direct correlations between the presence of high quantities of PM10 and the diffusion of the COVID-19 virus were not evident. The assumption that the virus diffusion in Lombardy was favored by PM
 <sub>10</sub> transport effects would be an invalid assessment of health risk. On the other hand, 
 <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro and Barros (2020)</xref> have recently tested the hypothesis that air pollution increases susceptibility to COVID-19. For this, the authors used publicly available data on the cumulative number of COVID-19 confirmed cases by municipality in Continental Portugal until the May 2, 2020 and the average annual levels of PM
 <sub>10</sub>, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub> in the same municipalities. Adjusted models revealed a positive and significant association between COVID-19 notification rates and PM
 <sub>10</sub> and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, while association with NO
 <sub>2</sub> disappeared after adjustment for confounders. These results as those also shown in Italy (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Conticini et al., 2020</xref>) and in the USA (
 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020</xref>), indicate that chronic exposure to air pollutants impairs recovery and leads to more severe and lethal forms of disease. In this same line, 
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Coccia (2020)</xref> has recently examined the mechanisms of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in the environment for a possible strategy to cope with future epidemics similar to coronavirus diseases. The study was focused on case study of Italy, one of the countries with the highest level of deaths worldwide. The results revealed that accelerated transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in specific environments was due to two mechanisms given by: air pollution-to-human transmission, and human-to-human transmission in a context of high density of population. The two main findings were: 1) the acceleration of transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in North Italy has a high association with air pollution of cities, and 2) cities having more than 100 days of air pollution (exceeding the limits set for PM
 <sub>10</sub>), show a very high average number of infected individual (about 3340 infected individuals), while cities having less than 100 days of air pollution show a lower average number of infected (about 1450 infected individuals) on April 27, 2020. Regarding this same topic, 
 <xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Sanità di Toppi et al. (2020)</xref> have hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-19 might be using a species of “
 <italic>highways</italic>”, which would be made up of atmospheric particulates, increasing its indirect transmission. For these authors, this is an issue that deserves further, immediate, and in-depth experimental investigations. Based on the results from various recent papers, here discussed, we fully agree with this recommendation.
