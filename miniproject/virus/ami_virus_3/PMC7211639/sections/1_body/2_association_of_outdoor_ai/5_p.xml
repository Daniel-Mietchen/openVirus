<p id="p0045">The investigation about the effects on respiratory -and also cardiovascular-diseases derived of the association between air pollutants and respiratory virus infections is not a new topic. However, the tremendous impact on health -and on other important socioeconomic aspects of our daily life-derived of the pandemic generated by the SARS-CoV-2 has generated an extraordinary interest in everything related with this serious infection. In recent years, it has been reported that exposure to environmental factors -including air pollutants-could influence the immune system and affect its ability to limit the spread of infectious agents like the Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) (

 <xref rid="bib82" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al. (2016)</xref> suggested that short-term exposure to PM

 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al. (2016)</xref> reported that exposure to particulate matter or ozone might activate cellular signaling networks including membrane receptors, intracellular kinases and phosphatases, as well as transcription factors that regulate inflammatory responses. PM-induced cell signaling would be associated with resultant ROS, while ozone-induced cell signaling would implicate phosphates. Recently, 
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Glencross et al. (2020)</xref> reviewed the effects of air pollution on individual cell types, as well as subsequent effects on multicellular immune responses. The intracellular signaling pathways that air pollution can trigger to start the cascade of immune dysfunction (leading to pollution-induced pathology) were also examined. Since inhaled air pollutants deposit primarily on the respiratory mucosa, the authors focused their review on the mechanisms of respiratory diseases. It was concluded that the clinical effects of air pollution, in particular the known association between elevated ambient pollution and exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), were consistent with the identified immunological mechanisms.
