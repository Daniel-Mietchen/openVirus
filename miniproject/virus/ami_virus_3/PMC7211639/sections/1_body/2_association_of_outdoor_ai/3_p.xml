 <xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Sooryanarain and Elankumaran (2015)</xref> reviewed the environmental drivers of influenza outbreak. In addition to meteorological factors, air pollutants such as ozone, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, nitric oxide and particulate matter –among other frequent environmental pollutants-could affect influenza transmission. Even haze has been suggested to have a potential epidemiologic association with respiratory viruses (

 <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib77" ref-type="bibr">Ye et al., 2016</xref>). Anyhow, environmental pollutants would be potential drivers in influenza A virus survival, stability, and transmissibility (

 <sub>3</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub>) with temperature, during pediatric influenza. Significant interactions between PM and mean temperature were observed, while the ozone level–influenza incidence relationship resulted to be independent of the temperature (

(2011)</xref> reported that the correlation between air pollution and infectious diseases varied depending on the city, region, and the specific pollutant(s) under investigation. Other study evaluated short-term effect of 3 risk factors: low temperatures, the influenza epidemic, and air pollution in Milan region in winter of 2016–2017 (

 <sub>10</sub> and influenza for cardiovascular-related mortality, as well as between influenza and cold temperatures for natural causes mortality.
