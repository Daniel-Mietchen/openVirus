<p id="p0030">In recent years, a number of studies have shown that air pollution can be an important risk factor for adverse respiratory and cardiovascular health outcomes. In addition, increasing evidence supports the association between air pollution and respiratory infections. It has been demonstrated that exposure to air pollutants can induce oxidative stress, resulting in the production of free radicals, which in turn, may damage the respiratory system, reducing the resistance to viral and bacterial infections (
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ciencewicki and Jaspers, 2007</xref>). Regarding this, 
 <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Huang et al. (2016)</xref> investigated the effects of some air pollutants (PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>) on respiratory infections in the Nanjing area (China). The acute effects of air pollutants on ILI were also assessed. Air pollution effects tended to be null -or negative-for patients aged over 25 years, a result that could be due to the small number of influenza-like cases in that age group. With respect to age, epidemiological investigations on the health effects of air pollution have found that children and the elderly are the two groups that are more probably affected, which would be probably due to their relatively weak immune systems (
 <xref rid="bib69" ref-type="bibr">Wang and Chau, 2013</xref>). Recently, 
 <xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Su et al. (2019)</xref> quantified the short-term effects of six air pollutants on ILI in Jinan (China). The average concentrations of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, O
 <sub>3</sub>, CO, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub> were determined in that area. It was noted that subjects aged 25–59, 5–14 and 0–4 years were significantly susceptible to PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and CO, while all age groups were significantly sensitive to SO
 <sub>2</sub>. In turn, people aged ≥60, 5–14 and 0–4 years showed a significant negative sensitivity associated with the levels of O
 <sub>3</sub>. The authors concluded that air pollutants, focused in that study on PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, CO and SO
 <sub>2</sub>, might increase the risk of ILI. In turn, 
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2017)</xref> also in China, observed that ambient PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> might increase the risk of exposure to influenza, especially in the cooler days. It was found that 10.7% of incident influenza cases might result from exposure to ambient PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. Based on these findings, the authors suggested that all measures addressed to decrease PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations, would be potentially beneficial to reduce the risk of exposure and subsequent transmission of influenza. Similar conclusions were also drawn by 
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al. (2016)</xref>, who investigated the association between daily PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and ILI risk in Beijing (China). Ambient PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were significantly related with ILI risk at the flu season. However, the effect of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> differed across age groups, being more pronounced in adults (25–59 years), followed by young adults (aged 15–24), school children (aged 5–14) and the elderly (&gt;60 years). The effect of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> was much less pronounced for children under 5 years of age. In contrast, the levels of PM
 <sub>10</sub> and a warmer climate zone, were found to be other risk factors for common cold among pre-school children. Recently, 
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al. (2018)</xref> investigated in 11 cities and counties of Taiwan the causal relationship between human influenza cases and air pollution, quantified by PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. According to the age-groups, the elderly group was clearly affected in all study sites. It was concluded that minimizing exposure to air pollutants –and specifically to PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>- would be of great importance for the elderly, as well as for susceptible individuals with respiratory diseases.
