<p id="p0050">In the past decade, 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ciencewicki and Jaspers (2007)</xref> published an interesting review on the potential interactions between various air pollutants and respiratory viral infections. The outdoor pollutants examined were NO
 <sub>2</sub>, ozone and particulate matter. The studies reviewed by 
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Ciencewicki and Jaspers (2007)</xref> showed how exposure to these common air pollutants might alter host immunity to respiratory viral infections, meaning important public health implications for people worldwide. It was noted that air pollution-induced enhanced susceptibility to respiratory viral infections. This could mean more serious implications for those subjects who were already affected by preexisting pulmonary diseases (asthma or COPD, for example). These patients could have a significant increased risk of morbidity/mortality after suffering infections with respiratory viruses. In Hong Kong, 
 <xref rid="bib71" ref-type="bibr">Wong et al. (2010)</xref> conducted the first Asian study aimed at examining the interactions between air pollution, influenza, and social deprivation from an epidemiological perspective. The concentrations of NO
 <sub>2</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub> and ozone were daily measured, while the activity of influenza and RSV was also determined. The excess risk estimates for the short-term effects of air pollution on mortality and hospitalization were higher in individuals older than 65 years, compared with all-ages group. Interaction effects between influenza activity and air pollution were found in the estimated risks for hospitalization due to respiratory diseases. A complex issue regarding the association between air pollution with infectious diseases lies in the fact that some investigations of pollution revealed conflicting results according to different cities, regions, and air pollutants (
