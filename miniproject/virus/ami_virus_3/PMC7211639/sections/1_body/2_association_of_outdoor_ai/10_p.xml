 <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Nhung et al. (2019)</xref> investigated the effects of various air pollutants (PM

 <sub>3</sub> and extended LOS. Similar results were also observed for PM
 <sub>10</sub>. It is well known that ozone generates oxidative stress. Therefore, exposure to high ozone concentrations might reduce the lung lining fluid antioxidant level. In contrast, increases in SO
 <sub>2</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, NO
 <sub>x</sub> and CO concentrations were associated with shorter LOS in single-pollutant models. Notwithstanding, these inverse results were less stable and more inconsistent across subgroups, as well as in two-pollutant models. In turn, 
 <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Pfeffer et al. (2019)</xref> found that higher levels of ambient NOx were associated with prolonged exacerbations of likely viral etiology, supporting toxicological effects of air pollution. It would increase susceptibility to infection and its severity. It was noted that the recovery for viral-type exacerbations, after higher ambient levels of NOx, was significantly prolonged. On the other hand, rhinovirus (RHV), which is among the smallest RNA viruses, it is well known that it infects the upper and sometimes lower respiratory apparatus, being responsible for half of the cases of common human cold. In individuals suffering from chronic respiratory diseases, or in the elderly, RHV can be also responsible for life-threatening diseases. Regarding this, recently 
 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Rodrigues et al. (2019)</xref> reported that RHV circulation was determined by environmental conditions, including air pollution.
