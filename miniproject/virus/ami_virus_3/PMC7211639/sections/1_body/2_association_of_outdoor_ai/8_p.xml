<p id="p0060">Since respiratory viral infections (RVIs) are the most common causes of the infection in the respiratory system, 
 <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Silva et al. (2014)</xref> examined in the city of Porto Alegre (Brazil) the number of emergency visits for ILI and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). The association between ILI/SARI, RVI prevalence, and meteorological factors and air pollution was also examined. Surprisingly, it was found that SARI cases were associated with a decrease in mean concentration of air pollutants, which suggested that it could be related with a higher rainfall in the same period of data collection. In that study, special relevance was given to indoor air pollution. 
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Nhung et al. (2017)</xref> conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (including 17 studies) on the acute effects of ambient air pollution on pneumonia in children. It is important to note that pneumonia is the leading cause of childhood death, being caused by viral pneumonia influenza and RSV. Pollutant-specific excess risk percentage and confidence intervals were estimated using random effect models for PM
 <sub>10</sub>, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and carbon monoxide. The results of the meta-analysis confirmed that short-term increases in ambient air pollution, measured by the concentrations of PM
 <sub>10</sub>, PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub>, O
 <sub>3</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub>, were associated with increases in hospital admissions due to pneumonia. It has been demonstrated that long-term exposure to PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> reduces the resistance to influenza virus via down-regulating pulmonary macrophage Kdm6a and mediates histones modification in IL-6 and IFN-β promoter regions (

 <xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al. (2018)</xref> conducted an integrated data analysis to quantify the association among air quality index (AQI), meteorological variables, and respiratory infection risk in Shaanxi (China), whose main goal was to measure the impact of air pollution on that risk. A statistically significantly positive correlation between AQI and the number of ILI cases was observed. This finding was in agreement with the results of previous studies on the association between PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> and ILI cases in Beijing (
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Feng et al., 2016</xref>), and data on hospital admissions in Guangzhou related with air pollution (
 <xref rid="bib80" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bib81" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al. (2019)</xref> assessed the short-term effects of air pollutant concentrations in Suzhou City (China) on respiratory infections in children of different age groups. The results of single-pollutant models showed that PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>, PM
 <sub>10</sub>, NO
 <sub>2</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and CO had significant associations with respiratory tract infections in children &lt;3 years. In turn, the multi-pollutant model found that PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> concentrations were significantly associated with viral respiratory in children under 7 months, while PM
 <sub>10</sub> levels were associated with viral infections in preschool children.
