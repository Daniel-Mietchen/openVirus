<p id="p0040">In addition to influenza, a number of studies have shown that regulated proteolysis is required for the spread/propagation of many human viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Nipah, Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and metapneumoviruses (

 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Ali et al. (2018)</xref> examined the relationship of influenza transmissibility with common air pollutants â€“with special attention to ozone-as well as other environmental factors such as UV radiation and absolute humidity, which were also included. Interestingly, an association of ozone with a reduction in influenza transmissibility was observed. Anyway, these authors also stated that as a highly reactive oxidant air pollutant, ozone might decrease host defenses against bacterial and fungal infections in the airways, aggravating pre-existing diseases such as asthma.
