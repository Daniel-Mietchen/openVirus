 <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">Croft et al. (2019)</xref> investigated nearly 500,000 adults from the state of New York with a diagnosis of influenza, bacterial pneumonia, or culture-negative pneumonia, between 2005 and 2016, with the objective of associating the rate of these infections to the increases of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>. The authors concluded that “
 <italic>increased rates of culture-negative pneumonia and influenza were associated with increased PM</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>2.5</italic>
 </sub>
 <italic>concentrations during the previous week</italic>”. However, they also pointed that these associations could due to an altered toxicity of PM
 <sub>2.5</sub> or a higher pathogen virulence, and therefore, further studies are required. In the same line, 
 <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Horne et al. (2018)</xref> studied the relationship between PM2.5 levels and acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI). Similarly, these authors concluded that short-term exposure to high levels of PM2.5 was associated with greater healthcare use for ALRI in young children, older children, and adults.
