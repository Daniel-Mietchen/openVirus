<p id="p0055">The impact of air pollutants on RSV has been also investigated. The possible link between climate factors, air pollution and increased childhood morbidity/mortality from respiratory diseases is an issue of great interest. 
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Nenna et al. (2017)</xref> studied the association between acute viral bronchiolitis, weather conditions, and air pollution in children of Rome (Italy). Epidemiological data for 14 respiratory viruses detected in nasal washing samples, along with air pollutant concentrations and mean weekly data for weather conditions, were assessed. A strong correlation between peak RSV activity (but not for the remaining 13 viruses) and cold temperatures, higher relative humidity, and air pollutants (especially benzene) was found. Experimental models have shown the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying benzene-induced toxic damage to the respiratory airways, which cause apoptotic changes in the parenchymal components of the lungs. 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Carugno et al. (2018)</xref> investigated whether PM
 <sub>10</sub> exposure was associated with hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis among infants of Lombardy (Italy). The results showed a clear association between short- and medium-term exposure to PM
 <sub>10</sub> and an increased risk of hospitalization due to RSV bronchiolitis. On the other hand, with data obtained in 1990–2016 in 195 countries, 
 <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Troeger and GBD (2018)</xref> reported that the interventions conducted to improve ambient particulate matter pollution –among others such as wasting, household air pollution and expanded antibiotic use-could avert one under-5 deaths due to lower respiratory infection for every 4000 children treated in the countries with the highest lower respiratory infection burden.
