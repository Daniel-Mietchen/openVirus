<p id="p0010">In recent decades, air pollution has been a major environmental health hazard for the general population. Increases in outdoor air exposure affect people's health outcomes, directly and indirectly (

 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Sun and Zhu (2019a)</xref> reviewed the effects of exposure to air pollution on human health. Among the eight categorized health outcomes, asthma and mortality were the most common. Moreover, adverse health outcomes involving respiratory diseases among children accounted for the largest group. Among the total studies included in the review, 95.2% reported at least one statistically positive result, while only 0.4% showed ambiguous results. In turn, 
 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Pothirat et al. (2019)</xref> investigated the association between daily average seasonal air pollutants and daily mortality of hospitalized patients and community individuals, as well as emergency and hospitalization visits for serious respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. It was found that air pollutants were associated with higher mortality of the hospitalized patients and community dwellers, with varying effects on severe acute respiratory, cardiovascular, and cerebrovascular diseases. In relation to the age of the individuals who are affected by outdoor air pollution -with particular attention to the respiratory system-the elderly is one of the most sensitive groups (
