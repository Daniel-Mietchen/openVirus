<p id="p0020">On the other hand, the role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of severe respiratory infections is an issue of great importance. Until recently human coronaviruses were considered to be relatively harmless respiratory pathogens. However, after the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and very especially the recent appearance of the SARS-CoV-2, coronaviruses are receiving worldwide attention as very serious pathogens, especially in respiratory tract infections (

Taking the above into account, the present literature review is aimed at assessing the effects of air pollution on the transmission and severity of respiratory viral infections. The available scientific literature on that hypothetical association was reviewed on PubMed (

The final search date for both databases was April 30, 2020.
