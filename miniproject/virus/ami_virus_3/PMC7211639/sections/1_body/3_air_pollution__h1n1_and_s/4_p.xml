<p id="p0085">Regarding SARS, in an ecologic study conducted in China on air pollution -evaluated by air pollution index (API)- and case fatality of SARS, 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al. (2003)</xref> found that SARS patients from regions with moderate APIs had an 84% increased risk of dying in comparison to patients residing in regions with low APIs. In turn, SARS patients from regions with high APIs were twice as likely to die from SARS, in relation to patients living in regions with low APIs. The results showed a positive association between air pollution and SARS case fatality in Chinese population. Similar results were also reported by 
 <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Kan et al. (2005)</xref>, who in the population of Beijing (China) studied the association between air pollution and daily SARS mortality. It was found that an increase of each 10 μg/m
 <sup>3</sup> over a 5-day moving average of PM
 <sub>10</sub>, SO
 <sub>2</sub> and NO
 <sub>2</sub> corresponded to 1.06, 0.74 and 1.22 relative risks of daily SARS mortality, respectively. 
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al. (2007)</xref> carried out an ecological study in mainland China in order to assess the potential relationship between the outbreak of SARS with meteorological factors and air pollution. In contrast to the results of 
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al. (2003)</xref>, these authors (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2007</xref>) did not find a correlation between air pollution and the SARS outbreak. Although theoretically, air pollution should not affect survival of SARS-CoV 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, it could exert its effect by influencing local resistance of the host. The authors recommended conducting further investigations on this topic.
