<p id="p0080">Despite the wide number of investigations assessing the different factors influencing susceptibility to viral infections, the mechanisms by which inhaled oxidants can modify viral pathogenesis are very complex, and at the time of that pandemic were not well established. It has been shown that oxidative stress increases severity of viral infections. Ozone, an elemental form of oxygen, is one of the most abundant air pollutants in urban areas. It is a potent inducer of oxidative stress that may cause airway inflammation and increased respiratory morbidities. 
 <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">Kesic et al. (2012a</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">2012b</xref>) demonstrated that secreted proteases from primary human respiratory nasal epithelium proteolytically, activated influenza virions, while exposure to an air oxidant pollutant such as ozone increased these effects. On the other hand, associations between PM pollution exposure and adverse health outcomes are well documented. They include respiratory diseases such as COPD and asthma. In turn, associations between PM exposure and increased susceptibility to infectious respiratory diseases have been also reported. Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) were detected in PM samples collected from various cities in the USA (

A number of investigations have been aimed at capturing the global mortality impact of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and identifying factors to explain mortality variations seen across populations. Some studies have focused on risk factors such as pollution exposure. For example,
