  <p>The effects of polyphenols may antagonize the acute respiratory distress induced by macrophage-produced pro-inflammatory cytokine storm. On the left (RED background), COVID-19 infection results in cytokines, and chemokine release by alveolar macrophages. Chemokines further recruit circulating immune cells. On the right (GREEN background), polyphenol exposure can block the immune cell inflammatory program and, at the same time, promote the SLPI release crucial for tissue repair.</p>
