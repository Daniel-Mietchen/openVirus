 </xref>. Unfortunately, we do not yet have weight, height, and waist circumference data for all patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, and, therefore, we cannot disentangle the effects of adiposity on lung function and immune response to viral infection. Excess body weight and increased visceral adiposity are habitually associated with metabolic alterations such as insulin dysregulation, high fasting glucose levels, hyperlipidemia, or systemic hypertension, which cause dysregulation of the immune system through mediation in various immune, metabolic, and thrombogenic responses. However, the clinical impact of this immune dysregulation on susceptibility to and severity and outcome of viral infections and on lung function is not yet clearly understood (
