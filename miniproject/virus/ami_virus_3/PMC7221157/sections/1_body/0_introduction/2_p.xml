Four Regions in Italy have reported 59,173 cases of COVID-19, including 34,889 confirmed infections solely in Italy's epicentral Lombardy region, corresponding to more than a third of the total number of infected people in the entire country (Ministry of Health). Italy's mortality rate may be partially explained by the country's relatively higher proportion of older people.
