<p>As mentioned previously, COVID-19-related deaths are due to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); nonetheless, data indicate that the COVID-19 virus is detectable in stool of infected patients, suggesting systemic manifestations (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and diarrhea as among the most frequent infection symptoms (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Inflammation of intestinal mucosa may result in increased intestinal permeability with a consequent cascade of events that cause persistent inflammation, worsening the infection-related symptoms. Immune homeostasis is a dynamic process maintained by a complex interplay between the gut microbiota and host mucosal immune system (

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). It is possible that COVID-19 mortality is increased in older patients with comorbidities associated with intestinal dysbiosis, as this could support systemic chronic inflammation in the host. Nonetheless, only future studies will clarify this aspect.
