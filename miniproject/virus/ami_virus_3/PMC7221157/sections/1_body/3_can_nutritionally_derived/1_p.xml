<p>ACE2-expressing epithelial cells are the primary targets of COVID-19. Similarly to other pulmonary viral infections, following primary exposure, the progeny proliferate in the host cells, which consequently die and release their contents. COVID-19 is now able to infect other cells, including alveolar macrophages (

Activated or infected immune cells secrete excessive pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, fuelling a vicious circle leading to pulmonary tissue damage. Data accumulating from COVID-19 patients indicate that these patients might have a cytokine storm syndrome, with markedly higher levels of IFN-γ, CCL-2, CCL-3, TNF, and the aforementioned IL-6 (
