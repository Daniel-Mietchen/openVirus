 <sup>dull</sup> MBCs might play a crucial role being capable of a more rapid reaction than naive B cells. They could immediately secrete antibodies and simultaneously enter the germinal centre reaction, where they acquire more somatic mutations and select their BCR on the basis of affinity. In infants and children, most MBCs are CD27
 <sup>dull</sup> and thus highly adaptable to new antigens. In contrast, in the elderly, most MBCs are CD27
 <sup>bright</sup>. CD27
 <sup>bright</sup> MBCs, being highly mutated and specific, recognise their targets but appear incapable of adaptation to new antigens.
