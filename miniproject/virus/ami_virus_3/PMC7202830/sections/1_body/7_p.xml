<p id="para80">Second, children have the ability to rapidly produce natural antibodies with broad reactivity that have not yet been selected and shaped by the reaction to common environmental pathogens. Following infection, two types of MBC, CD27
 <sup>dull</sup> and CD27
 <sup>bright</sup> MBCs,

 </xref> cooperate. The two populations are related but have distinct molecular signatures and functions. CD27
 <sup>bright</sup> MBCs express highly mutated VH genes shaped by antigen. On stimulation, CD27
 <sup>bright</sup> MBCs rapidly differentiate into plasmablasts and secrete antigen-specific antibodies, mostly of switched isotype. By contrast, CD27
 <sup>dull</sup> MBCs are less mutated, generate few plasmablasts and secrete IgM antibodies. Innate or IgM MBCs are CD27
 <sup>dull</sup>. When CD27
 <sup>bright</sup> MBCs are used to produce plasmablasts and increase the amounts of antibody, CD27
 <sup>dull</sup> MBCs proliferate and rapidly reconstitute MBC numbers.

 </xref> Thus, the interrelationship between CD27
 <sup>dull</sup> and CD27
 <sup>bright</sup> MBCs might explain the resilience and rapidity of the adult immune response.
