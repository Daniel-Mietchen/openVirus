<p id="para30">Children are more vulnerable to other infections; thus, the important question arisesâ€”why are children less susceptible to COVID-19 disease compared with adults? So far, there is no evidence of a lower degree of expression or function of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor (namely ACE2) in children. Thus, studying the innate immune system of children might be the key to understanding protection against or susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2.
