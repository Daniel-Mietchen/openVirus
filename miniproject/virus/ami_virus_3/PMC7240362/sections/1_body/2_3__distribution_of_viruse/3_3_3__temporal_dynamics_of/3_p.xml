<p>The transmission route is another important factor that determines the dynamics of pathogens. Viruses can transmit in indirect ways, using vectors. The recent spread of 
 <italic>V. destructor</italic> greatly modified the epidemiology of several viruses, which switched from low titers of mostly orally transmitted pathogens to rapidly spreading epidemics driven by the direct transmission and/or indirect effects of Varroa on individual and colony bee health [
 <xref rid="B137-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. Shortly after this invasion, viruses such as ABPV, DWV and SBPV were shown to be successfully transmitted by the mite [
 <xref rid="B138-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Some of these viruses rapidly evolved towards a vector-borne lifestyle [
 <xref rid="B78-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>] with increased rates of prevalence and virulence [

 <xref rid="B139-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>]. As a result, the annual prevalence and titer patterns of these viruses were altered, with a peak later in the season, following the Varroa population dynamics within colonies [

 <xref rid="B127-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>,
 <xref rid="B131-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>,
 <xref rid="B140-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>,
 <xref rid="B141-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>,
 <xref rid="B142-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. Models show that transmission by the mite greatly modifies the in-hive dynamics of DWV, resulting in an imbalanced age structure of overwintering bees leading to the death of infected workers and eventually the colony during the following winter or spring [
 <xref rid="B143-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>]. With an early onset of the mite demographics, DWV loads and prevalence remain high at the start of the winter, which has a significant effect on bee and colony survival prior to the following spring and the start of a new brood cycle [
 <xref rid="B75-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B144-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>,
 <xref rid="B145-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Given the influence of the mite population dynamics on the temporal variation of vectored viruses, any factor influencing the growth rate of the mite and its demographics will subsequently modify the dynamics of the viral population within the host. For instance, naturally mite-resistant colonies show a significant reduction of the mite population size relative to non-resistant colonies. Consequently, they display much lower DWV titers and different virus infection dynamics [

 <xref rid="B146-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>]. To minimize colony losses, the beekeeping industry has developed several strategies and tools to control mite populations infesting mite-susceptible honey bee stocks. Acaricide treatments have been shown to significantly reducte the prevalence of varroa-vectored viruses, including DWV and the ABPV-complex viruses [
 <xref rid="B75-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
 <xref rid="B145-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>]. Nevertheless, viruses are never totally eliminated from treated hives and can persist at low prevalence and titers, illustrating the importance of the multiple routes of transmission for disease dynamics.
