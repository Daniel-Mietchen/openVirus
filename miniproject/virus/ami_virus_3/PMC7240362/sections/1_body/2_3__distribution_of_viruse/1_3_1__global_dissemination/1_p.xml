<p>Honey bee viruses can be transmitted horizontally, vertically or vectored by parasites, such as the mite 
 <italic>V. destructor</italic>. In addition, viruses can be dispersed anthropogenically, along nodes of a network of existing managed colonies. As the latter has the greater consequences, and because this review concerns the dissemination of viruses on a global scale, we will focus here on human activities that drive the dispersal of bee viruses.
