  <title>Diversity and pathogenicity of deformed wing virus.</title>

 <p>The existence of major strains for any one virus species is of great significance for virulence evolution, quasispecies dynamics and virus adaptation [
  <xref rid="B62-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. As a consequence of the emergence of 
  <italic>V. destructor</italic> as a novel, exotic mechanical, and sometimes also biological, vector of viruses in 
  <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, different strains of deformed wing virus (DWV) have adapted to this new transmission route [
  <xref rid="B63-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>], leading to the emergence of new threats to honey bee health. Disentangling the individual effects of the different strains of this virus on honey bee health is complex, especially for colony-level effects. For instance, DWV-B (originally named 
  <italic>Varroa destructor</italic> virus-1 or VDV-1) is an emerging strain of DWV with elevated virulence in continental Europe [
  <xref rid="B64-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. In studies conducted in Germany, this pathogen appeared to be more virulent than the other major DWV variant, DWV-A, at the individual bee level in adults workers [
  <xref rid="B64-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
  <xref rid="B65-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] but not in pupae [
  <xref rid="B66-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. However, although DWV-B has recently been detected in the USA, its impact on honey bee health there is unclear [
  <xref rid="B67-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>], since DWV-A has been associated with higher overwintering colony losses across the country [
  <xref rid="B68-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Moreover, these two DWV strains differ markedly in their interaction with 
  <italic>V. destructor</italic>. Notably, DWV-B is capable of replicating in the mite [
  <xref rid="B69-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
  <xref rid="B70-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>], while DWV-A is not [
  <xref rid="B71-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
  <xref rid="B72-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The higher virulence of DWV-B when transmitted by the mite to pupae [
  <xref rid="B65-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] makes the brood more susceptible to detection by adult bees and may therefore encourage its removal from the colony by social immunity, similar to other highly virulent Varroa-transmitted viruses [
  <xref rid="B73-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. However, DWV-B also impairs adult bee cognitive function to a greater extent than DWV-A [
  <xref rid="B65-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], potentially compromising social hygiene efficiency in general, which may benefit DWV-B to a greater extent than DWV-A [
  <xref rid="B74-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. The two strains may thus each be favored in different aspects of the Varroa–virus–bee relationship, which may determine which strain persists at colony level under different circumstances [
  <xref rid="B64-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>,
  <xref rid="B68-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
  <xref rid="B75-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>,
  <xref rid="B76-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Additionally, the spread of 
  <italic>V. destructor</italic> and the global trade in bees and bee products has led to the co-occurrence of different major virus strains that did not initially exist in sympatry. This has resulted in the appearance of many natural recombinant strains between DWV-A and B, representing the majority of the DWV variants in colonies from the UK and France [
  <xref rid="B77-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
  <xref rid="B78-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
  <xref rid="B79-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Through recombination, the most potent features of either strain can be linked in a single genome, thus abolishing the need for cooperation and self-regulation between strains through the quasispecies social structure [
  <xref rid="B62-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. For this reason, recombinant viruses are often more virulent than either of the parental genomes [
  <xref rid="B68-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
  <xref rid="B76-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
  <xref rid="B77-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>,
  <xref rid="B78-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
  <xref rid="B79-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
  <xref rid="B80-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Finally, the discovery of a third major DWV variant (DWV-C) [
  <xref rid="B81-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>], less common and possibly more virulent than either DWV-A or DWV-B in honey bees [
  <xref rid="B68-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>,
  <xref rid="B82-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>], and the confirmation of Egypt bee virus [
  <xref rid="B36-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] as a fourth major DWV variant (de Miranda, unpublished) adds a further level complexity to the possible interactions between these major DWV strains and their recombinants.
