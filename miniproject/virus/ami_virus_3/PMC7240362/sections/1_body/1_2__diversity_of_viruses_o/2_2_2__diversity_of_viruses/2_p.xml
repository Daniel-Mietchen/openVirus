<p>HTS technologies have effectively turned this entire paradigm upside-down by uncovering, through sequencing and bioinformatic analyses, a staggering diversity of previously unknown viruses that vastly outstrips the viruses known from diseases [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. These discoveries have shown that the overwhelming majority of viruses are asymptomatic, and that only a miniscule proportion cause disease [
 <xref rid="B22-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. This avalanche of virus discoveries covers all organisms and environments, surpassing the capacity of the existing taxonomic structures to catalogue and organize this data, while the discoveries themselves add resolution and power to the bioinformatics tools for further discoveries, in new or old datasets. For bees, this process started in earnest with the mass screening for possible virological links to colony collapse disorder (CCD) [

 <xref rid="B48-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], culminating in the list in 
 <xref rid="insects-11-00239-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. However, this is almost certainly a vast underestimate of the true total virus diversity in bees, judging by the rate of new discoveries [
 <xref rid="B49-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], not only of virus species and genera [
 <xref rid="B50-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] but also of families and orders [
 <xref rid="B23-insects-11-00239" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Additionally, methodological biases exist in the discovery process towards RNA viruses (preponderance of transcriptome studies in HTS), especially those with poly-A tail (e.g., Picornavirales), and a bioinformatic screening based largely on conserved replication protein domains, thereby excluding subviral entities lacking a replicase (viroids, satellite viruses), viruses replicating by other means and other non-host, replicating, bioactive nucleic acid sequences.
