<p>With this work, one of our aims was to provide an extensive database (
 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-insects-11-00239">Table S1</xref>) reporting the global prevalence of viruses of the honey bees that can be used as a reference for future studies. The honey bee epidemiology research field is continuously expanding, as illustrated by the growing number of studies on honey bee viruses (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="insects-11-00239-f003">Figure 3</xref>). Yet, several major knowledge gaps remain. For instance, data on the prevalence of viruses of honey bees are still lacking in several areas of the world. This absence of data is particularly remarkable in central Africa and some regions of Asia. Although we may have missed some reports in our survey as we only included peer-reviewed articles published in scientific journals, we can predict that the viruses found in the south and the north of the African continent may also be widespread in the center. In fact, the natural high swarming tendencies of native African 
 <italic>A. mellifera</italic> subspecies may enforce the dispersal of diseases in that continent [
