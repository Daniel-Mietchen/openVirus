<p>Finally, knowledge on the transmission routes and on the biology of vectors and alternative host species will be needed to help prevent the spread and host switch of new viruses. The mechanisms of dispersal of viruses of honey bees could be investigated by studying the prevalence and biogeography of newly described viruses that do not yet occur globally. The spread of invasive species such as

 <italic>V. destructor</italic> and 
 <italic>T. mercedesae</italic> is also alarming, as these species are known to be infected by viruses of
