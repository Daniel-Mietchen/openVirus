<p>Analyses of demographic trends across Sabah indicated a slightly higher proportion of male dengue cases (60%) than females (40%); however, mean annual incidence rates were not significantly different between genders across the 7 years (29/100,000 for males and 20/100,000 for females, Mann-Whitney U = 19, p = 0.535), nor within different age groups (U = 321, p = 0.241) (
