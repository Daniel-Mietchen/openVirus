<p>The changing annual spatial trend is shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007504.g005">Fig 5</xref>, which indicates high annual variability across districts, and the highest mean incidence rates overall in the western districts of Sabah. A spatial shift occurred during the large 2015 outbreak, when incidence increased markedly in the more densely populated western districts of Kota Kinabalu, Penampan, and Putatan, as well as in Sandakan and Semporna in the east (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007504.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The overall urban case proportions in these districts ranged from 53â€“85%. During 2016, cases from both urban and rural localities contributed to the outbreak, but the greatest overall burden was in rural localities of Tenom, Nabawan and Keningau districts.
