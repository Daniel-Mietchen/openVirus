 <italic>albopictus</italic> was by far the commonest potential dengue vector identified by the public health authorities. It was three times more common than 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> in urban case households and seven times more common in rural households. In &gt;50% of case households inspected, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>albopictus</italic> was the only potential vector identified. The eastern districts of Sabah state appeared to have a higher proportion of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> compared to the rest of the state, although overall dengue incidence was lower on the east coast. This finding was consistent with those of early entomological surveys of Sabah in the 1970â€™s, which reported higher numbers of 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> on the east coast and lower abundance on the west coast [
