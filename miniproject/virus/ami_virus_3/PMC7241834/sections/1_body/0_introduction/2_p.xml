<p>In Malaysia, regular outbreaks have occurred since the 1960s with the first major, nation-wide outbreak of 1,487 cases and 54 deaths recorded in 1973 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Steep increases in case numbers began to occur from the late 1980s when incidence rates rose from 9 cases/100,000 in 1988 to 123 cases/100,000 in 1998, reaching a total of 27,381 reported cases in 1998 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These increases occurred alongside Malaysia’s rapid population and infrastructure growth (rising from 13.7–23.3 million people between 1980 and 2000), which facilitated the spread of dengue through the unintended creation of new vector breeding sites [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. This trend continued into the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, with a 7-fold increase in case numbers between 2000 and 2010, when case numbers reached 46,171 (incidence rates of 30 and 162/100,000, respectively) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This coincided with the introduction of a new national dengue case definition in that same year, requiring all notifications to be laboratory-confirmed by a diagnostic test (either NS1 and/or IgM/IgG serology) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. While the majority of reported cases have been concentrated in the highly urbanized states of Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Johor, located on the Malaysian peninsula (together comprising 68% of cases between 2012 and 2016), increases have also been recorded in more rural states [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Few eco-epidemiological studies have explored the factors driving incidence rates in rural parts of the country; however, seroprevalence and vector surveillance studies suggest that infection risk has become comparable in rural and urban areas alike [
