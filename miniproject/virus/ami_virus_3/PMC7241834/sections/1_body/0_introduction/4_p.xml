<p>The Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak, in Malaysian Borneo, report lower incidence rates than mainland Malaysia (together, 5% of all cases between 2012–2016) and patterns of transmission in these states are not well characterised [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Rapidly developing urban areas are located in close proximity to disturbed forest environments, facilitating interactions among DENV vectors and hosts, and increasing potential risk of spill-over of sylvatic pathogens to human populations [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Sabah has high rates of forest loss, with monocultures of rubber and palm plantations estimated to cover 36–56% of the land area [

 <italic>knowlesi</italic> malaria in Sabah have been linked to deforestation and land use changes, which lead to increased contact between its

 <xref rid="pntd.0007504.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], it is essential from a public health perspective to understand current disease patterns and their associated risk factors. Our study describes recent spatial and temporal trends in dengue incidence, and some potential demographic and entomological risk factors from this understudied region of South East Asia.
