<p>Annual, monthly and mean incidence of dengue were calculated using the number of notifications per month and Sabah population estimates based on the 2010 Malaysian census. Incidence rates were standardized for age and gender by adjusting population numbers for these variables by their relative district-level population proportions. Ages of cases were grouped into four categories to broadly separate young children from older children and adults (0–9, 10–29, 30–49 and ≥50). Differences between means were determined by Kruskal-Wallis or Mann-Whitney statistical tests using SPSS Statistics software (SPSS, IBM New York USA; version 23). Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05. Maps of Malaysia and Sabah dengue cases and incidence were created using ArcGIS (Esri Redlands USA; version 10.5.1).</p>
