<p>Entomological surveillance data (number of larvae, mosquito species identified) were generated from active surveillance of potential aquatic habitats, primarily water-holding containers, indoors and outdoors around 719 case residences inspected during the 2015â€“16 outbreaks. Surveys were carried out by the local public health authority who designated 255 (36%) of inspected residences as urban, and 437 (61%) as rural. No rural or urban designation recorded for a further 27 (4%) of houses. Where mosquito larvae were found in or around a case household, samples were taken to local public health laboratories for species identification. The presence or absence of one or more species per household was recorded, and the House Index (HI) was calculated as the proportion of houses infested with larvae and/or pupae [
