<p>Key to the threat to humanity discourse is the stock image of spread that is characteristic of pandemic risk. Pandemics imply ‘movement, directionality and contagious spread’; boundaries become porous, leading to zones cordoned off for containment (

 <xref rid="bibr40-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Vellek’s (2016)</xref> content analysis of newspaper reports of Ebola as a global threat, one made possible by easier travel options in the modern world. However, this discourse, when used in the earlier outbreaks in Zaire and Sudan, had the effect of protecting individual governments because it sidestepped the real factors that led to fatalities, that is, the economic and systemic constraints reflected in staff not being trained or enough supplies not being provided (Garrettas cited in 
 <xref rid="bibr43-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Weldon, 2001a</xref>). 
 <xref rid="bibr21-0081246319868656" ref-type="bibr">Kamradt-Scott (2016)</xref>, therefore, in explaining the WHO’s reform of global health security – although late for West Africa – comments that the affected countries’ governments should have been more proactive by asking for help because of the global risks. Thus, the effect of the threat to humanity discourse is to detract from national governments’ responsibilities and failures, allocating passivity and even invisibility to their actions and roles while uncontrolled agency is granted to the virus. The uncontrolled agency is also figured into the discourse of invasion which reveals the process that unfolds with graphic descriptions of territorial uncontainment. In other words, the threat to humanity discourse, which rests on the universal globalised fear, is the outer layer of the sinister (unseen) process of invasion.
