<p>A limitation of this study is that, because Sabinet relies on manual processing, it is possible that articles may have been mistagged and therefore did not appear in the search results. In addition, there may have been newspapers that were absent from the database. That the outbreak occurred 3 years ago does not imply the current study is delayed or irrelevant. The 2013–2016 Ebola outbreak was the largest, with approximately 28,639 cases (

The fear discourse spread worldwide, unlike the current 2018–2019 outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) that has approximately 1,082 cases since August 2018 (

Our study highlights discourses similarly contained in the social construction of disease, enhancing understandings about how epidemics are represented in the public sphere, and the findings suggest that media use alternative discourses that could bring social cohesion, social action, and organised medical management, rather than disease management being disabled by fear and conspiracy.
