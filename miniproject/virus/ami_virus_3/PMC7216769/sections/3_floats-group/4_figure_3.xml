   </sup> The case fatality ratio was calculated as the ratio of total deaths per total number of laboratory confirmed cases. Dependent on the country both numbers can be underestimated. COVID-19 cases were normalized to total cases/1 million population. (A) The graph illustrates that CFR is not a constant; some countries have a low percentage CFR in relation to a high number of cases, while other countries have a high CFR as compared to their total number of cases. (B) As shown here for the US, the CFR of a country can change within a relatively short period of time as the number of cases increases. This could be due to an overwhelmed healthcare system where personnel, hospital beds, and life-saving supplies become limiting.
