  <p>Exponential spread of emerging and re-emerging diseases based on their R0 values. The higher the R0 value, the faster a disease spreads through a population that has not yet built immunity or is not vaccinated. The label “Influenza” represents influenza viruses causing seasonal flu for which herd immunity exists.</p>
