<p>The case fatality ratio (CFR, also called case fatality rate) is the ratio of deaths per total confirmed infected cases. It plays a significant role in assessing the severity of a disease. The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.6% in China and 15.2% outside of China.

 </sup> The high percentage of deaths was speculated to be due to the breakdown of the healthcare system, i.e., their inability to optimally treat seriously ill patients.

 </sup> Furthermore, incomplete testing could contribute to high CFRs if the population of COVID-19 infected individuals is substantially larger than the cases confirmed by laboratory testing. Using the WHO estimate calculated from the ratio of death cases per total laboratory-confirmed positive cases, the CFR for COVID-19 is estimated worldwide to be 7.0% (as of 4/22/2020), which compares with 11% for SARS and 34% for MERS (

 </xref>B). Factors underlying high CFRs are under investigation, but the availability of an effective healthcare system may play a major role in curtailing the CFR within a country. This can occur when the total number of cases increases sufficiently to overwhelm the available hospital capacities for critical care. In particular, countries with less developed healthcare structures will be expected to have high CFRs. In a global pandemic, other communities/countries need to step up in order to provide critical life-saving support.
