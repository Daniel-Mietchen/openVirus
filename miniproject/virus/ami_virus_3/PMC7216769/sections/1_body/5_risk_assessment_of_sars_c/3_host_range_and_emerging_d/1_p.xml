<p>The host range of a pathogen determines whether only a specific host or a broad range of hosts can be infected. How can a bat virus evolve into a human pathogen that creates a disease of such global dimensions? The answer to this question lies in a characteristic viral feature, the rapid viral genome mutation rate which then results in a variety of viral descendants with altered proteins responsible for attaching to and entering host cells of different animal species, including humans. RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses exhibit especially high mutation rates that allow rapid diversification at the cost of generating nonviable descendants.

 </sup> Viral adaptation to new hosts is driven entirely by stochastic mutations and a stochastic, hit or miss host encounter. Expanding a viral host range creates additional reservoirs and is thus of evolutionary advantage to the virus. The spike protein is an important target for evolutionary changes as it allows recognition of different host cell target proteins, not only between different host species but also between different tissues within one host (tropism).

 </sup> Dispersion as aerosolized particles to different species is especially efficient in creating new reservoirs of animals by mutated coronaviruses that can eventually reach a human host. As the virus is spreading across the world, it has already begun to mutate leaving a possibility for a recurrence of a SARS-CoV-2 variant.
