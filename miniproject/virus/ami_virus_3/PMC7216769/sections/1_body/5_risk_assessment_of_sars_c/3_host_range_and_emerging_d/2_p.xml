<p>The hallmark of an emerging contagious disease is that it is not previously known to exist in humans but has now acquired the ability to spread from human to human. Diseases crossing the animal–human barrier are referred to as zoonotic diseases. Often peridomestic animals or wildlife serves as intermediate stable reservoirs increasing the opportunity of the virus to inadvertently infect humans.

 </sup> For MERS, camels were suggested as the intermediate reservoir.

 </sup> The exact intermediary animal for both SARS coronaviruses will become known once more viral sequences from various animal sources become available. This raises the question whether COVID-19 could spread from humans to domestic animals including pets and eventually wildlife, thus creating new reservoirs in countries without previous animal reservoirs. As of recently, there is evidence of inadvertent human to dog and cat (domestic and tiger) transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

 </sup> In laboratory settings, cats as well as ferrets were also able to transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their kind suggesting that cats and ferrets represent at least two new potential animal reservoirs in countries outside China. More research will examine whether either animal species can transmit the virus back to humans.
