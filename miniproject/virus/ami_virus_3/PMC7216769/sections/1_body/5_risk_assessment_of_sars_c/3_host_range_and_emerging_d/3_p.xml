<p>Interestingly, all viruses listed in 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table 
  <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref>
 </xref> are RNA enveloped viruses and originated either in bats (i.e., coronaviruses, ebolavirus, and also zika virus not included in the table) or in birds or other animals (i.e., influenza viruses). An exception is HIV, which is thought to have originated in primates.
