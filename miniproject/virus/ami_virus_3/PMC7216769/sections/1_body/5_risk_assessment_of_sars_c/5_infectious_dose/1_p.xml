<p>The infectious dose is an important factor in assessing the ability of a pathogen to establish a successful infection in its host. It is expressed as ID
 <sub>50</sub> and refers to the number of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, that is sufficient to infect 50% of a given susceptible population. Some pathogens have lower infectious doses than others. For influenza, a high infectious dose appears to correlate with a more severe disease.

 </sup> The infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 is currently not known. A study by Watabanbe et al. used animal studies and modeling of SARS spreading in an apartment complex in China to estimate the infectious dose for SARS-Cov-1 to be 280 viral particles to cause disease in 50% of the population.

 </sup> This ID
 <sub>50</sub> is similar to values determined for the human common cold coronaviruses and some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group as SARS-CoV-1.

 </sup> Exact infectious dose estimations for human pathogens are difficult to obtain since human volunteer studies are rare. One such study for the Influenza A virus determined the ID
 <sub>50</sub> to be 790 viral particles when administered intranasally. However, infection via aerosolization of Influenza A is believed to be much lower.
 <sup>
  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>
 </sup> This suggests that the infectious doses for the human coronaviruses and Influenza A are in about the same range. In contrast, the ID
 <sub>50</sub> of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is 10 bacteria by inhalation, which is far lower. How many SARS-CoV-2 viruses are expelled when people cough? The answer to this question is not yet known. However, viral shedding from the respiratory tract begins 2.5 days before the onset of symptoms and peaks already 0.6 day, on the average, 
 <italic>before</italic> the onset of symptoms.

 </sup> The authors speculate that 44% of transmission could already occur before people become aware of carrying the disease. Presymptomatic virus shedding is thus likely a major contributor to global COVID-19 spreading as it occurs undetected under the current limited testing practice. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV virus shedding from the respiratory tract begins at the onset of symptoms, and infectivity is greatest in the second week of illness.

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>
 </sup> Thus, both of these diseases are easier to trace.
