<p>An additional important question is whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in asymptomatic persons, and if so, can these individuals transmit the virus? An analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak on the cruise ship Princess Diamond in Yokohama, Japan, showed that, of the 634 persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 50.5% had no significant symptoms.

 </sup> Using mathematical modeling, Li et al. examined the spread of COVID-19 in 375 Chinese cities during January 10â€“23, 2020.

 </sup> This was a time period of extensive travel due to the Chinese Spring Festival, and before the Chinese Government implemented travel restrictions to curb the spread of the disease. The authors concluded that 86% of all infections were not documented during this time period because infected individuals displayed mild, limited, or no symptoms. While the infected but asymptomatic population was estimated to be less contagious, they were responsible for 79% of the symptomatic COVID-19 documented cases during that time period.

 </sup> Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic or individuals with mild symptoms is a major contributor to the rapid global spread of COVID-19. In contrast, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-1 made up 7.5% of a healthcare worker population before infection control measures were implemented,

 </sup> It is unclear to date whether SARS and MERS asymptomatic individuals can transmit the disease.
