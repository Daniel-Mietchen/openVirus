<p>What else can change R0 of a disease? There is the possibility that a virus could mutate to become more or less efficient in establishing an infection, resulting in a higher or lower R0, respectively. In addition, some infected individuals participate in superspreading events where excessive disease spreading is traced to a single person, who is also called a superspreader (reviewed by Stein 2011).

 </sup> Well documented in the news is a woman in Korea traveling home from Wuhan and infecting 37 members during one large church event, who then went on to spread the disease to hundreds of other church members within a short period of time. At a birthday party in the US one person already ill with COVID-19 infected approximately 50 partygoers who subsequently scattered to different states in the US and traveled abroad infecting many people in their path.

 </sup> Other documented cases of superspreader events are known for MERS and SARS.

 </sup> A MERS superspreading event played a significant role in the outbreak of MERS in Korea in 2015. A businessman returning from the Middle East was treated at a hospital from which the disease was spread to other hospitals to which patients were transferred where MERS then became a nosocomial disease (that is, a disease originating in a hospital). Because of the superspreading hospital events, the R0 value for MERS was increased to 8.1.

 </sup> In any case, whether it is the physiological nature of a certain individual or their social practices, superspreading events play a significant role in spreading emerging diseases. Examples of social gatherings that could become superspreading events contributing to rapid disease spread include major holidays that involve traveling such as the Chinese New Year, Thanksgiving, school or college holidays, and major gatherings such as sports events and concerts, etc.
