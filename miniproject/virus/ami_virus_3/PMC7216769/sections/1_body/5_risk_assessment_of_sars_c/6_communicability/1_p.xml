<p>Communicability of a disease is another measure to determine the capability of a pathogen to be transmitted from one human or animal to another. The basic reproduction number (R0 or R naught) determines the severity of an epidemic. It indicates the average number of people that will be infected by a single person (“The Source”). Measles and pertussis (whooping cough) have an R0 of around 15 meaning one person can transmit the disease to an average of 15 other persons in a population that has not developed any immunity or has not been vaccinated. It is worth noting that both diseases are spread via airborne transmission. R0 is also a useful measure for explaining how a new, emerging disease spreads in a vulnerable population. If R0 is less than 1 the disease will die out, if it is equal to one the disease will remain stable in a population, and if it is greater than 1 it can cause an outbreak or epidemic. Based on data from early transmission of COVID-19 in an unprotected population in Wuhan, the average R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was estimated to be 2.2

 </sup> A more recent analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak in China during the same time period, using mathematical modeling and including high-resolution domestic travel and infection data, determined R0 for SARS-CoV-2 to be 5.7.

 </sup> This makes COVID-19 a far more contagious disease compared to SARS and MERS. The R0 value for SARS-CoV-1 was estimated to be 3.0

 </sup> and for MERS-CoV 0.45.

 </sup> Seasonal flu, for which herd immunity exists, has an R0 of 1.3. What are the practical implications of R0 values? The higher the R0 value, the faster a disease spreads through the population as the spread is exponential (

  <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>
 </xref>). Once the population approaches saturation, that is, everyone is diseased, the spread levels off. Social distancing can reduce R0 by lowering the probability of person-to-person transmission. Since individuals already shed SARS-CoV-19 viruses before becoming symptomatic, wearing masks to create a barrier and retain droplets should potentially also lower R0. Once vaccines become available, R0 can likely be decreased effectively.
