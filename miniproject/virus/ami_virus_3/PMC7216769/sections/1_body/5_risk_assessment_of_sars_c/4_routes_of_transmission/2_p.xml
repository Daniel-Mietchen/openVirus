<p>Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to occur most commonly in groups sharing close proximity including families and their friends, nursing and hospital environments, and other environments favoring close contact. This suggests that the main mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via droplet transfer by infected individuals during coughing, sneezing, or speaking.

 </sup> However, a study found that, if aerosolized, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for about 3 h in the air suggesting that airborne transmission could be possible.

 </sup> SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in stool, urine, and saliva of infected patients.

 </sup> Furthermore, viral RNA was detectable in fecal samples for 33 days, even after patientsâ€™ respiratory samples had tested negative.

 </sup> This suggests continued viral shedding in feces. Therefore, alternative forms of transmission cannot be excluded, which may have ramifications for closed facilities such as nursing homes, hospitals, and cruise ships. More research on SARS-CoV-2 routes of transmission will inform additional protective measures.
