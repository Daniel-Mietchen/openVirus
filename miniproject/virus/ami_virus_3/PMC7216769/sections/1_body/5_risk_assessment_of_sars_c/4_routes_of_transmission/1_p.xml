<p>COVID-19, SARS, and MERS are aerosol transmissible diseases that are thought to be transmitted via sneezing, coughing, and talking by an infected person. Droplets of various sizes are aerosolized and expelled with potentially great force, which allows them to travel relatively long distances. Larger droplets may be directly deposited to mucous membranes of unlucky bystanders in close proximity (direct contact, droplet transmission). Smaller droplets (&lt;5 Î¼m) can be directly inhaled (airborne transmission). These smaller droplets may remain airborne for hours while larger droplets more rapidly follow a trajectory path down toward a surface. Healthy individuals may become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and subsequently transferring viral particles to their mucous membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth (indirect contact or fomite transmission).</p>
