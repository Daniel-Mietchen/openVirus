<p>A formal risk assessment procedure evaluates multiple aspects of a given pathogen, and how it interacts with the human and the environment. Risk assessments are commonly done in research environments, but they are also critical in public health to assess the dangers a newly emerging disease might pose to the population. Risks for emerging diseases should be evaluated similarly to new chemicals synthesized in drug development. The premise of risk assessment for biological research uses several well-defined criteria, including the pathogen, the human, and the context or environment, which affects policy decision making processes, including healthcare decisions in the public health realm.</p>
