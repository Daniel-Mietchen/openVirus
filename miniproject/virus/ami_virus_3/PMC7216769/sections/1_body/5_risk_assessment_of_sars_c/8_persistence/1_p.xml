<p>Viral persistence without losing viability on solid surfaces or while airborne plays an important role in the spread of pathogens. Both aerosol and fomite transmission were important drivers of superspreading events during the 2002â€“2003 SARS epidemic.

 </sup> A recent study by Doremalen et al. revealed that both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 can remain viable for hours in air and on solid surfaces but decayed exponentially.

 </sup> Under controlled experimental conditions, the median half-life of SARS-CoV-2 small aerosolized particles was 2.7 h in air. SARS-CoV-2 has half-lives on copper, cardboard, steel, and plastic surfaces of 3.4, 8.5, 13.1, and 15.9 h, respectively. The environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1 was overall similar to that of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that virus stability is not the cause for the explosive pandemic spread of COVID-19 as compared to the containable SARS outbreak.
