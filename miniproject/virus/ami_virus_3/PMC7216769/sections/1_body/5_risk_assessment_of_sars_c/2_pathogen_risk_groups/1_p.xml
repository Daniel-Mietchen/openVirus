<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) organize pathogens and toxins produced by certain pathogens into 4 risk groups based on the severity of the disease caused in humans, the adverse effect on the community, and the availability of preventative measures and treatment (

 </sup> The coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and are classified as Risk Group 3 pathogens.

 </sup> Clearly, SARS-CoV-2 carries a very high risk to the community based on the rapid, global spread of the virus and the impact it has on human health and the global economy. Furthermore, to date, no effective treatment nor vaccine exists. The high risk SARS-CoV-2 poses to the community makes this virus comparable to Risk Group 4 pathogens at this time. Since a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been assigned, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed interim guidelines for handling specimens potentially containing the virus in the laboratory.
