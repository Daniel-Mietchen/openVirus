<p>During an epidemic, it is critically important to monitor the spread of the disease agent. One could compare this to monitoring the whereabouts of radioactivity during an experiment or accident with radionuclides to prevent contamination. Testing generates data that informs public health policy makers in implementing administrative controls and then measures the effectiveness of those controls. However, insufficient numbers of tests in the US are currently hampering efforts to detect the spread and thus contain the expansion of COVID-19. An absence of testing could be equated to responding to the Chernobyl outfall hazard without having access to sufficient data from Geiger-Muller counters, and thus no information on the type and extent of exposure.</p>
