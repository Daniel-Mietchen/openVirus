<p>What types of testing are used to monitor the spread of COVID-19? The most commonly used diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 is done by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction). Briefly, viral RNA is first purified from samples, transcribed into DNA which is then amplified in a PCR reaction to achieve easily detectable amounts. In the laboratory, the RNA isolation and the RT-PCR reaction and analysis can be automated, processing 100 or more samples at a time on one machine with a turnaround time of a few hours. Multiply that by several machines per lab and many laboratories per country and, theoretically, this should provide hundreds of thousands of tests per day. But that is not what the current reality looks like. At this time, COVID-19 test availability is limited, and it often takes days to obtain results. What is limiting testing, and why does it take so long to get results? Before answering these questions, let us ask how other countries solve this problem. Recall the images of drive-by testing stations in South Korea? Healthcare personnel fully protected by appropriate PPE (Tyvek suits, respirators, eye or face protection, and gloves) took swabs and personal information from concerned citizens who could then expect the result via text or email message the next day. The testing procedure in South Korea and elsewhere currently relies on the same type of RT-PCR assay. Some countries such as South Korea have more test reagents available to them than other countries because they already produced them and rapidly increased production as soon as they learned of the emergence of COVID-19.

 </sup> As more and more countries dealt with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, the supply of swabs, test reagents, other laboratory supplies, and PPE became limited, and the ability to test for COVID-19 was disrupted. Some companies are already working on offering tests that combine the RNA purification and RT-PCR procedures into one step that can be accomplished by a small portable machine. These quick tests reduce testing time and allow for personalized testing by medical offices affording the price. An effective response to an outbreak would be to ramp up production of all needed materials as soon as there is a threat of a potential pandemic.
