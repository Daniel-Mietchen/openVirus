<p>Other monitoring tests currently in development include human antibody and viral antigen tests. Most infected persons develop antibodies as part of their immune response to most pathogens. These antibodies can be detected with synthetic peptides designed to mimic specific portions of a pathogenâ€™s surface that is exposed to the immune system. Such antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in the serum of previously infected patients. Antibody tests are effective weeks to months to years after an infection depending on the immunity to a given pathogen. They are useful to survey the spread of a disease and provide insight into the scale of an outbreak. The test may also be effective in screening for nonsymptomatic carriers that could be part of a yet unknown transmission chain during an outbreak. Finally, they can be used after the crisis phase passes to better measure the true infection rate. The antigen test works similarly except that antibodies generated against a pathogen are used to directly detect this pathogen in the serum or other bodily fluids of infected patients. Like RT-PCR, this test is a diagnostic test but is less sensitive than the RT-PCR test and is generally applied several days after a patient becomes symptomatic. However, the antigen test is generally less expensive than RT-PCR, administered more conveniently, and has a fast turnaround time.</p>
