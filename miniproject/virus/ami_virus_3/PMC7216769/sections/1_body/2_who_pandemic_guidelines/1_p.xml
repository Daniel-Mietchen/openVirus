 </sup> In their companion document on preparing the whole society for pandemic readiness, they state: “In the absence of early and effective planning, countries may face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of essential services, lower production levels, distribution difficulties, and shortages of supplies. ... The failure of businesses to sustain operations would add to the economic consequences of a pandemic. Some business sectors will be especially vulnerable (e.g., those dependent on tourism and travel) and certain groups in society are likely to suffer more than others.”

 </sup> What was stated in 2009 equally applies to our currently limited global coordination efforts to curb COVID-19. A concerted global effort is needed to contain COVID-19.
