<p>Why do N95 respirators need to be fit-tested and how are they different from standard face masks? N95 respirators filter 95% of all airborne particles if worn correctly. The respirator’s flexible edge is designed to achieve a tight facial fit. Fit-testing determines the correct respirator size and model for the wearer and typically also trains the user in applying the respirator correctly so that the nose and mouth are effectively shielded from nonfiltered air. However, facial hair may not allow a tight seal, enabling infectious particles to be sucked in through the sides (as a point of least resistance).

 </sup> Keeping in mind that the individual’s health is of utmost importance; either facial hair must be removed, or an alternative respirator type should be used when available.
