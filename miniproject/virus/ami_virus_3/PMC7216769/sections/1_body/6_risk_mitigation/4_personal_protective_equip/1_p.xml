<p>While PPE is generally considered to be the last line of defense in laboratory research and high-risk manufacturing industries, it appears that in healthcare environments PPE, when properly used in a patient setting, often serves as the initial barrier between healthcare providers or first responders and patients. This is because there are few or no physical barriers, unlike standard designs in laboratories and production facilities. PPE, therefore, should be given a much higher priority when dealing with infectious diseases equal to engineering controls. The CDC provides strict guidelines for PPE appropriate for hospital personnel treating patients with infectious respiratory diseases such as SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-Cov-2.
