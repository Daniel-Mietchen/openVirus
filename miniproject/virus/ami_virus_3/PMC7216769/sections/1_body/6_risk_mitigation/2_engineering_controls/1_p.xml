<p>Engineering controls provide a physical separation from infected individuals through mechanical means. The most effective examples are physical barriers and ventilation controls such as negative pressure isolation rooms in hospitals. Generally, hospitals do not equip these rooms with HEPA filters. HEPA filters are high-efficiency particulate air filters that retain 0.3 Î¼m particles with 99.97% efficiency. However, general room ventilation was also shown to reduce airborne viral particles load.

 </sup> A study of isolation wards (rooms that can contain several beds and are located away from other hospital rooms) showed a significant correlation between the reduction of healthcare worker infections and increased room ventilation during the 2003 SARS epidemic.

 </sup> Modeling the spread of influenza in schools demonstrated a significant reduction of airborne transmission when room ventilation was increased.

 </sup> While effective room ventilation may not be an option for many schools, even opening windows was shown to significantly increase airflow and consequently decrease respiratory infection rates.

 </sup> Additional engineering controls recommended by Centers for Disease Control (CDC) include physical barriers, partitions, and curtains to separate infected from healthy persons.
