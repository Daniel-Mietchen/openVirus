<p>Another important administrative control is the type of disinfectants to be used against SARS-CoV-2. Because of their phospholipid bilayer, enveloped viruses are highly sensitive to common household cleaners that contain detergent, bleach, or hydrogen peroxide as well as alcohol-based hand sanitizers and soap. These disinfectants dissolve the lipid layer and/or denature viral proteins. Note that, in contrast to sterilization methods, which kill all pathogens, disinfectants greatly reduce the infectious dose by reducing the number of pathogens. A list of disinfectants recommended by the CDC for COVID-19 can be found at their website.
