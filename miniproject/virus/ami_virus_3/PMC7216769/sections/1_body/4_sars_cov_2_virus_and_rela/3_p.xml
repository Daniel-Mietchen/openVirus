<p>Host cell invasion assays revealed that both viruses indeed recognize the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their target cell receptor for subsequent cell entry.

 </sup> ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels where it hydrolyzes the vasoconstriction hormone angiotensin II to angiotensin 1–7. Angiotensin 1–7 acts as a vasodilator, thus increasing blood flow and reducing blood pressure. Those individuals with hypertension are likely familiar with ACE-inhibitors such as lisinopril or the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan that inhibit the production of angiotensin II or block binding of angiotensin II to its receptor proteins, respectively. The expression of ACE2 was found to be increased in response to administration of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and also in response to some anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, potentially providing more opportunities for SARS coronaviruses to enter the cell.

 </sup> However, more research in this area is needed to produce conclusive results. Using a risk benefit approach, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and anti-inflammatory drugs have robust benefits to human health as compared to their risk based on unclear contributions to COVID-19 outcomes.
