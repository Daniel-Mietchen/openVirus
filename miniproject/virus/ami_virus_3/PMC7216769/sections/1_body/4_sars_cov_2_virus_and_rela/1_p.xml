<p>SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 also termed COVID-19. It is an enveloped RNA virus, meaning it stores its genetic information as RNA packaged inside an envelope (see Fehr and Perlman for review on coronaviruses,

 </sup> The envelope is composed of the host cell’s membrane and is decorated with viral proteins. The most prominent of the viral proteins, the spike protein, emanates from the infective virion (virus particle) giving it a crownlike appearance which has given this virus family the name coronaviruses. The spike protein serves to recognize and attach to the host cell’s receptor proteins and facilitates entry into the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus propagates by recruiting the host cell’s enzymes to produce numerous viral precursors. Mature virions are then released from the host cell’s surface by exocytosis.
