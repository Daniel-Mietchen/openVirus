<p>The RNA sequence of SARS-CoV-2 became available in early January 2020 and revealed several important facts.

 </sup> First, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus very closely related to two coronaviruses found in Chinese bats (&gt;99% and 98% sequence identity).

 </sup> This finding explains why scientists believe that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a bat virus. Second, it is also related to SARS-CoV-1 (about 79%), which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002, and more distantly to MERS-CoV (about 50%), which caused the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012.

 </sup> Third, RNA sequence comparison and protein modeling found that the domain of the spike protein that attaches the virus to the host cell receptor does so in a manner similar to that of SARS-CoV-1.
