<p>It is only a matter of time for new diseases to emerge or reemerge and cause pandemics. It would appear that coronavirus-associated diseases have been underestimated thus far, and the time since the SARS and MERS outbreaks was not used effectively to develop infrastructure to rapidly mobilize diagnostic tests, vaccinations, antiviral therapies, and policies to control outbreaks and to coordinate healthcare systems worldwide. Countries are struggling to save lives while attempting to limit damage to their economies in order to preempt a potential local and worldwide recession. What will be the lessons learned from COVID-19 that will convince policy makers to treat the next emerging disease with scientific rationale? Risk assessment for emerging hazards is essential to employ optimal engineering and administrative controls and inform appropriate PPE decisions. Constant surveillance is essential for the detection of emerging diseases and their containment by contact tracing and social isolation. The same risk assessment principles for work with hazardous chemicals, radioactivity, or encounters apply to newly emerging diseases:
