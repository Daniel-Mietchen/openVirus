<p>All influenza and coronavirus outbreaks have two factors in common: (a) human proximity to farm and wildlife animals that facilitates interspecies transmission and emergence of disease in humans, and (b) global travel. However, several factors set the COVID-19 pandemic apart from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. These include the high infectivity as indicated by a recently estimated R0 of 5.7 for SARS-CoV-2, peaking of viral shedding before the onset of symptoms, and a large population of asymptomatic carriers still capable of infecting others. Thus, COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that can easily spread undetected in a society with high population density and mobility.</p>
