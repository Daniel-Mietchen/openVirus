China, in December 2019. The disease is caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which is
related to the viruses that cause SARS and MERS. While the case fatality ratio for
COVID-19 (5%) is far lower than that for SARS (11%) and MERS (34%), COVID-19 is
spreading relatively uncontrolled at this time across the globe. In contrast, SARS
appears to be contained, and MERS is controlled. This paper will explore why COVID-19 is
able to progress to a global pandemic that affects our daily lives to an extent not
known in recent history. The COVID-19 outbreak and spread will be examined based on the
current literature, using a researcher&#x02019;s perspective of risk assessment and risk
mitigation; this approach will be related to public health.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>SARS-CoV-2</kwd><kwd>risk assessment</kwd><kwd>risk mitigation</kwd><kwd>pandemic</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>hs0c00035</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>hs0c00035</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>ccc-price</meta-name><meta-value/></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The first cases of COVID-19 became known in mid to late December when a clustering of
patients with unusually severe respiratory disease was noticed in Wuhan, the capital of
China&#x02019;s Hubei province, a city with roughly 11 million inhabitants. On December 31,
2019, China informed the World Health Organization (WHO), and the world took notice for the
first time. While the Chinese government began to take restrictive actions to curb the
spread of the virus, most people in the rest of the world did not comprehend then that this
disease would change our daily lives as we know it. One might compare the onset of the
COVID-19 outbreak with a looming storm and our inability to predict the extent of the
storm&#x02019;s severity despite available data. Four months later, by the time this Review
was written, COVID-19 was rapidly spreading out of control with alarming death rates
worldwide. The outbreak has led to a global health and economic crisis with countries
closing their borders and issuing travel bans, shuttering their schools and businesses,
imposing strict quarantines, and more. In short, COVID-19 has posed severe economic strain
on the world&#x02019;s economy. Furthermore, life-saving supplies and hospital beds are
already limiting in most countries. What causes COVID-19, and why is this outbreak so
different from other outbreaks such as SARS and MERS? In addition, why is the COVID-19
disease so difficult to contain?</p><p>This paper will address these questions using a risk assessment approach normally used by
scientists working with pathogenic organisms or biohazardous materials and apply this
approach to public health. Lessons learned from the SARS epidemic and guidelines for
pandemics will be reviewed. Why are we so unprepared? In essence, the current COVID-19
pandemic appears to be an ongoing experiment on mitigating practices of a global emergency
with broad implications for future health crises.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Lessons Learned from SARS</title><p>A coordinated multinational effort was able to contain the 2002 SARS pandemic that had
spread to 26 countries. The global cost of SARS associated with economic losses was
estimated at $54 billion.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref></sup> The following summarizes the lessons learned

readiness, they state: &#x0201c;In the absence of early and effective planning, countries may
face wider social and economic disruption, significant threats to the continuity of
essential services, lower production levels, distribution difficulties, and shortages of
supplies. ... The failure of businesses to sustain operations would add to the economic
consequences of a pandemic. Some business sectors will be especially vulnerable (e.g., those
dependent on tourism and travel) and certain groups in society are likely to suffer more
than others.&#x0201d;<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref></sup> What was stated in 2009 equally applies to our
currently limited global coordination efforts to curb COVID-19. A concerted global effort is
needed to contain COVID-19.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Pandemics and Emerging Diseases</title><p>By definition, a pandemic is a disease that has spread from its country of origin, where it
is considered an epidemic, to other countries worldwide. The World Health Organization (WHO)
considers a pandemic a global illness caused by a new virus. As such, seasonal flu, which is
caused by several influenza viruses having caused outbreaks previously, including those
listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>, is not considered a pandemic
disease. <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> lists some of the major emerging
and re-emerging epidemics and pandemics in the 20th and 21st centuries to illustrate the
constant threat that these types of diseases pose to the global population. It should be
pointed out that the 1918 Influenza pandemic also known as the Spanish flu occurred before
the discovery of antibiotics, and many deaths are now attributed to secondary bacterial
infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref></sup> Improvements in healthcare and the development of
life-saving procedures and vaccinations have greatly reduced the number and outcomes of flu
pandemics. Furthermore, epidemiological studies have provided guidance on how to limit the
expansion of new diseases into pandemics.</p><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Recent Pandemic and Major Pandemic-Prone Emerging Diseases</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="0"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border:none;" align="center">disease</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">pathogen</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">worldwide infected</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">worldwide deaths</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">case fatality ratio<xref rid="t1fn1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">1918&#x000a0;Influenza&#x000a0;pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Influenza&#x000a0;A (H1N1)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">500&#x000a0;million</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x0003e;17.4&#x000a0;million (1%<xref rid="t1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref>)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x0003e;2.5%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">1957&#x000a0;Influenza&#x000a0;pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Influenza&#x000a0;A (H2N2)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">unknown</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">1.1&#x000a0;million (0.004%<xref rid="t1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref>)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x0003c;0.1%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">1968&#x000a0;Influenza&#x000a0;pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Influenza&#x000a0;A (H3N2)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">unknown</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">1&#x000a0;million (0.03%<xref rid="t1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref>)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">&#x0003c;0.5%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">1981&#x000a0;HIV/AIDS&#x000a0;pandemic<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">HIV</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">75&#x000a0;million</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">32 million</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">100%<xref rid="t1fn3" ref-type="table-fn">c</xref><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></sup></td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">2002&#x000a0;SARS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">SARS-CoV-1</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">8422</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">916</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">11%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">2009&#x000a0;Swine&#x000a0;Flu<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Influenza&#x000a0;A (H1N1) pdm09</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">unknown</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">151&#x0202f;700&#x02013;575&#x0202f;400 (0.001&#x02013;0.007%<xref rid="t1fn2" ref-type="table-fn">b</xref>)</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">0.1&#x02013;5%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">2012&#x000a0;MERS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">MERS-CoV</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">2494</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">11&#x0202f;325</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">34%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">2014&#x000a0;Ebola<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Ebola virus</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">28&#x0202f;652</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">13&#x0202f;562</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">40%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">2018&#x000a0;Ebola<xref rid="t1fn4" ref-type="table-fn">d</xref><sup>,</sup><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref></sup></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Ebola virus</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">3461</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">2279</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">66%</td></tr><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">2019&#x000a0;COVID-19<xref rid="t1fn5" ref-type="table-fn">e</xref></td><td style="border:none;" align="left">SARS-CoV-2</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">2&#x0202f;714&#x0202f;942</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">190&#x0202f;395</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">7%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="t1fn1"><label>a</label><p>Case fatality ratio (CFR) is the number of deaths/confirmed total cases.</p></fn><fn id="t1fn2"><label>b</label><p>Estimated percentage of world population.</p></fn><fn id="t1fn3"><label>c</label><p>If untreated;

It
is an enveloped RNA virus, meaning it stores its genetic information as RNA packaged inside
an envelope (see Fehr and Perlman for review on coronaviruses, <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> The envelope is composed of the host
cell&#x02019;s membrane and is decorated with viral proteins. The most prominent of the viral
proteins, the spike protein, emanates from the infective virion (virus particle) giving it a
crownlike appearance which has given this virus family the name coronaviruses. The spike
protein serves to recognize and attach to the host cell&#x02019;s receptor proteins and
facilitates entry into the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus propagates by recruiting
the host cell&#x02019;s enzymes to produce numerous viral precursors. Mature virions are then
released from the host cell&#x02019;s surface by exocytosis.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic diagram of SARS-CoV-2. The virus consists of a phospholipid-bilayer, or

important facts.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref></sup>
First, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus very closely related to two coronaviruses found in
Chinese bats (&#x0003e;99% and 98% sequence identity).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> This finding explains
why scientists believe that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a bat virus. Second, it is also
related to SARS-CoV-1 (about 79%), which caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)
outbreak in 2002, and more distantly to MERS-CoV (about 50%), which caused the Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in 2012.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup> Third, RNA sequence
comparison and protein modeling found that the domain of the spike protein that attaches the
virus to the host cell receptor does so in a manner similar to that of SARS-CoV-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref></sup></p><p>Host cell invasion assays revealed that both viruses indeed recognize the human
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their target cell receptor for subsequent cell
entry.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref></sup> ACE2 is expressed by epithelial cells of the lung, intestine,
kidney, and blood vessels where it hydrolyzes the vasoconstriction hormone angiotensin II to
angiotensin 1&#x02013;7. Angiotensin 1&#x02013;7 acts as a vasodilator, thus increasing blood
flow and reducing blood pressure. Those individuals with hypertension are likely familiar
with ACE-inhibitors such as lisinopril or the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan that
inhibit the production of angiotensin II or block binding of angiotensin II to its receptor
proteins, respectively. The expression of ACE2 was found to be increased in response to
administration of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and also in response to
some anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, potentially providing more opportunities for
SARS coronaviruses to enter the cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref></sup> However, more
research in this area is needed to produce conclusive results. Using a risk benefit
approach, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and anti-inflammatory drugs have
robust benefits to human health as compared to their risk based on unclear contributions to
COVID-19 outcomes.</p><p>Not all human coronaviruses have severe outcomes. Besides the three shown in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> that cause severe respiratory syndrome, four
additional human coronaviruses are known,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> coronaviruses 229E, NL63,
OC43, and HKU1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref></sup> All are endemic globally and cause 10&#x02013;30% of the
upper respiratory tract illnesses like the common cold.</p><p>In addition to the human coronaviruses, hundreds of animal coronavirus variants exist with
the greatest diversity observed in bats. Coronaviruses cause a variety of different diseases
including enteritis in cows and pigs and upper respiratory disease in chickens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref></sup> Although these viruses rarely crossover to humans, occasional infections may
occur if both share the same environment, for example, a farmer and their livestock.</p></sec><sec id="sec6"><title>Risk Assessment of SARS-CoV-2</title><p>A formal risk assessment procedure evaluates multiple aspects of a given pathogen, and how
it interacts with the human and the environment. Risk assessments are commonly done in
research environments, but they are also critical in public health to assess the dangers a
newly emerging disease might pose to the population. Risks for emerging diseases should be
evaluated similarly to new chemicals synthesized in drug development. The premise of risk
assessment for biological research uses several well-defined criteria, including the
pathogen, the human, and the context or environment, which affects policy decision making
processes, including healthcare decisions in the public health realm.</p><sec id="sec6.1"><title>Pathogen Risk Groups</title><p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) organize
pathogens and toxins produced by certain pathogens into 4 risk groups based on the
severity of the disease caused in humans, the adverse effect on the community, and the
availability of preventative measures and treatment (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="other">2</xref></xref>).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup> The coronaviruses MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1 and are classified as Risk
Group 3 pathogens.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref></sup> Clearly, SARS-CoV-2 carries a very high risk to
the community based on the rapid, global spread of the virus and the impact it has on
human health and the global economy. Furthermore, to date, no effective treatment nor
vaccine exists. The high risk SARS-CoV-2 poses to the community makes this virus
comparable to Risk Group 4 pathogens at this time. Since a risk group for SARS-CoV-2 has
not yet been assigned, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) developed interim
guidelines for handling specimens potentially containing the virus in the
laboratory.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref></sup></p><table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Risk Group Assignments According to the NIH Guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref></sup><xref rid="tbl2-fn1" ref-type="table-fn">a</xref></title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="0"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead><tr><th style="border:none;" align="center">risk group</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">definition</th><th style="border:none;" align="center">examples</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style="border:none;" align="left">1</td><td style="border:none;" align="left">Agents that are not associated with disease in healthy adult humans.

hosts can be infected. How can a bat virus evolve into a human pathogen that creates a
disease of such global dimensions? The answer to this question lies in a characteristic
viral feature, the rapid viral genome mutation rate which then results in a variety of
viral descendants with altered proteins responsible for attaching to and entering host
cells of different animal species, including humans. RNA viruses such as the coronaviruses
exhibit especially high mutation rates that allow rapid diversification at the cost of
generating nonviable descendants.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref></sup> Viral adaptation to new hosts is
driven entirely by stochastic mutations and a stochastic, hit or miss host encounter.
Expanding a viral host range creates additional reservoirs and is thus of evolutionary
advantage to the virus. The spike protein is an important target for evolutionary changes
as it allows recognition of different host cell target proteins, not only between
different host species but also between different tissues within one host
(tropism).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref></sup> Dispersion as aerosolized particles to different species
is especially efficient in creating new reservoirs of animals by mutated coronaviruses
that can eventually reach a human host. As the virus is spreading across the world, it has
already begun to mutate leaving a possibility for a recurrence of a SARS-CoV-2
variant.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref></sup> More
research will reveal the consequences of SARS-CoV-2 variants on host range and
tropism.</p><p>The hallmark of an emerging contagious disease is that it is not previously known to
exist in humans but has now acquired the ability to spread from human to human. Diseases
crossing the animal&#x02013;human barrier are referred to as zoonotic diseases. Often
peridomestic animals or wildlife serves as intermediate stable reservoirs increasing the
opportunity of the virus to inadvertently infect humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> For MERS, camels were suggested as the intermediate reservoir.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref></sup> COVID-19 spread from a Chinese seafood marketplace also selling live
chicken and rabbits,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref></sup> and SARS is thought to have originated from palm
civets, exotic cats sold at Chinese marketplaces.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref></sup> The exact
intermediary animal for both SARS coronaviruses will become known once more viral
sequences from various animal sources become available. This raises the question whether
COVID-19 could spread from humans to domestic animals including pets and eventually
wildlife, thus creating new reservoirs in countries without previous animal reservoirs. As
of recently, there is evidence of inadvertent human to dog and cat (domestic and tiger)
transmission of SARS-CoV-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref></sup> In laboratory settings, cats as well as
ferrets were also able to transmit the SARS-CoV-2 virus to their kind suggesting that cats
and ferrets represent at least two new potential animal reservoirs in countries outside
China. More research will examine whether either animal species can transmit the virus
back to humans.</p><p>Interestingly, all viruses listed in <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref> are
RNA enveloped viruses and originated either in bats (i.e., coronaviruses, ebolavirus, and
also zika virus not included in the table) or in birds or other animals (i.e., influenza
viruses). An exception is HIV, which is thought to have originated in primates.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.3"><title>Routes of Transmission</title><p>COVID-19, SARS, and MERS are aerosol transmissible diseases that are thought to be
transmitted via sneezing, coughing, and talking by an infected person. Droplets of various
sizes are aerosolized and expelled with potentially great force, which allows them to
travel relatively long distances. Larger droplets may be directly deposited to mucous
membranes of unlucky bystanders in close proximity (direct contact, droplet transmission).
Smaller droplets (&#x0003c;5 &#x003bc;m) can be directly inhaled (airborne transmission). These
smaller droplets may remain airborne for hours while larger droplets more rapidly follow a
trajectory path down toward a surface. Healthy individuals may become infected by touching
contaminated surfaces and subsequently transferring viral particles to their mucous
membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth (indirect contact or fomite transmission).</p><p>Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 appears to occur most commonly in groups
sharing close proximity including families and their friends, nursing and hospital
environments, and other environments favoring close contact. This suggests that the main
mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is via droplet transfer by infected individuals during
coughing, sneezing, or speaking.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> However, a study found that, if
aerosolized, SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for about 3 h in the air suggesting that airborne
transmission could be possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> SARS-CoV-2 RNA was also detected in
stool, urine, and saliva of infected patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref></sup> Furthermore, viral RNA
was detectable in fecal samples for 33 days, even after patients&#x02019; respiratory
samples had tested negative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref></sup> This suggests continued viral shedding
in feces. Therefore, alternative forms of transmission cannot be excluded, which may have
ramifications for closed facilities such as nursing homes, hospitals, and cruise ships.
More research on SARS-CoV-2 routes of transmission will inform additional protective
measures.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.4"><title>Infectious Dose</title><p>The infectious dose is an important factor in assessing the ability of a pathogen to
establish a successful infection in its host. It is expressed as ID<sub>50</sub> and
refers to the number of pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, that is sufficient to
infect 50% of a given susceptible population. Some pathogens have lower infectious doses
than others. For influenza, a high infectious dose appears to correlate with a more severe
disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref></sup> The infectious dose for SARS-CoV-2 is currently not known.
A study by Watabanbe et al. used animal studies and modeling of SARS spreading in an
apartment complex in China to estimate the infectious dose for SARS-Cov-1 to be 280 viral
particles to cause disease in 50% of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> This
ID<sub>50</sub> is similar to values determined for the human common cold coronaviruses
and some animal coronaviruses belonging to the same genetic group as SARS-CoV-1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref></sup> Exact infectious dose estimations for human pathogens are difficult to
obtain since human volunteer studies are rare. One such study for the Influenza A virus
determined the ID<sub>50</sub> to be 790 viral particles when administered intranasally.
However, infection via aerosolization of Influenza A is believed to be much lower.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref></sup> This suggests that the infectious doses for the human coronaviruses and
Influenza A are in about the same range. In contrast, the ID<sub>50</sub> of
<italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> is 10 bacteria by inhalation, which is far
lower. How many SARS-CoV-2 viruses are expelled when people cough? The answer to this
question is not yet known. However, viral shedding from the respiratory tract begins 2.5
days before the onset of symptoms and peaks already 0.6 day, on the average,
<italic>before</italic> the onset of symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref></sup> The authors
speculate that 44% of transmission could already occur before people become aware of
carrying the disease. Presymptomatic virus shedding is thus likely a major contributor to
global COVID-19 spreading as it occurs undetected under the current limited testing
practice. In contrast, SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV virus shedding from the respiratory tract
begins at the onset of symptoms, and infectivity is greatest in the second week of
illness.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref></sup> Thus,
both of these diseases are easier to trace.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.5"><title>Communicability</title><p>Communicability of a disease is another measure to determine the capability of a pathogen
to be transmitted from one human or animal to another. The basic reproduction number (R0
or R naught) determines the severity of an epidemic. It indicates the average number of
people that will be infected by a single person (&#x0201c;The Source&#x0201d;). Measles and
pertussis (whooping cough) have an R0 of around 15 meaning one person can transmit the
disease to an average of 15 other persons in a population that has not developed any
immunity or has not been vaccinated. It is worth noting that both diseases are spread via
airborne transmission. R0 is also a useful measure for explaining how a new, emerging
disease spreads in a vulnerable population. If R0 is less than 1 the disease will die out,
if it is equal to one the disease will remain stable in a population, and if it is greater
than 1 it can cause an outbreak or epidemic. Based on data from early transmission of
COVID-19 in an unprotected population in Wuhan, the average R0 for SARS-CoV-2 was
estimated to be 2.2<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref></sup> but other studies suggest a higher R0
value.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref48">48</xref></sup> A more recent analysis of the COVID-19 outbreak in China
during the same time period, using mathematical modeling and including high-resolution
domestic travel and infection data, determined R0 for SARS-CoV-2 to be 5.7.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref49">49</xref></sup> This makes COVID-19 a far more contagious disease compared to SARS and
MERS. The R0 value for SARS-CoV-1 was estimated to be 3.0<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref50">50</xref></sup> and for
MERS-CoV 0.45.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref></sup> Seasonal flu, for which herd immunity exists, has an
R0 of 1.3. What are the practical implications of R0 values? The higher the R0 value, the
faster a disease spreads through the population as the spread is exponential (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref></xref>). Once the population approaches saturation,
that is, everyone is diseased, the spread levels off. Social distancing can reduce R0 by
lowering the probability of person-to-person transmission. Since individuals already shed
SARS-CoV-19 viruses before becoming symptomatic, wearing masks to create a barrier and
retain droplets should potentially also lower R0. Once vaccines become available, R0 can
likely be decreased effectively.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Exponential spread of emerging and re-emerging diseases based on their R0 values. The
higher the R0 value, the faster a disease spreads through a population that has not

to become more or less efficient in establishing an infection, resulting in a higher or
lower R0, respectively. In addition, some infected individuals participate in
superspreading events where excessive disease spreading is traced to a single person, who
is also called a superspreader (reviewed by Stein 2011).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> Well
documented in the news is a woman in Korea traveling home from Wuhan and infecting 37
members during one large church event, who then went on to spread the disease to hundreds
of other church members within a short period of time. At a birthday party in the US one
person already ill with COVID-19 infected approximately 50 partygoers who subsequently
scattered to different states in the US and traveled abroad infecting many people in their
path.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref53">53</xref></sup> Other documented cases of superspreader events are known for
MERS and SARS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> A MERS superspreading event played a significant role
in the outbreak of MERS in Korea in 2015. A businessman returning from the Middle East was
treated at a hospital from which the disease was spread to other hospitals to which
patients were transferred where MERS then became a nosocomial disease (that is, a disease
originating in a hospital). Because of the superspreading hospital events, the R0 value
for MERS was increased to 8.1.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref54">54</xref></sup> In any case, whether it is the
physiological nature of a certain individual or their social practices, superspreading
events play a significant role in spreading emerging diseases. Examples of social
gatherings that could become superspreading events contributing to rapid disease spread
include major holidays that involve traveling such as the Chinese New Year, Thanksgiving,
school or college holidays, and major gatherings such as sports events and concerts,
etc.</p><p>An additional important question is whether SARS-CoV-2 is present in asymptomatic
persons, and if so, can these individuals transmit the virus? An analysis of the COVID-19
outbreak on the cruise ship Princess Diamond in Yokohama, Japan, showed that, of the 634
persons who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, 50.5% had no significant symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref></sup> Using mathematical modeling, Li et al. examined the spread of COVID-19 in
375 Chinese cities during January 10&#x02013;23, 2020.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup> This was a time
period of extensive travel due to the Chinese Spring Festival, and before the Chinese
Government implemented travel restrictions to curb the spread of the disease. The authors
concluded that 86% of all infections were not documented during this time period because
infected individuals displayed mild, limited, or no symptoms. While the infected but
asymptomatic population was estimated to be less contagious, they were responsible for 79%
of the symptomatic COVID-19 documented cases during that time period.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref56">56</xref></sup>
Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 transmission by asymptomatic or individuals with mild symptoms is a
major contributor to the rapid global spread of COVID-19. In contrast, asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-1 made up 7.5% of a healthcare worker population before infection control
measures were implemented,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref57">57</xref></sup> and the latest WHO estimation indicates
that 10% of a MERS positive population is asymptomatic or has mild symptoms.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref58">58</xref></sup> It is unclear to date whether SARS and MERS asymptomatic individuals can
transmit the disease.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.6"><title>Case Fatality Ratio</title><p>The case fatality ratio (CFR, also called case fatality rate) is the ratio of deaths per
total confirmed infected cases. It plays a significant role in assessing the severity of a
disease. The case fatality ratio of COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.6% in China and 15.2%
outside of China.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref59">59</xref></sup> The high percentage of deaths was speculated to be
due to the breakdown of the healthcare system, i.e., their inability to optimally treat
seriously ill patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref60">60</xref></sup> Furthermore, incomplete testing could
contribute to high CFRs if the population of COVID-19 infected individuals is
substantially larger than the cases confirmed by laboratory testing. Using the WHO
estimate calculated from the ratio of death cases per total laboratory-confirmed positive
cases, the CFR for COVID-19 is estimated worldwide to be 7.0% (as of 4/22/2020), which
compares with 11% for SARS and 34% for MERS (<xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">Table <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="other">1</xref></xref>). Analysis of the current CFRs by country illuminates significant differences
in CFR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). Certain countries such as
France, UK, Italy, Sweden, and Spain have substantially higher CFRs than other countries.
In addition, CFRs in one country can increase over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>B). Factors underlying high CFRs are under investigation, but the
availability of an effective healthcare system may play a major role in curtailing the CFR
within a country. This can occur when the total number of cases increases sufficiently to
overwhelm the available hospital capacities for critical care. In particular, countries
with less developed healthcare structures will be expected to have high CFRs. In a global
pandemic, other communities/countries need to step up in order to provide critical
life-saving support.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Case fatality ratios (CFRs) for COVID-19 by select countries as of April 22, 2020.
Data were obtained from Worldometer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> The case fatality ratio was
calculated as the ratio of total deaths per total number of laboratory confirmed
cases. Dependent on the country both numbers can be underestimated. COVID-19 cases
were normalized to total cases/1 million population. (A) The graph illustrates that
CFR is not a constant; some countries have a low percentage CFR in relation to a high
number of cases, while other countries have a high CFR as compared to their total
number of cases. (B) As shown here for the US, the CFR of a country can change within
a relatively short period of time as the number of cases increases. This could be due
to an overwhelmed healthcare system where personnel, hospital beds, and life-saving
supplies become limiting.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="hs0c00035_0003" id="gr3" position="float"/></fig><p>CFRs are also strongly influenced by underlying diseases and ages of infected patients.
Older patients are exceedingly more prone to die of COVID-19 probably because of a
diminished immune system and additional comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease,
diabetes, hypertension, and cancer.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref61">61</xref></sup> Conclusions might still be too
early, and more research will provide better insight into factors contributing to COVID-19
morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec id="sec6.7"><title>Persistence</title><p>Viral persistence without losing viability on solid surfaces or while airborne plays an
important role in the spread of pathogens. Both aerosol and fomite transmission were
important drivers of superspreading events during the 2002&#x02013;2003 SARS
epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref52">52</xref></sup> A recent study by Doremalen et al. revealed that both
SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 can remain viable for hours in air and on solid surfaces but
decayed exponentially.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup> Under controlled experimental conditions, the
median half-life of SARS-CoV-2 small aerosolized particles was 2.7 h in air. SARS-CoV-2
has half-lives on copper, cardboard, steel, and plastic surfaces of 3.4, 8.5, 13.1, and
15.9 h, respectively. The environmental stability of SARS-CoV-1 was overall similar to
that of SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that virus stability is not the cause for the explosive
pandemic spread of COVID-19 as compared to the containable SARS outbreak.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref></sup></p><p>What is known about the environmental stability of other enveloped viruses? Because of
their lipid membrane, enveloped viruses are generally more prone to desiccation and
inactivation than nonenveloped viruses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref63">63</xref></sup> Once the envelope is
disrupted, the virus loses its viability.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec7"><title>Risk Mitigation</title><p>What are effective risk mitigation practices for emerging diseases? In laboratory research
and high-risk manufacturing environments, risk mitigation relies on multiple safety measures
including engineering controls to establish barriers between the hazard and humans,
administrative controls that guide best practices for handling hazards, and personal
protective equipment (PPE) considered to be the personal protection of last resort when
engineering or administrative control measures fail. When working with radioactivity the
ALARA principle is applied, which means to keep the exposure <italic>A</italic>s
<italic>L</italic>ow <italic>A</italic>s <italic>R</italic>easonably
<italic>A</italic>chievable. Redundant measures are operationalized in healthcare settings
and could be expanded to the larger public health community.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref64">64</xref></sup> However,
this requires commitment from organizational leadership and appropriate resources for it to
work well.</p><sec id="sec7.1"><title>Engineering Controls</title><p>Engineering controls provide a physical separation from infected individuals through
mechanical means. The most effective examples are physical barriers and ventilation
controls such as negative pressure isolation rooms in hospitals. Generally, hospitals do
not equip these rooms with HEPA filters. HEPA filters are high-efficiency particulate air
filters that retain 0.3 &#x003bc;m particles with 99.97% efficiency. However, general room
ventilation was also shown to reduce airborne viral particles load.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> A
study of isolation wards (rooms that can contain several beds and are located away from
other hospital rooms) showed a significant correlation between the reduction of healthcare
worker infections and increased room ventilation during the 2003 SARS epidemic.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref65">65</xref></sup> Modeling the spread of influenza in schools demonstrated a significant
reduction of airborne transmission when room ventilation was
increased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref67">67</xref></sup>
While effective room ventilation may not be an option for many schools, even opening
windows was shown to significantly increase airflow and consequently decrease respiratory
infection rates.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref68">68</xref></sup> Additional engineering controls recommended by
Centers for Disease Control (CDC) include physical barriers, partitions, and curtains to
separate infected from healthy persons.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec7.2"><title>Administrative Controls</title><p>Administrative controls guide&#x02014;among other work practice controls&#x02014;training
and best practices including decontamination methods to prevent exposure to respiratory
diseases. In addition, policies should direct a medical surveillance plan for healthcare
workers and first responders, logistics for acquiring and storing needed materials
required during an outbreak, and logistics for managing needed personnel. While this paper
is not meant to detail all appropriate administrative controls needed for public health
during a disease outbreak, two points should be emphasized. First, in the context of
emerging diseases, administrative controls must optimally be put into place in
anticipation of an outbreak or a pandemic rather than after a disease has already become
established. Lessons learned from the SARS pandemic provide ample information for helping
design administrative controls leaving sufficient flexibility for adaptation to different
pathogens and regional needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> Second, the importance of personnel
training cannot be emphasized enough. Even if sufficient PPE is available it becomes
useless if personnel are not trained in proper donning and doffing procedures. Improper
PPE use was likely a contributing factor in superspreading hospital events during the SARS
and MERS outbreaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref></sup> In the 2003 SARS epidemic 20.5% of all healthcare providers treating
SARS patients in Hong Kong hospitals became infected, and 36.7% in a Canadian hospital
episode.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref69">69</xref></sup> The incorrect removal of PPE, for example, gloves, not
only endangers hospital personnel and first responders and their patients but also plays a
role in spreading disease in other facilities such as nursing homes, airports, and grocery
stores. Thus, instead of offering protection, PPE without guided training can instill a
false sense of security and accomplish the opposite, the expansion of an outbreak.</p><p>Another important administrative control is the type of disinfectants to be used against
SARS-CoV-2. Because of their phospholipid bilayer, enveloped viruses are highly sensitive
to common household cleaners that contain detergent, bleach, or hydrogen peroxide as well
as alcohol-based hand sanitizers and soap. These disinfectants dissolve the lipid layer
and/or denature viral proteins. Note that, in contrast to sterilization methods, which
kill all pathogens, disinfectants greatly reduce the infectious dose by reducing the
number of pathogens. A list of disinfectants recommended by the CDC for COVID-19 can be
found at their website.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref70">70</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="sec7.3"><title>Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)</title><p>While PPE is generally considered to be the last line of defense in laboratory research
and high-risk manufacturing industries, it appears that in healthcare environments PPE,
when properly used in a patient setting, often serves as the initial barrier between
healthcare providers or first responders and patients. This is because there are few or no
physical barriers, unlike standard designs in laboratories and production facilities. PPE,
therefore, should be given a much higher priority when dealing with infectious diseases
equal to engineering controls. The CDC provides strict guidelines for PPE appropriate for
hospital personnel treating patients with infectious respiratory diseases such as
SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-Cov-2.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref></sup> Included are disposable gowns, fit-tested
N95 respirators or PAPRs (battery-powered air-purifying respirators), face shields or eye
protection, and disposable gloves.</p><p>Why do N95 respirators need to be fit-tested and how are they different from standard
face masks? N95 respirators filter 95% of all airborne particles if worn correctly. The
respirator&#x02019;s flexible edge is designed to achieve a tight facial fit. Fit-testing
determines the correct respirator size and model for the wearer and typically also trains
the user in applying the respirator correctly so that the nose and mouth are effectively
shielded from nonfiltered air. However, facial hair may not allow a tight seal, enabling
infectious particles to be sucked in through the sides (as a point of least
resistance).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref71">71</xref></sup> Keeping in mind that the individual&#x02019;s health is
of utmost importance; either facial hair must be removed, or an alternative respirator
type should be used when available.</p><p>Face masks, in contrast, do not act as filters for airborne pathogens. Rather, they act
as splash or spray barriers. For this reason, face masks are provided to infected persons
as a barrier to dispersal of droplets generated by them. More information on respirators
and masks can be found at the CDC.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref72">72</xref></sup></p></sec></sec><sec id="sec8"><title>Testing for SARS-CoV-2</title><p>During an epidemic, it is critically important to monitor the spread of the disease agent.
One could compare this to monitoring the whereabouts of radioactivity during an experiment
or accident with radionuclides to prevent contamination. Testing generates data that informs
public health policy makers in implementing administrative controls and then measures the
effectiveness of those controls. However, insufficient numbers of tests in the US are
currently hampering efforts to detect the spread and thus contain the expansion of COVID-19.
An absence of testing could be equated to responding to the Chernobyl outfall hazard without
having access to sufficient data from Geiger-Muller counters, and thus no information on the
type and extent of exposure.</p><p>What types of testing are used to monitor the spread of COVID-19? The most commonly used
diagnostic test for SARS-CoV-2 is done by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction). Briefly, viral RNA is first purified from samples, transcribed into DNA which is
then amplified in a PCR reaction to achieve easily detectable amounts. In the laboratory,
the RNA isolation and the RT-PCR reaction and analysis can be automated, processing 100 or
more samples at a time on one machine with a turnaround time of a few hours. Multiply that
by several machines per lab and many laboratories per country and, theoretically, this
should provide hundreds of thousands of tests per day. But that is not what the current
reality looks like. At this time, COVID-19 test availability is limited, and it often takes
days to obtain results. What is limiting testing, and why does it take so long to get
results? Before answering these questions, let us ask how other countries solve this
problem. Recall the images of drive-by testing stations in South Korea? Healthcare personnel
fully protected by appropriate PPE (Tyvek suits, respirators, eye or face protection, and
gloves) took swabs and personal information from concerned citizens who could then expect
the result via text or email message the next day. The testing procedure in South Korea and
elsewhere currently relies on the same type of RT-PCR assay. Some countries such as South
Korea have more test reagents available to them than other countries because they already
produced them and rapidly increased production as soon as they learned of the emergence of
COVID-19.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> Other countries had to import them.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref73">73</xref></sup> As
more and more countries dealt with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, the supply of
swabs, test reagents, other laboratory supplies, and PPE became limited, and the ability to
test for COVID-19 was disrupted. Some companies are already working on offering tests that
combine the RNA purification and RT-PCR procedures into one step that can be accomplished by
a small portable machine. These quick tests reduce testing time and allow for personalized
testing by medical offices affording the price. An effective response to an outbreak would
be to ramp up production of all needed materials as soon as there is a threat of a potential
pandemic.</p><p>As of April 22, the testing density of populations ranges from 1.4% in the US to 1.6% in
Canada, 0.9% in the UK, 2.6% in Italy, and 1.1% in South Korea.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> Early
testing in South Korea guided immediate social isolation approaches, in accordance with the
SARS lessons learned,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref></sup> and likely contributed to a lower CFR as compared
to other countries (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figure <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref></xref>A). Note that no
country has yet been able to test 10% of its total population for COVID-19 with the
exception of Iceland.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref62">62</xref></sup> Increased levels of testing would be ideal, as it
better informs healthcare planning, treatment, and quarantine measures. The combination of
testing, extensive contact tracing, and follow-up controls such as quarantine was effective
in controlling the SARS, MERS, and other outbreaks.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref74">74</xref></sup></p><p>Other monitoring tests currently in development include human antibody and viral antigen
tests. Most infected persons develop antibodies as part of their immune response to most
pathogens. These antibodies can be detected with synthetic peptides designed to mimic
specific portions of a pathogen&#x02019;s surface that is exposed to the immune system. Such
antibody tests are available to detect SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV in the serum of previously
infected patients. Antibody tests are effective weeks to months to years after an infection
depending on the immunity to a given pathogen. They are useful to survey the spread of a
disease and provide insight into the scale of an outbreak. The test may also be effective in
screening for nonsymptomatic carriers that could be part of a yet unknown transmission chain
during an outbreak. Finally, they can be used after the crisis phase passes to better
measure the true infection rate. The antigen test works similarly except that antibodies
generated against a pathogen are used to directly detect this pathogen in the serum or other
bodily fluids of infected patients. Like RT-PCR, this test is a diagnostic test but is less
sensitive than the RT-PCR test and is generally applied several days after a patient becomes
symptomatic. However, the antigen test is generally less expensive than RT-PCR, administered
more conveniently, and has a fast turnaround time.</p></sec><sec id="sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>All influenza and coronavirus outbreaks have two factors in common: (a) human proximity to
farm and wildlife animals that facilitates interspecies transmission and emergence of
disease in humans, and (b) global travel. However, several factors set the COVID-19 pandemic
apart from the SARS and MERS outbreaks. These include the high infectivity as indicated by a
recently estimated R0 of 5.7 for SARS-CoV-2, peaking of viral shedding before the onset of
symptoms, and a large population of asymptomatic carriers still capable of infecting others.
Thus, COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease that can easily spread undetected in a society
with high population density and mobility.</p><p>It is only a matter of time for new diseases to emerge or reemerge and cause pandemics. It
would appear that coronavirus-associated diseases have been underestimated thus far, and the
time since the SARS and MERS outbreaks was not used effectively to develop infrastructure to
rapidly mobilize diagnostic tests, vaccinations, antiviral therapies, and policies to
control outbreaks and to coordinate healthcare systems worldwide. Countries are struggling
to save lives while attempting to limit damage to their economies in order to preempt a
potential local and worldwide recession. What will be the lessons learned from COVID-19 that
will convince policy makers to treat the next emerging disease with scientific rationale?
Risk assessment for emerging hazards is essential to employ optimal engineering and
administrative controls and inform appropriate PPE decisions. Constant surveillance is
essential for the detection of emerging diseases and their containment by contact tracing
and social isolation. The same risk assessment principles for work with hazardous chemicals,
radioactivity, or encounters apply to newly emerging diseases:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>decrease the time of exposure to reduce the
dose;</p></list-item><list-item><p>increase the distance to the source (i.e., infected
persons); and</p></list-item><list-item><p>use shielding to protect from direct
contacts.</p></list-item></list></p><p>The lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic will only be valuable if they result in
actions to prepare our global society for the next pandemic to come.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="COI-statement" id="NOTES-d7e924-autogenerated"><p>The author declares no competing financial interest.</p></notes><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the UC Office of the President and the UCLA Chancellor&#x02019;s
