<p id="par0015">Over the last several weeks researchers have been caught off guard in several aspects of clinical research and are having to make tough decisions about ongoing clinical research, e.g. whether to continue, reschedule or cancel the research activities. For making such decisions, investigators need to determine the risk benefit ratios of the Research visits, seek local and national guidance, assess level of risk of the pandemic in their setting, optimize staffing issues, and minimize risk involved to each participant. Given that disruptions to the study are likely in most cases, investigators should inform the study sponsors and regulatory bodies in a timely manner. Protocol revisions to allow remote data collection using video interview apps such as zoom and Skype should be considered. Participant input should be considered as well. If an in-person visit is decided upon, it is important to make sure that all precautions including protective care are fully implemented, and the participants’ and researchers’ safety carefully monitored. Interestingly, many participants appear to support continuation of medical research during epidemics (
