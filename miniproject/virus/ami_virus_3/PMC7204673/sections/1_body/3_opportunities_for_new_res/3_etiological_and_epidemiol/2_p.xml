<p id="par0025">Mental disorders emerge from a complex interplay between multiple psychosocial, and lifestyle factors. Environmental exposures such as green space, air pollution and housing conditions may all serve to increase risk for or protect against mental disorders (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Attademo et al., 2017</xref>). Several questions are worth addressing in this context. What is the impact of medical comorbidity in psychiatric disorders on risk for Covid-19 infection? Does intimate partner violence increase in the context of restriction of social mobility outside of home? Are psychiatric disorders likely to worsen because of this? Is the decreasing air pollution across the globe as a result of the Covid-19 crisis (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Dutheil et al., 2020</xref>) likely to be protective for mental illness? Which co-morbid illnesses are likely to enhance risk of exposure to Covid-19 and of severe illness and mortality? Do medical and substance abuse comorbidity increase likelihood of psychiatric disorders in relation to Covid-19? Is social distancing likely to increase loneliness and psychiatric symptoms as a consequence (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Narita et al., 2020</xref>)? There is evidence that anxiety and distress are positively associated with interpersonal distance in schizophrenia patients. The shelter in place regulations as a result of the current pandemic are forcing people to stay at home with the effect of decreasing interpersonal distance in the home setting. The impact of such social changes on the trajectory of serious mental illness is worth investigating.
