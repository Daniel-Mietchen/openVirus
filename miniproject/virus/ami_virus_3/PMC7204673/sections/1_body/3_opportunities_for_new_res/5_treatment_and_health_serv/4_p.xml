<p id="par0055">In summary, we are witnessing an unprecedented threat to global well-being and its mental health consequences. Psychiatric research can be creatively repurposed using existing resources; this needs a rapid adaptation to new technology, both to enable continuation of ongoing research and also to understand mental health consequences of COVID-19; all this can happen in the context of our ongoing efforts to improve patient care. Given the almost universal nature of the pandemic, collaboration is needed across mental health researchers to rapidly develop and share large datasets on the emerging new knowledge of the mental health implications of Covid-19, Such knowledge will not only help mount an effective response to the current pandemic but will also enhance our ability to effectively address future similar disasters. It is encouraging that the National Institutes of Health and other funders are now beginning to facilitate administrative supplements to enable researchers in these endeavors. It would be a huge missed opportunity if we do not actively understand these rapidly unfolding events and learn the important lessons that the pandemic may teach us.</p>
