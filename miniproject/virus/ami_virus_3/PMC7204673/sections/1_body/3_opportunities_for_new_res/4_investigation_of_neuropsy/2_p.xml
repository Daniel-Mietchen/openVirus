Also important are the questions about how people with already existing mental illness are coping when faced with the direct or indirect effects of the COVID-19 crisis. It is also important to investigate reactions of the mentally ill persons to isolation, uncertainty, and lack of access to needed care, and about what therapeutic strategies are working.
