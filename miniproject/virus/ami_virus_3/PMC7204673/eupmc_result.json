    "The current Covid-19 pandemic is posing an unprecedented threat to global well-being and its mental health consequences are just becoming understood. While the crisis has led to a temporary halt in a lot of ongoing or planned psychiatric research, this pandemic is a natural experiment that can help the field to repurpose research to better understand the causes, presentations and outcome trajectories as well as treatments in psychiatry. Inter-disciplinary collaborations between researchers are needed to rapidly develop and share the emerging new knowledge of the mental health implications of Covid-19, This will help mount an effective response to the current as well as future pandemics."
