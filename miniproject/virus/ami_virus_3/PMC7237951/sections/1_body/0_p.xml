<p id="p0010">As I write this article, we are experiencing two epidemics: a global epidemic of disease (COVID-19) caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), and an epidemic of panic caused by the uncertainty about the disease and its consequences. A solution to both of these epidemics is, of course, knowledge derived through research. Globally, efforts are now focused on understanding the natural history of the COVID-19 infection and on development of interventions, including vaccines to prevent infection and treatments for the disease. In addition, we need research on how to better convey information to the general public to avoid over-reaction and panic in the face of uncertainty. Research on coronaviruses, like any other research, is most effective if it is adequately funded and researchers have the necessary skill sets. For COVID-19, we need research expertise in both basic and applied sciences, including not only health sciences but also technological sciences, social sciences, biology, chemistry, and epidemiology, to maximize the impact and benefit of this targeted research to the community.</p>
