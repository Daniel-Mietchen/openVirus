<p id="p0025">Research to understand cervical cancer began with an Italian mathematician and epidemiologist Dr Rigoni-Stern in the mid-nineteenth century.

 </xref> His work demonstrated that cervical cancer was significantly more common in married women than nuns, an observation that remained unexplained for over 100 years, although knowledge of how to control this disease was developed meanwhile through the work of US-based Greek pathologist, George Papanicolaou, in the 1920s. He demonstrated that cancer and precancer cells could be found in the neck of the womb in women before they developed disseminated disease, thus leading to an effective way of controlling cervical cancer through early treatment.

 </xref> However, it took 20 years before other researchers adopted and accepted this approach, and around 50 years before routine screening for cervical cancer started to have an impact on the global prevalence of this common disease.

 </xref> In the meantime, the link between sexual activity and cervical cancer was reconfirmed epidemiologically, and serological association of cervical cancer with one possible infection, herpes virus, was given as a possible explanation of the link.

 </xref> However, German virologist, Harald zur Hausen, and his knowledge of oncogenic animal viruses, enabled him to develop a hypothesis in the late 1970s that the causal virus of cervical cancer might be a papillomavirus,

 </xref> because HPVs were transmitted through sexual activity, and animal papillomaviruses were known to be associated with cancers in cattle, rabbits, and dogs. His team, building on newly available technology, was able to demonstrate genetic signatures of HPV in some cervical cancer samples.

 </xref> that confirmed that one family of HPVs, the Î±-HPVs, includes specific genotypes whose genes could immortalize cell lines in the lab. These findings completed a loop of evidence that the observed association of high-risk HPVs with cervical cancer was likely causal. Not only cervical cancer, but also cancers at other anogenital sites and some oropharyngeal cancers, are now recognized to be associated with persistent HPV infection.
