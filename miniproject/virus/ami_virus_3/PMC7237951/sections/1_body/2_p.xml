<p id="p0020">My lifetime research focus has been cervical cancer, a disease of global epidemic proportions, killing over 300,000 women worldwide each year. The disease is caused entirely by infection with human papillomaviruses (HPV). These infections are of equally epidemic nature, as more than half of all the adult population are infected with cancer-causing HPVs at some time in their lives. Fortunately, most infected people clear the infection themselves, through largely unknown mechanisms.</p>
