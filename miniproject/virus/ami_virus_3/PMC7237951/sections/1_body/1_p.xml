<p id="p0015">Preparedness for epidemics should not wait till an epidemic arrives! In my lifetime, I have experienced epidemic diseases caused by newly recognized viruses, including hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, SARS-CoV-1, MERS, Lassa fever, Zika virus, and Ebolavirus, as well as Yellow Fever, influenza, and measles virus, which are more common but equally severe. For all these epidemics, we need to be prepared and have teams of researchers ready to handle the unexpected! One aspect of preparedness pertinent to this journal is that the efforts in research will be most effective if undertaken through collaborations—between global researchers, between health care professionals researchers and governments, and between researchers and the general public—to ensure that research produces outcomes of real benefit to the community, who are the true end users of our research.</p>
