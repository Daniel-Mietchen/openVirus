<p>The data repository used in this paper for COVID-19 data is a Visual Dashboard operated by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE). The data repository
 <xref rid="c15" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>15</sup>
 </xref> is also supported by ESRI Living Atlas Team and the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU APL). We used datasets of cases confirmed with a laboratory test, irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms.

 </xref> The data contain, as recognized by the public authorities that dispatched them, several inhomogeneities due to the different ways of testing patients with suspicious symptoms. As an example, Italy announced on February 26 that it relaxed testing criteria to the point that contacts linked to confirmed cases or recent travelers to outbreak areas would not be tested anymore, unless they show symptoms.

 </xref> Unlike Italy, South Korea (with a population of 51 million) has been testing 15 000–20 000 individuals per day since February 27 with the goal to minimize hospital pressure and stop the epidemic in the early stages.

 </xref> COVID-19 data also suffer from reporting problems due to the local management of health infrastructures. In Italy, healthcare is a regional task and every day data are collected at a regional level and transmitted to the Protezione Civile, who transfers the data to WHO. Many inconsistencies and delays have been documented in this transfer process.

 </xref> A similar situation occurs in Mexico, in which, for instance, private institutions, either hospitals or laboratories, do not possess the necessary national and international certifications given by the 
 <italic>Instituto de Diagnóstico y Referencia Epidemiológicos</italic> (InDRE) and, therefore, their tests are not considered valid and must be redone by certified institutions,
 <xref rid="c19" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>19</sup>
 </xref> thus unnecessarily delaying of the release of accurate daily reports. COVID-19 data of Mexico were collected from the daily reports generated by Mexico’s 
 <italic>Secretaría de Salud</italic>.

 </xref> Our goal is to account for these uncertainties in the modeling of COVID-19 data.
