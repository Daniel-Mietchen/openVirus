<p>This model also has evident deficiencies in representing the COVID-19 infections. First of all, the total population

  <math id="M67">
   <mi>N</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, which provides the best fit for the Chinese data, is orders of magnitude lower than that of China or the Hubei province. Indeed, a major problem in the estimation of the SEIR model for COVID-19 is almost the total absence of infection counts for asymptomatic patients. In Ref. 
 <xref rid="c26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, posterior model estimates of percentage of total population infected (prevalence), as of March 28, 2020, have been performed for European countries that yield a ratio between

   <mi>C</mi>

  </math>
 </inline-formula> and total population of the same order of magnitude of the Chinese Hubei province. That study revealed a COVID-19 prevalence of 15% (CrI [3.7%–41%]) for Spain and 9.8% (CrI [3.2%–26%]) for Italy. Furthermore, the population under consideration does not consist of a group of about the same age and general health level, and the group members do not mix homogeneously. The model does not have any spatial component, nor does it predict the influences of policy and behavioral responses to the progress of the pandemic. Finally, the fit is obtained with a constant value of

  <math id="M69">
   <msub>
    <mi>R</mi>
    <mn>0</mn>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, although confinement measures have been introduced, possibly leading to a reduction in

  <math id="M70">
   <msub>
    <mi>λ</mi>
    <mn>0</mn>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> and, therefore, in 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="M71">
   <msub>
    <mi>R</mi>
    <mn>0</mn>
   </msub>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>. More complex models introducing further parameters would likely lead to overfitting and overconfident predictions due to the limited volume of data currently available. No model will be sufficient to predict the outcome of this pandemic: the outcome depends on our response. Models are presented here with the aim of generating some insight into the overall behavior and the risks entailed by inaction.
