<p>The goal of this paper is to analyze the effect of those large uncertainties in real-time forecasting of the long-term behavior of the COVID-19 epidemic.

 </xref> These models consist of ordinary differential equations where a population is divided into compartments, with the assumption that every individual in the same compartment has the same characteristics. In SEIR, the population is divided into susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered individuals. Such models predict a sigmoid shape of the total number of infections

We use SEIR models to show the possible origins of this sensitivity by perturbing the relevant parameters, often assumed deterministic, with a noise that mimics changes in the way the virus is spreading, e.g., as a result of application of confinement measures or the presence (rate/magnitude) of super-spreaders.

 </xref> The paper is organized as follows: in Sec. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">II</xref>, we discuss the various sources of data for COVID-19 and their shortcomings, and then we discuss in detail the SEIR model and its statistical modeling. In Sec. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">III</xref>, we discuss the results focusing on the statistical sensitivity of the modeling and apply them to the data from France, UK, and Italy. We finish, in Sec. 
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">V</xref>, with some remarks and point out some potentially beneficial policy guidelines.
