<p>In this work, we have discussed the statistical and dynamical sensitivity of asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 infections when performed at the early stages of the epidemics. First of all, we noted that SEIR model, with

  <math id="M163">
   <mi>λ</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>, 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="M164">

  </math>
 </inline-formula>, and 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="M165">
   <mi>α</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> inferred from clinical studies, can fit Chinese data with a value of 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="M166">
   <mi>N</mi>
   <mo>≃</mo>
   <mn>88</mn>
   <mspace width=".1em"/>
   <mn>000</mn>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> that is very different from that of the Chinese, Hubei, or Wuhan populations. This enormous discrepancy can be due both to a large underestimation in the prevalence or to the effectiveness of confinement measures which results in a smaller exposed population. This estimate should be taken as a first caveat in fitting a SEIR model to infer COVID-19 epidemics evolution in other countries as results may be largely under/overestimated.
