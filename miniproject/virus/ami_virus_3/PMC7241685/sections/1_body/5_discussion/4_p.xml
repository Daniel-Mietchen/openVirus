<p>Finally, we have investigated whether this statistical sensitivity can be dynamically reproduced with a SEIR model, where parameters are considered stochastic processes [Eq. 
 <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="d12">(12)</xref>]. We have found that the stochastic dynamics are more sensitive to

  </math>
 </inline-formula> and 
 <inline-formula>
  <math id="M170">
   <mi>λ</mi>
  </math>
 </inline-formula>. Perturbations on these parameters are proportional to the number of infected patients

 </inline-formula> and are, therefore, important in the growth phase of the epidemics. Actual data display fluctuations even larger than those simulated in the stochastic models, suggesting that instead of assuming observational Gaussian noise on the parameters, jump processes (e.g., Levy noise) may be more appropriate.

 </xref> Furthermore, we noticed that large fluctuations in the number of detected infections are also due to changes in the testing protocols and availability of tests. All these inconsistencies prevent the possibility of performing meaningful asymptotic statistical or dynamical modeling for COVID-19 or comparing results among different countries. This may be even more problematic in less developed countries, which are just beginning to register cases.
