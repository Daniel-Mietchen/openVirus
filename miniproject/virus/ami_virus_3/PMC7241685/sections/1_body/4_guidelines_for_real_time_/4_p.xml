 <italic>Statistical modeling</italic>: A simple cross-validation can follow both the approaches described in this paper: (i) exclude the last data points and check the stability of the estimates and (ii) add noise to the last data point and obtain an ensemble of estimates. Another approach could be based on evaluating every day each model on the performance in predicting the new data point, and then used again with the new data point for an updated estimate.
