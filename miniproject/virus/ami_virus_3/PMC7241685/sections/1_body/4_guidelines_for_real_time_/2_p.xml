<p>Real-time forecasts of COVID-19 epidemics are crucial to plan the duration of confinement measures and to define the needs for healthcare facilities. Due to the intrinsically non-linear nature of the underlying dynamics, extrapolations of total infection counts depend not only on the quality of data but also on the stage of the epidemics. This prevents from performing successful long-term extrapolations of the infection counts with statistical models. On the basis of the results obtained, we can, however, define a few guidelines for the real-time dynamical and statistical models of the epidemics.</p>
