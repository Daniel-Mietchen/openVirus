 <italic>Dynamical modeling</italic>: Without having reliable estimates of the prevalence of the epidemics including asymptomatic patients, one would not expect quantitative forecasts from dynamical models such as SEIR to be correct, not even within an order of magnitude. A dynamical model only tells us something about the basic structure, or shape, of the epidemic. It is robust, for instance, that there is an exponential regime and that the outcome of the epidemics is very sensitive to variations in the parameters during the exponential phase. In order to use dynamical models, one should first perform a grid search for the deterministic SEIR model and obtain the best set of parameters. From the root mean square errors, one can infer the typical distance from model to data and use that value to set the level of noise in the parameters. Then, by running a stochastic SEIR model, an uncertainty range for the prediction can be obtained. If confinement measures are introduced, the estimate of
