<p>We begin by showing the sensitivity of the logistic extrapolations in the early stage of the epidemics by looking at the French data from March 4 to March 20. France has previously recorded sporadic cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections, but the exponential growth phase started at the beginning of March 2020. To show the high sensitivity to the last point of the datasets, we first perform a logistic fit with data starting from different dates and ending on March 20 [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3(a)</xref>] and then do the reverse experiment by fitting data starting on March 4 but ending at different dates [
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3(b)</xref>]. This procedure is known as leave-one-out cross-validation, which has already been used in epidemiological models,

 </xref> although other studies have suggested that cross-validation is biased toward more complex models.

 </xref> Our goal is to use cross-validation not as a way to perform model selection but rather to assess the uncertainty in the estimation of the logistic fit to COVID-19 data. The results show that fits are more stable by removing days from the beginning of the outbreak than from the most recent past, therefore showing a time-asymmetry in the cross-validation procedure. Again, we stress the inadequacy of the

   <msup>

    <mn>2</mn>

   <mn>0.99</mn>
  </math>
 </inline-formula> for all cases considered in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>. The analysis suggests that, if a large error is presented in the last data point, the extrapolation has less predictive adequacy. This implies very narrow estimates of confidence intervals for

   <mi>C</mi>
   <mo stretchy="false">(</mo>
   <mi>t</mi>

  </math>
 </inline-formula>: for each fit, confidence intervals are as small as the thickness of the line used in the plots in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3</xref>. This prevents a correct evaluation of the confidence interval, which is critical to assess the uncertainties around the future evolution of the epidemics and to build relevant policies to address the worst case scenario.
