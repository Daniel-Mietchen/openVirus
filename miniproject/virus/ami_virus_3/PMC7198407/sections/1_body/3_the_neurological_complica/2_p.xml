<p id="p0055">Recent evidence suggests that COVID-19 pathophysiology may also involve the nervous system. A retrospective study in China involving more than 200 participants revealed that a subset of COVID-19 patients experienced neurological symptoms

These included impaired consciousness, acute cerebrovascular disease and skeletal muscle symptoms, suggesting the involvement of both the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The observed symptoms were more likely to be present in patients suffering from severe disease. Other possible PNS symptoms included hypogeusia and hyposmia. The link between these neurological symptoms and patient outcome could not be investigated, since patients were still acutely hospitalised at the time of the publication. Another study by the same group reported that in 13 patients COVID-19 infection was followed by acute cerebrovascular disease, including ischaemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and cerebral haemorrhage
