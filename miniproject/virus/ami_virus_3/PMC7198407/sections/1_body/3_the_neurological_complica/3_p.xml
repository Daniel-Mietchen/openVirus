<p id="p0060">Consistent with the findings from China, neurological manifestations were also reported by a second study in France, which followed 58 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospital owing to acute respiratory distress syndrome 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. 84% experienced neurological symptoms at various timepoints, from ICU admission to discontinuation of neuromuscular blockade. The neurological features included evidence of encephalopathy, corticospinal tract dysfunction, agitation and delirium. MRI and perfusion brain imaging conducted in a small subset of patients also revealed leptomeningeal enhancement and bilateral frontotemporal hypoperfusion, and two patients also had evidence of a small acute ischaemic stroke. As we await additional studies to further characterise the associated neurological manifestations of COVID-19, an increasing number of individual case reports have emerged, describing acute neurological disorders ranging from Guillain-Barr√© syndrome and acute myelitis to acute haemorrhagic necrotising encephalopathy in patients with COVID-19
