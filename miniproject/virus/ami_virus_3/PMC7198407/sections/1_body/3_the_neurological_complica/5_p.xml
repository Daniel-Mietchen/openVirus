 <xref rid="b0125" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0130" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0135" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Another study involving 70 MERS patients further reported confusion and seizures in 18 and 6 of the participants, respectively 
 <xref rid="b0140" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, although interpreting such findings again warrants caution. In contrast to SARS, little evidence currently exists for the presence of the MERS coronavirus in CSF. This also appears to be the case for COVID-19, where evidence for viral presence in CSF is still limited to a single case report 
 <xref rid="b0075" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, with other studies unable to replicate these findings thus far 
 <xref rid="b0055" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0060" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0090" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.
