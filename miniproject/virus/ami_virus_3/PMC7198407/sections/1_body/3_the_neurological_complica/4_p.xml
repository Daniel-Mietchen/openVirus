<p id="p0065">Whilst relatively fewer neurological associations have been made during past coronavirus epidemics, a number of case reports of SARS patients have documented the development of seizures, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis

 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. In one study involving 206 SARS patients, five cases of acute cerebrovascular disease were reported

Noting that these are rare presentations, and acknowledging that they are, in some cases, associated with a differential diagnosis, the presence of viral RNA, in both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
 <xref rid="b0095" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0105" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> as well as in autopsied brain tissue 
 <xref rid="b0115" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, nevertheless points to a neurotropic component to the SARS coronavirus.
