<p id="p0080">It is also currently unclear how SARS-CoV-2 invades the human CNS. One suggested mechanism is through haematogenous dissemination, whereby the virus crosses into the CNS from the bloodstream by infecting endothelial cells or leukocytes 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Another possible pathway is via retrograde neuronal routes, in which the virus gains access to the CNS by infecting peripheral neurons 
 <xref rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Animal studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV could reach the brain via an olfactory route, promoting neurodegeneration 
 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Emerging evidence from two studies, both available via 
 <italic>bioRxiv</italic> preprint, and therefore yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that SARS-CoV-2 also gains access to the CNS via the olfactory pathway, with concordant results demonstrating the expression of both the ACE2 receptor and the spike protein protease TMPRSS2, which is also required for SARS-CoV-2 entry, by specific subsets of cells present in the olfactory region 
 <xref rid="b0180" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0185" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. Whilst reports of SARS-related olfactory neuropathy are sparse 
 <xref rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, anosmia and hyposmia are increasingly being recognised as key features of COVID-19 infection, often as a presenting symptom 
 <xref rid="b0045" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0195" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0200" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0205" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0210" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0215" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. Thus, these studies could potentially provide promising avenues for future research aimed at improving our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 neurotropism.
