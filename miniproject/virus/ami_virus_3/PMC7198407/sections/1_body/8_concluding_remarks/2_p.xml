<p id="p0105">The neurology of COVID-19 and other coronavirus-related infections is a rapidly evolving area of medicine. Whilst most studies in the past, including those relating to SARS and MERS, have mainly involved small patient samples, the latest evidence on COVID-19 suggests that neurological events may occur in a significant proportion of patients. Further studies will allow for an assessment of the presence of any long-term neurological sequelae. There is a need for record-linkage studies that can establish varying degrees of associations between the incidence, severity and prognosis of COVID-19, and specific immunosuppressive disease modifying therapies, that would help in risk stratification and risk modification exercises for the management of patients with neuroinflammatory disorders; this would be especially useful if there were a second wave of COVID-19 illness. Finally, improving our understanding of the neurobiology of coronaviruses could augment our knowledge of neurological disorders with potential viral associations, such as viral encephalitis and multiple sclerosis.</p>
