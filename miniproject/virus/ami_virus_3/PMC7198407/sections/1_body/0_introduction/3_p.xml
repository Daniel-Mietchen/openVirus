<p id="p0035">Whilst numerous comparisons can be drawn between SARS-CoV-2 and its predecessors – SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) – responsible for the SARS and MERS epidemics, respectively, SARS-CoV-2 has unquestionably proved to be the most deadly. The reported COVID-19 global death toll has now risen to more than 200,000 since its first death in early January, far surpassing the combined reported death toll of SARS and MERS, which stands at less than 2,000

Moreover, a considerable number of deaths from COVID-19 are taking place in the community and in care homes, which are commonly not being included in publicised national death tolls. The reported number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the People’s Republic of China has largely been exceeded by those residing elsewhere, with the USA and Europe now the new epicentres of this global health pandemic.
