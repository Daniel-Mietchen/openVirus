<p id="p0040">Coronaviruses, named after their characteristic crown-shaped microscopic appearance, are positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Taxonomically, they form part of the 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily 
 <italic>(Coronaviridae</italic> family and 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> order). The 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily consists of four genera, of which betacoronaviruses include many of the most highly pathogenic coronaviruses known to man, including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Similar to betacoronaviruses, alphacoronaviruses also infect humans and other mammals. The two other genera, gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses, are more commonly associated with birds.
