<p id="p0075">Whilst MERS-CoV infects cells by binding to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptor, SARS-CoV instead acts via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor 
 <xref rid="b0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. ACE2, which is a membrane-bound protein expressed across different organs, including skeletal muscle and the brain 
 <xref rid="b0145" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b0150" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, has also recently been found to be the functional receptor of SARS-CoV-2 
 <xref rid="b0155" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the host cell membrane through interaction between a spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor

 <xref rid="b0165" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. Notably, the binding affinity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to ACE2 has been found to be significantly higher than that of the SARS-CoV spike protein 
 <xref rid="b0160" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, although the implications of this remain to be established. Whilst still controversial, ACE inhibitors and ibuprofen may increase ACE2 levels
