<p id="p0100">There are a number of specific patient management and service delivery considerations that are worth touching on 
 <xref rid="b0235" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>,

 <xref rid="b0250" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>. The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated the rapid dissemination of authoritative and practical information by representative neurology bodies globally, providing, for instance, consensus guidance advising about isolation strategies for high-risk patients, and the management considerations for patients on immunosuppressive agents. The scope of these guidelines will change based on emerging data from our colleagues in other specialties, such as whether thromboprophylaxis regimes, or the process of taking informed consent need to be altered in patients requiring intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, given the concerns about prothrombotic states in COVID-19. Moreover, given the possibility that a significant driver of pathology may be related to an overactive immune state, it remains an open question whether certain immunosuppressive agents may be beneficial, such as has been suggested in a case report of ocrelizumab in multiple sclerosis 
 <xref rid="b0255" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Owing to outpatient departments being closed to mitigate COVID-19 transmission, several academic centres, hospitals and clinics have rapidly adopted new strategies for managing neurology patients, and it is heartening to see those neurological centres lacking in infrastructure for tele-medicine catching up with those that did, in a concerted effort to maintain acute neurology and outpatient services.
