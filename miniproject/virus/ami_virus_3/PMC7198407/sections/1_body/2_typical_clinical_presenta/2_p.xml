<p id="p0050">COVID-19, SARS and MERS primarily manifest as respiratory illnesses, which are occasionally accompanied by gastrointestinal manifestations 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Disease severity can range from an illness with only mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Incubation time is also variable, with symptoms taking from two days to as long as around two weeks to appear 
 <xref rid="b0035" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. COVID-19 presents most frequently as a pneumonia, with its associated signs and symptoms, including fever, dry cough, and breathlessness, with characteristic radiological changes of bilateral lung opacities 
 <xref rid="b0030" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Whilst many of these also feature in SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has a propensity to cause lower respiratory tract infections, as suggested by the relatively less frequent occurrence of symptoms such as rhinorrhoea and sore throat. SARS and MERS are also more commonly linked to gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea. Furthermore, it has become increasingly clear that all of these highly pathogenic coronaviruses affect the cardiovascular system, with evidence of both acute and chronic cardiovascular features
