<p>There is a negative correlation between the ENc value and codon usage bias. ENc values indicate higher codon usage bias in SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with SARS and MERS CoVs, due to lower ENc values, which is mostly observed in S, E, and M genes and to a lesser extent in N and RdRP genes. In SARS, bat SARS, and MERS CoVs E gene, ENc was &gt;60, while in SARS‐CoV‐2, the ENc value was decreased by an amount of 18 to be no more than 42. Similarly, the M gene ENc value in SARS‐CoV‐2 was decreased by an amount of 3 to 5. Genes with low expression levels have high ENc values and more rare codons.

 </xref> The relative expression can be concluded from the ENc value, where small ENc value indicates higher bias and a generally higher level of expression.

 </xref> Thus, the small ENc value is suggesting for higher gene expression. The lower observed ENc, especially for Spike and Envelope genes, values for SARS‐CoV‐2 structural genes are indicative for higher gene expression potency.
