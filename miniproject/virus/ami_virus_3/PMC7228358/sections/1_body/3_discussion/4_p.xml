<p>RNA viruses had evolved high ENc value (&gt;35), implying low codon bias to adapt a wide range of hosts with various codon usage preferences.

 </xref> ENc values above 50, in general, mean low codon usage bias. The codon usage data indicated lower number of ENc values of the SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with SARS, bat SARS, and pangolin CoV. This indicates a higher codon usage bias of SARS‐CoV‐2. Within these CoVs, pangolin CoV had the least ENc differences.
