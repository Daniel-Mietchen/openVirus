<p>In this study, the newly emerged fatal SARS‐CoV‐2, the four structural genes, and two most important nonstructural genes were evaluated for their nucleotide composition, preferred codons, relative synonymous codons usage (RSCU), and positively and negatively biased codons. This investigation will cover a knowledge gap in our understanding of mechanisms of viral genome evolution, the underlying codon composition, and codon usage preferences in comparison with the most recent CoV epidemic viral infections. The structural genes comprises the S, E, M, and N genes, while the nonstructural genes include the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and main protease (Mpro) genes.</p>
