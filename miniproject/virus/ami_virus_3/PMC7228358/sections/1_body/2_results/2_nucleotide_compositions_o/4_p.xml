<p>In the N gene, A nucleotides were the most predominant (29.6%‐31.7%) followed by C (25%‐29%). There was little or no differences in GC% and AT% between the CoVs with a conserved tendency for higher AT%. The nucleotide percentages in the N gene were in the following order: A&gt;C&gt;G&gt;T for SARS‐CoV‐2, SARS, and bat SARS CoVs, while MERS CoV showed a revised order of A&gt;C&gt;T&gt;G. In NT3s, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively.</p>
