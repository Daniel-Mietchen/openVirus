<p>In the M gene, T nucleotides were the most predominant (29.9%‐31.9%) followed by A (24.4%‐25.6%). SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the lowest GC% (42.6%) and the highest AT% (57.4%), compared with bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 and pangolins Beta‐CoV showed slightly lower G/C nucleotides at the third position of codons. In all of the examined CoVs, the nucleotide percentages in the M gene were in the following order: T&gt;A&gt;C&gt;G. In NT3s, similar to other structural genes, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively.</p>
