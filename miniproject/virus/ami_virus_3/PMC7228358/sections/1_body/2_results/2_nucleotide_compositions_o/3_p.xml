<p>In the E gene, T nucleotides were the most predominant (34.5%‐40.4%) followed by A (21.5%‐25.7%). SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the lowest GC% (38.2%) and the highest AT% (63%), compared with bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 has the lowest frequency of G/C nucleotides. In all of the examined dCoVs, the nucleotide percentages in the E gene were in the following order: T&gt;A&gt;C&gt;G. In NT3s, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively.</p>
