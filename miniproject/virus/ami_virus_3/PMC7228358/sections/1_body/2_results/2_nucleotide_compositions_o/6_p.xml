<p>In RdRP, T and A nucleotides were the most predominant nucleotides. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the highest T3s and the lowest G3s (Table 
 <xref rid="jmv25754-tbl-0002" ref-type="table">2</xref>). In contrast, pangolins Beta‐CoV and MERS CoV showed the lowest A3s and the highest G3s frequencies. Therefore, similar to structural genes, RdRP contained pyrimidine nucleotides more frequent than purines. For Mpro, there is a conserved profile of general preference for T3s and low frequencies for G3s. Both SARS‐CoV‐2 and pangolin Beta‐CoV showed the lowest G3s frequencies.
