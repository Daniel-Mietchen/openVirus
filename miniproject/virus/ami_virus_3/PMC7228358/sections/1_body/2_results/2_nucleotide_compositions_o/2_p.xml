<p>In S gene, T nucleotides were the most predominant (32%‐34%) followed by A (25%‐29%). SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the lowest GC% (37%) and the highest AT% (63%), compared with bat SARS, MERS, and SARS CoV. In addition, SARS‐CoV‐2 has the lowest percentage of G/C nucleotides at the third position of codons followed by pangolins Beta‐CoV, which showed the highest A3s. In all of the examined CoVs, the nucleotide percentages in the S gene were in the following order: T&gt;A&gt;C&gt;G. In NT3s, the T3s and G3s were the most and the least frequent nucleotides, respectively (Table
