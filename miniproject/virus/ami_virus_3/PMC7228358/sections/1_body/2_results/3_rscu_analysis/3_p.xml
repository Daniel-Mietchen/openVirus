<p>In the S gene, the over‐biased codons, SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the highest number of over‐biased codons (10 codons), including CTT, ATT, GTT, TCT, CCT, CCA, ACT, GCT, AGA, and GGT. All of these codons contained A3s or T3s. In contrast, pangolin Beta‐CoV, SARS CoV, bat SARS CoV, and MERS CoV showed 8, 8, 9, and 8 over‐biased codons, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="jmv25754-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>). Therefore, SARS‐CoV‐2 has the largest number of over‐biased codons. The over‐biased codons were similar to that provided for SARS‐CoV‐2 except for CCA and ACT for pangolin Beta‐CoV, CCA, and GGT for SARS CoV, CCA for bat SARS CoV and ATT and CCA for MERS CoV.
