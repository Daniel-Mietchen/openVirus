<p>The number of over‐biased and negatively biased codons were compared in SARS‐CoV‐2, pangolin Beta‐CoV, SARS CoV, Bat CoV, and MERS CoV. SARS‐CoV‐2 almost coding the highest number of over‐biased and negatively biased codons among all of the structural proteins. In the S gene, SARS‐CoV‐2 bears 12 and 19 over‐biased and negatively biased codons, respectively. The SARS‐CoV‐2/SARS over‐biased codons ratio was 1.2, 1.14, and 1.44 for S, N, and M genes, respectively. In addition, The SARS‐CoV‐2/SARS negatively biased codons ratio was 1, 1.2, and 1.44 for S, N, and M genes, respectively. Therefore, the SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the highest number of extreme codon usage patterns of over‐ or under‐biased codons, followed by SARS CoV. The gap between SARS‐CoV‐2 and SARS CoVs is more tighter than the gap of SARS‐CoV‐2 or SARS CoV and the bat SARS CoV, which showed a much lower number of biased codons in comparison with the other viruses. MERS CoV showed a higher number of biased codons only in the N gene, compared with SARS and SARS‐CoV‐2.</p>
