 <xref rid="jmv25754-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>, and Table S1, the RSCU values for codons of CoV structural and nonstructural genes are provided, respectively. The tables are colored by a color scheme to denote the levels of codon usage bias. A value of RSCU =1 means that the observed frequency of codon is equivalent to the predictable frequency and indicating the lack of any codon usage bias. The underrepresented or negatively biased codons denote RSCU &lt;0.6 (blue color), the overexpressed or positively biased codons with RSCU &gt;0.6 (red color). The range between 0.6 and 1.6 conforms to the nonbiased codons.
