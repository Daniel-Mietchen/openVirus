<p>In the M gene, the over‐biased codons were CTT, ATT, GTA, GCT, CCA, GAC, GAA, TGT, CGT, and GGA for SARS‐CoV‐2 (10 codons), CTT, ATT, TCT, TCA, GCT, CCA, and GGA for pangolin Beta‐CoV (seven codons), CTT, ATT, GTA, GCT, CCA, GAC, TGT, and CGT for SARS CoV and bat SARS CoV (eight codons), CTT, ATT, GTA, GCT, CCA, GAC, TGT, GGT, and CGT for MERS CoV (nine codons). GGA and GAA codons were nonbiased codons in all coronaviruses except for the SARS‐CoV‐2 and pangolin Beta‐CoV were over‐biased. In the E gene, the codon usage could be biased by the short length of the E gene that favors excluding its delivered RSCU values.</p>
