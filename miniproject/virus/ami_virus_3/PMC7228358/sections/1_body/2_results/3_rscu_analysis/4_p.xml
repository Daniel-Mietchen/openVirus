<p>In the N gene, the over‐biased codons, SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the highest number of over‐biased codons (six codons), including TTG, CTT, ATT, ACT, GCT, and AGA. In contrast, pangolin Beta‐CoV, SARS CoV, bat SARS CoV, and MERS CoV showed 4, 4, 4, and 5 over‐biased codons, respectively (Table 
 <xref rid="jmv25754-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Therefore, SARS‐CoV‐2 has the largest number of over‐biased codons in the N gene. The over‐biased codons were similar to that provided for SARS‐CoV‐2 except TTG for pangolin Beta‐CoV, TTG, and CTT for SARS TTG and CTT for bat SARS CoV and TTG for MERS CoV. For MERS CoV, the over‐biased codons were slightly different and included CTT, ATT, TCT ACT, GCT, TAC, and AGA.
