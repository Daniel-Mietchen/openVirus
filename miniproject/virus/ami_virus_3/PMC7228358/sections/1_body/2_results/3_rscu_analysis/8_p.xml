<p>The structural genes undertook a homogenous profile of codon usage with little differences among the genes. In contrast, NSP as RdRP and Mpro showed larger variations. RdRP showed three over‐biased codons and eight common under‐biased codons. SARS‐CoV‐2 and pangolin Beta‐CoV showed the highest number of under‐biased codons (12 codons). Compared to 10 codons in SARS and bat SARS and five codons in MERS CoV (Table S1).</p>
