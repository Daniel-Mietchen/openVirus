<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 showed the lowest ENc value for all nonstructural and structural genes, compared with pangolins Beta‐CoV, SARS, and bat SARS CoVs (Figure 
 <xref rid="jmv25754-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). MERS CoV has the lowest ENc value for N and RdRP. The differences between ENc values between SARS‐CoV‐2 and pangolins Beta‐CoV were 0.6, 4.2, 2.9, 0.7, and 0.7 for S, E, M, N, RdRP, and Mpro. These values were the lowest differences compared with the other CoVs.
