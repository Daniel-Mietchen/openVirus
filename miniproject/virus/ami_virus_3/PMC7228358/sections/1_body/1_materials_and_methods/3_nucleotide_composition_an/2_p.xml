<p>The nucleotide composition of the four structure genes, S, E, M, and N, were analyzed to reveal the nucleotides (A, T, G, and C) percentages. A/T, G/C percentage, the percentage of G or C nucleotides at the first position of codons (GC1), the percentage of each nucleotide at the third position of codons, the percentage of G or C nucleotides at the third position of codons (GC3) were calculated.</p>
