<p>ENc values range from 20 to 61. The obtained ENc value can be used to conclude the codon usage bias. An ENc value of &lt;35 indicates strong codon usage bias due to lower number of codons used in protein translation. Higher ENc value indicates low codon usage bias. The raw data for ENc are provided in the Supporting Information Material.</p>
