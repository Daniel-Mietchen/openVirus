<p id="p0025">Although COVID-19 is widely known as a respiratory virus, there have been reports of patients with GI symptoms that developed before respiratory manifestations. Recent studies of COVID-19 showed GI tropism of the coronavirus, verified by detection of the virus in biopsy specimens and stool, even in discharged patients. This may provide some explanation for the GI symptoms, potential recurrence, and transmission of COVID-19 from individuals who persistently shed the virus.

Among them, 18 (64.29%) remained positive for viral RNA in feces after pharyngeal swabs returned negative results. The duration of viral shedding from feces after conversion to negative pharyngeal swab results was 6 to 10 days. These findings suggest possible transmission via the fecal–oral route. Although this route of transmission has not been confirmed or refuted, it seems safer to prevent any kind of contamination during lower GI procedures.
