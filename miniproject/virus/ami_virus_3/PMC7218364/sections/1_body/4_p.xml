<p id="p0030">This motivates us to seek a new protection barrier for endoscopists to limit contact with aerosols from the patient. We report an economic and easily achievable anti-aerosol barrier design that protects the group involved in upper and lower digestive endoscopy procedures. Although we have not used this barrier in ERCP, we think use is possible—surrounding the head with the barrier while confirming that the oxygen cannula remains in place—if the patient is not under general anesthesia. Cardiopulmonary monitoring is always necessary during any procedure performed with this barrier.</p>
