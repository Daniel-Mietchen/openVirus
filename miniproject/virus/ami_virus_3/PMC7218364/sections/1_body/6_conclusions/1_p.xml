   <p id="p0075">Digestive endoscopic procedures involve a high risk of exposure to COVID-19, given their high generation of aerosols.</p>

   <label>2.</label>
   <p id="p0080">All of the protective equipment described in the personal protection equipment guidelines must be used.</p>

  <list-item id="o0025">
   <label>4.</label>
   <p id="p0090">The barrier is low cost, easy to install, and can be generalized in all public and private institutions because of its cost effectiveness.</p>

  <list-item id="o0030">
   <label>5.</label>
   <p id="p0095">The barrier can be used in upper endoscopic procedures, such as EGD, EUS, ERCP, and lower digestive endoscopy procedures.</p>
