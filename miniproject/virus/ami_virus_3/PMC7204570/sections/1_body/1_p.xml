<p>The COVID-19 pandemic emerged in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. In late December, evaluation of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from an ill patient identified a betacoronavirus, and the virus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), was sequenced by early January 2020, enabling rapid development of molecular testing.

 </sup> Standard testing for acute infection entails reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) amplification of reverse-transcribed viral RNA from respiratory specimens, most commonly nasopharyngeal swabs, but also oropharyngeal swabs, sputum, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.

 </sup> Antigen-based and serological testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection are under study. Antigen-based tests may suffer from limited sensitivity, as seen for related viruses.

 </sup> Serological testing, once standardized, will be valuable for epidemiological studies evaluating the extent of the pandemic, but may be limited for acute diagnosis.
