<p>The case report from Thailand demonstrated prompt and appropriate management of a patient with exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and then diagnosis facilitated by repeat RT-PCR testing and lung imaging. This diagnosis facilitated appropriate management through the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Early isolation is important, as COVID-19 may be highly infectious in asymptomatic individuals or before symptoms are apparent.

 </sup> Notably, this diagnosis would likely have been missed in the United States, where, to date, clinicians struggle to provide diagnostic tests. The Thai patient would have fit some current criteria for testing in the United States, as she was a contact of a patient with documented infection, but U.S. guidelines do not include repeat testing in the event of initial negative tests. This is unfortunate, as it appears that COVID-19 patients commonly have negative tests early in the course of illness, at times with abnormal chest imaging, as in the described case report and in a report from China,

 </sup> but the limited supply of tests necessitates restrictive testing algorithms that do not incorporate repeat testing. By contrast, the patient described in the case report received appropriate isolation and then appropriate discontinuation of isolation, based on a total of 5 RT-PCR tests.
