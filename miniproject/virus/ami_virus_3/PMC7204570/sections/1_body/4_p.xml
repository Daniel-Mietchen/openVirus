 </sup> She had been tested 4 days earlier by RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 of nasopharyngeal and throat swabs, and results were negative. On the day of admission, she denied symptoms and was afebrile with normal oxygenation, but coughing was noted during examination. Chest X-ray showed an alveolar opacity suggestive of COVID-19, and the patient was admitted, with respiratory isolation. Repeat RT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 of sputum on the day of admission was deemed inconclusive. The patient reported sore throat, mild cough, and diarrhea 2 days after admission. A third RT-PCR test, of sputum, 3 days after admission, was positive for SARS-CoV-2. The patientâ€™s symptoms and chest X-ray infiltrates worsened, and chest computed tomography and ultrasound were abnormal, but findings subsequently improved, and the patient was discharged after two negative SARS-CoV-2 tests.
