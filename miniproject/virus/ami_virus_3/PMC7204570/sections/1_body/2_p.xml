<p>Two critical features of a successful response to a pandemic respiratory virus are early detection and isolation of potentially infectious individuals. In China, where the pandemic began, initial delays in action contributed to the rapid growth of the epidemic, but acknowledgment of the outbreak in late December 2019 was followed by development of a molecular test for the infection within about 2 weeks. The rapid development of a reliable diagnostic was of great value. Availability of diagnostics was initially limited, but the establishment of extreme isolation for Hubei Province likely played a major role in allowing the Chinese epidemic, although very large, to be controlled over some weeks. Epidemic responses were different in other countries in Asia, including South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan. In these countries, the early response was marked by wide access to molecular testing, benefitting from the earlier advances in China. Widespread testing of those with suggestive symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection or contact with a patient, followed by aggressive contact tracing, allowed for isolation of those infected and quarantine of contacts. In these countries, COVID-19 outbreaks were controlled reasonably quickly, with relatively few deaths compared to some other countries with similar numbers of reported infections.</p>
