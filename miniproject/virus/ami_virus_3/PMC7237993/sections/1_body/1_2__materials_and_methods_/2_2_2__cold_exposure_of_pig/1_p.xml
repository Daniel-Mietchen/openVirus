<p>To investigate the effects of cold exposure on Hsp70 expression in pig duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, nine piglets with 35 days of age from the same birthday were randomly allocated to three groups as one control and two cold exposure (n = 3/each group) groups. Animals were allowed to acclimate for three days before being subjected to experimental conditions. Prior to cold exposure, pigs were raised in a climatic chamber at an ambient temperature of 26 ± 2 °C with 40% relative humidity. Experimental pigs were exposed to cold ambient temperature at 4 °C for 6 h and 12 h, while control pigs were exposed to room temperature (26 ± 2 °C) for 12 h. At indicated time points, piglets were euthanized and duodenum, jejunum and ileum were collected immediately then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in −80 °C freezer until use. All animal studies were approved in accordance with the regulations and guidelines of the animal care committee of Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University (20180328002), and all experiments were performed in accordance with specific guidelines provided by Heilongjiang Bayi Agricultural University (201401002).</p>
