<p>To determine the effects of Hsp70 inhibitor VER155008 on Vero E6 cell viability, MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay was applied. Briefly, Vero E6 cells were grown on 96-well culture plates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>3</sup>/well and were incubated for 24 h. After initial period of incubation, cells were treated with various concentrations of VER155008 for another 24 h. Cell viability was assessed using the MTT Cell Cytotoxicity Assay Kit (Beyotime, Beijing, China) as the manufacturer’s recommendations.
