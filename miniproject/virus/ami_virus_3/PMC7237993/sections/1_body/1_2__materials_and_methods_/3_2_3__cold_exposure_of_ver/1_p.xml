<p>To investigate the effects of cold exposure on Hsp70 expression in African green monkey kidney epithelial (Vero E6) cells, three groups of cell as one control (37 °C) and two cold exposure (4 °C or 25 °C) groups were prepared. Vero E6 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. When monolayer reach 80%–90% confluent, culture medium was replaced and exposed to 4 or 25 °C for 6 or 12 h respectively, followed by recovery at 37 °C for another 4 h. Control cells were cultured at 37 °C all through the experiments. At the indicated time points, cells were collected after three times of washing. Proteins and RNA were extracted according to manufacturer’s protocol.</p>
