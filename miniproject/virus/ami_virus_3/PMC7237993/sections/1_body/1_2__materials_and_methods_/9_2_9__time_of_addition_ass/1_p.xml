<p>To validate the effects of VER155008 on PEDV replication, Vero E6 cells were seeded onto 6 well plates at a density of 5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup>/well in complete culture medium incubated for 24 h. Then, cells were inoculated with PEDV strain CV777 (MOI = 1) for 2 h at 4 °C to synchronize infection. After three wash with PBS, 1 mL of DMEM contain trypsin (10 μg/mL) was added to each well and placed in a humidified incubator at 37°C. At the indicated time points, a VER155008 solution was added to the wells at a final concentration of 5 μM. At 24 hpi all cells were harvest for immunoblotting assays. Time of VER155008 additions are shown in Figure 4A.
