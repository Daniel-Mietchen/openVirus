<p>To investigate the effects of Hsp70 on PEDV replication, plasmid encoding porcine Hsp70 was transfected into Vero E6 and porcine small intestinal epithelial cells (IPEC-J2). To construct the recombinant overexpression vector, porcine Hsp70 (HSPA6, reference sequence: NM_001123127) coding sequence without the stop codon was cloned from the total cDNA of porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. The Hsp70 fragment was amplified by PCR and inserted into the multiple cloning site of the pTSB plasmid (TSE02, TranSheepBio, Shanghai, China). The recombinant pTSB-Hsp70 vectors were successfully constructed, as confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis (data not shown). To determine the effects of Hsp70 on PEDV replication, Vero E6, and IPEC-J2 cells plated on 6-well plates were transient transfected with 2.5 μg/well pTSB-Hsp70 plasmid using Exfect 2000 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Vazyme, Nanjing, China). IPEC-J2 cells were purchased from Ze Ye (Shanghai, China) and cultured in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium supplement with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. At 24 h post-transfection, cells were infected with PEDV strain CV777 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. At 48 h post inoculation (hpi), samples were subjected to detection of PEDV RNA and protein by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively.</p>
