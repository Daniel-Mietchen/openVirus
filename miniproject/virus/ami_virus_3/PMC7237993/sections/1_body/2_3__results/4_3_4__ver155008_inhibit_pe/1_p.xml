<p>To further investigate the stage at which Hsp70 exerts its pro-viral effect, VER155008 was added to the PEDV infected Vero E6 cells at different time points before and during infection. The infection process was divided into virus absorption (at 4 °C), virus invasion (the first two hours post infection at 37 °C) and replication (2–24 hpi) phases (

Compare to the control group (group 1), VER155008 inhibited PEDV N protein levels significantly if applied throughout the experiment (group 2) or during the replication (group 4) and invasion stages (group 5), although no inhibition of PEDV production were shown in group 3 (
