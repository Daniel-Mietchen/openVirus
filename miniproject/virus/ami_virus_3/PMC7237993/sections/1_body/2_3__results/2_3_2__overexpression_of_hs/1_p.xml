<p>To address our hypothesis that overexpression of Hsp70 could enhance PEDV replication, we used eukaryotic expression vector to overexpress porcine Hsp70 into Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00246-f002">Figure 2</xref>A,B, pTSB-Hsp70 successfully transduced an exogenous gene and expressed the target protein in Vero E6 cells. When Hsp70 was overexpressed by pTSB-Hsp70, an increase in PEDV mRNA and N protein levels were observed compare to both pTSB and mock groups (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00246-f002">Figure 2</xref>E,F, overexpression of Hsp70 can also enhance PEDV N protein levels in IPEC-J2 cells. These data suggested that overexpression of Hsp70 can significantly enhance PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression in Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells.
