<p>We performed silencing experiments to investigate more specifically the function of Hsp70 expression in PEDV replication. We designed three siRNAs, siRNA1, siRNA2, siRNA3, and a negative control siRNA (siRNA NC) targeting the Hsp70 gene. SiRNA2 had no inhibited effect, while siRNA 1 and siRNA3 had significantly inhibited Hsp70 mRNA and protein levels compared to scramble siRNA (

Twenty-four hours post siRNAs transfection, cells were infected with PEDV at 1 MOI. Under these conditions, the knockdown of Hsp70 expression was associated with a significant reduction of the amounts of viral mRNA and protein levels (
