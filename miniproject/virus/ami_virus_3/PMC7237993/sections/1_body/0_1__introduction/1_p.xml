<p>Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), belonging to the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> subfamily of 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic>, which causes porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), an enteric disease characterized by acute watery diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting, and high mortality in nursery piglets [
