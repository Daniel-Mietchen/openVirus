<p>The heat shock response or stress response is the most highly conserved cellular response in all species. Hsps play important roles in antigen presentation, intracellular trafficking, apoptosis, and act as molecular chaperones by helping nascent polypeptides assume their proper conformations [
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The increase of Hsp70 levels following physical stress has been widely observed. The induction may occur indirectly through the production of a large number of unfolded proteins during stress. Indeed, Hsp70 is involved in many cellular processes, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and cellular innate immunity pathways, which is frequently diverted by viruses for their benefits [

 <xref rid="B43-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Induction of the Hsp70 is a specific virus function that ensures proper synthesis of viral proteins and virions, thus stress proteins may be important for virus replication [
