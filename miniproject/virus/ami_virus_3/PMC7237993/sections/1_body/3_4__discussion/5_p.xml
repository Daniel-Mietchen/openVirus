<p>Viral infection depends entirely on the host cellular factors at different steps of the viral life cycle: viral invasion, genome replication, viral protein synthesis, viral assembly, and counter defense against cell apoptosis and innate immunity. It has been shown that Hsp70 is involved in all steps of viral life cycle for viruses from numerous families of diverse orders [

 <xref rid="B46-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. To determine the relationship between Hsp70 levels and PEDV replication, pTSB-Hsp70 mediated overexpression or siRNAs mediated knockdown of Hsp70 were applied in PEDV infected Vero E6 or IPEC-J2 cells, results indicate that Hsp70 has a pro-viral effect on PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression by acting during at least one step of the viral cycle (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00246-f003">Figure 3</xref>). To further clarify which steps in the viral life cycle require Hsp70 in Vero E6 cells, we performed time-of-addition experiment using VER155008. As expected, PEDV N protein levels were significantly reduced when VER155008 applied throughout the experiment (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00246-f004">Figure 4</xref>, group 5). In contrast, VER155008 had no effects on PEDV N protein levels if applied during absorption stage (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00246-f004">Figure 4</xref>, group 3). Not surprisingly, Hsp70 levels were not change during VER155008 treatment (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pathogens-09-00246-f004">Figure 4</xref>C). VER155008 is a chemical modulator that interfere with Hsp70 ATPase enzymatic activities by competes with ATP for Hsp70 binding [
 <xref rid="B47-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Hsp70 has been shown as a putative receptor, supplementary receptor or receptor-associated protein to facilitate Japanese encephalitis virus [
 <xref rid="B48-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], enterovirus 71 [
 <xref rid="B28-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], or infectious bronchitis virus [
 <xref rid="B20-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] invasion. Also, Hsp70 plays a negative regulator role of MDA5-MAVS signaling pathway to inhibit innate immunity response in vitro [
 <xref rid="B40-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. However, the mechanisms of Hsp70-induced up-regulation of PEDV mRNA and protein synthesis during viral invasion and replication stages are unknown and consequently need to be further investigated. These data indicated that synthesis and activity of Hsp70 positively regulate PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression in vitro.
