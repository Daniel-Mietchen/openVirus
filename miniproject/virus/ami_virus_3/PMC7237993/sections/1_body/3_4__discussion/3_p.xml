<p>Similarly, exposure of cultured Vero E6 cells to low ambient temperature also increased Hsp70 mRNA and protein levels. Although only mRNA levels of Hsp70 were significantly up regulated when Vero E6 cells were exposed to 25 Â°C environment, we still notice the increase tendency of Hsp70 protein levels as cold exposure time extension, suggesting Hsp70 protein synthesis rate were correlated with cell stress levels. Overexpression of Hsp70 in Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells or siRNAs mediated knockdown of Hsp70 in Vero E6 cells resulted in increased or decreased mRNA synthesis and protein expression of PEDV respectively. Specific inhibition of Hsp70 by VER155008 seriously impaired the N protein expression of PEDV by inhibits viral invasion and replication. Our data suggest that cold exposure induced Hsp70 could contribute to the infection of PEDV and the seasonality of PED epidemics.</p>
