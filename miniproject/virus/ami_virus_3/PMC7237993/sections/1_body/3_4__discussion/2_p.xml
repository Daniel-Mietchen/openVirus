<p>In this study, we tried to determine whether low environmental temperature induced Hsp70 impact on PEDV infection by using piglets, Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. Thermal sensitivity and grade of physiological stress were defined according to Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) and Physiologic Equivalent Temperature (PET), 4 °C was the critical temperature of strong cold stress and extreme cold stress [
 <xref rid="B39-pathogens-09-00246" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Meanwhile, the average temperature in the cold region of northeast China was during −5 °C to 5 °C. So we choose 4 °C for cold exposure experiment in this study. Exposure of piglets to low ambient temperature increased Hsp70 levels significantly in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum, where tropism of PEDV infection in vivo.
