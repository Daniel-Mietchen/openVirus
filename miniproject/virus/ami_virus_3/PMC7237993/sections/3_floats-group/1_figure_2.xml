  <p>Overexpression of Hsp70 promotes PEDV mRNA synthesis and protein expression. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Plasmid coding porcine Hsp70 were transfected into Vero E6 cells, and incubated for 72 h. The Hsp70 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The level of Hsp70 mRNA was normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. (
   <bold>B</bold>) The cells were harvested for western blotting analysis with anti-Hsp70 anti-GAPDH antibodies. The levels of Hsp70 was quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Plasmid coding porcine Hsp70 were transfected into Vero E6 cells, 24 h post transfection PEDV were infected at MOI = 1 and incubated for another 48 h. The Hsp70 and PEDV ORF3 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The mRNA levels of Hsp70 and PEDV ORF3 were normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. (
   <bold>D</bold>) The cells were harvested for western blotting analysis with anti-Hsp70, anti-PEDV-N and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The relative protein levels were quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). (
   <bold>E</bold>) Plasmid coding porcine Hsp70 were transfected into IEPC-J2 cells, 24h post transfection PEDV were infected at MOI = 1 and incubated for another 48 h. The Hsp70 mRNA levels were detected by qRT-PCR. The level of Hsp70 mRNA was normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. (
   <bold>F</bold>) The cells were harvested for western blotting analysis with anti-Hsp70, anti-PEDV-N and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The relative protein levels were quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel).
