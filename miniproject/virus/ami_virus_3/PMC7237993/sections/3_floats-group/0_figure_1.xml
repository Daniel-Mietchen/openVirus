  <p>Cold exposure increases the expression of Hsp70 in vivo and in vitro. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Relative fold change of Hsp70 mRNA levels in vivo were analysed by qRT-PCR. The Hsp70 mRNA levels were normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Duodenum, jejunum and ileum from control or cold exposed piglets were lysed and extracts were analyzed by western blotting using anti-Hsp70, or anti-GAPDH antibodies. The level of relative proteins was quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Relative fold change of Hsp70 mRNA levels in vitro were analysed by qRT-PCR. The Hsp70 mRNA levels were normalized to the level of β-actin mRNA in the same sample. (
   <bold>D</bold>) Control or cold exposed cells were lysed and extracts were analyzed by western blotting using anti-Hsp70, or anti-GAPDH antibodies. The level of relative proteins was quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). The data are presented as the mean ± SEM (n = 3). Statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: ns, not significant; *,
