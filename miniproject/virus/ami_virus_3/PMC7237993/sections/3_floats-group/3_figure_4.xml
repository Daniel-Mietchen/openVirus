  <p>Hsp70 inhibition blocks PEDV invasion and replication. (
   <bold>A</bold>) Timeline of VER155008 addition. (
   <bold>B</bold>) Vero E6 cells were treated with serial concentrations of VER1555008 as indicated for 24 h. Cell viability was measured by MTT assay. DMSO treated cells served as control (Ctrl). (
   <bold>C</bold>) Vero E6 cells were treated by VER155008 at different phases and harvest at 24h post infection. Cell extracts were analyzed by western blotting with anti-Hsp70, anti-PEDV-N and anti-GAPDH antibodies. The relative protein levels were quantified by immunoblot scanning and normalized with respect to the amount of GAPDH (lower panel). The data are presented as the mean Â± SEM (n = 3). Statistically significant differences are indicated as follows: ns, not significant; **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***,
