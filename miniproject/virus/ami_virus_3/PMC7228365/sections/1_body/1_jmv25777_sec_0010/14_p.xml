<p>In 2018, the total number of resuscitation units (intensive care and cardiovascular arterial units) were estimated to be 69 921 + 148 124 (a total of 218 045 hospitalized cases, ie, 597.38 cases per day), which means about 30 cases/day/region and 600 subjects in those units in a time range of about 20 days. Data from the Health Ministry were sensitively lower (351) on 5 March 2020 and showed a very modest up‐growth only very recently (877 on 10 March 2020), which might explain the big concern about health care services.</p>
