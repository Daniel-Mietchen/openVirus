<p>The crowded debate burst on the epidemiological causes of the SARS‐CoV2 outbreak in Italy never addressed the possibility that, also in a European country, the animal‐mediated intermediate transmission may have a role in the positive SARS‐CoV2 diagnosed individuals so far. Interestingly, the paper by Lai et al,

 </xref> discussed the hypothesis that a COVID19‐like coronavirus causative agent, might have existed in Italy quite earlier than the Wuhan outbreak, probably since September or October 2019. The question if we are currently “mapping” a family of SARS‐CoV2‐corelated genotypes derived from pre‐existing human autochthonous β‐coronavirus, is particularly concerning. In Italy, the Lombardia region, which accounts for the highest number of SARS‐CoV2 positive subjects, has also the highest percentage of Chinese resident people (&gt;23%), according to recent ISTAT data in 2019. Interestingly, Tuscany (Toscana) region, with Prato, accounting on about 18% Chinese individuals, appeared to have a very low number of people purported to have contracted the SARS‐CoV2.
