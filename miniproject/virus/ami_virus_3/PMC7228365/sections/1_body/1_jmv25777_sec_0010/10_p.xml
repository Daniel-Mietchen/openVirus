<p>Besides China, a spillover of zoonotic pathogens from wildlife was reported also in Italy from bats.

 </xref> In Italy, the association between β‐coronavirus species, closely akin to SARS‐CoV, and bats (
 <italic>Rhinolophus ferrumequinum</italic> L), has been recently reported.

 </xref> reported a phylogenetic investigation about the origin of the many different coronavirus genotypes in Italy from wild bats and identified two alpha‐coronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle (
 <italic>Pipistrellus kuhlii</italic>), three clade 2b β‐coronaviruses from lesser horseshoe bats (
 <italic>Rhinolophus hipposideros</italic>), and 10 clade 2c β‐coronaviruses from Kuhl's pipistrelle, common noctule (
 <italic>Nyctalus noctula</italic>), and Savi's pipistrelle (
 <italic>Hypsugo savii</italic>), mainly in the Italian Regions Lombardia and Emilia‐Romagna, where major SARS‐CoV2 focuses are present.

 </xref> The group of Moreno et al,
 <xref rid="jmv25777-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">

 </xref> described two β‐coronaviruses closely associated with MERS‐CoV and present in very common bat species, that is, 
 <italic>P. kuhlii</italic> and 
 <italic>H. savii</italic>), widespread in the Northern regions of Italy. This study fills a substantive gap in the knowledge of bat‐CoV ecology in Italy and extends the current knowledge of clade 2c β‐coronaviruses with new sequences obtained from bats that have not been previously described as hosts of these viruses. According to the authors, the mean evolutionary rate was estimated as 2.15 × 10
 <sup>−6</sup> substitutions/site, corresponding to a value of 7.8 × 10
 <sup>−4</sup> substitutions/year, so retrieving an estimated tMRCA dating back to 10 September.

 </xref> The conclusions reported by the authors showed that the evolutionary rate of the novel SARS‐CoV2 is online with the SARS and MERS ones.
