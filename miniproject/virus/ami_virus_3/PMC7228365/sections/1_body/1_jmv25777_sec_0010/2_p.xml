<p>The authors reported their conclusions by taking into account coalescent analysis and a birth‐death method to estimate the SARS‐CoV2 ancestor and establish unequivocally the origin of pandemics.

 </xref> Despite the trivial observation that a common reader of these issues may raise that is, that genetic divergence cannot be confused with a phylogenetic difference, RNA viruses mutation rate and their maintenance in the population structure or the balancing selection must be debated with great caution.

 </xref> It is well known that, particularly for viral pathogens, their ecological (genetic) and evolutionary dynamics may occur in the same timescale where potential cross interactions represent a fundamental hallmark. As regards RNA viruses, such as coronaviruses, the nucleotide mutation rate is at least a million times higher respect to a vertebrate, frequently recombine their genomes, between animals and humans, and are therefore highly pushed by evolutionary selection to adapt and survive in the animal‐human coexisting population.

 </xref> This should suggest that the cross‐talk between evolution and epidemiology is closely intertwined, causing that the maintenance of an onward transmission might be crucially associated with a continuous viral adaptation.
