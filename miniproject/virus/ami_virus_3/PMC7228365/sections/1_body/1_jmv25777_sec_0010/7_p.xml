<p>Previous reports have outlined that the genetic difference in the Spike protein sequence, between the most frequent human coronavirus genotypes such as HCoV‐NL63, HCoV‐229E and HCoV‐OC43, and SARS or MERS coronaviruses, is practically absolute (100%), so describing new emerging species in the human coronavirus outbreaks.
