 <xref rid="jmv25777-tbl-0001" ref-type="table">1</xref> shows the Waterman‐Eggert score and similarity of main zoonotic coronavirus genomes and the SARS‐Cov2 Italian genomic sequence (Gene Bank MT_008022.1) of about 322 nucleotides, from a BLAST evaluation on 60 different genome sequences. The similarity is higher than 85%, a similarity quite similar for previous human SARS outbreaks, for example, the 2004‐SARS epidemic virus (Gene Bank NC_004718.3), with a similarity of 84% but not with MERS coronavirus (Gene Bank NC_019843.3), with 56.9% of similarity.
