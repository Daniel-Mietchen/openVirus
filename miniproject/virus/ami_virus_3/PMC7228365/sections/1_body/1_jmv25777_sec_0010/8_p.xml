<p>The low kinship with other human coronavirus outbreaks, such as MERS, suggests that human coronaviruses rapidly evolve in the local population and rapidly disappear, probably via evolutionary adaptation, via an immune pressure. Briefly speaking and despite the fact that SARS HCoV was a newly emerging virus likewise SARS‐CoV2, the COVID19 causing agent, when the outbreak occurred in 2002 to 2003, worldwide alarming and warnings widespread in lesser extent respect to the current SARS‐CoV2 claim.

 </xref> dismiss the hypothesis of pangolin as a possible intermediate, mainly focusing on bats. We do not know if in Italy a wide genetic subfamily of β‐coronaviruses coexisted in the country due to zoonotic spillover and population spreading caused by the very frequent human exchanges with also Chinese people from endemic areas. This issue has not been thoroughly investigated so far, because of the urgent need to diagnose infected individuals just following the Wuhan outbreak, but it might have an important consequence also in political decisions.
