<p id="p0225">Addressing each of these points would be required for 
 <italic>calibrating</italic> any WBE monitoring method so that data could be related to actual per capita infection rates. A number of different means have been proposed, the inverse regression of qPCR cycle thresholds with known infection rates being one example (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Bar Or et al., 2020</xref>). Only if calibration could be achieved, would WBE then be able to reliably estimate the total number of infected people at any given time. It would then also be enabled to compare the infection rates
