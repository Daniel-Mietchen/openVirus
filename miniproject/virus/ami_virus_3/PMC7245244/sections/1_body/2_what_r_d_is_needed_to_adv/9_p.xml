<p id="p0185">Developing the third approach, in particular, will depend on addressing the following primary questions. These questions become more challenging when the objective is to try and measure the incidence of active infection (on a per capita basis). The following are key:

   <p id="p0190">Required is a much better understanding of the intra- and inter-person variability in the magnitude of excretion (shedding) of detectable biomarkers from the virus in its infectious state (whether nucleic acids or proteins) — within-day, across days, and duration. The power of drawing conclusions from WBE monitoring will be a direct function of the range in these variabilities for individuals and the general population. The greater the variability, the harder it will be to determine if infections are from a few super-shedders or from a large portion of the population (e.g., see: 
    <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>; 
    <xref rid="bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Petterson, 2020</xref>; 
    <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al., 2020b</xref>). It is possible that an antigen unique to SARS-CoV-2 might partition to excreta with more fidelity and better reproducibility. Furthermore, because of the duration of RNA excretion via the stool, it may not reflect active infections. This means that the collective signal of sewage RNA at any point in time might reflect unknown portions of active and past infections.

   <p id="p0195">If RNA is the targeted marker, there are currently too many unknowns surrounding the kinetics of viral load and excretion over the entire course of an infection (
    <xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Joynt and Wu, 2020</xref>). To date, the published data on targeted markers for SARS-CoV-2 in feces (primarily RNA), or the viable virus itself, is insufficient for the modeling required for WBE. This is because nearly all of these data derive from clinical studies, which almost always use low numbers of case samples. A larger, randomized analytical study would be needed to shed more light on this important point. Currently, clinicians are motivated to monitor feces for four major clinical reasons (e.g., see: 
    <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Ianiro et al., 2020</xref>; 
    <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2020</xref>; 
    <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020</xref>): (1) A critical concern is whether infectious virus occurs in fecal microbiota transplant samples, so mandatory screening could become important (
    <xref rid="bb0265" ref-type="bibr">Ng et al., 2020</xref>). (2) Concern exists as to whether the fecal-oral transmission route could prove significant. (3) Feces could become an alternative route for clinical diagnostic testing for Covid-19. (4) In many cases, feces continue to test RNA-positive long after the respiratory tract tests negative, and it is therefore important to know whether these cases still pose an infection threat.

   <p id="p0200">Whatever the targeted marker(s) might be, the excretion-route distribution needs to be known (e.g., fecal versus urine). The limited studies to date indicate that the fecal route is more important for SAR-CoV-2, at least for nucleic acids; but it is unknown for possible antigen targets. Likewise, the partitioning of a marker between feces and the liquid sewage needs to be established.</p>

   <p id="p0205">The half-life (persistence) of the marker in wastewater must be known. It cannot be too long, otherwise it would be a trailing measure of infection, as its levels would be less prone to concentration change in sewage. Persistence is partly a function of temperature.</p>

   <p id="p0215">The sampling and analytical approaches will range from simple batch methodologies (where individual samples are collected) to time-integrated sampling and continuous monitoring (which would more closely represent “real-time” monitoring). The latter would pose far more challenges to develop but would be amenable to remote data collection. Indeed, sewer networks have already been undergoing automation, primarily for maintenance and remote control. However, much development has already been devoted to a wide range of sensors for parameters important to sewage treatment (e.g., see: 
    <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">Setford et al., 2018</xref>). This could provide an existing platform within which WBE sensors could eventually be integrated to fully automate monitoring and its remote reporting.

   <p id="p0220">For a quantitative approach, it is important to know the population size that contributes to an individual sewage treatment plant (to calculate the percentage of infected population). This can be an extremely onerous problem (

    <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Daughton, 2018</xref>). Important to keep in mind is that an endogenous, excreted proxy marker for per capita population would remove the need to know the population size of a sewershed and could prove more accurate for estimating real-time population size (
