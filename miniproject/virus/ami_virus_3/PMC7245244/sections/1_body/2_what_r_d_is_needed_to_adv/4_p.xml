<p id="p0160">The attractiveness of WBE has always resided in its conceptual simplicity. However, resolution of some complex, underlying technical details could stymie its full potential value as a widely adopted monitoring approach for community-wide health and disease. For Covid-19, one of the most important details is signal calibration â€” what do the data actually mean? The biggest unknown surrounds the need to calibrate the targeted marker for Covid-19 (which currently is primarily viral RNA) against the actual number of cases the signal actually represents. But as already mentioned, this problem might be more easily solved by targeting key endogenous biomarkers instead.</p>
