<p id="p0065">With this brief thumbnail sketch of the world's current quagmire, this paper discusses the potentially key role that environmental science could play in solving some of the many obstacles and challenges currently faced in monitoring the spread of Covid-19. The existing tools were designed specifically for diagnostic (or serological) testing of individuals. Scaling these conventional tests for mass surveillance of populations is fraught with tremendous challenges, including the extremely high costs for repeatedly testing large portions of population (
