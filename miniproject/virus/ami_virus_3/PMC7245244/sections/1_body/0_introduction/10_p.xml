<p id="p0070">Over the last 20 years, environmental scientists continue to develop an armamentarium of monitoring and epidemiological tools capable of measuring the combined, collective activities or health status of entire populations. This approach is analogous to conventional diagnostic urinalysis performed en masse but instead targets sewage (

However, the numbers of research projects and pilot studies currently planned or in progress globally far exceed these and are rapidly growing. Three current review articles discuss many of the complex issues surrounding the application of WBE to infectious disease tracking — Covid-19 in particular (
