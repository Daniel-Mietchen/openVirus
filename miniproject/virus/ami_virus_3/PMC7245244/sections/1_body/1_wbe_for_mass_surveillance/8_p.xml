<p id="p0105">One of the more important potential advantages of WBE over diagnostic testing would be an ability to detect Covid-19 before it might be possible with surveillance using random diagnostic testing. This would partly rely on the timing of virus shedding via the stool with respect to the initiation of infection or the onset of signs and symptoms (if any). But it is not yet clear if any generalizations will ever be possible. The time at which RNA from SARS-CoV-2 becomes PCR-detectable from shedding into stool can vary widely (and not even occur in all cases) – within one or several days of symptom onset and persisting for a month or so beyond the resolution of signs and symptoms – even for children (
