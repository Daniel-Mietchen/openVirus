<p id="p0095">The application of WBE can be extended beyond its current confines that were imposed by privacy, ethics, and legal concerns — boundaries recognized in WBE's pre-existing applications for illicit drug monitoring (

Its utility for targeting where diagnostic testing should be directed could be amplified by monitoring smaller, key, confined sub-populations. Major targets to monitor would include the following (some of which have already proved problematic by promoting outbreaks): schools, universities (e.g., dormitories), congested public housing (where new cases can be easily overlooked and outbreak clusters can quickly emerge), hospitals, long-term care facilities, prisons, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, meat processors, maritime ships, naval vessels (e.g.,

Of particular interest would also be sub-populations under-served by healthcare — whether because adequate healthcare is not available or because certain individuals actively avoid seeking health care (
