<p id="p0100">The reality is that massive-scale diagnostic-based testing is simply not possible in most countries given the enormous costs and current limitations of manufacturing and supply-chains. Testing must get smarter and better targeted. This is where WBE becomes so important. By avoiding the testing of populations likely to be negative, WBE would serve to magnify the value of diagnostics testing by “making them count”. One of the biggest challenges for many countries, regions, states, and cities is the formulation of a data-driven strategy for guiding when to “re-open” economies and when they might need to re-close during resurgence (

WBE could play a key role in optimizing these decisions by providing the earliest possible dates for: (1) beginning the post-isolation phase (when businesses could restart and population isolation could be terminated) and (2) reinstatement of population-wide isolation upon Covid-19 rebound or seasonal re-emergence. This early-warning ability minimizes the major dual problems of re-opening too soon or isolating too late, both of which could set back public trust even further and cause yet more damage to economies. By establishing baselines for the incidence of Covid-19 before re-opening, both resurgence and acceleration could be readily detected.
