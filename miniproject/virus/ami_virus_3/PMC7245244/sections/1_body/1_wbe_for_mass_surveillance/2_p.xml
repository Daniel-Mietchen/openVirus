<p id="p0075">The most adverse domino effects from an epidemic can be reduced or minimized only by implementing sufficient, timely, targeted testing. But what is considered sufficient testing? Testing during epidemics has always been impaired by the lack of any option other than application of tests designed for clinical detection and diagnosis of current infections (or serological tests for establishing past infections, e.g., 
 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Gronvall et al., 2020</xref>). Most importantly, this approach to testing needs to continually increase test coverage (i.e., the percentage of the population tested) until a key level is achieved. This level is the number of tests that must be completed in order to reveal a single positive (confirmed) case. This ratio is the most direct indicator of the extent of infection in the general population (
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Hasell et al., 2020</xref>). A low ratio (when using random sampling) points to a high incidence of infection and therefore the need for more intensive testing until the ratio significantly increases (where ever-increasing amounts of testing are required to confirm each additional case of infection). This indicates increasing success in containment or mitigation measures.
