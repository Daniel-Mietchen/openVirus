<p id="p0090">Metaphors likening the control of Covid-19 to war can be useful. As such, WBE's role in fighting the spread of Covid-19 would be analogous to warfare where “forward observers” are used to improve the outcomes of artillery fire by greatly improving the accuracy of targeting. WBE would, in effect, provide a call warning for fire (i.e., “start diagnostic testing here”), directing fire, adjusting fire, and confirming mission accomplished. This would greatly reduce the demand for diagnostic testing and also reduce supply-chain shortages caused by insufficient manufacturing capacity. The metric of success for WBE when used for targeting the use of clinical diagnostic testing would be lower ratios for “Tests Administered” per “Case Confirmed” (counter intuitively, maximize the positivity test rate).</p>
