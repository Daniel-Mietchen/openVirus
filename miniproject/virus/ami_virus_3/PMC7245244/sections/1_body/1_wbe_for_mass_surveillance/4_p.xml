<p id="p0085">The first can be partly accomplished with the use of more advanced versions of current diagnostic tests (

Pooled-sample analysis could greatly increase testing capacity and throughput, especially for PCR-based methods (nucleic acidâˆ’based polymerase chain reaction); although not as sensitive as PCR testing, antigen testing (e.g., capsid proteins) is just emerging for SARS-CoV-2, with the US FDA's emergency use authorization for the first antigen test (
