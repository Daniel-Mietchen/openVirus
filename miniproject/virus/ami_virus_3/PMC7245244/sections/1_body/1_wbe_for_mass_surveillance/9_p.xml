<p id="p0110">As an aside, an important point merits some consideration. There is no reason that WBE must be based on the same analytical platforms used in clinical diagnostic testing (i.e., direct measures of viral infection such as PCR or antigen testing). WBE for Covid-19 (or diseases caused by any other infectious agent) need not be limited to the monitoring of the actual infectious agent's nucleic acid or an antigen. WBE's usefulness could be greatly expanded by targeting endogenous biomarkers that are significantly elevated in the diseased state. Benefits of targeting indirect markers of infection might include reduced analytical costs and broader availability (e.g., by use of immunoassays) or serving as better leading indicators of infection (providing the possibility of earlier alerts); biomarkers that are excreted extensively in urine (as opposed to feces), for example, would simplify sewage sampling and sample preparation prior to analysis. A likely place to start evaluating the use of biomarkers would be to make use of the fact that Covid-19 can involve extensive inflammatory damage. The archetype biomarker for systemic oxidative stress is the prostaglandin-like class of substances called isoprostanes (

Testing for biomarkers might have several other major advantages over the use of PCR: (i) biomarkers might be more universally excreted among infected individuals, (ii) excreted levels might better track the severity of infection, (iii) biomarker testing might have tighter ranges for per-capita excretion, facilitating better calibration and more accurate estimations of the number of infected individuals in a community, and (iv) avoiding a potential under-appreciated problem with using PCR, where RNA fragments may not be originating from viable virus, but rather from virus remnants (litter) from cleared infections and therefore could be overestimating the incidence or intensity of existing infections. This could well be a cause of repeated reports of recovered patients again testing positive for Covid-19 (e.g.,
