<p id="p0135">Also worth emphasizing is that WBE might be the only means of indirectly inferring the portion of the total population that remains uninfected at any moment in time. In effect, this information serves to complement diagnostic testing (and syndromic surveillance) and to more fully construct the so-called surveillance pyramid. Likewise, it could provide better perspective on how well the results of diagnostic testing are reflecting the status of the general population. It also might be the best way to convince a doubting public when infections are indeed spreading (but not yet reflected in hospital statistics) and whether the spreading has entered an acceleration phase. Of great importance, near-real-time community-wide monitoring could greatly increase community connectedness and sense of purpose, thereby improving willingness to comply with government recommendations for distancing and self-isolation. Importantly, and contrarily, WBE could reveal that suppositions regarding infectivity and spreading may have been overestimated (see contrarian views:
