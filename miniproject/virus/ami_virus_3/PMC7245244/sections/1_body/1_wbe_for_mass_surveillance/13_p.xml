<p id="p0130">WBE could play an integral role in minimizing the occurrence of surges of serious cases whose numbers can overwhelm critical care hospital capacities and long-term care facilities. Preventing hospital surges is also critically important for minimizing a “collateral pandemic” (
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Galarza and Gazzeri, 2020</xref>). There could be untold numbers of non-Covid-19 cases who die prematurely, or unnecessarily, or with untimely/inadequate care — all indirectly because of Covid-19. Once critical care capacity is exceeded by Covid-19 patients, this serves to amplify deaths and morbidities for those who did not receive care simply because they were non-Covid-19 patients. This includes those who refuse or delay in seeking medical attention because of fear of contracting Covid-19, those who must wait too long to receive care, and those who had to be diverted to facilities incapable of providing sufficient care. Any action that can reduce hospital surges (such as “flattening the curve” of infection transmission) will reduce overall deaths. Early warnings are therefore critical.
