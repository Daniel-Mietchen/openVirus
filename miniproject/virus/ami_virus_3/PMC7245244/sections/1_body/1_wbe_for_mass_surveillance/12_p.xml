<p id="p0125">Note that since WBE has the ability to detect Covid-19 days before random diagnostic testing of asymptomatic individuals, it could save critical days in facilitating a head-start for contact tracing (e.g., 
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Allen et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">Watson et al., 2020</xref>) because follow-up diagnostic testing can be better targeted to locate the infected individual(s). It would therefore have the potential to short-circuit significant forward transmission.
