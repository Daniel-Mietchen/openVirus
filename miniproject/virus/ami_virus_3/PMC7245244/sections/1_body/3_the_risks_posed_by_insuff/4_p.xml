<p id="p0245">Isolation policies and physical distancing can lead to a sense of anger and personal aggrievement. One outcome is public unrest and defiance of suppression and mitigation measures, imposing additional stress on law enforcement and increasing the burden for more contact tracing and greatly endangering already over-stressed healthcare workers. Finally, democracies depend on un-suppressed, fully accessible voting. A public that feels unsafe to vote can self-suppress; even voter registration can be suppressed. It is imperative that the public trust is ensured by establishing credibility and a reputation for safety. In addition, this is best accomplished through a well-conceived and transparent nationwide testing system.</p>
