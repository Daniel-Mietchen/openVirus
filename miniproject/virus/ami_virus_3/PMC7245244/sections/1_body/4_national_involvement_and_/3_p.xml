<p id="p0265">Science typically advances in incremental, evolutionary steps, often catalyzed by competition between research groups. Revolutionary advancements also occur, but much less frequently. The fight against Covid-19 will require greatly accelerated development of an armamentarium of tools across a wide spectrum of disciplines in the sciences, medicine, and engineering. Advancements in WBE alone will require collaboration and coordination not just within individual disciplines, but also across disparate disciplines that traditionally are separate: analytical chemists, immunochemists, biochemists, environmental and civil engineers, wastewater treatment operators, computer modelers, statisticians, clinical scientists, pharmacologists, infectious disease specialists, public health experts, microbiologists (particularly virologists), epidemiologists, social scientists/psychologists, and communication/messaging experts (especially risk communication), among others.</p>
