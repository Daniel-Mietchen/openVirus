<p id="p0275">Scores of local WBE pilot projects targeted at Covid-19 have been started or planned in cities around the world. However, this does not promote leveraging of worldwide knowledge and best practices, nor is it efficient at promoting uniform, standardized WBE for adoption at national scales. The research and development needed to advance WBE for fighting Covid-19 would benefit greatly from national and international direction, coordination, and government funding (

A unified worldwide plan would also help to minimize duplicative efforts and conserve resources. The ultimate objective would be to develop standardized, optimized, quality-assured WBE testing protocols that could be implemented worldwide — optimally as nationalized networks; few efforts to date have been directed at standardization and inter-laboratory studies (e.g., see: 
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">WRF, 2020</xref>). Standardized testing would be critical for promoting intercomparisons of all monitoring data — at local, state, regional, national, and cross-nation levels. All future advancements and best practices could be continually incorporated into harmonized methods. Furthermore, a geographically fragmented WBE data collection and reporting system would pose the same problems that already plague some clinical diagnostics networks at the national scale (
