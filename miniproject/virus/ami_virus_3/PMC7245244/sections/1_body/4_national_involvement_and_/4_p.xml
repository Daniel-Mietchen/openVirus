<p id="p0270">One particularly important aspect of communication pertains to the perception of risk by the public. When WBE is applied to surveillance of infectious disease, clarity is essential in that WBE is not being used to monitor for viable, infectious virions (colloquially called “live” virus and which must instead be determined by traditional plaque-based assay), but rather to monitor for remnants of virus particles that serve as definitive indicators of active infections. This distinction is important for preventing public anxiety from the erroneous belief that “live” virus is rampant in sewage and could be released to surface waters.</p>
