  <p>Evasion and inhibition of respiratory virus-induced IFN-I signaling. Many respiratory viruses can inhibit and modulate their detection using diverse strategies, thereby inhibiting the IFN-I production. Circular boxes in black background represent the viral protein involved in the pathway inhibition. Abbreviations: NS: nonstructural protein; V: V protein; C: C protein; SH: small hydrophobic protein.</p>
