<p>IFN-I production occurs primarily when pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) present on the cell surface or in the cytosolic compartment of virtually all cell types are stimulated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. The most widely studied PRRs are Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Ten different TLRs have been identified in humans, all of which detect PAMPs either on the cell surface or the lumen of intracellular vesicles, such as endosomes or lysosomes, and are involved in the recognition of a particular type of PAMP [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. TLRs recognize different pathogen components, including double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) (TLR-3), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) (TLR-7), or CpG DNA [
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Other PPRs include retinoic acid-inducible gene-I- (RIG-I-) like receptors (RLRs) and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain- (NOD-) like receptors (NLRs).
