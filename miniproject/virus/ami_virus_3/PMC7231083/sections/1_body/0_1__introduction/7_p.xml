<p>Dendritic cells (DCs) play a key role in the production of IFN-I. Although both myeloid DC (mDC) and plasmacytoid DC (pDC) produce IFN, the latter express specialized TLR-7 and TLR-9 and has a high constitutive expression of IRF-7 that allow them to respond to viruses with rapid and extremely robust IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> production [
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Upon activation and production of IFN, pDCs mature into antigen-presenting cells (APC) serving as a key link between the innate and adaptive immune responses [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, DCs produce IL-12, which drives naïve T cells into Th1-type responses, as well as IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>, which increases the frequency of IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> producing CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, IFN-I also boost natural killer (NK) and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses, promoting both survival and clonal expansion of the latter [
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>–
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> lead to an immediate innate antiviral response and stimulate the adaptive immune system, affecting myeloid cells, NK cells, T cells, and B cells to mount an adequate Th1-biased immune response [
