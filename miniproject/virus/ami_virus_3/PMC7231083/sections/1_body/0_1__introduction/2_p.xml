 <italic>β</italic>, and it also includes IFN-
 <italic>ο</italic>, IFN-
 <italic>δ</italic>, IFN-

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], which directly mediate a potent antiviral response. IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> includes 13 partially homologous members, encoded by chromosome 9, while IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> is composed by a single member and the gene is located on chromosome 12 [
