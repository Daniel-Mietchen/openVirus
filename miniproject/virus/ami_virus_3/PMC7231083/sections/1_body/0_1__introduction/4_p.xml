<p>The recognition of TLR ligands leads to the recruitment of adaptor molecules that contain Toll interleukin-1 receptors (TIR) such as TIR-domain-containing adapter (TRIF), TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM), Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88), or TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAP), leading the activation of molecular cascades that finally promote the activation of nuclear transcription factors such as nuclear factor
