<p>The viral infectious cycle involves several steps, and ISGs target different stages of the viral cycle. For example, PKR, which was among the first ISG described, is a PRR that recognizes dsRNA, inducing IFN production and further ISG production [

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. ADAR is a nucleic acid editing enzyme that disrupts base pairing. ADAR catalyzes the deamination of adenosine (A) to produce inosine (I) in dsRNA, inducing the replacement of the AU base pair by IU, which produces dsRNA destabilization [
