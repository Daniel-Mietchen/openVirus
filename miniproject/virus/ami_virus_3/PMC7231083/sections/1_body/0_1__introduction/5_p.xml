<p>Both IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> use the same receptor, IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>/
 <italic>β</italic> receptor (IFNAR), which is expressed on a vast variety of cell types [
 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1(b)</xref>). This receptor is associated with Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) and Tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>/IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> binding to IFNAR activates JAK1 and TYK2, which subsequently phosphorylate the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2 [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], among other less characterized transcription factors such as STAT3, STAT4, and STAT5. Once phosphorylated, these factors associate with IRF-9 to form the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 complex (ISGF3). In the nucleus, this complex binds specific DNA sequences containing IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) that promote the transcription of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) including IRF-1, IRF-7, IRF-8, and IRF-9, whose function is to inhibit viral replication and induce an antiviral response in the area of the infected cell [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Some ISGs have been widely studied; the best known members include IFN dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR), 2′-5′oligoadenilate synthetase (OAS), IFN-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM), dsRNA-specific adenosine deaminase (ADAR), and Myxovirus resistance protein A (MxA) and B (MxB) [
