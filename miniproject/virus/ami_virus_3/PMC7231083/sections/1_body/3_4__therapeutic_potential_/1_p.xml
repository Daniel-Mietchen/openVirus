<p>Upon recognition of viral infection, the cell, through PRRs, mediates the production of IFN-I leading to the transcription of hundreds of ISGs by the JAK/STAT pathway [
 <xref rid="B301" ref-type="bibr">301</xref>]. ISGs are the effectors of cell-autonomous antiviral defense and have been shown to be very effective at resisting and controlling pathogens. ISGs are induced to vastly different levels during viral infection or IFN treatment, and expression levels are often dependent on time, dose, and cell type. They act at different stages of the viral life cycle, from entry, replication, assembly, and release, providing adequate cellular immunity against both RNA and DNA viruses [
 <xref rid="B302" ref-type="bibr">302</xref>]. Microarray studies have identified between 50–1000 ISGs, with 200–500 genes typical of many cell types. Representative and well-studied ISG members with specific or broad antiviral activities include IRF1, IRF3, IRF7, IRF9, IFITM3, ISG15, and OASL. The products of these ISGs exert numerous antiviral effector functions, many of which are still not fully described. However, as the mechanisms of more IFN effectors are uncovered, it is likely that their modes of action will collectively span the majority of virus life cycle stages [
