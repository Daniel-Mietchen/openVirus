<p>Several ISGs have been described in the setting of respiratory viruses (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Recent work has shown that the egress of the influenza virus is also targeted by an ISG. Viperin interacts with the cellular enzyme farnesyl diphosphatesynthase to perturb lipid rafts, resulting in inhibition of influenza and rhinovirus release [
 <xref rid="B305" ref-type="bibr">305</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B306" ref-type="bibr">306</xref>]. In addition, ZAP, which can be upregulated independently from IFN production, limits influenza virus replication via the enhancement of RIG-I [
 <xref rid="B307" ref-type="bibr">307</xref>]. TRIM56 is another ISG with broad antiviral activity. Although its upregulation is dependent on IFN-I, it abrogates influenza virus A and B and HCoV infection through STING and TLR-3/TRIF [
 <xref rid="B308" ref-type="bibr">308</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B309" ref-type="bibr">309</xref>]. TRIM21 has shown activity against rhinovirus by intercepting incoming antibody-opsonized virions during cellular infection, mediating efficient postentry neutralization [
 <xref rid="B310" ref-type="bibr">310</xref>]. A new human IFN-induced gene that we have termed ISG20 codes for a 3′ to 5′ exonuclease with specificity for single-stranded RNA and, to a lesser extent, for DNA. ISG20-overexpressing HeLa cells showed resistance to infections by the influenza virus. The mechanism has been shown to be related to the impairment of the polymerase activity, inhibiting both the replication and transcription [
 <xref rid="B311" ref-type="bibr">311</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B312" ref-type="bibr">312</xref>]. Finally, TDRD7 (tudor domain containing 7) has shown activity against several paramyxoviruses, such as HPIV3 and RSV by interfering with the activation of AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). The activation of AMPK is required for efficient replication. TDRD7 interferes with the activation of AMPK, limiting viral replication [
