<p>Several ISGs have been reported to inhibit flavivirus infection through different mechanisms (
 <xref rid="tab2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The expression of IFN-I inducible ISGs such as IFITM2/3, viperin, ISG15, ISG20, OAS, BST2, RyDEN, TRIM69, and IFI6 has been shown to block DENV infection [
 <xref rid="B314" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>–
 <xref rid="B320" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>] at multiple steps of the viral cycle. IFITM2 and IFITM3 disrupted the early steps (entry and/or uncoating) of DENV and WNV infection [
 <xref rid="B314" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B316" ref-type="bibr">316</xref>]. In contrast, three IFN-induced cellular enzymes, viperin, ISG20, and dsRNA-activated protein kinase, inhibited the steps of the DENV and WNV cycle in viral proteins and/or RNA biosynthesis [
 <xref rid="B314" ref-type="bibr">314</xref>]. DENV infection-induced viperin which has antiviral properties residing in the C-terminal region of the protein that acts to restrict early DENV RNA production/accumulation, potentially via the interaction of viperin with DENV NS3 and replication complexes [
 <xref rid="B315" ref-type="bibr">315</xref>]. The expression of the Repressor of yield of DENV (RyDEN) conferred resistance to all serotypes of DENV in human cells. RyDEN is likely to interfere with the translation of DENV via interaction with viral RNA and cellular mRNA-binding proteins, resulting in the inhibition of virus replication in infected cells [
 <xref rid="B317" ref-type="bibr">317</xref>]. OAS and its downstream effector RNase L have been reported to block DENV replication and likely contributed to host defense against DENV infection playing a role in determining the outcomes of DENV disease severity [
 <xref rid="B318" ref-type="bibr">318</xref>]. ZIKV has been reported to induce the expression of ISG15 in primary human corneal epithelial cells, and the silencing of ISG15 increased ZIKV infectivity [
 <xref rid="B321" ref-type="bibr">321</xref>]. ISG15 has also inhibited the replication of several flaviviruses, including DENV, WNV, and JEV [
 <xref rid="B322" ref-type="bibr">322</xref>–
 <xref rid="B324" ref-type="bibr">324</xref>]. IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>-inducible protein 6 (IFI6), an endoplasmic reticulum- (ER-) localized integral membrane effector, prophylactically protected uninfected cells by preventing the formation of virus-induced ER membrane invaginations that house flavivirus (YFV, WNV, and DENV) replication machinery [
 <xref rid="B320" ref-type="bibr">320</xref>]. TRIM69 interacts with DENV NS3 directly and mediates its ubiquitination and degradation, thus, interrupting DENV replication [
 <xref rid="B319" ref-type="bibr">319</xref>]. Recently, Schlafen 11, an ISG that controls the synthesis of proteins by regulating tRNA abundance, has been reported to restrict WNV, DENV, and ZIKV replication by impairing viral infectivity [
