<p>Influenza virus is primarily recognized by two different types of PRRs: RLRs and TLRs. Regarding the RLR family, RIG-I, LGP2, and MDA5 sense viral RNA during viral replication in the cytoplasm [
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>–
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. Once activated, RIG-I and MDA5 interact with the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), leading the activation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and IRF-3 to stimulate IFN production (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). On the other hand, LGP2 has been related to the regulation of RIG and MDA5 activation [
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Two different TLRs are activated by influenza virus, TLR-3 and TLR-7. The stimulation of TLR-3 in DCs and macrophages signal through TRIF, activating IRF-3/ NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, leading to IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> secretion. On the other hand, TLR-7 in DCs activates MyD88, which activates IRF-7 and produces the secretion of both IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> [
