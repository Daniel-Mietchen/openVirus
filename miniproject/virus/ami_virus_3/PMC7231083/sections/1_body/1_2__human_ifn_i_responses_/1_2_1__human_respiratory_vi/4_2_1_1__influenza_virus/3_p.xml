<p>Influenza virus NS1 suppresses IFN synthesis through several different mechanisms [

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). First, it limits the pretranscriptional induction of IFN by forming a complex with RIG-I and limiting its signaling [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Second, it directly limits the extent of the antiviral state by inhibiting PKR by sequestering dsRNA and by forming a complex with PKR avoiding its activation [
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. Third, it inhibits mRNA maturation by interfering with the effector domain of the 3′-end processing [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Finally, NS1 activates phosphatidyl-inositol-3 kinases (PI3K) which can delay apoptosis of infected cells [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>].
