<p>The IFN response seems to be contributing simultaneously to the protection against viruses and to the pathology induced by the same viral infections. Human pDCs demonstrate a robust IFN-I production after MERS-CoV infection, especially IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>, and this response is greater than that elicited by SARS-CoV [

 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>γ</italic> have been associated with early SARS-CoV sequelae suggesting that unregulated IFN responses during acute-phase SARS-CoV may be deleterious for this infection [
