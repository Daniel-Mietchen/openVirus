<p>RSV is a common virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. RSV is a negative-sense ssRNA virus that causes a wide range of symptoms and the severity can vary from mild to lethal disease [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. RSV is especially severe in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals [
