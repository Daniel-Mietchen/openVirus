<p>Like other viruses, HCoVs use multiple mechanisms to evade IFN-I immune response. Evidence shows that different viral structures can inhibit or modulate the IFN production or activity. Thereby, NS protein-16 codified by SARS-CoV and HCoV-229E induces the methylation of viral mRNA cap structures that inhibit recognition by MDA5 [
