<p>Although RSV can lead to IFN-I production through multiple pathways, it has been established that this virus in particular is a poor stimulator of IFN-I. Unlike other respiratory viruses, studies have shown a limited role for IFNs in response to RSV infection [

 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Thereby, NS1 and NS2 (2 proteins encoded by RSV) appear to interact (and interfere) with multiple molecules of the IFN pathway (RIG-I, TRAF3, and IRF-3), which then interfere with IFN synthesis [

 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> was augmented and this increase was associated with a reduction in viral titer [

 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>], thus, inhibiting IFN-
