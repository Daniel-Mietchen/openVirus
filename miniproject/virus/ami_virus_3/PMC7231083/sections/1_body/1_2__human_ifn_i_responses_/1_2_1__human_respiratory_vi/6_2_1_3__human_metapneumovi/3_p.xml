<p>It is worth noting that the vast majority of cells express IRF-7 only after the activation of IRF-3 (which is expressed constitutively and is activated essentially by the RIG-I/MAVS pathway) or in response to IFNs. Importantly, TLR-7 is the main PRR that participates in sensing hMPV by pDCs, whereas MDA5-MAVS is the major pathway mediating hMPV sensing in conventional DCs [
