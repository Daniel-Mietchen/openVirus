<p>The family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> contains two subfamilies, the 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> and the 
 <italic>Torovirinae</italic>. They are a large group of positive-sense ssRNA genome viruses that can infect mammals and birds, causing a wide variety of diseases which can lead to frequent mutations and infections of new species. They have been divided into four genera, two of which, alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus contain viruses infecting humans [

 <xref rid="B134" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. HCoVs had been regarded as mildly pathogenic until the early 2000s. At that time, a new disease appeared in China, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was quickly attributed to a new HCoV, the SARS-CoV. Following that outbreak, a related but different HCoV producing severe respiratory disease emerged, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [
