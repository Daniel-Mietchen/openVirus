<p>This group of viruses is known to encode proteins that block innate immune responses to viral infections, allowing PIV replication. As mentioned above, pathogen RNA synthesis provides strong stimuli to mount an IFN immune response. PIV-1 and PIV-3 encode C proteins, while PIV-2 encodes a V protein. Both proteins, C and V, are involved in the blockade of IFN-I induction by preventing PKR activation [

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>]. The viral strategy in the case of PIV-1 and PIV-3 is to avoid the IFN production. PIV-1 does not inhibit the IFN pathway, given that the synthesis of the viral RNA can activate IFN production. Rather, the viral C protein modulates its RNA production, preventing MDA5 activation [

 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. This protein also interferes with STAT1, avoiding signaling through this pathway and thus IFN production [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. The V protein of PIV-2 interferes with the IFN production in different ways. One of the mechanisms is the inhibition of MDA5 activation [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. In addition, the highly conserved V protein Cys-rich domain has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient to limit the activation of the IFN-

 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. Finally, the V protein interferes with the IFN pathway by abolishing STAT2 signaling [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>]. Interestingly, there is evidence that shows that this protein also regulates viral RNA production (as PIV C protein) [
