<p>PIVs are a group of nonenveloped, negative-sense, ssRNA viruses that belong to the 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> family. First isolated in the 1950s, PIVs are composed of five different (antigenic and genetic) types, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, and PIV-4 with two subtypes PIV-4a and PIV-4b [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>]. The virus was named 
 <italic>Parainfluenza</italic> because it produces influenza-like disease and has a lipid envelope and hemagglutination and neuraminidase activities [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Worldwide, PIVs are important causes of upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses. Although PIV infections are generally self-limiting, some patients require hospitalization and the disease may lead to mortality, especially in children under the age of five years [
