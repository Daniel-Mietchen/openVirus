<p>Different PRRs are involved in HRV recognition, belonging to two different families of receptors: TLRs (TLR-2, 3, 7, and 8) and RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5). TLR-2 on the cell surface recognizes the virus capsid, even without viral replication. In addition, TLR-3, TLR-7, and TLR-8 localized in intracellular compartments are stimulated once the viral particle is internalized and the dsRNA/ssRNA is sensed [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. The TLR stimulation leads to the activation of downstream signaling molecules that activate IRF-3, IRF-7, and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, triggering IFN-I secretion. The evidence regarding TLR-3 is somewhat unclear; while one study described an important role for this receptor in the host response against the HRV infection [
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>], others found no function for this PRR [
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>]. The HRV genome is also recognized by RIG-I and MDA5 (both localized in the cytosol) which can recognize ssRNA and dsRNA, respectively. The RLR stimulation leads to the activation of MAVS and the consequent activation of NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and IRF, triggering the production of IFN-I in the airway cells [

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. Responses mediated by IFN-I 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> are critical for the antiviral effects that limit HRV through the activation of NK cells [
