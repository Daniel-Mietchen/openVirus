<p>Similar to other respiratory viruses, HRV seems to suppress IFN synthesis using multiple strategies. Even though IFN evasion mechanisms have been well-studied in other enteroviruses, the information for HRV is scarce. A study showed that the MAVS adaptor is cleaved by 2A and 3C proteases of HRV to stop IFN-I signal transduction [
