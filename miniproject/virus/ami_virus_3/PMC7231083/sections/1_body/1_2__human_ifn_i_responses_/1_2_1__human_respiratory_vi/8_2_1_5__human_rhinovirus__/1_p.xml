<p>HRV is a small, nonenveloped, positive-sense, ssRNA virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> family. The family is divided into three species: rhinovirus A, B, and C [
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. HRV is a ubiquitous seasonal microorganism and is the most frequent cause of common cold (causing more than 50% of upper respiratory tract infections in humans worldwide). Given that the viral genetic diversity is huge (&gt;160 serotypes), recurrent infections with this virus are frequent. Although HRV infections are not life-threatening, they can be also detected in the lower airways where they can cause severe exacerbations in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [
