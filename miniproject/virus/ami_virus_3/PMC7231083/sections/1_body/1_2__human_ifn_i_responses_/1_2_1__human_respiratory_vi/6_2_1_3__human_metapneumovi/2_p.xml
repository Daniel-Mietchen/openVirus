<p>Similar to RSV, two major pathways for the secretion of IFN-I during hMPV infection have been described. Each pathway involves different types of PRRs, one utilizes RLRs and the other TLRs. The former is primarily activated by RIG-I and MDA5, whereas the latter involves TLR-3 and TLR-7. RIG-I- and MDA5-mediated signal transduction begins when viral RNA is sensed in the cytosol. This recognition leads to the activation of IRF-3 and IRF-7 through the MAVS pathway [
