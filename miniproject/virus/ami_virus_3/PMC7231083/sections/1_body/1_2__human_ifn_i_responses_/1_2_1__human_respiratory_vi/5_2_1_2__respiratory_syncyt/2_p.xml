<p>Several PRRs are involved in RSV recognition, including TLRs (TLR-2, TLR-3, TLR-4, and TLR-7), RLRs (RIG-I and MDA5), and NLRs (NOD-2). IFN-I production during RSV infection is activated by different mechanisms (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). TLR-3 detects dsRNA during viral replication and signals through TRIF, which activates IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> production through NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B and IRF-3 pathway [
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Other important PRRs for IFN-I production are RIG-I and MDA5 which subsequently link MAVS. This recruits TRAF2/6 and TRAF3 which leads to the activation of IRF-7 and IRF-3 through NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Together, these IRFs stimulate ISRE sequences that promote IFN-I production [

 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. NLRs also play a role in activating the IFN-I pathway. NOD-2 can recognize RSV ssRNA, thus, mediating IRF-3 and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B activation pathways and leading to the IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> production [
