<p>Similar to other respiratory viruses, evidence suggests that hMPV has mechanisms for evading IFN-I production through interference in TLR- and RLR-dependent surveillance pathways. Early studies published by Dinwiddie et al. showed that hMPV can inhibit the IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> pathway in A549 cells. Therefore, this virus abolished the IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> pathway and downstream ISG signaling through mechanisms that regulate STAT1 activation [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. One study supporting this information found that hMPV suppressed IFN-I responses through mechanisms involving the regulation of STAT1, STAT2, JAK1, TYK2, and the surface expression of IFNAR1 [
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. hMPV proteins impair the activation of PPRs through several different mechanisms. hMPV M2-2 protein interferes with MyD88 adaptor, a critical component for the activation of proinflammatory genes. This protein also interacts with MAVS, altering the production of IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> and also prevents IRF-3 phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. In addition, hMPV G protein alters the recognition by RIG-I thereby influencing the secretion of IFNs, and the small hydrophobic protein can inhibit NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, which is an important component in the IFN pathway [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Finally, the hMPV phosphoprotein B1 interferes with RIG-I recognition [
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>].
