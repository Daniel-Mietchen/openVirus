<p>When a cell is infected, the viral sensing activates pathways that trigger host immune responses. The viral presence is detected by several distinct PRRs including TLR-2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8, RLRs including RIG-I and MDA5 pathways among others [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>–
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. These signaling pathways converge on IRF-3/IRF-7 and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B that promote the induction of IFN-I that inhibit viral replication and contribute to the initiation of more specific adaptive immune responses [
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> bind to receptor complexes, which activate STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation. IRF-9 binds to STAT1/STAT2 heterodimers forming the ISGF3 complex, which translocates to the nucleus to induce transcription of ISGs and to mount an antiviral state within the cell [
