<p>Different studies have attributed susceptibility to HRV infection to impaired IFN-I production that leads to a higher viral load [

 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>]. Abnormal HRV-induced IFN in asthmatic patients was shown in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for IFN-

 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>]. In addition, 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies on epithelial cells showed that exogenous IFN-I led to reduced viral load [
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>]. Furthermore, this has been confirmed in epithelial cells from asthmatic patients, suggesting a role for IFN-I in limiting induced viral exacerbations [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. However, other groups have found no differences between viral loads in asthmatic and control subjects during HRV infections [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. Further investigation regarding the role of IFN-I during HRV infections needs to be completed.
