<p>The innate immune response to PIV is not well-characterized, and little is known about the signaling pathways. Unlike other respiratory viruses, TLR signaling is not described but is thought to play a role in the IFN pathway activation during PIV infection. Regarding RLRs, a study showed that RIG-I is involved in IFN-I induction via IRF-3 after PIV-3 infection [
