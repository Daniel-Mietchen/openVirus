<p>Similar to previously described respiratory viruses, HCoVs are detected by TLR-3, TLR-7, RIG-I, and MDA5 [
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>]. TLR-3 activated by dsRNA stimulates TRIF that activates AP-1, NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B, IRF-3, and IRF-7 leading to the IFN production [
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. TLR-7 senses the ssRNA, leading to the activation of IRF-7 that also stimulates IFN secretion. RIG-I and MDA5 sense viral molecules in the cytoplasm, and their activation stimulates MAVS that induces the activation of IRF-3 and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B to finally induce the IFN production [
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>].
