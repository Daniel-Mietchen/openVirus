<p>One interesting study by Marr et al. showed that RSV-induced IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> expression by primary pDCs exposed to RSV is strongly correlated with age, observing higher IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> expression in healthy adults, followed by preschool children and little to no expression in healthy full-term infants [

This analysis of developmental innate immunity associated with poor IFN-I production during the first year of life suggests a role for IFN-I in RSV pathogenesis. Deficits in MAVS or RIG-I signaling events could explain this deficit. Furthermore, infants with severe bronchiolitis have less IFN-I levels when compared to those with moderate disease [
