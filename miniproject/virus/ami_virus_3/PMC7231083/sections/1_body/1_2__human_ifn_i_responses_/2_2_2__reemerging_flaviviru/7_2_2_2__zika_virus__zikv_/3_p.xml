<p>The mechanisms by which ZIKV antagonizes IFN-I induction and signaling in human cells, which might contribute to the broad cellular tropism and persistence of ZIKV, have been reported in recent studies [
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>–
 <xref rid="B223" ref-type="bibr">223</xref>]. ZIKV NS1 has been reported to interact with RIG-I and downregulate the antiviral signaling pathway [
 <xref rid="B224" ref-type="bibr">224</xref>]. In addition, Donald et al. reported that sfRNA in ZIKV acts as the antagonist of RIG-I-dependent IFN production [
 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>]. Furthermore, ZIKV NS4A impairs RLR-MAVS interaction and subsequent induction of antiviral immune responses by binding to the caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) of MAVS and thus blocking its accessibility by RLRs [
 <xref rid="B225" ref-type="bibr">225</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B226" ref-type="bibr">226</xref>]. ZIKV NS3 has been shown to antagonize antiviral gene induction by RIG-I and MDA-5 by binding to and sequestering the scaffold proteins 14-3-3

 <italic>η</italic> [
 <xref rid="B227" ref-type="bibr">227</xref>]. ZIKV NS1, NS2A, NS2B, and NS4B have been shown to interact directly with TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), required for the phosphorylation of IRF-3 [
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B228" ref-type="bibr">228</xref>]. In addition, the NS2B-NS3 protease complex of ZIKV has been reported to impair the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by promoting the degradation of JAK1 and to block RLR-triggered apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, the cooperation between NS1, NS4B, and NS2B-NS3 further attenuates antiviral immunity, by impairing IFN-induced degradation of NS2B-NS3 [
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>]. Similar to DENV, ZIKV NS5 has been reported as a potent antagonist of IFN-I responses by targeting human but not mouse STAT2 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B221" ref-type="bibr">221</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. However, unlike DENV, ZIKV NS5 did not require the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBR4 interaction, exhibiting a virus-specific mechanism [
 <xref rid="B222" ref-type="bibr">222</xref>]. In addition, ZIKV NS1 and NS5 interact with NLRP3 and promote assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasome complex resulting in IL-1
 <italic>β</italic> production and stimulated ZIKV replication [
