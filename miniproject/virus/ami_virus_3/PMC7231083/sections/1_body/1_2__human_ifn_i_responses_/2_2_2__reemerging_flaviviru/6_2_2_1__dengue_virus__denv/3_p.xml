<p>DENV nonstructural proteins have been involved in the downregulation of the IFN pathway in humans, targeting important signaling molecules downstream of PRRs, resulting in the inhibition of IFN-regulated gene expression [
 <xref rid="B177" ref-type="bibr">177</xref>]. NS4B in combination with NS2A and NS4A have been reported to block IFN-I signaling by decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation in human A549 cells [
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. Furthermore, the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease complex has been involved in the cleavage of the human adaptor molecule STING or MITA, inhibiting IFN-I production [
 <xref rid="B179" ref-type="bibr">179</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>]. Interestingly, DENV cleaves STING in humans but not in nonhuman primates that may serve as its sustaining reservoir in nature [
 <xref rid="B181" ref-type="bibr">181</xref>]. In addition, the DENV NS2B-NS3 protease interacts with the cellular I
 <italic>Îº</italic>B kinase, an important kinase involved in the IFN-I induction, disrupting RIG-I signaling and inhibiting the IFN production [
 <xref rid="B182" ref-type="bibr">182</xref>]. The DENV polymerase NS5 has also been reported as a potent and specific IFN-I antagonist, due to its binding to human STAT2 for ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation [
 <xref rid="B183" ref-type="bibr">183</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>]. The ability of DENV NS5 to bind and degrade human but not mouse STAT2 may be the major reason behind DENV's efficient replication in human but not in wild-type mouse cells [
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>]. Recently, increased virulence of different type 1 DENV isolates has been associated with a higher capacity of NS proteins to suppress IFN signaling [
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>]. Likewise, sfRNA of DENV strains that are associated with greater epidemic potential prevents the ubiquitination-dependent activation of RIG-I by binding to the ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25), subverting the RIG-I pathway, and consequently impairing IFN-I induction [
