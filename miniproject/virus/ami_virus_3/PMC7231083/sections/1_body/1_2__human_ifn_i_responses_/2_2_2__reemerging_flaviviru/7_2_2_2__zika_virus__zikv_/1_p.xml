<p>ZIKV is a newly emerging flavivirus transmitted to humans by 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes, including 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [
 <xref rid="B201" ref-type="bibr">201</xref>]. Since the first human ZIKV infection was reported in Uganda in 1964 [
 <xref rid="B202" ref-type="bibr">202</xref>], human ZIKV infections had remained sporadic and limited to small-scale epidemics in Africa and Southeast Asia for decades [
 <xref rid="B203" ref-type="bibr">203</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>], until 2007, when a large outbreak of Zika fever was reported on Yap Island (Micronesia) [
 <xref rid="B205" ref-type="bibr">205</xref>]. Over the next seven years, outbreaks were reported in other Pacific Islands [
 <xref rid="B206" ref-type="bibr">206</xref>]. In 2015, the largest outbreak of ZIKV ever reported began in Brazil, with a rapid expansion of the virus in South and Central America [
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>–
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. Typically, ZIKV infections can be asymptomatic or manifested as a self-limiting febrile illness characterized by rash, headache, conjunctivitis, arthralgia, and myalgia [
 <xref rid="B204" ref-type="bibr">204</xref>–
 <xref rid="B207" ref-type="bibr">207</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B209" ref-type="bibr">209</xref>]. However, recent outbreaks in the South Pacific and Latin America reported severe neurological complications, including Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) in adults and microcephaly in newborns [
 <xref rid="B210" ref-type="bibr">210</xref>–
 <xref rid="B212" ref-type="bibr">212</xref>]. ZIKV has been shown to cross the placental barrier, disrupting brain development [
 <xref rid="B213" ref-type="bibr">213</xref>]. Recently, ZIKV spread by sexual contact has also been documented [
 <xref rid="B214" ref-type="bibr">214</xref>]. At present, there is an urgent need for vaccines and therapeutics to combat ZIKV.
