<p>DENV has been reported to trigger a robust IFN-I response, which has been shown to be important in controlling DENV infection [
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>]. IFN-I has been reported to inhibit DENV infection in a variety of human cells, including hepatoma, fibroblasts, and myeloid cells [
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>]. RIG-I and MDA5 sensing of DENV has been critical in the immune response [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], as knockdown of RIG-I and MDA5 in Huh7 cells resulted in increased DENV replication [
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>]. In addition to TLR-3, 7, and 8 [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>], DENV has been reported to activate and upregulate the expression of TLR-2 and 6 in human PBMCs [
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>]. NLRs have also been shown to be activated in DENV and WNV infections leading to the formation of the inflammasome complex with subsequent production of inflammatory cytokines of the IL-1
 <italic>Î²</italic> family [
 <xref rid="B176" ref-type="bibr">176</xref>]. DENV sensing by PRRs results in the secretion of IFN-I which triggers the JAK/STAT pathway leading to the production of ISGs with diverse antiviral properties [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>].
