<p>The induction of antiviral immune responses after ZIKV infection of human cells has been reported in several studies [
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>–
 <xref rid="B219" ref-type="bibr">219</xref>]. The innate immune response after ZIKV infection of skin cells and endometrial stromal cells was characterized by a strongly enhanced IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> gene expression and the induction of ISGs, including OAS, ISG15, and MX1 [
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B216" ref-type="bibr">216</xref>]. Moreover, the transcription of PRRs such as TLR-3, RIG-I, and MDA5 has been reported to be induced upon ZIKV infection of human skin cells [
 <xref rid="B215" ref-type="bibr">215</xref>]. Similar to DENV, NLR (inflammasome) activation has also been reported in ZIKV infection of monocytes [
 <xref rid="B220" ref-type="bibr">220</xref>]. Elevated secretion of IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> was also reported in human lung epithelial cells, which may delay the apoptosis exerted by ZIKV infection [
 <xref rid="B217" ref-type="bibr">217</xref>]. Schwann cells (SC), which play a central role in peripheral nerve disease and can be the target for damage in GBS, were susceptible to infection with ZIKV and YFV, but not DENV, and ZIKV infection of SC induced expression of IL-6, IFN-
 <italic>β</italic>, IFN-
 <italic>λ</italic>, IFIT-1, TNF-
 <italic>α</italic> and IL-23A mRNAs, and negative regulators of IFN signaling [
 <xref rid="B218" ref-type="bibr">218</xref>]. Furthermore, ZIKV infection of human DCs produced a strong induction of the RLR signaling pathway at the RNA transcription level, but ZIKV was able to block IFN-I signaling by targeting STAT1 and STAT2 phosphorylation [
