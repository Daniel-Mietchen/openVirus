<p>WNV is a mosquito-borne flavivirus of international health concern. WNV is maintained in a natural cycle involving primarily 
 <italic>Culex</italic> spp. mosquitoes and avian hosts, but it also infects humans, horses, and other animals [
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. WNV is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe, and it was first introduced to North America in 1999 [
 <xref rid="B235" ref-type="bibr">235</xref>]. Since then, the virus has spread rapidly throughout the United States and has been associated with over 21,000 encephalitis/meningitis cases and 1,800 deaths [
 <xref rid="B236" ref-type="bibr">236</xref>]. However, no effective prophylactic or therapeutic measures are currently available [
 <xref rid="B234" ref-type="bibr">234</xref>]. Infection with WNV in humans remains asymptomatic and/or subclinical in most cases and causes symptoms in 20-30% of WNV-infected individuals. The clinical manifestations range from a mild flu-like illness to more severe neuroinvasive disease, associated with significant morbidity and mortality [
