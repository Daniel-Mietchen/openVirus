<p>The dual role of IFNs in protection against and pathogenesis of viral infections was suggested using a gene overexpression screening approach in human cells [
 <xref rid="B258" ref-type="bibr">258</xref>]. In this study, several ISGs (ADAR, FAM46C, LY6E, and MCOLN2) were identified as inhibitors of YFV, WNV, HCV, HIV, chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) replication. Conversely, several ISGs were found to enhance the replication of YFV, WNV, CHIKV, and VEEV, highlighting the complexity of the IFN-I system.
