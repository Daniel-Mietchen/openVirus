<p>Gene expression microarray analysis in PBMCs from YF17D-vaccinated humans revealed an immune profile related to antiviral IFN-I responses [

Recently, it has been reported that an inherited IFNAR1 deficiency resulted in life-threatening complications of vaccination with the YF vaccine in a previously healthy individual [
