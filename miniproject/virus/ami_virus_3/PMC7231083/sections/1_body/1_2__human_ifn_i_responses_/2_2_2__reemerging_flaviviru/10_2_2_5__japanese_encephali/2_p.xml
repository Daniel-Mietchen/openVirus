<p>JEV infection of human microglial cells has been shown to induce an innate immune response characterized by the production of IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> via IRF-3 activation and phosphorylation. The overexpression of the ubiquitin ligase TRIM21, which interacts with IRF-3 negatively, regulated this innate immune response by targeting IRF-3-mediated IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> production [
