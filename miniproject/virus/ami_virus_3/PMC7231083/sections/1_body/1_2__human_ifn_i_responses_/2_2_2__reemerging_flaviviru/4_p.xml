<p>To facilitate propagation, flaviviruses, like other viruses, have evolved specific strategies involving one or more viral nonstructural proteins to either prevent IFN induction or to inhibit IFN signaling. The inhibition of IFN-I induction is achieved by either sequestration or modification of viral RNA and inhibition of PRRs [

Recently, subgenomic flavivirus RNA (sfRNA), a nongene product encoded in 3′UTR generated by incomplete degradation of viral RNA by a cellular 5′-3′ exoribonuclease, has been proposed to play a modulatory role in the host antiviral response in mammalian cells by antagonizing IFN-I, as well as displaying viral interference in insect cells [
