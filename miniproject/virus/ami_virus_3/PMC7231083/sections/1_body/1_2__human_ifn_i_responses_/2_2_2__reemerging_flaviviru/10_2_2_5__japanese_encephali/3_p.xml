<p>The antagonist activity of JEV NS5 in IFN-I responses has been reported. The JEV NS5 has been shown to block IFN-I signaling by reducing the phosphorylation of TYK2 and STAT1 and subsequently inhibiting STAT1 nuclear localization [

 <xref rid="B263" ref-type="bibr">263</xref>]. Furthermore, JEV NS5 inhibited the nuclear translocation of IRF-3 and NF-
 <italic>κ</italic>B by binding to nuclear transport proteins KPNA3 and KPNA4, impairing the production of IFN-
