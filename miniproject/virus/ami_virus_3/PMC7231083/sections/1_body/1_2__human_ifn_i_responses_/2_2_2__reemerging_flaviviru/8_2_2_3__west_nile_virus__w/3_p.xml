<p>WNV NS4B and NS5 have been reported as important IFN-I antagonists [
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. Similar to DENV, NS4B inhibited the JAK/STAT signaling pathway by decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B178" ref-type="bibr">178</xref>]. The NS5 of WNV strain NY99 blocked IFN-I responses by inhibition of STAT1 phosphorylation [
 <xref rid="B242" ref-type="bibr">242</xref>]. The helicase domain of WNV NS3 has been reported to inhibit IFN-I signaling and differences in virulence between the NY99 and NSW2011 strains of WNV have been attributed to differential inhibition of the helicase domain of NS3 [
 <xref rid="B243" ref-type="bibr">243</xref>]. Furthermore, WNV NS1 has been demonstrated to antagonize IFN-
