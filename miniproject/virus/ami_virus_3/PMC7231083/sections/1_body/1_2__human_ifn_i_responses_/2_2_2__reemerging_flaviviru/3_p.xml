<p>In human cells, the host responds to flavivirus infection by recognizing viral nucleic acids through several distinct PRRs including RLRs, TLR-3, 7, and 8, NLRs, and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase/stimulator of IFN genes- (cGAS-STING-) dependent sensing pathway [

 <xref rid="B152" ref-type="bibr">152</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Among RLRs, RIG-I and MDA5 are involved in the detection of cytoplasmic dsRNA produced during viral replication [
 <xref rid="B153" ref-type="bibr">153</xref>]. The TLRs of importance during flavivirus infections are TLR-7 and TLR-8, which detect ssRNA as well as TLR-3, which identifies dsRNA produced during viral replication [

 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>]. The cGAS-STING pathway, which is known to sense DNA viruses, has also been recently involved in restricting flavivirus infections [
 <xref rid="B151" ref-type="bibr">151</xref>]. It has been reported that during DENV infection, mtDNA is spilled into the cytoplasm and this subsequently activates the cGAS/STING signaling pathway to stimulate the production of IFN-I [
 <xref rid="B155" ref-type="bibr">155</xref>]. pDCs are a predominant source of IFN-I during viral infection and TLR7 signaling in pDCs has been reported to promote the contact of these cells with infected cells in a specialized platform that enables viral RNA transfer and antiviral responses [
 <xref rid="B156" ref-type="bibr">156</xref>]. The binding of viral ssRNA and/or dsRNA to PRRs activates downstream signaling cascades, such as the activation of transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 and NF-
