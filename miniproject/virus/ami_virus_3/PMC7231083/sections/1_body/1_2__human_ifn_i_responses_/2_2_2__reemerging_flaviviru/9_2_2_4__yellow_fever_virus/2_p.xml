<p>IFN-I induction has been shown in YF17D-vaccinated human subjects [
 <xref rid="B249" ref-type="bibr">249</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B250" ref-type="bibr">250</xref>] and combined IFN-I and -III are crucial for controlling YFV infection in mice [
 <xref rid="B251" ref-type="bibr">251</xref>]. Recently, it has been reported that cells infected with YFV stimulated pDCs to produce IFN-I in a TLR7- and cell contact-dependent manner. Cells producing immature particles as well as capsid-free viral RNA participated in pDC stimulation [
