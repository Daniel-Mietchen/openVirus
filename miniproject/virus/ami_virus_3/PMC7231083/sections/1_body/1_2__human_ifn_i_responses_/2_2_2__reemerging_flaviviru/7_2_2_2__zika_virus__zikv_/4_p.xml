<p>Recently, ZIKV microcephaly in newborns has been associated with rs3775291 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) at TLR-3 reducing the activation of NF-

 <xref rid="B233" ref-type="bibr">233</xref>]. Compared to the replication of other ZIKV strains, the replication of Asian ZIKV strain Brazil Fortaleza 2015, which was associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, was less sensitive to the antiviral actions of IFN-I, while infection with this strain induced weaker and delayed innate immune responses
