<p>The viral control and immune regulation exerted by IFN-I in dengue patients and human cells infected with DENV have been studied in several reports [
 <xref rid="B172" ref-type="bibr">172</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B173" ref-type="bibr">173</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B187" ref-type="bibr">187</xref>–
 <xref rid="B189" ref-type="bibr">189</xref>]. Even though a strong IFN-I response has been described in dengue patients, the association of this response with disease severity is controversial [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>–
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>]. While some studies reported similar serum levels of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> or IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> in DF and DHF in Thai and Mexican patients [
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>], several other reports from Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, India, and Thailand showed higher levels of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> in patients with milder dengue disease [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>–
 <xref rid="B196" ref-type="bibr">196</xref>], suggesting that a robust production of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> may be correlated with a better clinical condition with respect to dengue infection and disease progression. Conversely, a recent study from Paraguay reported higher levels of IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> in severe 
 <italic>vs.</italic> nonsevere dengue children [
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>]. Similarly, a study from Northeast Brazil described higher levels of IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> in primary DHF patients compared to those with primary DF [
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Considering the preexisting immunity of patients to DENV, several reports described higher levels of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> in patients undergoing primary infection compared to those with secondary DENV infections [
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B195" ref-type="bibr">195</xref>], while other studies observed a similar expression of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> levels in both types of infections [
 <xref rid="B197" ref-type="bibr">197</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B198" ref-type="bibr">198</xref>]. Furthermore, different serum levels of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> have been reported in DENV-infected patients [
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>], probably due to the differential kinetics of IFN-I induction during DENV infection of human cells [
 <xref rid="B199" ref-type="bibr">199</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B200" ref-type="bibr">200</xref>].
