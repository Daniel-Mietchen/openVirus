<p>DENV is an acute febrile disease caused by four distinct antigenically related DENV serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) that are transmitted to humans by the bite of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> spp. mosquitoes, mainly 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> [

 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>]. The clinical manifestations of dengue can range from mild febrile illness with myalgia and rash (formerly known as dengue fever (DF)) to severe forms of disease, characterized by plasma leakage and hemorrhage (dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)) leading to potentially life-threatening hypovolemic shock [
 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>]. At present, several DENV vaccines are under development, including one that has been registered in several countries with high endemicity due to the limited efficacy in na√Øve individuals and against all four DENV serotypes [
