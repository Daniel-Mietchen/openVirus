<p>The protective role of IFN-I after WNV infection has been extensively demonstrated in mice by the marked increase in mortality in infected IFN-

 <italic>β</italic> receptor-deficient mice [
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>]. The studies of IFN-I protection after WNV infection are more limited in human cells. Recently, the PI3K, which play an important role in the induction of IFN-I antiviral responses, have been shown to control West Nile virus infection in human and mouse cells [
 <xref rid="B238" ref-type="bibr">238</xref>]. The presence of PI3K inhibitors blocked the translocation of IRF-7 from the cytosol to the nuclei, reduced IFN-I mRNA and protein expression, and decreased the secretion of IFN-I. Recently, in human monocyte-derived DCs early activation of RLR or IFN-I signaling could block WNV infection [

 <italic>β</italic> induction, while in human neuroblastoma cells, a delayed IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> response, due to the concealing of viral dsRNA in intracellular membranes, resulted in efficient WNV replication [
 <xref rid="B240" ref-type="bibr">240</xref>]. In addition, differences in replication and induction of IFN-I responses between attenuated and virulent WNV strains in human monocyte-derived DCs accounted for the differing virulence in humans [
