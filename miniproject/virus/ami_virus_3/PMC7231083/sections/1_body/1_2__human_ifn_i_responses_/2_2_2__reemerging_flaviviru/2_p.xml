<p>DENV, ZIKV, WNV, YFV, JEV, and SLEV belong to the flavivirus genus of the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, which comprises a diverse group of enveloped, positive-sense, ssRNA viruses transmitted by blood-feeding mosquitoes, causing disease in humans [
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>]. The flavivirus RNA genome (11 kb), which encodes a single open reading frame flanked by highly structured 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), is transcribed as a single polyprotein that is proteolytically processed by host and viral proteases to yield three structural proteins (C, prM, and E) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5), the latter of which regulate viral translation, transcription, and replication as well as attenuate host antiviral responses [
