<p>NS4B and NS5 of YFV have been reported as IFN-I antagonists. YFV NS4B interacts with STING, blocking IFN-I stimulation [
 <xref rid="B253" ref-type="bibr">253</xref>]. Moreover, YFV NS5 inhibits IFN-I signaling via binding and inhibition of STAT2 following IFN-I-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 and requires K6 ubiquitination [
 <xref rid="B254" ref-type="bibr">254</xref>]. This IFN-induced ubiquitination of YFV NS5 is absent in murine cells resulting in a lack of binding of YFV NS5 and human STAT2 in murine cells, highlighting the importance of YFV ubiquitination in determining the host cell range for YFV [
