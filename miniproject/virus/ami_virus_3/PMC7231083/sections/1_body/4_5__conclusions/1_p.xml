<p>After 60 years of research, the protective role of IFN-I has been demonstrated from cell culture to animal models and in human subjects. More recently, pathogenic effects of IFN-I have been described during viral infections highlighting the vast and intricate interactions of IFN-I in the immune response. Further insights into the effector mechanisms of individual ISGs in the complex signaling networks in human viral diseases are needed in order to design more specific and effective therapeutic strategies.</p>
