<p>Similar to WNV and JEV, the use of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> was evaluated in human subjects with SLEV severe neurologic disease. A nonrandomized, unblinded, interventional pilot study evaluated IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>2b therapy for meningoencephalitis produced by SLEV and suggested a beneficial effect on the early neurologic course of the disease, indicating that two weeks of treatment were well tolerated [

 <italic>α</italic>2b and intravenous immunoglobulin G was associated with a potential clinical improvement [

 <italic>α</italic>2a therapy for SLEV meningoencephalitis.
