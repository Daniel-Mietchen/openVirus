<p>Concerning WNV-infected patients, the use of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> is limited to case reports of meningoencephalitis, where different outcomes have been described [
 <xref rid="B293" ref-type="bibr">293</xref>–
 <xref rid="B296" ref-type="bibr">296</xref>]. IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> treatment was well tolerated and might have potential beneficial effects. However, the dynamic course of WNV neuroinvasive disease prevented the determination of whether the beneficial effects were due to the experimental therapy or to chance. Further randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials are needed to define the role of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> treatment in WNV-infected patients.
