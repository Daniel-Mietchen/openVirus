<p>Regarding influenza disease, a pathogenic role for endogenous IFN-I has been suggested in children with influenza infection, in whom clinical disease severity was associated with an increased level of IFN-

 <italic>α</italic> related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) [

 <italic>α</italic> and IFN-
 <italic>β</italic> [
 <xref rid="B280" ref-type="bibr">280</xref>]. Moreover, recent evidence showed that the upregulation of TRAIL expression by monocytes and death receptor 5 (DR5) expression by epithelial cells contributed to the pathogenic mechanism induced by IFN-

 <italic>β</italic>, where enhanced production of this molecule can contribute to immunopathology in severe infections [
