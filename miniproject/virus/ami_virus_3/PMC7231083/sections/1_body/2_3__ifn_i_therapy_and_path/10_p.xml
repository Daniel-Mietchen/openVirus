<p>The antiviral effects of IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> against JEV have been originally described in cell cultures [
 <xref rid="B297" ref-type="bibr">297</xref>]. In humans, IFN-
 <italic>α</italic>2a treatment against JE was also evaluated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial in Vietnamese children with JEV infection [
 <xref rid="B298" ref-type="bibr">298</xref>]. Intramuscular IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> administration did not show beneficial effects on hospital death or severe sequelae at discharge, suggesting that higher doses, alternative administration routes, or combination with other antiviral drugs might be needed.
