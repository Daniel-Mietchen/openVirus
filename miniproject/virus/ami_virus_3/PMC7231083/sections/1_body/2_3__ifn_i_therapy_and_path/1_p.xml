<p>IFNs are increasingly recognized as therapeutic agents. Three different types of human IFN (
 <italic>α</italic>, 
 <italic>β</italic>, and 
 <italic>γ</italic>) are widely used for the treatment of various diseases due to their immunomodulating, antiviral, and antiproliferative properties [
 <xref rid="B270" ref-type="bibr">270</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B271" ref-type="bibr">271</xref>]. However, the optimal dose and duration of IFNs as therapeutic agents have not been established [
 <xref rid="B272" ref-type="bibr">272</xref>]. This is important since IFNs administered in pharmacological doses produce considerable toxicity that is dose-related and that may require cessation of therapy. Common side effects due to IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> include flu-like symptoms (fatigue, fever, myalgias, and headaches), pulmonary toxicity, gastrointestinal symptoms, neurotoxicity, and depression [
 <xref rid="B273" ref-type="bibr">273</xref>–
 <xref rid="B275" ref-type="bibr">275</xref>]. Lethal toxicity associated with IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> regimen is rare and severe toxicity due to IFN-
 <italic>α</italic> is manageable if recognized expeditiously [
