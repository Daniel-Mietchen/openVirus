<p>Regarding DENV infections, the studies evaluating the association of IFN-I response with disease severity in humans have yielded mixed results [

In addition, monocytes of individuals with past severe dengue (SD) exhibited a significant upregulation of IFNB-1, RIG-I, and NLRP3 genes compared to those with past non-SD that was accompanied with higher viral loads, suggesting that initial innate immune responses may influence disease outcome [
