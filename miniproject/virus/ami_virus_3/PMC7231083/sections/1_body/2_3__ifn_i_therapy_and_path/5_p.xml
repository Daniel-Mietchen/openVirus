<p>During the 1980s, different studies showed that the use of high doses of intranasal IFN-

 <xref rid="B286" ref-type="bibr">286</xref>]. However, it was also found that the use of this molecule (in high doses) was associated with the occurrence of undesirable effects, as described above. Although low-dose treatment has proven to be better tolerated, it has been ineffective as postexposure prophylaxis [
