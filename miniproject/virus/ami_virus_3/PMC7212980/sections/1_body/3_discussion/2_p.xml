<p id="par0055">Much is still unknown about the time scale and effectiveness of asymptomatic transmission in COVID-19. Here we highlight the need to characterize the generation-interval distribution for asymptomatic transmission, and its consequences not only for contact tracing but for estimation of the basic reproduction number of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak (
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Park et al., 2020</xref>) and of the effective proportion of asymptomatic transmission during the exponential-growth phase. Our reproduction number findings fit into a broader framework linking epidemic speed, strength, and generation intervals â€“ for a given observed speed increases in the mean generation interval imply larger reproduction number (
