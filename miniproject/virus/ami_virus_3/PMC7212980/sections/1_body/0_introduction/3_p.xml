 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">Bai et al., 2020</xref>) for two major reasons. First, the proportion of infections that are asymptomatic (see 
 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">Mizumoto et al., 2020</xref>) is critical to attempts to estimate the likely burden of severe outcomes (including mortality (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Fauci et al., 2020</xref>)) when the virus spreads through a population. Second, understanding the possible role of 
 <italic>transmission</italic> by asymptomatic individuals is crucial to planning surveillance and control efforts (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Fraser et al., 2004</xref>). Given that 86% of the cases were undocumented (i.e., mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic) in Wuhan, China, prior to travel restrictions and may account for 79% of infection in severe, symptomatic cases (
 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2020</xref>), asymptomatic cases are also likely to play an important role in the transmission of COVID-19.
