<p id="par0020">We model viral spread using a renewal-equation framework (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Heesterbeek and Dietz, 1996</xref>), which allows us to model the current incidence of infected individuals (i.e., the rate at which new infections occur in the population) as a function of previous incidence and how infectiousness of an infected individual varies over the course of their infection. We divide incidence 
 <italic>i</italic> into two categories – 
 <italic>i</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>a</italic>
 </sub> and 
 <italic>i</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub> – corresponding to incidence of asymptomatic and symptomatic cases, respectively. Newly infected individuals that are either asymptomatically or symptomatically infected can transmit the disease to others, but they may differ in their intrinsic reproduction numbers,

  <italic>a</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>τ</italic>) and 
 <italic>g</italic>
 <sub>
  <italic>s</italic>
 </sub>(
 <italic>τ</italic>). Generation intervals, which are defined as the time between when an individual is infected and when that individual infects another person (
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Svensson, 2007</xref>), shape the relationship between the epidemic growth rate 
 <italic>r</italic> and the reproduction number (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007</xref>). The differences in the generation-interval distributions between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases can be caused by the differences in the natural history of infection irrespective of their transmissibility: Individuals with asymptomatic infections may recover faster and have short generation intervals, or have persistent infection and long generation intervals (cf. 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007</xref>).
