<p>Amid the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak and resulting pandemic, there has been a growing necessity to determine novel ways of safely evaluating patients who are suspected to be infected with the virus. Given the limited supply, cost, and often slow turnaround time of available assays, testing every patient who presents with symptoms or with recent exposure is currently not a viable option. It has been cited that early computed tomography scanning of patients may be beneficial, becauseinfected patients may demonstrate radiologic findings before the onset of severe clinical symptoms.

 </sup> However, the American College of Radiology recommends that computed tomography not be used to screen for or diagnose COVID-19 and that it be used sparingly in hospitalized, symptomatic patients given the risk of infection transmission posed to staff and subsequent patients.
