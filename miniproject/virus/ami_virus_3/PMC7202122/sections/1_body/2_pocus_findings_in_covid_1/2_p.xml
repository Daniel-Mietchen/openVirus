 </sup> utilized lung ultrasound to evaluate peripulmonary lesions of 20 noncritical COVID-19 patients at Xiâ€™an Chest Hospital in China. The authors conclude that computed tomography may be inferior to lung ultrasound in detecting smaller peripulmonary lesions and effusions in COVID-19 patients. Lung ultrasound in these patients demonstrated (1) posterior and inferior lung field lesions, (2) B lines, (3) distorted pleural lines, (4) subpleural pulmonary consolidations, and (5) air bronchograms.

 </sup> While these findings may not be specific to COVID-19 compared to other viral pneumonias, identification of these patterns during a pandemic could certainly assist providers in determining individuals who are likely to be infected.
