 </sup> Transport of these large devices to remote areas also creates added cost. These machines must be thoroughly sterilized after each use to prevent the spread of infection. Meanwhile, portable ultrasounds are available for between $2000 and $2500.

 </sup> A single handheld probe can be easily sterilized, while complete sterilization of the knobs, buttons, screens, and carts of traditional machines can be difficult and time consuming, if not impossible. Allotment of an ultrasound probe to each patient and/or the use of disposable probe covers can further help to reduce the risk of infectious spread from portable devices.
