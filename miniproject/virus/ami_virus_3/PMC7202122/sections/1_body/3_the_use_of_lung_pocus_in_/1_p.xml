<p>During the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, in which patientsâ€™ conditions rapidly deteriorated from self-limited febrile illness to an aggressive pneumonia, chest radiographs often failed to identify early interstitial lung disease.

 </sup> A cross-sectional study demonstrated abnormal ultrasound patterns showing interstitial syndrome in 15 of 16 patients who presented with normal chest radiographs, 63% of whom were subsequently diagnosed with viral (H1N1) pneumonia and 38% of whom were diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia.

 </sup> Overall, lung ultrasound was found to have 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity or a positive predictive value of 86% and a negative predictive value of 96% and outperformed chest radiography for the detection of viral pneumonia in symptomatic patients.
