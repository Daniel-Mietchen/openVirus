<p>Thus, ultrasonography has repeatedly proven to be an effective imaging modality to aid in both diagnosing and monitoring the progression of viral pneumonias. Its safety, in terms of lack of radiation exposure and relative ease of equipment sterilization to reduce the spread of infection, and accessibility to resource-limited settings make it an ideal choice during epidemics. Computed tomography, while reliable in providing good diagnostic quality imaging, is costly and carries the disadvantages of radiation exposure, lack of portability, and heightened risk of infectious spread.
