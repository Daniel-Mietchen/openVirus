<p>There is evidence that lung point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) may be comparable to chest radiography and to computed tomography in terms of its ability to detect parenchymal and pleural pathology and to monitor response to therapies.

 </sup> Historically, ultrasound was found to be an important tool for the rapid evaluation and assessment of pulmonary status in patients during the 2013 avian influenza A (H7N9) epidemic.

 </sup> Similarly, lung ultrasound may aid in the identification and subsequent monitoring of suspected COVID-19 infections, perhaps even before the onset or progression of respiratory symptoms. Here, we review the ultrasound findings reported from a number of studies and case reports

 </sup> and discuss the unifying findings from COVID-19 patients and from the avian (H7N9) and H1N1 influenza epidemics. We also discuss the potential role for portable POCUS as a safe and effective bedside option in the initial evaluation, management, and monitoring of disease progression in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection.
