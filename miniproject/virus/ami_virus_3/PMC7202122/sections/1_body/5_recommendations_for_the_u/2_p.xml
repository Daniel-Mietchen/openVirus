<p>After the initial assessment, serial lung ultrasound examinations may be helpful to track the clinical trajectory of a seemingly unpredictable disease course and guide suitable treatment options and timing of interventions. For example, detection of a new consolidation with dynamic air bronchograms may suggest the development of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. In addition to other clinical parameters, such ultrasound findings would support a decision to initiate antibiotics.

 </sup> Consolidations that are more posterior may advocate for early prone positioning in the appropriate clinical context. Similarly, increasing B lines suggests a trend toward deterioration in a patient who may benefit from titration of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to improve aeration. Atelectasis on lung ultrasound may suggest the need for additional PEEP and recruitment maneuvers. Although less common in viral pneumonia, the size, location, and appearance of any pleural effusions can be assessed by lung ultrasound to determine the need for drainage.
