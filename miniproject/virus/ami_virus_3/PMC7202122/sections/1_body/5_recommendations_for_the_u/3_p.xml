<p>Serial lung ultrasounds may be particularly useful in assessing the clinical response to the above interventions and guiding the appropriateness for deescalation of care. Examinations should be performed in a standardized manner, such as by using a 12- or 14-zone method to cover all lung areas and incorporating a scoring system, as proposed by Soldati et al,

 </sup> Reduction in B lines, the reappearance of A lines, and the resolution of consolidations suggest recovery and would support a decision to wean respiratory support. Although beyond the scope of this article, it is important to note that cardiac ultrasound can also play a major role in optimizing the management of COVID-19 patients who may develop postviral cardiomyopathy
