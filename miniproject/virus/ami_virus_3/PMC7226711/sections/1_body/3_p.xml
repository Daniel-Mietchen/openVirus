<p id="Par5">The massive mobilization of medical staff, which aims to assist 16 cities besides Wuhan, was started on Feb 11, 2020, while the “pairing assistance” medical personnel got to work in pairing cities from Feb 13, 2020 (the 22nd day after the lockdown of Wuhan). Plotting the number of patients still undergoing treatment against the day clearly showed that the 22nd day after the lockdown of Wuhan was the turning point in fighting the epidemic (Fig.

It is worth noting that Shennongjia Forestry District has a high level of medical personnel resources (2.999 medical personnel per thousand population) and the smallest number of patients (only 11 confirmed cases), so it shows a different curve pattern.
