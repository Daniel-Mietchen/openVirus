<p id="Par6">In the context of globalization, what we can learn from China’s “pairing assistance” is that the COVID-19 pandemic is not just the business of a single province or a single country. Every sector, every individual and every country must be involved in the fight and support each other. Areas with less severe outbreaks should provide medical resources within their capabilities to the areas with the most severe pandemics. Only by taking the “pairing assistance” measures can we defeat COVID-19, because no one can be immune from the worldwide pandemic.</p>
