<p>There remains significant debate regarding whether the use of HFNO including THRIVE is appropriate in patients with suspected or proven COVID-19 disease
 <xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Several sources recommend against the use of HFNO until evidence can establish its safety

 <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>. Nonetheless, HFNO has been utilized in many intensive care units, based on the premise that it may obviate the need for intubation in some patients; this stance continues to be debated

 <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,
 <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. If HFNO is used, the patient should ideally be placed in a negative pressure environment; although devices that limit aerosolization or distribution are also an option
 <xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>. Prior investigation with HFNO in simulation did not find it to increase the risk of droplet and contact infection
 <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, however, in the operating room, intermittent apnea should be utilized over apneic oxygenation via HFNO whenever possible. If HFNO is utilized, facemask protection should be placed on the patient to limit aerosolization. In patients with COVID-19 and severe respiratory compromise, the use of HFNO to maintain apneic oxygenation is unlikely to be as effective as in healthy patients
