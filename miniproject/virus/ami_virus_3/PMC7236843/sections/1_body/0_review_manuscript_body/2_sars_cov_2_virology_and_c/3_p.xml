<p>Transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus occurs by droplet spread (large particles &gt;5 μm produced by breathing, coughing, or sneezing) and by direct contact with contaminated inanimate objects (fomites). Droplet spread has a limited range for transmission (&lt;1 m) given the propensity of the droplets to fall out of the air from size and gravity. The virus can also be transmitted by aerosolization, with minute particles (&lt;5 μm) suspended in the air
