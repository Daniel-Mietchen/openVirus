<p>An iterative approach, adapted from Delphi methodology, was used to prioritize topics for inclusion and to reach consensus on recommendations. The first round consisted of drafting distinct statements for the inclusion of this manuscript, making recommendations on case selection, timing, performance, and management of procedures, based on the primary data sources retrieved. These recommendations were circulated among all authors, inviting both opinion and any additional recommendations. The second round of review was conducted incorporating new recommendations, along with those recommendations from the first round that had received a favorable comment. A final review of the recommendations was made during the final stage of drafting, and a videoconference was conducted, followed up with electronic correspondence and telephone discussions, facilitating refinement to the content of this manuscript.</p>
