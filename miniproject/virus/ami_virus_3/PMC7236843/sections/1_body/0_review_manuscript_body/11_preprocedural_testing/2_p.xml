<p>Diagnosis is made by the detection of viral RNA, typically using a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)

In addition to diagnostic tests identifying the presence of the virus, serological tests exist to measure the number of antibodies or proteins present in the blood when the body is responding to COVID-19. Antibody tests have been positive in 90% of infected individuals by 11–24 days after infection

While limitations exist to these tests’ effectiveness for diagnosing prior COVID-19 infection, these serological tests can play a critical role in the fight against COVID-19 by helping health care professionals identify individuals who have overcome infection and developed an immune response. Despite improvements in serological detection, a further consideration is that the degree and duration of protection afforded through immunity after infection with SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain

While COVID-19 infection remains prevalent, testing of both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals is advisable before proceeding with head and neck surgical procedures. Timely and accurate testing results allow perioperative patient outcomes to be optimized, and it also may help ensure the safety of health care workers and ensure appropriate stewardship of scarce PPE.
