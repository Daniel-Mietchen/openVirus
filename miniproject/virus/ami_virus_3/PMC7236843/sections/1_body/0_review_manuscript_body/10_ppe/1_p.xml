<p>For AGP, airborne precautions include the use of gowns, gloves (often inner and outer layer recommended), eye protection and/or shield, and an N95 mask or purified air positive respirator (PAPR). Airway procedures also present a significant risk of transmission in patients with undiagnosed disease who are asymptomatic.</p>
