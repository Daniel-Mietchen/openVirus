<p>Whether an N95 or PAPR provides superior protection in AGP represents an ongoing debate. In a review of the 2009 Influenza A Pandemic (H1N1), the CDC recommended that providers involved in AGP wear at a minimum an N95 respirator and may consider a powered air-purifying system (PAPR). The PAPR was shown to provide 2.5â€“100 times greater protection than the N95
 <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. The N95 efficacy is limited by the potential for face seal leakage, which is not always predicted by fit testing. Following the SARS-CoV-1 outbreaks in 2003, it was found that 9% of health care workers that intubated patients contracted SARS

The PAPR system is not without drawbacks as it requires appropriate assembly, maintenance, donning, doffing, and handling once it enters into the care setting and becomes contaminated. It may also limit hearing and communication, interfering with procedures. Regardless of the choice of respirator used, appropriate training and handling to prevent contamination are key to optimize its efficacy.
