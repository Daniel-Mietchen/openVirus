<p>During the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak in 2003, the use of jet ventilation in a patient presenting with respiratory infection resulted in a super spreading event linked to 138 infections, many of whom were health care workers
 <xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. Given its characteristic high frequency and pressure, jet ventilation entails a high risk of aerosolization and the dissemination of viruses when used during open airway procedures. During the pandemic, we recommend against jet ventilation for rescue in a cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate event. In such instances, a scalpel bougie technique is preferred to aerosolization without a secured cuffed tube. Also for laryngotracheal procedures, consideration should be made for intermittent apnea techniques that permit mechanical ventilation through a closed airway circuit. This approach uses a secured airway with ventilation to minimize the risk of aerosolization and is supported by the American Academy of Otolaryngologyâ€”Head and Neck Surgery
