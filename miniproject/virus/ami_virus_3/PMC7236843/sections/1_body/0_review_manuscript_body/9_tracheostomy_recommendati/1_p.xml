<p>The American Academy of Otolaryngology—Head and Neck Surgery has developed tracheostomy recommendations during the COVID-19 Pandemic
 <xref rid="R52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>. As an AGP, tracheostomy timing aims to minimize risk of viral exposure by considering timing, procedural approaches, and use of PPE. Tracheostomy should not be performed in patients with unstable pulmonary status nor sooner than 10–21 days weeks from initial intubation, preferably once the viral load has decreased (viral RNA can sometimes be detected by PCR for up to 20 days from symptom onset; however, the immune response is often activated and this virus is typically culture negative at these later time points). In addition, clinicians should bear in mind that days intubated will usually underestimate the duration elapsed since infection
 <xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>. Still, there is a lack of high-quality data on the degree of aerosolization with open versus percutaneous tracheostomy techniques. Several recommendations are considered important to optimize success and patient and provider safety during tracheostomy procedures (
