<p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus maintains high concentrations in the nasopharynx and nasal secretions
 <xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>; endoscopic transnasal surgery, and transsphenoidal surgery has a high risk for transmitting disease. From reports in China, transsphenoidal pituitary surgery resulted in multiple health care providers becoming infected and requiring quarantine often despite using appropriate respiratory PPE including N95 masks
 <xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. On the basis of these presented cases and reviewed reports, the American Academy of Otolaryngologyâ€”Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS reference) recommended that endoscopic transnasal surgery should only be performed for urgent/emergent needs. If preoperative COVID-19 testing is performed and the patient is found to be positive, surgery should be delayed until the infection is cleared. In addition, given the possibility of false negatives and risk with surgery, respiratory PPE should universally be utilized for these cases.
