<p>Given the concern for potential viral transmission, the use of nebulized local anesthetic for topicalization is discouraged
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. The use of intravenous low dose potent opioid (eg, remifentanil infusion) may be useful to reduce coughing during airway topicalization and should be considered with the patient under full monitoring and direct vision of the anesthesia provider. The “swish and swallow” technique is unlikely to lead to coughing or aerosolization, as is judiciously delivered local anesthesia via an atomizer directly onto mucosa. Regional techniques may also be considered although these too can cause patient reaction with coughing and viral spread. Use of other protective devices such as an endoscopy Faceshield (
