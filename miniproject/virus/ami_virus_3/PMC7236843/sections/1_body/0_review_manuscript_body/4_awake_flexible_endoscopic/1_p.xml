<p>Traditional awake flexible endoscopic (fiberoptic) intubation is considered an AGP and therefore requires careful risk assessment and mitigation before it is performed. If a nebulized solution of local anesthetic is used for topicalization, this can theoretically cause aerosolization and may compound the risk of infection to health care providers
 <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. The perceived risk of nebulizers is not universally accepted, and previous studies performed during the SARS-CoV-1 outbreak did not link the use of nebulizers to the transmission of infection

 <xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. Nonetheless, the procedure can cause gagging and coughing, which increases the risk of the droplet and aerosol spread. Flexible laryngoscopy by surgical providers is similarly considered to be a high risk
 <xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Given these risks, current guidance from the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation recommends avoiding awake endoscopic (fiberoptic) intubation in patients with suspected coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) infection, unless specifically indicated
