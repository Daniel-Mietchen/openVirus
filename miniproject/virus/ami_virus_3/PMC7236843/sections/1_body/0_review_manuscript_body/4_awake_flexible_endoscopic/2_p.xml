<p>There are some instances where an awake intubation seems difficult to avoid. For example, a patient with an anatomically abnormal airway requiring airway support for oxygenation/ventilation may still require awake intubation. If the decision is made to proceed with awake intubation, the procedure is ideally performed in an airborne isolation negative pressure room. Full respiratory PPE should be worn by each member of the health care team present in the room, and the individuals in the room should be minimized.</p>
