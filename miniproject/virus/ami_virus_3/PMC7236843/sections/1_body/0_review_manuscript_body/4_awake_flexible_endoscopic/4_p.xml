<p>In patients with a difficult airway who require tracheostomy, the surgical procedure is often preceded by awake fiberoptic intubation, with induction and maintenance of anesthesia to facilitate the surgical procedure. With this approach, there is a risk of viral aerosolization during both the fiberoptic intubation and the surgical tracheostomy, consideration should be made for the performance of awake tracheostomy under local anesthesia alone to reduce the risk of viral aerosolization and infection of the health care team. This would result in a single aerosolization procedure being performed, instead of two. Awake tracheostomy presents a high risk of aerosolization and should be performed with caution, using surgical and anesthetic techniques that minimize aerosol generation
