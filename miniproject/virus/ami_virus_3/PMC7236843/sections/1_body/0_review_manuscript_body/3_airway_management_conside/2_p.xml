<p>Recent evidence supports the theory that SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted via aerosolization of virus particles

Recommendations exist for general airway management procedures (including tracheal intubation, bag-mask ventilation, and laryngeal mask insertion) in patients suspected of, or infected with SAR-CoV-2
