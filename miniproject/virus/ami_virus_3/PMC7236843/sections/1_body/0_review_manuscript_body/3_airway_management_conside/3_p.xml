<p>Certain procedures warrant special attention, due to their predilection for generating infectious aerosols. These procedures include awake flexible endoscopic intubation; use of high-frequency jet ventilation; transnasal humidified rapid insufflation ventilatory exchange (THRIVE); and high-flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO). Although data are limited on the magnitude of aerosol generation associated with various procedures, experimental studies document that procedures that generate air currents with aerosol are conducive to wider spread
