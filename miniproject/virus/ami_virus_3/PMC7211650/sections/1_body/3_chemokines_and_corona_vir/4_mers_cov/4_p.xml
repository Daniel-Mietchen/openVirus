 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies also support the relevance of chemokines in MERS-CoV patients. A 2013 study evaluated the expression of several chemokines and cytokines in cell lysates of polarized airway epithelial cells infected with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV. The results showed that CXCL8 was up-regulated to a greater extent by MERS-CoV infection as compared with SARS-CoV. At difference, CCL2 and CXCL10 were more strongly up-regulated by SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV [
