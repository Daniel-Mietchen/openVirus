<p id="par0210">The fact that SARS-CoV infection would upregulate the transcription of CXCL10, while significantly down-regulating IFNs signaling, could seem paradoxical. However, transcriptional enhancement of CXCL10 could be due to a direct effect on the Nuclear Factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kB) [
