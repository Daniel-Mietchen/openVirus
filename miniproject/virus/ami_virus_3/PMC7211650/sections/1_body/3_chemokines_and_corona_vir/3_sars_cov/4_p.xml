<p id="par0185">These findings prompted further 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies aimed at investigating the relationship between SARS and the chemokine system. Spiegel et al., demonstrated that, in addition to its direct effect on epithelial lung cells, SARS-CoV could also enter macrophages and dendritic cells [
 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. This appeared crucial as viral entrance in these cells lead to an abortive infection (
 <italic>e.g.</italic> the virus enters the host-cell but cannot successfully complete replication). Yet the virus elicited the secretion of pro-inflammatory chemokines by dendritic and macrophages cells [
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This finding was confirmed 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> because the serum levels of a wide spectrum of cytokines and chemokines produced by dendritic cells and macrophages were elevated in SARS-CoV infected patients [
 <xref rid="bib0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. Furthermore, the infection with SARS-CoV of human primary myeloid-derived dendritic cells was followed by an impaired defensive IFNβ response, which was paralleled by a moderate up-regulation of pro inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF-α and IL-6) and a much more significant up-regulation of inflammatory chemokines (such as CXCL10, CCL3, CCL5, and CCL2) [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. The authors suggested that the lack of response to antiviral interferons in the presence of chemokine up-regulation could represent a further mechanism of immune evasion by SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. In line with this hypothesis, the direct exposure of lung epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] or Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs) [
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] coming from SARS infected patients to viral proteins (such as S-protein and N-protein) induced a prompt release of several chemokines, including CXCL8 and CXCL10. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> gene-expression studies also reported that PBMC from normal healthy donors inoculated with SARS-CoV showed an early enhancement in the expression of several chemokines belonging both to the CC family (CCL4, CCL20, CCL22, CCL25, CCL27, and their receptors CCR4, CCR7) and of the CXCL family (CXCL8 and IL-17) [
 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Additional data came from animal models of SARS-CoV infection. In mice infected with SARS-CoV, the clinical features of the syndrome showed an age-dependent increase in severity (similarly to what observed in humans), which was related to an increased level of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, paralleled by a reduction in T-cell responses [
 <xref rid="bib0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Another study showed that in mice infected with SARS-CoV, robust virus replication accompanied by delayed type I interferon secretion caused a rapidly fatal pneumonia. This delayed Type I-interferon signaling promoted the accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages, with resulting increase in cytokine (IL-6) and chemokine (CCL2) lung levels, vascular leakage, and impaired virus-specific T cell responses.
