<p id="par0235">There are few 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection published so far. The results of a study comparing SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV viruses behavior in the lung tissue should be overviewed. Briefly, the inoculation of the two viruses in 
 <italic>ex vivo</italic> human lung tissue explants showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more capable, as compared with SARS-CoV, in both infecting and replicating in human lung. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 infection was less able to trigger the expression of any IFNs, suggesting that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 might differ in their ability to modulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. As an example, it could be worth highlighting that SARS-CoV infection upregulated 11 out of the 13 pro-inflammatory factors evaluated, while SARS-CoV-2 upregulated only five of them, (namely, CXCL10, IL6, CCL2, CXCL1, CXCL5). Interestingly, CXCL8 transcription was up-regulated only by SARS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV-2 infection, while the opposite was observed for CXCL10 [
