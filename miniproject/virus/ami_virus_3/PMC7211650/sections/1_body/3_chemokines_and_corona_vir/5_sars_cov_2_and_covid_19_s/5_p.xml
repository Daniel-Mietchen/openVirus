<p id="par0245">Chen et al., recently characterized the immunological features of COVID-19 patients with different severity of the disease. Briefly, the 11 patients with severe disease displayed significantly higher serum levels of IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α and lower absolute numbers of T lymphocytes, CD4 + T cells, and CD8 + T cells as compared with the 10 patients with moderate disease. Of note, severe cases were characterized by a lower expression of IFN-γ by CD4 + T cells as compared with moderate cases. [
