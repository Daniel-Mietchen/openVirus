<p id="par0250">Xiong et al. performed a transcriptome sequencing analysis of several pro-inflammatory genes in both PMCs and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid of patients with COVID-19, compared with samples form healthy donors. The authors reported that COVID-19 patients showed up-regulation of genes encoding for several immune-regulatory molecules, in particular CXCL10, in PBMCs whereas no up-regulation of CXCL10 gene was observed in broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Moreover, an up-regulation of several genes involved in apoptosis and P53 signaling pathways in PBMC was observed, leading to the hypothesis that this process could be the underlying cause of lymphopenia commonly observed in COVID-19 patients.

Indeed, several cytokine/chemokine levels were measured and found to be elevated in patients with different clinical severity of the COVID-19. Among them, CXCL10, CCL7 and IL-1 receptor antagonist were the ones significantly related to disease severity and even more importantly, CXCL10 levels were the only one to be positively and significantly correlated with the viral load (Yang, et al. 2020).
