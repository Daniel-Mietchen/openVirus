<p id="par0150">Also the chemokine CXCL8, is involved in inflammation and immune cell trafficking in the context of viral infections. CXCL8 plays a major role in the initial control of respiratory tract infection due to its chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes [

Although in the majority of cases a strong chemokine action can efficiently contrast viral infections, some viruses acquire the capacity of escaping this surveillance system. Furthermore, viruses can use the chemokine system network for their own favor by several strategies:

   <p id="par0155">Some viruses “mimic” the components of the chemokine system by producing molecules that are very similar to chemokines and can interact with their receptor. These molecules generate an incongruous signal leading to a disorganized immune response to viruses [
