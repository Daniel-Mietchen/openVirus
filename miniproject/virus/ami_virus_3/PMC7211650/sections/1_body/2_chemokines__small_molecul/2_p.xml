<p id="par0130">Chemokines are a family of low molecular weight proteins expressed, both constitutively and in an inducible manner, by several types of cells. Chemokines play an important role in the inflammatory response by attracting leukocytes to sites of infection. These small proteins also contribute to the homeostatic circulation of leukocytes through tissues [
 <xref rid="bib0155" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. At present, 50 chemokines and 20 chemokine receptors have been recognized and classified. Chemokines are named according to the most recent nomenclature, which classifies them according to their chemical structure, the C, CC CXC and CX3C families [
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. The binding of chemokines to their receptors is responsible for their chemoattractant ability. The chemokine receptors belong to the seven-transmembrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors, which are expressed primarily on leukocytes but also on other cells,

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>]. Most recently, several studies investigated the involvement of chemokines in coronavirus-related infective disease. It emerged that specific chemokines could play a crucial role in the development of COVID-19-related symptoms, thus confirming what previously known for other types of coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS.
