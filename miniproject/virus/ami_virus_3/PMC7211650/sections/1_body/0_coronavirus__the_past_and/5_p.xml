<p id="par0040">In early December 2019, several pneumonia cases of unknown origin were observed in Wuhan (China). The pathogen was identified as a novel enveloped RNA β coronavirus that was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [

In view of its similarities to bat coronaviruses, it was postulated that bats could have been the primary hosts of SARS-CoV-2. This hypothesis suggested that the infection originated

On January, 30th, 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a public health emergency of international concern, and on March 11th, WHO Director General referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic. As of May 5th, 2020, the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 has exceeded 3 million worldwide, with more than 250,000 COVID-19-related deaths. The epidemic has put public health systems under severe strain both in western countries and in the developing world. SARS-CoV-2 displays a more efficient transmission pattern when compared with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The clinical spectrum of COVID-19 syndrome varies remarkably, going from asymptomatic forms to acute bilateral pneumonias requiring hospitalization. Common presenting symptoms include fever, fatigue and dry cough, while laboratory tests often show lymphopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Chest computed tomographic scans show a typical pattern of bilateral patchy shadows or ground glass opacity. A significant percentage of cases requires admission to intensive-care-units (ICU) due to acute respiratory distress syndrome that requires mechanical ventilation support. A subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 can experience the so-called “cytokine storm syndrome”, characterized by a fulminant and fatal hyper-cytokinemia associated with multi-organ failure.
