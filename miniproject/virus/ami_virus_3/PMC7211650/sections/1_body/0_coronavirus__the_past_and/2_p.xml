<p id="par0025">Coronaviruses, a genus of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family, are enveloped viruses with a large plus-strand Ribonucleic Acid (RNA) genome [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The genomic RNA is 27–32 kb in size, capped and polyadenylated. Coronaviruses were identified in several non-human species, including rats, mice, chickens, cattle, turkeys, swine, cats, dogs, rabbits and horses. In these species, Coronavirus infection often causes devastating epizootics of respiratory or enteric diseases. Several coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E and HCoV−OC43, were identified since the mid-1960s. Prior to the SARS-CoV outbreak, coronaviruses were only thought to cause mild, self-limiting respiratory infections in humans, commonly referred at as “colds”. These viruses are endemic among the human populations, causing 15–30 % of respiratory tract infections each year. Rarely, these viruses can cause lower respiratory tract infections, especially in neonates, in the elderly, and in individuals with underlying illnesses.
