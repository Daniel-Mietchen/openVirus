<p id="par0255">SARS-CoV-2, and its related syndrome COVID-19, have been known to the scientific community since less than 5 months. Clearly much is yet to be understood, and the challenge for the next future will be to increase our understanding the physiopathology of this novel infectious disease. Hopefully, the advances in our comprehension of the mechanisms sustaining the clinical course and patients-related factors driving the final outcome will be helpful in developing effective preventive strategies and/or therapeutical options. Based on current knowledge, the “cytokine storm” appears as one of the most dangerous and potentially life-threatening event related to COVID-19 sustaining its major clinical consequences. The immune mediated events related to the response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the role of the chemokine/chemokine receptor system, will be further and more extensively characterized with the final goal to identify targeted therapeutic strategies. Although lessons from the previous SARS and MERS epidemics can be drawn, there is still much to do in order to conclude whether SARS-CoV-2 virus behaves in the same way of its predecessors or if it is characterized by peculiar specificities. Clearly, the hide-and-seek challenge between the virus and our immune defenses will also help us understanding the extremely variable spectrum of clinical manifestations of COVID-19, which appears to range between asymptomatic cases to possibly lethal bilateral pneumonia with multi-organ failure.</p>
