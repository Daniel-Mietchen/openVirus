<p id="par0060">As shown by previous data in the literature, increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, Interferon γ, interleukin (IL-) 1B, IL-6, IL-12) and chemokines (CXCL10, and CCL2) are associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement in SARS patients, similarly to what happens in MERS-CoV infection [

More importantly, the so called “cytokine storm” emerged as a main factor driving a more severe clinical course. This concept originated from the observation that COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission displayed higher concentrations of CXCL10, CCL2 and TNFα as compared to those in which the infection was less severe and did not require an ICU admission. To further complicate the issue, it should be highlighted that, in patients with SARS-Cov-2 infection, at difference from SARS-CoV infection, there is also an increased secretion Th2-immune-oriented cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-10, whose main effect is to suppress inflammation [
