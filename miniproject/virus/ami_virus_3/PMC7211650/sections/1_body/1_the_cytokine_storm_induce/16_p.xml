<p id="par0115">Indeed, in a mouse model of IL-2 â€“induced ARDS, an up-regulation of the mouse CXCL10 analogue mob-1 mRNA was observed at initiation of lung injury [
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Several studies also showed that the intratracheal injection of mob-1 in mice induced pulmonary migration of leukocytes in the alveolar space, with massive recruitment of neutrophils, especially monocytes. This event was rapidly followed by microvascular injury and pulmonary edema typical of ARDS [

CXCL10 signaling appears to be a critical factor for the onset of ARDS, as shown in mice models of ARDS induced by either acid aspiration or by viral infection (with influenza H5N1 virus). Briefly, Ichikawa et al., demonstrated that wild-type mice developing ARDS had increased levels of CXCL10 mainly due to an increased secretion by infiltrating neutrophils, which induced an autocrine loop mechanism on the chemotaxis of inflamed neutrophils, leading to fulminant pulmonary inflammation. On the contrary, CXCL10 and/or its receptor CXCR3 knock-out mice showed decreased lung injury severity and increased survival in response to both viral and non-viral lung injury [

Moreover, CXCL10 expression in the lung was significantly up-regulated after induction of ARDS with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in a mouse model of lung injury, and the neutralization of CXCL10 with anti-CXCL10 antibody lead to amelioration of lung injury [
