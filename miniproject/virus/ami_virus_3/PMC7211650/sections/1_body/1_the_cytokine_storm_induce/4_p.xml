Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a devastating event, with an estimated mortality of approximately 40 %, defined as the presence of bilateral lung infiltrates and severe hypoxemia. ARDS can occur in a variety of clinical situations, including pneumonia, sepsis, pancreatitis, blood transfusion. ARDS pathogenesis involves inflammatory injury to the alveoloâ€“capillary membrane, which results in increased lung permeability and the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid into the airspaces, leading in the end to respiratory insufficiency [
