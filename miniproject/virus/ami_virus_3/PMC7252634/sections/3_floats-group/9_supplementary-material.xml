  <title>Neutralizing activity of RRV mAbs against RRV strain T48.</title>
  <p>Red circles represent percent neutralization relative to control at different antibody concentrations. Logistic curves are indicated by solid lines, and 95% credible intervals are indicated by dashed lines. A line at 100% neutralization highlights mAbs that completely neutralize. Multiple experiments were performed in triplicate, and the best fit curve is shown.</p>
