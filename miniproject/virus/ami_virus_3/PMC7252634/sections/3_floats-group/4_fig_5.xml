  <title>RRV mAbs increase mice survival rates when administered therapeutically.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> WT C57BL/6 mice were given 0.2 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb, and subsequently inoculated with 10
   <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV in the footpad. At day one post-infection, 100 μg of RRV mAb was administered. Antibodies are grouped according to neutralization profiles, with those exhibiting incomplete neutralization 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> on the left and those exhibiting complete neutralization 
   <italic>in vitro</italic> on the right. Two independent experiments were performed, with a total of n = 10 for each antibody group. The isotype control in the two graphs are the same. Statistical analysis was performed using a log rank test with Bonferroni correction: RRV-12, p = 0.0057; RRV-19, p &lt; 0.0001; RRV-34, p &lt; 0.0001; RRV-49, p = 0.0038; RRV-86, p = 0.0021; RRV-92, p = 0.0013; RRV-130, p = 0.0004; RRV-133, p = 0.3771; RRV-135, p &lt; 0.0001; RRV-139, p &lt; 0.0001. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> 100 μg of RRV-19, RRV-86, or an isotype control were administered 24 h post-infection to WT immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, and the ipsilateral and contralateral gastrocnemius, quadriceps, ankle, or spleen tissues were collected 3 dpi. Viral RNA was quantified through qRT-PCR. Two independent experiments were performed, with a total of n = 10 mice for each antibody group (one-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s post-test comparing each group to the isotype control; **p &lt; 0.01, ***p &lt; 0.001, ****p &lt; 0.0001).
