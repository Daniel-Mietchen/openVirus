  <title>Antibodies generated against RRV bind and neutralize RRV.</title>
  <p>
   <bold>(A)</bold> Isotype, subclass, light chain designation (λ or κ), half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
   <sub>50</sub>) for neutralization, and half maximal effective concentration (EC
   <sub>50</sub>) for binding are shown. Binding was measured using ELISA; neutralization was measured using a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT). Both ELISA and FRNT were performed in triplicate, and 95% credible interval for EC
   <sub>50</sub> and IC
   <sub>50</sub> values are indicated in brackets. Curves and EC
   <sub>50</sub> binding values were obtained using non-linear fit analysis using Prism software version 7 (GraphPad Software). IC
   <sub>50</sub> neutralization values were obtained using 5 paramater logistic curves (
   <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1008517.s007">S1 Methods</xref>). Values are color-coded according to binding or neutralization potency, with a stronger binder or neutralization indicated by a darker blue or green color, respectively. &gt; indicates neutralization was not detected, when tested at concentrations up to 10,000 ng/mL. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Neutralization profiles of mAbs were divided into two groups, based on pattern of activity in a dilutional FRNT assay. Eight antibodies left a resistant fraction of 10 to 40% virus (based on E
   <sub>max</sub> value), indicated by the red dotted lines and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> thirteen antibodies completely eliminated virus. Error bars represent SD, and curves are representative of multiple experiments are shown.
