<p>We isolated a panel of mAbs from two subjects, one with a previous laboratory-confirmed case of RRV that was acquired in Australia in 1987, and the other with a clinical history of childhood infection in Australia in the 1990s. Blood samples were obtained after written informed consent with approval from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Institutional Review Board from the first donor in 2016 and from the second donor in 2017, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated. We transformed B cells with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) before screening for secretion of RRV-reactive antibodies in cell supernatants through direct virus binding ELISA. We established stable hybridoma cell lines from B cells secreting antibody reactive with the virus and purified 21 mAbs after cloning the cell lines by single-cell flow cytometric sorting. All but one of the mAbs isolated were of IgG1 subclass, and the antibody clonotypes identified by the recombined antibody variable genes were distinct. Two antibodies, designated RRV-130 and RRV-135, had identical variable (V) gene region sequences, but used a different joining (J) gene in the heavy chain (
