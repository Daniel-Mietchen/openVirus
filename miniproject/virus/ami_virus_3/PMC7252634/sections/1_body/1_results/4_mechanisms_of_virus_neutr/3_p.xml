<p>Recently, the cell surface protein Mxra8 was identified as a receptor for CHIKV and several other arthritogenic alphaviruses, including RRV, Mayaro, and o’nyong’nyong viruses [
 <xref rid="ppat.1008517.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. To determine whether the RRV mAbs can block attachment of virus to this receptor, we performed a competition ELISA in which RRV particles were captured onto the plate, and then mAbs were bound to the virus before addition of a purified recombinant mouse Mxra8-Fc fusion protein. MAbs from each of the competition-binding groups blocked binding of Mxra8-Fc binding to RRV (

 <sub>50</sub> values of greater than 100 ng/mL, suggesting that neutralization potency might be related to effectiveness of Mxra8 blocking. However, we did not observe a difference in potency of Mxra8 blocking for those mAbs that did or did not leave a resistant fraction of virus in the neutralization assay. Based on our alanine mutagenesis data, the mAbs that blocked binding to Mxra8 contacted residues 60, 66, 69 and 75 in the A domain and residues 172, 207, 211, and 221 in the arch and B domain. We overlaid these residues (yellow) on the CHIKV E1/E2 heterodimer along with the known Mxra8 contact residues on E2: 5–6, 18, 26–29, 62–64, 71–72, 74–76, 119–121, 123, 144, 150, 157–160 178–182, 189, 191–193, 212–214, 221–223, 263–265, 267 (red) [
