<p>To determine if some of the inhibitory activity in post-attachment neutralization was due to antibody-mediated prevention of RRV fusion to cell membranes after entering the endosome, we performed a fusion from without (FFWO) assay. This assay, which measures fusion of virus with the plasma membrane under low pH conditions, has been used as a surrogate assay for determining antibody inhibition of alphavirus fusion in endosomes [

Subsequently, after removing unbound virus and antibody, cells were pulsed at 37°C in a low-pH medium to promote plasma membrane-mediated viral fusion. Virus that entered the cells was stained with fluorescent antibodies 14 h later and detected by flow cytometry. At a concentration of 10 μg/mL, RRV-133, RRV-130, RRV-135, RRV-139, and RRV-19 significantly reduced virus entry to cells under low-pH conditions (
