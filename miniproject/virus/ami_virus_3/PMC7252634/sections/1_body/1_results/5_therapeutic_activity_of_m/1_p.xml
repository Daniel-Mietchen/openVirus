<p>We selected ten antibodies with neutralization IC
 <sub>50</sub> values below 100 ng/mL to test for protection in a highly susceptible, immunocompromised mouse model of RRV infection and disease. Four-week old male wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were treated with 0.2 mg of MAR1-5A3 (a blocking anti-Ifnar1 mAb) [

 <sup>3</sup> FFU of RRV, and 100 Î¼g of RRV mAb was administered via the intraperitoneal route 24 h after virus inoculation. When given a control mAb for treatment, all mice died after 7 days. In contrast, when given an RRV mAb, mortality was delayed over the course of three weeks (

We did not detect a difference in protection between those mAbs that left a resistant fraction of virus (left) and those that neutralized completely (right), although the two most protective mAbs neutralized completely (
