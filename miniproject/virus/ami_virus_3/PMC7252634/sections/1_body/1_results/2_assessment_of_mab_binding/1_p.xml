<p>The 21 RRV-reactive mAbs were identified by binding to infectious RRV particles in a direct ELISA. Fifteen of these mAbs had half maximal effective concentration (EC
 <sub>50</sub>) values for binding to RRV of less than 100 ng/mL (

 </bold>). When tested for neutralization against the prototype strain RRV T48 in a focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT), five mAbs had half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC
 <sub>50</sub>) values less than 15 ng/mL, indicating highly potent neutralization in cell culture, whereas nine other mAbs had neutralization IC
 <sub>50</sub> values less than 100 ng/mL (
