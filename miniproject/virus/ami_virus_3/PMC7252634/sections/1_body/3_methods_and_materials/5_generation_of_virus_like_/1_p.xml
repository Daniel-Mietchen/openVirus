<p>RRV structural genes, capsid-E3-E2-6K-E1, encoding 3,783 bp with the addition of a Kozak sequence, were cloned into the pcDNA3.1(+) mammalian cell expression plasmid (GenScript). 293T cells (American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] Cat. No. CRL-11268) were transfected with 4 μg per 5 ×10
 <sup>5</sup> cells of the plasmid using the Lipofectamine 2000 method according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Transfection was allowed to proceed for 48–72 h before supernatant was harvested and filtered through a 0.45 μm filter. VLPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 110,000 g in a SW28 rotor for 2 h at 4°C through a 20% sucrose cushion using a Sorvall Discovery 90SE ultracentrifuge. The resulting pellet was resuspended in 250 μL of TNE buffer (0.01 M Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.001 M EDTA) and stored at 4°C.
