<p>An Octet RED96 BLI instrument (Pall FortéBio) was used to perform epitope binning studies using competition binding. One of the human antibodies obtained in early experiments (RRV-86) was used as a capture antibody and was immobilized onto Fc-specific anti-human IgG biosensors for 2 min. After measuring the baseline signal, the biosensor tips were immersed into wells containing RRV VLPs for 2 min. After another baseline measurement, biosensors then were transferred to wells containing a first mAb at a concentration of 100 μg/mL for 5 min, before immersion in a solution containing a second mAb, also at a concentration of 100 μg/mL for 5 min. The percent competition of the second mAb in the presence of the first mAb was determined by comparing the maximal signal of binding for the second mAb in the presence of the first antibody to the maximal signal of that mAb alone when separately tested uncompeted. Competition was defined by reduction of the maximal binding score to &lt;20% of un-competed binding. A non-competing mAb was identified when maximal binding was &gt;50% of un-competed binding. A 25 to 50% reduction in maximal binding was considered intermediate competition.</p>
