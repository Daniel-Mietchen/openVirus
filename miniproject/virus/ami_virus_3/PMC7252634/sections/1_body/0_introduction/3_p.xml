<p>Here, we describe human mAbs isolated from individuals who were naturally infected with RRV. These mAbs neutralized RRV infectivity in cell culture, protected mice when administered therapeutically, and reduced viral burden in multiple tissues. Furthermore, these mAbs bind to multiple domains on the E2 protein, as determined through alanine scanning mutagenesis, and roughly fall into two competition-binding groups, revealing that the A and B domains are the major antigenic targets for the human neutralizing antibody response. These mAbs blocked infection by preventing viral attachment and entry to the cell and also blocked at a later step in the virus lifecyle associated with viral fusion. Notably, nearly all of the neutralizing mAbs blocked attachment of RRV to Mxra8, a recently discovered entry receptor for RRV, CHIKV, and other arthritogenic alphaviruses [
