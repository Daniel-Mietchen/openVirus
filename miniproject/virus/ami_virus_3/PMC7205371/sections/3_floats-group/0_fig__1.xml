  <p>Demonstration of different sampling sites aided by endonasal endoscopy (Karl Storz 4 mm 0° lens). When inserted parallel the external nasal profile, the swab samples the vault of the nasal fossa or the middle meatus (upper half). To reach the nasopharynx, the swab needs to be inserted parallel to the floor of the nasal fossa and pushed all the way in until blocked by the posterior wall of the nasopharynx (lower half). NS nasal septum, IT inferior turbinate, MT middle turbinate, NP nasopharynx. </p>
