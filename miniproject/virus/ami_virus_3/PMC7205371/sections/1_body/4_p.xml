<p id="Par5">The false-negative rates of RT-PCR is reported to be around 51.6% [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Reaching the nasopharynx with a swab is not easy: the intranasal anatomy is highly variable (e.g. hypertrophic inferior turbinates, deviated septum, conchae bullosae, synechiae) and this factor, coupled with patients’ discomfort, may result in a flawed sampling of the nasal cavity, the inferior turbinate or the middle meatus instead. We hypothesize that part of these limited results may be linked to a wrong diagnostic procedure performed collecting the swabs.
