<p id="Par4">For the diagnosis in outpatients, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing on nasopharyngeal swabs, which have higher yields than nasal or throat swabs [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Nasopharyngeal swabs are considered easy and quick to collect, they are not time-consuming and they can be performed anywhere, even to people sitting in a car. Bronchoalveolar lavage is considered more sensitive than nasopharyngeal specimens, with a sensitivity around 97%, but its use is limited to critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation. More recently, serologic tests have to gain attention for their potential of screening wider populations, identifying uninfected and/or healed subjects and thus directing future policies. So far, though, they are still under investigation and their current role is, therefore, limited [
