<p id="par0030">SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus that belongs to the subfamily 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic>, the genus 
 <italic>Coronavirus</italic> and the subgenus 
 <italic>Sarbecovirus</italic> (beta-coronavirus, beta-2b) and within them to clade or lineage 2, which is much closer genetically to bat coronaviruses than to human SARS. The SARS-CoV-2 genome consists of single-stranded RNA of about 30,000 nucleotides and 6 ORF (open reading frames), identical to the rest of the coronaviruses, and several additional genes. Most of these genes are only 80% homologous with the former SARS-CoV virus; however, the genes involved in replication (ORF1ab) are 94% homologous with this virus.

 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> The complete sequencing of the coronavirus genomes detected in patients, and especially the RNA-directed polymerase (RdRp) gene and the S (external spicule) gene, show that the human strains constitute a different lineage from SARS-CoV, but very close to the lineage detected in some bats (BatCoV RaTG13). The S protein of the new coronavirus shows &lt;75% similarity with the other known coronaviruses but 93% identity with the bat coronavirus. These genetic similarities seem to confirm the origin of SARS-CoV-2, which would be some wild bat in the area. According to Zhou et al.,
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0245" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> this coronavirus would be a genetic recombinant between a bat strain (80%-85%) and that of another animal species (perhaps that of the intermediate host).
