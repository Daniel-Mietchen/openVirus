 </xref> Currently the only criteria that have been met are that SARS-CoV-2 has been isolated, detected by analytical techniques (molecular biology) and cultured in vitro from respiratory samples from patients with suspected respiratory disease. However, no animal model is yet available to meet the remaining criteria, such as (a) demonstrating the ability of this new coronavirus to infect animals and cause them the same disease; (b) re-isolating the virus from experimentally infected animals; and (c) demonstrating an immune response to it. Despite this, virological, clinical and epidemiological evidence seems to indicate with some certainty that SARS-CoV-2 is the aetiological agent of the acute respiratory infection epidemic in Southeast Asia.
