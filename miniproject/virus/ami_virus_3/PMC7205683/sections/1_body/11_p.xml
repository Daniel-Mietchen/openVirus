<p id="par0060">Despite the importance of bats in the evolutionary biology of coronaviruses, in the case of the new coronavirus it does not appear that there has been direct transmission from this animal to humans.

 </xref> The main reasons for this are: (a) the outbreak began in late December 2019, a period in which most bat species in the Wuhan region are hibernating; (b) according to Chinese epidemiologists, no bats were found or sold in the Huanan market (Wuhan) as it was a fish and seafood market, although other conventional mammals were found; (c) the genetic sequence identity of SARS-CoV-2 and its homologue bat-SL-CoVZC45 is less than 90%, indicating that it forms a phylogenetic branch distinct from humans, and therefore this bat virus and the bat SARS-like coronavirus (bat-SL-CoVZC21) cannot be considered the direct ancestors of the human virus; and (d) in previous coronaviruses causing human epidemics, it was always possible to find an intermediate host, and therefore in this case it must also exist.
