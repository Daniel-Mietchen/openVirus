<p id="par0045">SARS-CoV-2 infects and efficiently replicates in pneumocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells in the deepest parts of the lung parenchyma where the ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II) cell receptor resides, which is used by this virus to bind to these cells and initiate the infectious process.

 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> This cellular receptor is the same that SARS-CoV used to infect humans, therefore the pathophysiology of the new coronavirus at pulmonary level is probably very similar, with clear predominance of severe pneumonias and low involvement of the upper respiratory tract.
