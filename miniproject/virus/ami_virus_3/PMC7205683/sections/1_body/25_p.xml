<p id="par0130">We are therefore facing the challenge of a new pandemic of acute respiratory infection caused by a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. We still do not know many of the virological, epidemiological and clinical aspects of this infection, and therefore as new studies appear, we will be able to update our knowledge. Once again, we are facing a new viral pandemic with no specific antivirals or a vaccine, and again only the classical epidemiological recommendations (isolation, surveillance and monitoring) will enable us to tackle this as we have other similar situations.</p>
