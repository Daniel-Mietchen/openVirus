<p id="par0095">The presence of the virus in the oropharynx with a high viral load even before the onset of symptoms, although without proven ability to replicate in this area, is what determines the transmissibility of the virus. Obviously associated with the mechanisms that facilitate the spread of the virus are coughing, sneezing and expectoration, as well as the important role of direct contact through the hands or other fomites from an infected individual.

 </xref> studied the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 in the pharynx and nostrils of both symptomatic and non-symptomatic people and observed that the highest loads are detected from the time of onset of symptoms and that it is somewhat higher in the nostrils. It is especially relevant that the viral load of asymptomatic people is very similar to that of symptomatic people and can persist in some cases for up to 5 days, which supports asymptomatic people as possible efficient spreaders.
