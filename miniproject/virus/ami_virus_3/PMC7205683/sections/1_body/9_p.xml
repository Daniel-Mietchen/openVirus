 </xref> indicates the possibility that a single mutation in the N501T position of the S1 protein may significantly increase the ability to bind to the ACE2 receptor; the evolution of this mutation should be monitored. It has also been shown, based on the affinity of the S1 protein for ACE2, that the new coronavirus is not capable of infecting the civet (SARS-CoV intermediary) or mice, and therefore they cannot be used as experimental models unless genetically modified. The animals that have shown capacity to be infected by SARS-CoV-2 are pigs, ferrets, cats and non-human primates, therefore they could be intermediate hosts and/or experimental models.
