<p id="par0090">The first cases described in early January 2020 were epidemiologically linked to a fish and live animal market in the city of Wuhan; but from the end of that month, transmission became predominantly person-to-person. This confirms the high capacity of this coronavirus to adapt to humans and to transmit efficiently between them. Genetic phenomena of adaptability, mutation and recombination with previous animal strains have probably participated in this adaptation, from which the new strain with special tropism for humans emerged. As the virus was new to humans, not to the natural world of viruses, the population lacked previous immunity and therefore the process of epidemic spread started.
