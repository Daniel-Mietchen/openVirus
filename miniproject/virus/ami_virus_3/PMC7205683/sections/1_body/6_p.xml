<p id="par0035">The S protein on the surface of coronaviruses is responsible for binding to the cell receptor and the fusion process, thus determining host tropism and transmission capacity in a new host, in addition to being the immunodominant antigen and the antigen most intensely recognised by the host's immune system.

 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> For the S protein to be able to perform its function it must be hydrolysed by the pulmonary proteases resulting in the S1 fragment, responsible for binding to the receptor, and the S2 fragment, responsible for the fusion process. Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are found in different genetic lineages, they have around 50 amino acids preserved at position S1, while most of those from bats show important antigenic variations in this sensitive area.
