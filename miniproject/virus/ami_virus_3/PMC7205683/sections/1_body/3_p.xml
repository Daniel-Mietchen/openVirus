<p id="par0020">On 31 December 2019, an outbreak of pneumonia of unknown aetiology was detected in the city of Wuhan, China, which was quickly reported to the WHO. One week later, on 7 January 2020, a new coronavirus, initially called 2019-nCoV,

 </xref> suggested the name PARS (pneumonia-associated respiratory syndrome) and for the new coronavirus PARS-CoV, to maintain the terminology used for the two previous coronaviruses. After a few disagreements, the name TRAS (transmissible acute respiratory syndrome) was suggested and TRAS-CoV for the virus; however, this name was not confirmed. We must therefore consider that we are facing the third zoonotic epidemic caused by a coronavirus in the 21st century. That is why on 30 January 2020 the WHO declared this disease an international health emergency in order for all countries to prepare for it.
