<p id="par0070">The specific diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection should be made by means of a real-time PCR assay that detects the specific targets of this virus (NP and E genes), together with the common RNA-polymerase (RdRp) gene.

 </xref> Serology could be useful for identifying asymptomatic cases and for seroprevalence studies within a given population. This serological diagnosis (ELISA for IgG and IgM) has been designed using the nucleoprotein (NP) of bat coronavirus which has a genetic identity of 92% and does not show cross-reaction with the rest of the coronaviruses.

 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The isolation of this virus in cell cultures using the Vero and Huh7 cell lines can also be used as a diagnostic methodology. The cytopathic effect is detected after 3 days of incubation and can be detected by immunofluorescence directed against NP.
