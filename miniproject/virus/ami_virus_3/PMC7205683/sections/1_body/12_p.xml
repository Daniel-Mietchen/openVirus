<p id="par0065">Two animal species appear to be intermediate host candidates, some snakes or a scaly mammal called a pangolin. The study by Ji et al.

 </xref> has postulated that the new coronavirus is a recombinant strain between one from the bat and another from some snake species from the epidemic zone and that the affected zone corresponds to the 21,500â€“24,000 nucleotides of the gene encoding the S1 protein (a determinant of human tropism). The sequence of this reptile would have allowed the new virus to acquire the ability to infect humans. However, this is the first time that snakes have been described as hosts of coronaviruses and the study by Robertson and Jiang

 <italic>Manis javanica</italic>) phylogenetically related to SARS-CoV-2, especially in the sequence that encodes the cellular ACE2 receptor-binding S protein. These authors believe that this mammal should be considered the intermediate host and removed from markets to prevent further zoonotic transmission.
