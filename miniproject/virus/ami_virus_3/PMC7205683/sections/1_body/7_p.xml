<p id="par0040">The capacity of the S1 protein to bind to the cell is located in the C-terminal domain of the cell. Phylogenetic studies of this area have shown that the SARS-CoV-2 protein is almost identical to that of SARS-CoV and is further removed from the homologous bat strain, which suggests an evolutionary process of adaptation to human cell receptors following the same process as that of SARS-CoV in 2002.

 </xref> As with many other RNA genome viruses, the mutation rate of coronaviruses is 10 nucleotide substitutions/position/year, occurring mainly in the first replication cycles. It is therefore surprising that the genetic sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from different patients are absolutely identical (99.9%). This data suggests that this new coronavirus originated from a single source in a very short period of time and was detected very early in the first days of human-human transmission.
