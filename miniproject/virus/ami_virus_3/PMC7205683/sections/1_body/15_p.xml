<p id="par0080">SARS-CoV-2 has now infected many more people than its predecessors (&gt;85.000). Several factors seem to have led to this rapid spread; on the one hand, the epicentre of the outbreak, the city of Wuhan, has about 11 million inhabitants and is the main communications hub in Hubei Province, which facilitates person-to-person contact and the export of cases to other cities. Its R0 is estimated at 2–3.5, therefore each patient may infect 2 or 3 new people. This value is similar to SARS (R0 2–5) and much higher than that of MERS (R0 &lt; 1), but the number of people infected by the new coronavirus through human-to-human transmission is about 3–10 times higher than previous viruses.
