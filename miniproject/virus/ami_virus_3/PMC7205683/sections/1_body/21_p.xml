<p id="par0110">It seems that SARS-CoV-2 presents with three clinical patterns, beyond the asymptomatic cases: (a) a moderate upper respiratory tract infection with mild symptoms; (b) clinically and radiologically evident pneumonia; and (c) severe pneumonia associated with respiratory distress that could progress to respiratory failure and death of the patient (that 2% fatality). Severe pneumonia occurs more in men over 65 years of age and with comorbidities such as diabetes, pulmonary and cardiac pathologies.
