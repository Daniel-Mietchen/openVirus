 </xref> in 15 patients confirms the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the pharynx, faeces and blood of patients, and therefore it could be transmitted via these three routes, although its presence has been detected only by molecular biology and its infectivity in a new host cannot be ascertained. They also observed how in patients with a negative pharyngeal smear the virus could be detected in faeces, especially 4â€“5 days after the onset of symptoms, producing oro-faecal transmission. According to these authors, infection could not be ruled out by a negative pharyngeal smear alone, although the airway remains the main route of transmission of the virus. In addition, the presence of an immune response in the form of IgM and specific IgG could be detected in all patients.
