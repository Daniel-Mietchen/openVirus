<p id="p0035">Animal models suggest that male mice were more susceptible to SARS-CoV compared with female mice with matched age. This enhanced susceptibility was associated with accumulation of inflammatory monocyte macrophages and neutrophils resulting in vascular leakage and alveolar edema. Moreover, blocking estrogen receptors among female mice was associated with increased mortality suggesting that estrogen receptor signaling might offer some protective effect for female mice [

 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. This might be the case for coronaviruses as well. In a study, which has not undergone peer review, of 331 Chinese patients with COVID-19, there was no difference in plasma IgG levels among mild and recovering cases between men and women. But among severely diseased patients, plasma levels of IgG were higher among women compared with men [

The viral surface spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 enters the host cell by binding to the human ACE2 receptor, which is prevalent in the lung but also present in the endothelium of blood vessels of other organs including myocardium and brain. Animal models have also suggested that male sex is associated with increased expression of ACE2 receptors [

In addition, it is well known that the prevalence of autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus is much higher among women. Perhaps the therapeutic agents used to manage these disorders such as hydroxychloroquine, which in-vitro blocks the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the endothelial cells, and interleukin-6 receptor antagonists (e.g., tocilizumab and sarilumab), which work to modify the cytokine storm in severe cases, might play a role in treating COVID-19 patients (
