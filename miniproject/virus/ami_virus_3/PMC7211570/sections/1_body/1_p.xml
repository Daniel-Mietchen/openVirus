<p id="p0010">SARS-CoV-2 uses angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for entry into cells. Limited human data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing ACE/ACE2 balance toward a state of heightened angiotensin II production, leading to pulmonary vasoconstriction, inflammation, and oxidative-related organ damage resulting in an increased risk for acute lung injury. However, as ACE2 is an “X” linked enzyme and some reports indicate an increase in plasma ACE2 in older women, they would appear to be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2. Yet, reports from China, Italy, and New York clearly document that women have about half of the COVID-19 incidence with much less disease severity and mortality compared with men. Perhaps higher ACE2 produces more Ang-1-7, which provides more protection? It may also be possible that higher ACE2 activity provides a more efficient “sink” in eliminating the virus or preventing its attachment for target cell entry. Differential regulation of ACE2 with sex hormones may be working, as well. Investigation of this disparity could provide important clues to better understanding complexities of this enzyme and improving COVID-19 outcomes.</p>
