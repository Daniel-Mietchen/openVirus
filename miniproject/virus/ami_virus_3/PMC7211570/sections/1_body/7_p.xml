<p id="p0040">By observing this pattern of worse outcomes among men again with COVID-19, how could this help us moving forward? First, future studies, including the anticipated studies from the US, should address the sex-differences in the prevalence and outcomes of this disease, and try to identify the predictors of worse outcomes among both sexes, as it appears that the virus behaves differently in men versus women. Better understanding of these prognostic differences could help us better risk-stratify patients. Second, therapies for certain auto-immune and viral diseases such as interleukin-6 receptor antagonists and remdesiver might be potential therapies. There are several ongoing trials evaluating the merits of these agents in improving clinical outcomes. Finally, there are two recently launched randomized phase 1 trials to evaluate for a newly developed vaccine. It is imperative that randomized trials of the vaccines as well as therapies consider recruiting an equivalent proportion of women and men, as there have been many examples in the past of therapies later shown to be ineffective in women due to under-representation of women in the landmark trials.</p>
