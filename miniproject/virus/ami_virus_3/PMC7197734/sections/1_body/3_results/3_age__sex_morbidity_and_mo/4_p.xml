<p>The CFRs across the three viruses range from 2 to 35% (see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="dyaa033-F2">FigureÂ 2</xref>), with the highest among MERS cases and the lowest among the current outbreak, although it is important to note that the CFR for COVID-19 should be interpreted cautiously as the outbreak is still ongoing, and it is hypothesized that many cases are yet to be confirmed, due to a lack of RT-PCR kits in China. It is too early for comparisons to be made between the morbidity and mortality rates of the first two coronaviruses with the current epidemic.
