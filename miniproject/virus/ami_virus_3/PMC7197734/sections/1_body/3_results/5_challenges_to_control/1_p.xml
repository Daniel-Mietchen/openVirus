<p>Several challenges have been identified in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Among them are limited coordinated efforts among stakeholders with few policies in place for inter-sectoral collaboration, a lack of medical supplies (shortages of masks, goggles) and laboratory facilities for assessment of the disease. Additionally, many cases may have been asymptomatic; so it is difficult to predict when the epidemic will peak and introduces further difficulty in the detection of cases. A recent correspondence to the 
 <italic>New England Journal of Medicine</italic> documented an asymptomatic contact in Germany.

 </xref> In order to contain the virus, Chinese authorities prevented travel to, from and within the city of Wuhan on 23 January, as airline and railway departures were suspended. Between the 23 and 25 January, travel restrictions were implemented in 18 additional cities, affecting nearly 60 million people. The orders issued by Beijing were significant, but late in coming: the first official case of the virus was confirmed almost 2 months previously (8 December 2019) and the length of time it took for China's state-controlled media to reveal the nature of the illness was too great. This can be attributed to a failure of proper risk assessment and management by the Chinese government and health ministry. By the time travel was suspended, however, millions of Chinese citizens had passed through the affected region, unaware of the risks involved.
