<p>Risk factors for COVID-19 are still largely unknown, however, it is believed that the virus was transmitted to humans via contaminated live animals (snakes, civet cats). All three beta coronaviruses emerged via zoonotic transmission. Risk factors for zoonotic transmission of SARS and MERS were direct contact with infected animals. The suspected reservoir hosts are currently believed to be bats, similar to the SARS epidemic. The focal point of the epidemic is the Huanan seafood market. SARS was also hypothesized to have arisen from one of these types of markets. These commonalities may signal the need for closure of these wholesale markets in China. China has a long history of live-animal markets considered vital to communities across the country. As such, it is unlikely that these markets will be closed permanently, although their closure would be the strongest deterrent to another zoonotic disease outbreak. Re-opening of these markets should be under strict purview of the CCDCP, and appropriate measures should be taken to ensure health and hygiene protocols that limit live-animal and human contact are used. Surveillance of these markets may be vital for controlling the spread of zoonotic diseases. Surveillance activities may be similar to that of novel influenza viruses undertaken by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
