<p>There are several similarities between these viruses in their diagnosis and treatment. All three viruses are definitively diagnosed by utilizing cell cultures of respiratory fluids, serum antibody analysis or RT-PCR analysis of respiratory fluids from patients. All three viruses cause pneumonia, and radiography of the lungs is an important diagnostic tool for preliminary and broad identification of the severity of the disease. These viruses are similarly treated with antiviral therapies, although no specific antiviral therapy has yet been approved for COVID-19, with clinical trials underway. The major difference between COVID-19 and its predecessors is that this virus rarely produces runny noses or gastrointestinal symptoms in those infected, which are commonplace in MERS and SARS cases.
