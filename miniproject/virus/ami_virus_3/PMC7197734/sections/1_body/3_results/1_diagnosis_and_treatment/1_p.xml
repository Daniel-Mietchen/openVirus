<p>With respect to COVID-19, diagnosis was conducted initially by assessing clinical characteristics of the presenting patient, chest imaging and the ruling out of common bacterial and viral pneumonia. Once common bacterial and viral pathogens were ruled out, lower and upper respiratory tract specimens were obtained for cell culture and deep sequencing analysis. These specimens indicated a novel coronavirus initially known as ‘2019-nCoV’.

 </xref> PCR, using the ‘RespiFinderSmart22kit’ (PathoFinder BV) real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay, was used to detect viral RNA by targeting a consensus RNA dependent RNA polymerase region of pan β-CoV.

 </xref> A diagnostic test was developed soon after viral isolation. Treatment in some hospitals involves prophylactic antibiotics to prevent secondary infection.

 </xref> To date, no antiviral agent has been proven effective against COVID-19. Initial reports showed that oseltamivir was given to 93% of patients (orally administered 75 mg 2x/day) in combination with antibiotics.

 </xref> Patients experiencing severe illness (22%) were given corticosteroids (40–120 mg/day) to reduce lung inflammation due to high levels of cytokines caused by the virus, as part of a combined regimen for cases that were community-acquired and diagnosed at the designated hospital.

 </xref> Since the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir was already available in the local hospital, a randomized controlled trial was initiated quickly to assess the efficacy and safety of combined use of lopinavir and ritonavir in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 infection.
