 </xref> HCWs were infected, in part, through the use of nebulizers, endotracheal suction and intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, nasogastric feeding and high flow-rates of oxygen. The high risk presented by these procedures has implications for medical practice and organization of hospital care during the current infectious disease outbreak. The capacity of COVID-19 to infect healthcare workers has been confirmed, although comparisons with MERS and SARS cannot yet be made.
