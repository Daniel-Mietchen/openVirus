It took the Chinese government from 8 December, the first case of the virus, to the 3 January for the initiation of emergency monitoring, case investigation and investigation of the seafood market. Additionally, it took the government from 31 December, when the Wuhan Health Commission announced the outbreak, until 8 January for the government to publicly declare the novel coronavirus was the cause.
