Researchers should critically review the virusâ€™ genome sequence to ascertain the presence of human-to-human transmission, incubation period, modes of transmission, the common source of exposure and the presence of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases that go undetected. Risk assessment is badly needed to control the impact of the virus. This risk assessment should include an evaluation of the current standard of epidemiologic surveillance and identifying the risk factors for human-to-human transmission from asymptomatic cases.</p>
