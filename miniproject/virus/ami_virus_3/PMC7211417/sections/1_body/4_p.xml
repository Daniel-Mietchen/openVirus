<p>We propose that football players need a gradual return to physical activities during four separate phases. The first phase includes training in a small group, while the second phase comprises training of the entire team. Consequently, players will start with the national leagues’ competition (phase three), while in phase four, the clubs will be joining international competitions. Ideally, the club’s prior international competition should provide for all registered players, certificates issued by the accredited laboratories that the players are negative for COVID-19. In addition to all these procedures mentioned above, special preventive recommendations will be given to the football players and other team members in addition to the above described screening program prior to the continuation of competitive matches. Those include the following: 1) Trainings must be performed outdoors. Entry into club rooms and other closed spaces are prohibited. 2) No more than 5 players can participate in training sessions at the same time. The personal distance must be met at all times with at least 5 m separating the players. Players must use own lanes for running and sprints, if this requirement can’t be met, the same lane may be used by more players, but they must keep a distance between each other of at least 40 m when sprinting. Headers are not allowed in training sessions due to close contact of the ball with orifices of the body. 3) The number of coaches in training sessions should be kept to a minimum. Apart from the coaches only a physio or a team doctor may be present in the session. Protective equipment is mandatory for the medical team when they are getting in close contact to a player. Protective equipment includes face masks (N95, FFP2 or FFP3), protective gloves and face shields. 4) Original, sealed plastic water bottles must be used and properly discarded after training. They may not be shared between players. 5) Players and coaches must come to the training grounds alone, in their own cars, wearing appropriate clothes. Changing and shower rooms will not be available for the athletes nor coaches. 6) After the training session both players and coaches must go to their homes using the same transport they came with. This should be done orderly whilst respecting the social distancing measures. We propose to implement these measures first in the Croatian First League. They will also be recommended to lower leagues when they start with training and competitions and will be adhered to until a broader relaxation of preventive measures is advised by the local authorities. We presented our model to the leadership of FIFA and UEFA, with the goal of sharing our knowledge and ideas, as well as synchronising the actions of all the members during the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that adherence to the recommendations and testing of players will drastically reduce the risk of them being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens. In turn, it should allow a steady return to football we all know and love.</p>
