<p>Although professional football players are generally a healthy population without chronic respiratory, cardiac, renal diseases, as well as other chronic conditions, we must take COVID-19 seriously and act accordingly before returning to football pitches. Underlying genetic factors must also be taken into account as they might be aggravated by COVID-19 causing their clinical manifestation. Together with the list of medical examinations that players must undergo in order to be eligible to participate in UEFA competitions, we hereby propose a model for screening professional football players returning to the field after the lift of the ban on all sport activities because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides pre-season physical examination (primarily 12-lead ECG, ECG, spirometry with bronchodilatation test, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) test and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) test) and medical examination defined by the UEFA Medical Regulations (for the next season), we are proposing that every football player from the Croatian first National League must have negative consecutive two RT-qPCR COVID-19 pharyngeal swabs over a 5-day interval. Such tests are targeting two regions of the viral nucleocapsid gene (N1 and N2) or RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) and envelope (E) genes [

 <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is essential to do two subsequent tests during the proposed period. In addition to the detection of viral genetic material, we will target the immune response of the athlete being screened, looking specifically for antibodies (IgM and IgG) against the virus or viral antigens. Those tests are less complex than molecular tests but since antibody responses to infection take days to weeks to be detectable, serologic tests will not be reliable among those with recent exposure to virus. However, antibodies detected by this test indicate that a person had an immune response to COVID-19, implying the infection was subclinical if the person was asymptomatic. Serologic tests could play an important role in establishing diagnosis, if the COVID-19 patient with late complications of disease is examined since RT-qPCR could produce false-negative results, presumably because of the low viral load [

In addition to limiting the potential of viral spread with the start of regular sport activities, the results of this screening protocol will allow us to estimate how many football players have been infected nationally. The results will also provide information on the percentage of Croatian football players who have not had COVID-19 and are still at risk of being infected.
