<p>Altogether, as depicted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f01">Figure 1</xref>, these data show that modulating the renin-angiotensin axis alters ACE-2 expression in several tissues, especially in the lung and heart tissues. The use of ACE inhibitors and AT1R antagonists seems to upregulate ACE-2 expression, facilitating viral attachment and entry. The further presence of the virus itself or some cytokines, including TNF-Î±, leads to ACE-2 release from the cell membrane, abrogating its function to counteract Ang II.
