<p>Another interesting feature of the dynamics of ACE-2 expression in tissues is its ability to be cleaved from the cell surface by a metalloproteinase called ADAM17 (TACE) 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. The ACE-2 ectodomain gets cleaved, releasing soluble ACE-2 (sACE-2), whose role has not been fully elucidated. However, it has been shown that a higher concentration of sACE-2 in the plasma correlates with a poorer prognosis after heart failure 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Notably, sACE-2 may also be detected at higher concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid in hypertensive patients. This has been corroborated in Nefh
 <sup>cre</sup>x AT1aR
 <sup>flox/flox</sup> mice, indicating that ACE-2 and sACE-2 levels in the brain are associated with the etiology of neurogenic hypertension
