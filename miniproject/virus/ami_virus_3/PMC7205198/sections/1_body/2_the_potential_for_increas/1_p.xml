<p>Although a respiratory disease, COVID-19 is likely transmissible via fecal–oral contamination. While only a portion of Wuhan patients experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, these generally presented prior to respiratory symptoms [

During the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and SARS (and now COVID-19) coronavirus epidemics, patients often experienced gastrointestinal symptoms, and these viruses were detected in stool samples and shown to infect and replicate in intestinal tissues [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008265.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] as its host receptor. Collectively, this suggests that fecal–oral transmission will probably be important for COVID-19 spread [
