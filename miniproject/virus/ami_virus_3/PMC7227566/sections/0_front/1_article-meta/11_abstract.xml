     <bold>What is the main finding of this study?</bold>—AMS may be one of the first clinical symptoms of COVID 19 infection. The elderly are the most vulnerable to significant adverse complications from COVID 19 and AMS should be considered as a possible sign of infection to initiate treatment early in the course of the disease, perhaps before respiratory symptoms are apparent.

     <bold>What is the meaning of the finding?</bold>—Detecting patients infected with COVID 19 can be particularly important in the elderly and individuals in communal living situations (e.g., nursing homes and assisted living facilities) and could prompt early measures to provide treatment and quarantine the individual.
