<p id="para0009">This report includes four patients living independently in the nonmemory care section of a personal care home. All four patients had established diagnoses of dementia (two with Alzheimer's disease). The diagnoses were made by a geriatric psychiatrist Christine Figiel Ward (CFW) based on a neuropsychiatric evaluation and clinical information obtained from family members and caregivers. Each of the four patients developed AMS without fever or respiratory symptoms and were transferred to the local emergency department and were tested for the COVID-19 virus as part of their medical work up. All four patients tested positive for the COVID-19 virus and met the inclusion criteria for this report: AMS without fever or respiratory symptoms and positive COVID-19 test. After the patients tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, clinical information was obtained from their medical records, families and caregivers to determine their clinical symptoms prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19.</p>
