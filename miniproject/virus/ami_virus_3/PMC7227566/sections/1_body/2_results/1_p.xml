<p id="para0010">Four elderly patients (mean age = 83.3 ± 10.2 years; three females) initially presented with AMS which included: 1) confusion, agitation and refusing care; 2) confusion including laying in bed in diarrhea; 3) two patients with increasing confusion, disorientation, and loss of appetite.  All four patients had common risk factors for developing a COVID-19 infection: communal living, older age and multiple comorbid medical problems. None of the patients had the classic presentation of fever and/or respiratory symptoms.  All four patients were transferred to the emergency department (ED) within 24–48 hours of developing AMS. In the ED, all the patients were tested for COVID-19 using the molecular diagnosis/polymerase chain reaction-based testing. The test was positive for all four patients within 3–7 days. Chest x-rays were positive for pneumonia in all four patients.  All of the patients were hospitalized. Two patients were admitted to hospice and are currently in grave condition. The other two are currently in rehabilitation therapy, but still dependent on oxygen. A summary of the patients’ time to diagnosis and comorbid medical conditions is outlined in
