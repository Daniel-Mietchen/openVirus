<p>The protocol contains some steps such as the combination of lysis and binding buffer, the addition of the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s, adsorption, removal of supernatants, desorption, the collection of RNA sample for RT-PCR and recovery of MNP’s. The steps following the adsorption can also be omitted to lessen the time required for further processes. Thus, MNP’s-RNA complexes can be directly used for the amplication in the RT-PCR process. As this process does not include any centrifugation process, the same RNA-extraction protocol can be automated as shown in 
 <xref rid="F0004">Figure 4</xref>. This automation process tackles the disadvantageous centrifugation process of the conventional approach. Studies related to the real-time RNA-extraction process and RT-PCR amplification are in progress and will be presented in our upcoming reports. 
 <xref rid="F0005">Figure 5</xref> shows the merits of the current protocol proposed for viral RNA-extraction process.
