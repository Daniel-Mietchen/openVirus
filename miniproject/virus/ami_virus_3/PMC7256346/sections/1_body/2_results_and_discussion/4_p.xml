<p>The TGA curves for both the pristine ZNF NP’s and surface functionalised ZNF NP’s are shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(d</xref>). The same kind of initial loss in weight below 250°C was observed for both the samples, which is appeared due to the removal of hydroxyl groups and water molecules remained during synthesis process. The total weight loss of 2.98% was observed for pristine ZNF NP’s. No further weight loss was observed above 400°C for pristine ZNF NP’s. The two-step loss in the weight up to 500°C was observed for surface functionalised ZNF NP’s which credited to the de-composition and consequent elimination of coating agents. This weight loss of 16.24% mainly originated for the silica and polymer coating content present over the ZNF NP’s. It assures the total % of coating layer presented on the core of ZNF NP’s. Moreover, TGA analysis confirms that coating agent bonded chemically with the ZNF NP’s core and not by means of adsorbing the surface of ZNF NP’s [
