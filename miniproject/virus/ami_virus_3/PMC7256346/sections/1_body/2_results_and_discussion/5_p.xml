<p>The Zeta potentials of pristine ZNF NP’s, ZNF@Si, ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub> and ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub>@CPoly were measured to authenticate the surface functionali﻿sation of ZNF NP’s. 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(e</xref>) displays Zeta potentials of pristine ZNF NP’s, ZNF@Si, ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub> and ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub>@CPoly. It is noted from
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(e</xref>) that average zeta potential of pristine ZNF NP’s is −12.37 ± 0.92 mV which changes to 15 ± 0.85 mV for silica modified ZNF NP’s. This change in zeta potential can be due to the change in nanoparticles surface from hydrophilic-to-hydrophobic by the silica surface. This zeta potential values further increases to 23.87 ± 0.79 mV for NH
 <sub>2</sub> modified MNP’s. The NH
 <sub>2</sub> groups available on silica modified ZNF NP’s makes it more hydrophobic to increase the zeta potential value. The significant decrease up to −41.67 ± 0.65 mV in zeta potential value was noted for the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s, which signifies the successful CPoly functionali﻿sation of ZNF NP’s. In addition to this, the noteworthy change in zeta potential values indicates the enhanced colloidal stability. 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(f</xref>) displays the HDD size of the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s calculated using the dynamic light scattering (DLS). The HDD size of the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s was noted as 17.92 ± 1.6 nm with no noticeable aggregation. The insignificant changes in HDD size were observed even after 10 days (inset of 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(f</xref>)), which displays the enhanced stability of the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s.
