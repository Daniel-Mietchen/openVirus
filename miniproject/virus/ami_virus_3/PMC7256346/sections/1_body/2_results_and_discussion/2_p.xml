 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(a</xref>) displays the TEM image of the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s, which shows the spherical shape morphology of the particles. Some kind of agglomeration was observed in the TEM image, which may be due to the magnetic interface between the particles. The silica layer on the core of ZNF NP’s can be observed in the TEM image, which confirms the successful attachment of silica on ZNF NP’s. 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(b</xref>) displays the particle size distribution of the surface functionalised ZNF NP’s. The average particle size was found to be 10.46 ± 1.5 nm. This shows the nanocrystalline nature of the prepared surface functionalised ZNF NP’s.
