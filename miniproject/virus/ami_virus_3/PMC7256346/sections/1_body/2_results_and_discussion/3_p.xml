<p>The nanocrystalline appearance of the pristine ZNF NP’s and surface functionalised ZNF NP’s was determined via recording XRD patterns as shown in 
 <xref rid="F0002">Figure 2(c</xref>). Both the XRD patterns show single phase formation of MNP’s with formation of spinel cubic structure. No significant changes was observed in the XRD pattern of surface functionalised ZNF NP’s. However, slight background noise was observed in second XRD pattern due to the amorphous nature of PVA and silica. The crystallite size values determined from ‘Debye-Scherrer’s formula’ was found in the range is 12–14 nm showing the nanoscale formation of both the pristine ZNF NP’s and surface functionalised ZNF NP’s.
