<p>The surface functionalised zinc ferrite NP’s were fabricated successfully. The nanocrystalline nature and spherical shape morphology of the fabricated NP’s were investigated through TEM and XRD. The successful functionali﻿sation and stability of the fabricated NP’s were verified through zeta potential and HDD size determination. The surface functionalised zinc ferrite NP’s assisted uncomplicated but potential RNA-extraction protocol was proposed for active detection of COVID-19. The simple and cost effective nature of this protocol may offer capable substitute in near future for conventional techniques to tackle the tedious time taking procedures and man-power requirement, and therefore demonstrates applicability in active COVID-19 detection. More studies are required to employ this protocol in clinical diagnostics of COVID-19.</p>
