<p>The pristine zinc ferrite nanoparticles (ZNF NP’s) were prepared by sol-gel auto-combustion technique [
 <xref rid="CIT0012">12</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0013">13</xref>]. In brief, nitrates of metal ions (Zn
 <sup>2+</sup>, Fe
 <sup>3+</sup>) along with citric acid (C
 <sub>6</sub>H
 <sub>8</sub>O
 <sub>7</sub>) were dissolved in DD water and were continuously stirred for half an hour. The pH of the solution then adjusted to the 7 by the addition of liquid ammonia. Further, the pH adjusted solution was continuously stirred and heated at 80°C until it gets converted into gel. After the formation of gel, the heat was raised to 120°C which resulted in the auto combustion of the gel to form a fluffy loose powder. The powder was then grinded and sintered at 600°C for 4 h to acquire good crystallinity. The sintered ZNF NP’s then used to prepare silica-coated ZNF NP’s (ZNF@Si). For this, 0.5 g of ZNF NP’s, 20 mL DD water and 15 mL NaOH were inserted into 200 mL of ethanol and ultrasonicated for 15 min at 27°C. Further, 1.5 mL of TEOS was then inserted drop-by-drop and continuously stirred for 3 h at 27°C to form as silica layer on the core of ZNF NP’s. The silica modified ZNF NP’s then accumulated using magnet and washed many times with DD water and ethanol to eliminate excessive TEOS. Afterwards, the APTES (0.25 mL) was added drop-by-drop in the solution, containing the mixture of 0.3 g of ZNF@Si and 100 mL isopropanol and ultrasonicated for 4 h to modify the surface of ZNF@Si with NH
 <sub>2</sub>. The NH
 <sub>2</sub> modified ZNF@Si (ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub>) then accumulated using magnet and washed many times with DD water and ethanol to eliminate excessive APTES. Further, 0.1 g of ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub> was inserted into the DMSO solution and subsequently mixed with 3 g of carboxyl-modified PVA (CPoly) and then ultrasonicated for 15 min. Further, the NaOH solution was added into the mixture and exposed to the sonication of 30 min under continuous stirring. The CPoly functionalised ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub> (ZNF@Si@NH
 <sub>2</sub>@CPoly) then accumulated using magnet and washed many times with DD water and DMSO to eliminate excessive CPoly. The schematic procedure for this whole process is given in
