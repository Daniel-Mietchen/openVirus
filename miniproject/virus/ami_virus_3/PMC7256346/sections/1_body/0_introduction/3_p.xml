<p>RT-PCR is recognised as a high quality and consistently employed tool to analyse and quantify the different RNAâ€™s in the labs and clinical diagnostics due to elevated sensitiveness in RNA amplification. Subsequent to the occurrence of COVID-19, numerous techniques assisted with RT-PCR for the detection of COVID-19 have been reported [

 <xref rid="CIT0005">5</xref>]. Even though, RT-PCR assisted techniques have been extensively applied in COVID-19 detection, their applicability in precise detection of virus and outbreak control is relentlessly hindered due to time taking processes and man-power requirement. The pure quantification of nucleic acid extracts from the complexive specimens are the main requirement for potential RT-PCR analysis [
 <xref rid="CIT0006">6</xref>]. The lower efficiency of the extraction may result in the unfortunate indications through the amplification process and consequently appears in the wrong diagnosis. Conventional techniques for nucleic acid binding consist many steps which are lengthy, time taking and susceptible to impurities [

In the supervision and controlling of impulsive epidemics like COVID-19, these conventional techniques may consume heavy man-power, however, lacking efficient detection with a higher risk of cross-infections. Therefore, rapid, expedient and automotive techniques for the extraction of nucleic acid are extremely necessary not only in COVID-19 detection but also for other diseases.
