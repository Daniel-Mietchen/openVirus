<p>To tackle these drawbacks, magnetic nanoparticles (MNP’s) assisted extraction techniques are convenient, simple and companionable with automotive processes [
 <xref rid="CIT0008">8</xref>,
 <xref rid="CIT0009">9</xref>]. The surface functionalised MNP’s adsorbs the nucleic acid from the lysis solution and are quickly isolated from most of the contaminations with the help of external magnetic field. Following this quick process, nucleic acid can be further isolated from the functionalised surface of MNP’s by desorption process in eluent. Even though this technique is much easier and quicker than conventional techniques, MNP’s assisted extraction process still consists of several steps, which is insufficient for practical detection.
