<p>In light of this, a more simple and modernise MNP’s assisted RNA-extraction protocol is proposed for potential extraction and RT-PCR-based diagnosis of COVID-19. The MNP’s of zinc ferrite (ZNF) were fabricated by the cost-efficient sol-gel auto-combustion route and subsequently, its surface was functionalised with carboxyl containing polymers (CPoly). Among the magnetic materials, zinc ferrite was chosen due to its high chemical stability, soft magnetic behaviour, easy preparation and biocompatible nature [

Due to simple and cost-effective nature of this technique, it may provide a capable substitute for conventional techniques.
