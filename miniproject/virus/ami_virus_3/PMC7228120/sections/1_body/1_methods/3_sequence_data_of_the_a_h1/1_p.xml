<p>We downloaded all available HA and NA sequences of the A/H1N1pdm strains isolated in China from NCBI Influenza Virus Resource and GISAID EpiFlu database by 12 June, 2019. After discarding low-quality sequences with gap or incomplete coding region, and 100% identical sequences, 1,259 HA and 1,043 NA sequences of the A/H1N1pdm were obtained. Furthermore, all available full-genome sequences of the A/H1N1pdm from China were also downloaded to the database by 12 June, 2019, and a total of 320 full genomes were obtained.</p>
