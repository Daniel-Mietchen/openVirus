<p>RNA was extracted by Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen, United States). cDNA was first generated by SuperScript
 <sup>®</sup> III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR (Invitrogen, United States). Universal primers MBTuni12 and MBTnui13 were used to amplify all 8 influenza A viruses genomic segments as described previously (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>). Two additional reactions for PB1 and PB2 genomic segments were separately performed using primer sets of Ba-PB2-1 and Ba-PB2-2341R, and Bm-PB1-1, and Bm-PB1-2341R (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hoffmann et al., 2001</xref>). The PCR products were verified by gel electrophoresis, and purified using a QIAquick PCR Purification kit (Qiagen, Germany). Three purified DNA products were pooled together and fragmented with Covaris system (Covaris Inc., United States) for ∼200 bp. DNA libraries with unique indexes were constructed using Hieff NGSTM MaxUpII DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina
 <sup>®</sup> according to manufacturer’s instructions, and mixed in equal concentrations for next generation sequencing (NGS). NGS was performed on Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform by Novogene Co., Ltd. The sequencing depth was about 0.3G for each sample (about 20,000 × genome coverage). The raw data were deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) database (study PRJNA609449).
