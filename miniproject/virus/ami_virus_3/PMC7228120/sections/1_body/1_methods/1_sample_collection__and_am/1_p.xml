<p>Nasopharyngeal swabs from children with symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) were collected from Shanghai Children’s Medical Center from 2017 to 2019. The collection of samples was approved by the Ethics Committees of Shanghai Children’s Medical Center. Oral or written informed consents were obtained from children’s parents or guardians before sample collection. Infection with influenza A was determined by Colloidal gold immunochromatographic assay (Wondfo Co., Ltd, China) and an in-house RT-qPCR assay specific for influenza A virus. From the influenza A virus positive samples by both assays, we randomly selected 99 for further amplification and sequencing of complete genome.</p>
