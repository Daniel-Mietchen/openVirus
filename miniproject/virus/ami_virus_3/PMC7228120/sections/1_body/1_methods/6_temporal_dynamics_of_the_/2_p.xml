<p>To understand the evolutionary dynamics of seasonal influenza in China from 2009 to 2019, all available 1,192 HA sequences of the A/H1N1pdm from China were further analyzed, and compared with A/H3N2, influenza B/Victoria and influenza B/Yamagata. There are 1,021, 545, and 538 HA sequences for A/H3N2, influenza B/Victoria and influenza B/Yamagata from China to be downloaded from GenBank and GISAID, respectively. A strict molecular clock, the SRD06 codon position model, HKY85 plus gamma substitution model, and a GMRF Bayesian Skyride in BEAST v.1.10.4 were used to infer the phylogeny and the population dynamics of the seasonal influenza viruses.</p>
