<p>The raw data of NGS was first cleaned using Cutadapt v1.18 by removing Illumina sequencing adaptor. The low-quality sequences were removed under the parameters of SLIDINGWINDOW: 4:20 and MINLEN:50 using Trimmomatic v0.38 (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Bolger et al., 2014</xref>). Host contaminated reads were filtered out by Bowtie2 v2.3.4.3 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). The remaining high-quality reads were 
 <italic>de novo</italic> assembled by Megahit (v1.1.3) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Contigs were de-replicated, putative chimeric sequences were removed, and the remaining contigs were clustered at 98% identity using Vsearch v2.10.4 (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Rognes et al., 2016</xref>). Contigs with a length of more than 500nt were further mapped to the INFLUENZA database (download on October 25, 2018) by Blastn (version 2.7.1+) (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Camacho et al., 2009</xref>) and unique genomic sequences containing the complete ORFs of each influenza genomic segment were generated. Only the assembled genomic sequence with more than 80% genomic coverage were used. A total of 99 genomic sequences of influenza A were obtained, and deposited in GISAID database
