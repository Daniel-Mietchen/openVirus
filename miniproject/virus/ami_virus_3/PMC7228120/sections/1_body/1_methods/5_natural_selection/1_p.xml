<p>The ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN/dS) was used to test whether the A/H1N1pdm was under positive selection. The dN/dS ratio was an average over all sites and lineages that was estimated using the M0 model of Codeml program implemented in PAML4.8 (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">Yang, 2007</xref>). To access the adaptive evolution process of A/H1N1pdm from 2009 to 2019, we divided the A/H1N1pdm sequences into six periods of 2009–2010, 2011–2012, 2013–2014, 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2018–2019, and calculated the dN/dS ratio of each time period. Furthermore, the positively selected sites for each gene was inferred using the MEME method in Datamonkey

 </sup> and the Bayesian Experience Bayesian (M8 model + BEB) method in PAML4.8. To see whether reassortment occurs in evolution of the A/H1N1pdm virus, tanglegrams were generated based on the ML phylogenies of eight genomic segments using the software Dendroscope v.3.6.3 (
