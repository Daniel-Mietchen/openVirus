<p>We performed phylogeographic analysis to assess the spatial transmission pattern of A/H1N1pdm virus in seven geographical regions of China (North China, Northeast China, Northwest China, Central China, East China, South China, and Southwest China). The phylogenetic analysis showed that all A/H1N1pdm strains were rooted with the strains from East China, and the main trunk of the MCC tree was also characterized by an origin of East China (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="DS4">Supplementary Table S3</xref>). Two of the migration routes were from East China to South China and Northeast China. Other five migration routes were involved in South China, from where the virus was dispersed to Central China, Southwest China, North China, Northeast China, and Northwest China. These results indicate that East China and South China, as the primary seeding populations, played important roles in national migration of A/H1N1pdm virus. Very strongly supported migration links were also observed from Central China to Northeast China, and from Northeast China to Northwest China.
