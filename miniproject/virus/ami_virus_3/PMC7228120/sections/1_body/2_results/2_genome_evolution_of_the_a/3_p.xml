<p>Analysis of the ratio of the number of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions per site (dN/dS) revealed significant difference among eight gene segments of the A/H1N1pdm virus (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Higher dN/dS ratios were observed in HA, NA, and NS genes, implying stronger selection pressure acting on these genes. Interestingly, we found a decreasing trend of the dN/dS ratio in almost all gene segments except NA that was converse from 2009 to 2017 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Elevated dN/dS ratio occurred in HA, NS1, and NP genes during the 2018â€“2019 pandemic period, while the opposite was observed in NA gene. The changes in dN/dS ratio over time appeared not to be affected by the sampling bias (i.e., greater sampling density) in some years (
