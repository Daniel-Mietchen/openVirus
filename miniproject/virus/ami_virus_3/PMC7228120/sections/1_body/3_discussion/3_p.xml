<p>HA and NA are the most crucial proteins for infection and transmission of influenza viruses. HA is responsible for cell attachment by binding to sialic acid receptors on host cell surface and entry by mediating membrane fusion (

 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Caton et al., 1982</xref>). The HA1 subunit forms a globular head of the HA, including the receptor binding site and five antigenic sites (Sa, Sb, Ca1, Ca2, and Cb) (

From 2009 to 2019, continuous genetic changes were observed in HA and NA glycoproteins of A/H1N1pdm virus, and 15 amino acid changes were fixed in each of both proteins along the main trunk of the phylogenetic trees. Among these fixed mutations in HA, majority (80%) occurred on the HA head and six (S202T, K180Q, S179N, S181T, S91R, S200P) were situated either at antigenic sites or in proximity to the receptor-binding pocket. For NA, two fixed mutations were found to be situated at antigenic sites (

Importantly, we found that new genetic variants of A/H1N1pdm virus appeared almost every 1â€“2 years and replaced previously existing antigenic variants to dominate the forthcoming influenza pandemic. The frequency of emergence of new A/H1N1pdm antigenic variants appeared to be higher than previously thought (
