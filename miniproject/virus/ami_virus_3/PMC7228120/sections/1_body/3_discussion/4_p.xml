<p>Influenza vaccination is the primary measure to prevent and control seasonal influenza virus infections (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Recent study showed that individual immune selection pressure has weak effects on the evolution of seasonal influenza viruses (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Han et al., 2019</xref>). However, the effect of vaccination on influenza evolution is less clear. The vaccine-induced effect might be underestimated because of the low influenza vaccine coverage rate (&lt;10% of the world population) (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Partridge and Kieny, 2013</xref>). The first A/H1N1pdm vaccine was developed based on A/California/07/2009, and was licensed in 2009. It was recommended to be used globally by WHO until to 2017 when a new A/Michigan/45/2015-based vaccine was licensed to keep pace with the emergence of new circulating variants (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Petrova and Russell, 2018</xref>). From 2009 to 2016, newly emerging A/H1N1pdm strains gradually accumulated 15 amino acid changes in each of both HA and NA glycoproteins compared to the A/California/07/2009 vaccine strain. The accumulation of these mutations might be caused by adaptive immunity induced by prior infections with old antigenic variants and vaccination during this long-term period. Compared to the A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine strain, the newly emerging A/H1N1pdm lineages in 2017 rapidly evolved 3–4 amino acid changes in each of HA and NA glycoproteins during a short-term period, and two amino acid changes (S91R and S181T) on HA are associated with the Sa and Cb antigenic sites. Relate to high vaccination coverage (35.5–70.4%) in developed countries (e.g., the United States and Europe), China has a very low influenza vaccination coverage rate (about 1.5–2%). Therefore, the accumulation of these amino acid changes in the 2017 A/H1N1pdm lineages may be less likely related to the use of the vaccine (at least in China), but were more likely generated under the selective pressure of pre-existing immunity induced by the predominant A/H1N1pdm strains. Because this study focuses on the phylodynamics of A/H1N1pdm virus, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) assay was not performed to measure the effects of fixed amino acid changes on the antigenicity of the virus. Furthermore, we also did not conduct experiments to validate functional effects of the changes in NA glycoprotein. Bayesian phylogenetic analyses suggested multiple introduction of A/H1N1pdm virus into China from other regions of world. The substitutions (HA: 91, 181, 202, and 312; NA: 77, 81, 188, and 449) occurring in the newly emerging A/H1N1pdm variants in 2017 were also observed in the strains circulating globally during 2017–2019, but not in the strains before 2017 (data not shown). These amino acid mutations might lead to reduced efficacy of the WHO-recommended A/Michigan/45/2015 vaccine due to high sequence similarity to the predominant circulating strains. Wide spread of the 2017 newly emerging A/H1N1pdm lineages in population implies an urgent need to update the A/Michigan/45/2015-based vaccine, and as a response, WHO updated the vaccine composition using A/Brisbane/02/2018 strain for 2019–2020.
