<p>Seasonal influenza epidemics are a major public health burden, causing significant morbidity and mortality all over the world (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Iuliano et al., 2018</xref>). Two subtypes of influenza A virus (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2), and two lineages of influenza B virus (Victoria and Yamagata) are major causative agents responsible for the seasonal influenza epidemics, and often co-circulating. The classical seasonal A(H1N1) had circulated in humans from 1918 to 1957 and from 1977 to 2009 (
