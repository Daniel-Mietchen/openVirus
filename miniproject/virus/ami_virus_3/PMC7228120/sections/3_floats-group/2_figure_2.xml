  <p>Phylogeny of A/H1N1pdm virus by HA gene and three-dimensional structure of HA glycoprotein. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Maximum likelihood tree inferred from 1259 A/H1N1pdm virus HA sequences in China from 2009 to 2019. The color of the branch is marked by the isolation year of the strain. Fixed amino acid mutations are mapped at the major nodes of the tree. Positively selected sites are highlighted by asterisks (*). Scale bar represents number of substitutions per site. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Three-dimensional structure map of HA monomer of A/H1N1pdm virus (Protein Data Bank code: 3LZG). Antigenic sites were shown in red in the three-dimensional structure.
