 </xref> analyses 214 patients presenting SARS-CoV-2 infection in January and February 2020, 78 (36.4%) of whom presented one or more of the following neurological manifestations: dizziness, headache, impaired consciousness, stroke, ataxia, seizures, anosmia, visual alterations, neuropathic pain, and muscle damage. Stroke was reported in 2.8% of the total cohort, occurring in 5.7% of patients with severe respiratory infection (4 ischaemic and one haemorrhagic stroke) and 0.8% of those with less severe symptoms (one ischaemic stroke). Two of the 6 patients with stroke attended hospital due to hemiplegia and were incidentally found to have pneumonia secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection at admission, having presented no respiratory symptoms previously. Although the median time between onset of respiratory symptoms and stroke was 10 days, stroke occurred 1-2 days after hospitalisation in most cases. Patients with severe neurological damage had higher D-dimer levels than other patients, and presented greater immunosuppression caused by the virus, demonstrated by the lower lymphocyte count.
