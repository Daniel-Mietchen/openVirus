<p id="par0020">Before 2003, acute infection with different coronaviruses was known to cause congestion of the upper respiratory tract; these viruses are endemic, and their relationship with several chronic neurological diseases are currently under study.

 </xref> Since then, 3 new coronaviruses have caused epidemics of respiratory syndromes with high mortality rates, which are occasionally associated with neurological complications. The 2003 epidemic was caused by the SARS-CoV virus, the 2012 epidemic by the MERS-CoV virus, and the current epidemic (COVID-19), which began in Wuhan (China) in December 2019, was caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. During the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic, a series of 206 cases in Singapore included 5 cases of large-vessel stroke

Autopsies performed during the 2003 epidemic revealed venous thrombosis, inflammation, and fibrinoid necrosis of small vessel walls in many organs, including the lungs, heart, and brain.
