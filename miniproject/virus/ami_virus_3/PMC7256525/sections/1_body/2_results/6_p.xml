<p id="par0045">While history of cardiovascular disease and risk factors are not the main focus of this review, we should note that, like history of stroke, they are associated with poorer prognosis of COVID-19. The largest, most recent Chinese register, which includes 72 314 patients with COVID-19, reports a mortality rate of 2.3% globally, 10.5% in patients with history of cardiovascular disease (including stroke), and 7.3% in patients with diabetes.
