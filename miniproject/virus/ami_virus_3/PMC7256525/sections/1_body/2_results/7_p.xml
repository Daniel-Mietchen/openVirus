<p id="par0050">SARS-CoV-2 may cause stroke by several mechanisms: invasion of vessel walls, coagulation disorders, cerebral embolism secondary to myocardial damage, or destabilisation of an existing atheromatous plaque. The virus is able to invade vessel walls because endothelial cells express the ACE2 receptor, which the virus uses to enter cells; SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the endothelium.
