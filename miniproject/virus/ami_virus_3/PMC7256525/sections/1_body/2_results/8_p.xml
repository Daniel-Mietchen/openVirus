<p id="par0055">Another potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 may cause stroke is by interfering with coagulation. Respiratory infection with 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> or influenza virus is known to increase the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke; the influenza vaccine partially prevents the occurrence of these events.

 </xref> The general inflammatory status or “cytokine storm” that SARS-CoV-2 causes in some patients may alter coagulation, increasing D-dimer levels and procoagulant activity.
