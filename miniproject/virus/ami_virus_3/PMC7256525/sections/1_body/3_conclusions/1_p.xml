<p id="par0085">History of stroke is associated with a three-fold increase in the risk of death due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Stroke currently seems not to be one of the main complications of COVID-19. The virus enters the brain parenchyma, endothelium, and heart, and alters coagulation, which may lead to stroke; we must therefore remain vigilant. Patients with stroke may concomitantly present SARS-CoV-2 infection, even if they have not previously shown respiratory symptoms.</p>
