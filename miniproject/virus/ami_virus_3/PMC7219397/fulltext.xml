Although infections by human coronaviruses (e.g., HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43) frequently cause common cold symptoms in healthy individuals, severe clinical illness is relatively rare even in immunocompromised individuals, infants, and the elderly. Considerably more has been known about animal coronaviruses, leading to vaccines to prevent the infection of commercially important domesticated animals (e.g., cats, dogs, and cattle). Experiments over many years with murine hepatitis virus (MHV), a neurotropic and hepatotropic coronavirus, have provided substantial insight into the pathogenesis of viral hepatitis and central nervous diseases, including multiple sclerosis. While these studies enhanced our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of coronaviruses, only the recent explosive emergence of highly pathogenic coronaviruses in humans has sparked intense interest in developing countermeasures for human viruses in this family.</p><p id="p0015">In 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus emerged from bats and possibly civet cats in China. Within eight months, SARS-CoV spread to 27 countries around the world, resulting in 8,096 human infections and 774 deaths (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). An unprecedented level of containment, made possible by extensive collaboration among international public health organizations, limited transmission and human disease. Ten years later, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated from an individual suffering from severe respiratory disease and renal failure. As observed with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV spread via travel and contact with infected individuals, resulting in transmission and mortality within and beyond the Arabian Peninsula (&#x0223c;2,494 human cases, 858 deaths). Serological studies identified dromedary camels as the principal reservoir for MERS-CoV. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV, two additional human coronaviruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have been discovered. Sequencing studies of bat reservoirs identified a large number of novel coronaviruses with an unknown potential to emerge in humans (<xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Graham et&#x000a0;al., 2013</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">An appreciation of the considerable threat of coronaviruses to global health prompted remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as efforts to develop vaccines. In this Forum, we discuss how the prior study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enabled the extraordinarily rapid development of candidate vaccines that hopefully can curtail the incendiary spread of a novel, highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this unprecedented pace has eclipsed some of the fundamental basic and translational studies that customarily guide vaccine development and evaluation under non-pandemic circumstances. Accordingly, we discuss the challenges of rapid vaccine development during a pandemic response.</p><sec id="sec1.1"><title>The SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic</title><p id="p0025">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus first isolated in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (COVID-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (<xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Guan et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from COVID-19. Virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, and the United States and epicenters in large urban cities. Most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 April 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at &#x0223c;4%. The extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. Rapid implementation and deployment of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Coronavirus Structure and Entry</title><p id="p0030">Coronaviruses are round, &#x0223c;120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike (S) protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface. Three additional viral structural proteins (envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]), together with a lipid membrane and &#x0223c;25&#x02013;31 kilobase viral genome, comprise the virion (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>
A; <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). The M and E proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the S protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. Interactions between the M glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. The small structural E protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed. The nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle.<fig id="fig1"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Structure of the SARS-CoV-2</p><p>(A) The SARS-CoV-2 is a spherical virus particle that incorporates three structural proteins into its lipid envelope (S, M, and E) and encapsidates a positive-stranded RNA genome in complex with the N protein.</p><p>(B) The structure of the S protein trimer was solved using cryo-electron microscopy and is shown (PDB: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6VYB" id="intref0070">6VYB</ext-link>) (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). The RBD (shown in green) may existing in an open or closed (up or down) structural state; the RBD of one of the three S protomers within the trimer is shown in the up position.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gr1_lrg"/></fig></p><p id="p0035">The S protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). In some circumstances, the S protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. The S protein is a class I viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [HA], HIV-1 [gp160], and Ebola [glycoprotein, GP]). This class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield S1 and S2 fragments, followed by further processing of S2 to yield a smaller S2&#x02032; protein. Cleavage also may occur during viral egress. The S1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), whereas the carboxyl terminal S2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. The structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2&#x000a0;S protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5&#x000c5; using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the SARS-CoV S protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure&#x000a0;1</xref>B; <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et&#x000a0;al., 2020</xref>). Both viruses utilize human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cellular receptor, consistent with the high conservation of the RBD.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Vaccine Development</title><p id="p0040">The application of strategies that have worked for related viral family members provides a path for rapid vaccine development against a newly emerging virus. For example, several of the antigen targets, vaccine platforms, and clinical trial approaches used for Zika virus (ZIKV) after its emergence in 2015 were based on prior studies and successes with related flaviviruses. Several vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, many focused on the S protein, have&#x000a0;been developed and tested extensively in pre-clinical models (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et&#x000a0;al., 2018</xref>).

Extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ADE assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic> outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>. This may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ADE assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. The inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> assays, reduces enhancement in an IgG subclass-dependent manner. ADE has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of DENV infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral T&#x000a0;cells. Coronavirus antibodies that enhance <italic>in&#x000a0;vitro</italic> have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. Is the infection of Fc-&#x003b3;-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to COVID-19 disease severity? Studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. For DENV, the most compelling evidence for a role of ADE in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans.</p><p id="p0095">A second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response. Enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a Th2-directed T&#x000a0;cell response (<xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Ruckwardt et&#x000a0;al., 2019</xref>). Immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. While preclinical studies of multiple SARS-CoV vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar Th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bolles et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>). The structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. Based on recent progress in RSV vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion S epitopes together with a Th1 T&#x000a0;cell response may be key features of a safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0100">The development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. This traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. Although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. Against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. However, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. Studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. In this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Bolles</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Deming</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name><name><surname>Agnihothram</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Whitmore</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferris</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Funkhouser</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gralinski</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Totura</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Heise</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><name><surname>Baric</surname><given-names>R.S.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A double-inactivated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus vaccine provides incomplete protection in mice and induces increased eosinophilic proinflammatory pulmonary response upon challenge</article-title><source>J.&#x000a0;Virol.</source><volume>85</volume><year>2011</year><fpage>12201</fpage><lpage>12215</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21937658</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>de Wit</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><name><surname>van Doremalen</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><name><surname>Falzarano</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><name><surname>Munster</surname><given-names>V.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>SARS and MERS: recent insights into emerging coronaviruses</article-title><source>Nat.
