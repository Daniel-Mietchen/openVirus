<p id="p0025">SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus first isolated in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 from a cluster of acute respiratory illness cases (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a clinical syndrome, coronavirus-induced disease-19 (COVID-19), which is characterized by fever, cough, and shortness of breath that can progress rapidly to respiratory and cardiac failure requiring mechanical ventilation (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Guan et al., 2020</xref>). The elderly, immunocompromised, and those with co-morbid metabolic, pulmonary, and cardiac conditions are at a markedly greater risk of death from COVID-19. Virtually all countries and territories have been affected, with major epidemics in China, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Iran, and the United States and epicenters in large urban cities. Most cases are spread by direct human-to-human and droplet contact, with a contribution from transmission in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals. SARS-CoV-2 has caused a global pandemic with more than 2,400,000 infections to date, 165,000 deaths (as of 19 April 2020), and a case-fatality rate estimated at ∼4%. The extensive morbidity, mortality, and destabilizing social and economic consequences highlight the critical need for the accelerated development of countermeasures. Rapid implementation and deployment of an effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine has the potential to lessen the deleterious effects of infection, especially in vulnerable populations, curb transmission, end the pandemic, and prevent its return.
