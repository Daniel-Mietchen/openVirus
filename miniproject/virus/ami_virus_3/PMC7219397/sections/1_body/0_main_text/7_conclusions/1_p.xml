<p id="p0100">The development of an effective viral vaccine is a challenge typically guided by decades of basic research on viral biology and the host response to infection. This traditional path is not feasible for a rapidly emerging, highly virulent pathogen like SARS-CoV-2 for which a dire need for a vaccine exists. Although behavioral changes may stem the spread of infections, vaccination likely will be required to prevent the establishment of seasonal (or additional) waves of infection and disease. Against the backdrop of the many unknowns about coronavirus immunity, there is some risk associated with expedited vaccine development during a pandemic. However, this uncertainty must be balanced by the enormous cost of inaction. Studies of other pathogenic coronaviruses have enabled the rapid design of candidate SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, provided insight into aspects of immunity that may be important for protection, and identified features that merit attention with respect to vaccine safety. In this setting, carefully designed clinical trials in humans that establish and monitor safety and define correlates and durability of protection, may not only result in an effective countermeasure that curtails the pandemic but also provide key mechanistic answers into immune control of SARS-CoV-2 infection and possibly related highly pathogenic coronaviruses that could emerge in the future.</p>
