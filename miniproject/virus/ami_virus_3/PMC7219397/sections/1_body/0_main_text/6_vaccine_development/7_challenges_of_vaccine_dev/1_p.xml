<p id="p0070">Despite the expedited design of vaccine candidates against a newly emerging virus in a pandemic setting, there remain substantive challenges for implementation due, in part, to a need to concurrently unravel fundamental aspects of virus biology and immunity along with product development efforts. This approach contrasts with vaccine efforts against viruses that have been studied for many years (e.g., influenza, dengue [DENV], and respiratory syncytial viruses) for which we understand in great detail both the antigenicity of the viral structural proteins and the nature of protective and potentially pathological immune responses.</p>
