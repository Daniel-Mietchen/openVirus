Developed by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in collaboration with Moderna, mRNA-1273 is a lipid-encapsulated modified mRNA expressing a prefusion-stabilized S protein. The design of the S protein antigen encoded by mRNA-1273 was informed by prior structure-guided antigen design studies of the stabilization of class I fusion proteins of MERS-CoV and other coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Pallesen et al., 2017</xref>). These studies identified stabilizing proline substitutions in the central helix of S2 that reduced the fusion activity and allowed high-level expression of trimeric S in an antigenically native prefusion context. The structure of the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 antigen encoded by mRNA-1273 has been solved (

Subjects will be followed for 12 months following the second dose for safety, with immunogenicity as a secondary objective.
