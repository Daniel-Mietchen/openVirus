<p id="p0065">Multiple clinical studies are underway to explore the use of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as an immunomodulatory vaccine to protect against COVID-19 disease (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). BCG is a live-attenuated isolate of 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> delivered as a low-cost vaccine to more than 100 million children each year to protect against 
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (TB). Multiple studies in humans and mice suggest BCG administration confers a non-specific protective effect against viral infections (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Moorlag et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanisms of BCG-mediated cross protections may include enhanced Th1 and Th17 responses to heterologous antigens and the induction of non-specific memory or “trained immunity” in innate immune cells capable of producing inflammatory cytokines when challenged secondarily by virus infection.
