<p id="p0040">The application of strategies that have worked for related viral family members provides a path for rapid vaccine development against a newly emerging virus. For example, several of the antigen targets, vaccine platforms, and clinical trial approaches used for Zika virus (ZIKV) after its emergence in 2015 were based on prior studies and successes with related flaviviruses. Several vaccine strategies against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, many focused on the S protein, have been developed and tested extensively in pre-clinical models (
