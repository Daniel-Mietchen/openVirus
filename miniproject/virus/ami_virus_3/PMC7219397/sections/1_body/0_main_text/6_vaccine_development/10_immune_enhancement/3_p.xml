<p id="p0095">A second potential mechanism for vaccine-induced disease enhancement results from skewing of the cellular immune response. Enhanced respiratory disease was observed in the 1960s in some recipients of a formalin-inactivated respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine. Enhanced disease was characterized by lung infiltration by mononuclear cells, including eosinophils, along with a Th2-directed T cell response (

Immune complex deposition after the induction of binding, but not neutralizing, antibodies has been proposed as an explanation for this response. While preclinical studies of multiple SARS-CoV vaccine candidates demonstrated significant protection from infection, a similar Th2-driven immunopathogenic response was observed in some instances (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Bolles et al., 2011</xref>). The structure of the immunogen, vaccine formulation including the adjuvant, and age of vaccine recipient may influence the immune response and subsequent outcome of natural infection, although this remains unclear. Based on recent progress in RSV vaccine development, eliciting a neutralizing antibody response focused on the most protective prefusion S epitopes together with a Th1 T cell response may be key features of a safe SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.
