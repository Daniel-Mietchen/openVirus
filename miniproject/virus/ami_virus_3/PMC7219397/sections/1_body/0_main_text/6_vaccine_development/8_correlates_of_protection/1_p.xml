<p id="p0075">While multiple vaccine platforms against SARS-CoV-2 focus on the S protein, questions remain regarding the key elements of a protective immune response. (1) Will neutralizing antibodies correlate with protection? Do protective responses require antibody targeting of specific epitopes? Is there a threshold neutralizing antibody response that protects against SARS-CoV-2? (2) Do some of the assays commonly used 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> to measure neutralization (e.g., pseudotyped viruses) faithfully predict protective activity 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>? (3) What is the role of non-neutralizing anti-S antibodies that bind the surface of infected cells? Could non-neutralizing antibodies promote effector-function-mediated virus clearance via Fc-γ-receptor interactions? (4) What is the contribution of mucosal immunity in the respiratory tract for protection against infection or dissemination? (5) Are humoral responses to other viral open reading frames (ORFs) important for immunity, especially those with immune antagonist activity that are displayed on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly? And (6) how important are CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses to vaccine-mediated protection? While some of this information can be gleaned from pre-clinical and early vaccine trials with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, how certain are we that these correlates of protection will transfer to the pandemic SARS-CoV-2?
