<p id="p0090">Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of infection describes a phenomenon in which poorly neutralizing antibodies bind viruses and increase attachment, internalization, and infection of myeloid cells expressing Fc-γ or complement receptors. ADE of DENV infection contributes to severe clinical disease in a small fraction of individuals infected for a second time by a heterologous serotype of DENV or in newborns that have sub-neutralizing levels of maternal DENV-immune IgG. ADE is an obstacle for DENV-vaccine development, as illustrated by adverse events experienced by DENV-naive children that received the licensed tetravalent vaccine Dengvaxia. Through a possibly similar, yet undefined, mechanism, immunization of cats with a vaccinia virus-vectored feline infectious peritonitis virus S protein vaccine resulted in greater rates of death upon challenge of cats with this animal coronavirus (

 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). Extensive studies with flaviviruses revealed that ADE assays in cell culture do not correlate directly with 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> outcomes, as enhancement can be demonstrated 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> for many viruses for which there is no immune-enhanced disease 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may be explained by the very reductionist format of traditional ADE assays that do not integrate features of the immune response known to contribute to immunity. The inclusion of complement at physiological concentrations, which is omitted from many 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> assays, reduces enhancement in an IgG subclass-dependent manner. ADE has been demonstrated using immunodeficient murine models of DENV infection following passive transfer of immune sera, but disease severity is reduced considerably in the presence of antiviral T cells. Coronavirus antibodies that enhance 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> have not been tested for their ability to exacerbate infection and disease in animals. Is the infection of Fc-γ-receptor-expressing myeloid cells, which might be augmented by antibodies, an important contributor to COVID-19 disease severity? Studies to address these concepts await the development of appropriate disease models. For DENV, the most compelling evidence for a role of ADE in pathogenesis comes from epidemiological studies in humans.
