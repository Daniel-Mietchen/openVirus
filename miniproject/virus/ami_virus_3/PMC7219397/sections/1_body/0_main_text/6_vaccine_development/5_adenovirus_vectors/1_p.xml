<p id="p0060">Adenovirus (Ad) vectors, derived from multiple species, have been employed to deliver vaccine antigens for multiple infectious disease targets. Multiple Ad-vectored SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV vaccines have been characterized in preclinical models. These vaccines elicited both humoral and cellular coronavirus-reactive responses and protected against infection. A simian Ad vector expressing the MERS-CoV S protein is being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial (NCT04170829). A phase 1/2 study to explore the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine using this platform has been initiated by investigators at the University of Oxford (
