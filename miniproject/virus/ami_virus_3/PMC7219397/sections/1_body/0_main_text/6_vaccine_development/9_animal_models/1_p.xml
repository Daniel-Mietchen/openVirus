<p id="p0080">The emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 has provided a very short window to address knowledge gaps about coronavirus immunity. Indeed, a major challenge has been the absence of high-throughput small animal disease models to facilitate vaccine candidate down-selection and the detailed study of protective immunity. Pre-print manuscripts indicate that conventional laboratory strains of mice are not susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection (

Transgenic mice that express human ACE2 (hACE2-Tg) develop pneumonia after infection; however, these mice are not yet widely available for vaccine testing. Beyond this, pathogenesis and immune response evaluation studies in different non-human primate species or other possible animal models (e.g., ferrets and hamsters) still are in early stages of development.
