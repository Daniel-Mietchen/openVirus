<p id="p0055">INO-4800 is a DNA plasmid vaccine candidate encoding the SARS-CoV-2 S protein being developed by Inovio Pharmaceuticals. A similar approach was evaluated in preclinical and clinical trials as a vaccine for MERS-CoV and was shown to be immunogenic (GLS-5300;

Three doses of GLS-5300 elicited S-protein-binding antibodies in a majority (94%) of vaccinated individuals, although neutralizing antibodies were observed less frequently (50% of subjects) and titers waned substantially during the course of study follow-up (

These experiences informed the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate INO-4800, which is now being evaluated in an open-label phase 1 clinical trial. Volunteers will receive two doses of DNA administered intradermally by electroporation 28 days apart.
