<p id="p0015">In 2002, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) virus emerged from bats and possibly civet cats in China. Within eight months, SARS-CoV spread to 27 countries around the world, resulting in 8,096 human infections and 774 deaths (

An unprecedented level of containment, made possible by extensive collaboration among international public health organizations, limited transmission and human disease. Ten years later, a second coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated from an individual suffering from severe respiratory disease and renal failure. As observed with SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV spread via travel and contact with infected individuals, resulting in transmission and mortality within and beyond the Arabian Peninsula (∼2,494 human cases, 858 deaths). Serological studies identified dromedary camels as the principal reservoir for MERS-CoV. Since the discovery of SARS-CoV, two additional human coronaviruses that cause lower respiratory tract infections (HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) have been discovered. Sequencing studies of bat reservoirs identified a large number of novel coronaviruses with an unknown potential to emerge in humans (
