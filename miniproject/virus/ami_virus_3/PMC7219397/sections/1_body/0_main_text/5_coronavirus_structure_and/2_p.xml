<p id="p0035">The S protein exists on virions as homotrimeric spikes that promote coronavirus entry into cells via attachment and membrane fusion (
 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">de Wit et al., 2016</xref>). In some circumstances, the S protein also promotes the formation of syncytia enabling direct cell-to-cell transfer of the viral genome. The S protein is a class I viral fusion protein related functionally to the entry-fusion proteins of other well-characterized viruses including influenza (hemagglutinin [HA], HIV-1 [gp160], and Ebola [glycoprotein, GP]). This class of viral fusion proteins characteristically regulates fusogenic activity by proteolytic cleavage. Accordingly, the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are cleaved sequentially during the entry process to yield S1 and S2 fragments, followed by further processing of S2 to yield a smaller S2′ protein. Cleavage also may occur during viral egress. The S1 fragment includes the receptor binding domain (RBD), whereas the carboxyl terminal S2 portion of the molecule contains regions that drive membrane fusion. The structure of a soluble, stabilized prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein was solved to a resolution of 3.5Å using cryo-electron microscopy, revealing considerable similarity to the SARS-CoV S protein (
