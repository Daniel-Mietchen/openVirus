<p id="p0030">Coronaviruses are round, ∼120-nm-diameter virus particles that derive their name from the incorporation of the viral spike (S) protein in an arrangement that resembles a crown on the virion surface. Three additional viral structural proteins (envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]), together with a lipid membrane and ∼25–31 kilobase viral genome, comprise the virion (

The M and E proteins function during virion morphogenesis, and their expression is sufficient for the formation of virus-like particles, although their value as immunogens may be limited because they lack the S protein thought to be an important target for neutralizing antibodies. Interactions between the M glycoprotein and the other three structural proteins coordinate virion assembly. The small structural E protein has multiple functions including stimulating the membrane curvature required for virion budding and promoting lipid membrane scission of virions once formed. The nucleocapsid protein binds to the viral genome and facilitates its incorporation into the virus particle.
