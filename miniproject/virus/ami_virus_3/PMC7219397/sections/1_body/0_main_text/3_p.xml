<p id="p0020">An appreciation of the considerable threat of coronaviruses to global health prompted remarkable advances in our understanding of the molecular virology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV as well as efforts to develop vaccines. In this Forum, we discuss how the prior study of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV enabled the extraordinarily rapid development of candidate vaccines that hopefully can curtail the incendiary spread of a novel, highly pathogenic zoonotic coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). However, this unprecedented pace has eclipsed some of the fundamental basic and translational studies that customarily guide vaccine development and evaluation under non-pandemic circumstances. Accordingly, we discuss the challenges of rapid vaccine development during a pandemic response.</p>
