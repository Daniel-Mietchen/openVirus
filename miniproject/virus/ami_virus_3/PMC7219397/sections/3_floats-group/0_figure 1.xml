  <p>Structure of the SARS-CoV-2</p>
  <p>(A) The SARS-CoV-2 is a spherical virus particle that incorporates three structural proteins into its lipid envelope (S, M, and E) and encapsidates a positive-stranded RNA genome in complex with the N protein.</p>
  <p>(B) The structure of the S protein trimer was solved using cryo-electron microscopy and is shown (PDB: 
   <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="pdb:6VYB" id="intref0070" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">6VYB</ext-link>) (
   <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Wrapp et al., 2020</xref>). The RBD (shown in green) may existing in an open or closed (up or down) structural state; the RBD of one of the three S protomers within the trimer is shown in the up position.
