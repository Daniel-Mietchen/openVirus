 </xref> They determined the tissue levels of ACE2 where SARS-CoV-2 binds via its glycosylated outer membrane spike proteins. They found that ACE2 is highly expressed in the lung and heart, complementing previous observations that it is increased in myocardial infarction.

 </xref> Although SARS-CoV-2 mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells, it can also cause myocardial injury, as assessed by increased troponin T and NT-proBNP levels in COVID-19-infected patients, as further outlined in this issue.
