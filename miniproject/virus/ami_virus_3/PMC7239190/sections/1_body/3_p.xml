 <bold>SARS-CoV-2: should inhibitors of the renin–angiotensin system be withdrawn in patients with COVID-19?</bold>’, Gabriela Kuster 
 <italic>et al</italic>. from the University Hospital Basel in Switzerland discuss the hypothesis that angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) could foster cell entry of the COVID-19 virus and in turn provide a risk factor for fatal outcomes due to up-regulation of ACE2 that the virus uses to dock on the cell membrane (
