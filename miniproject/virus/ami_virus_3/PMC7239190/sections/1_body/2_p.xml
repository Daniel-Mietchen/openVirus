<p>For cardiologists, the pandemic was indeed a Black Swan as the vast majority had never dealt with viruses or epidemics (with the exception of a few interested in myocarditis).

 </xref> The authors remind us that much has been learnt in the course of preceding epidemics, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and H1N1 influenza, and it is now recognized that their overall health burden may be underestimated, since extrapulmonary manifestations are frequent. Acute and chronic cardiovascular complications of pneumonia are common and result from various mechanisms, including relative ischaemia, systemic inflammation, and pathogen-mediated damage including myocarditis.

 </xref> Thus, the COVID-19 outbreak emphasizes the need for greater awareness of the acute and long-term cardiovascular implications of viral infections and the significant gaps in knowledge that future research will need to address for the benefit of such patients.
