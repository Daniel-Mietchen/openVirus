<p>Pandemics such as COVID-19 massively affect health services in general, as all efforts are focused on the patients affected by it. Furthermore, the outcome of interventions may be affected by COVID-19 for both patients and physicians in charge. The latter issue is addressed in the

 <bold>EAPCI Position Statement in Invasive Management of Acute Coronary Syndromes during the COVID-19 pandemic</bold>’ prepared by Andreas Baumbach from St. Bartholomew’s Hospital in London, UK, and colleagues on behalf of EAPCI.

 </xref> They note that the COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to healthcare worldwide as the number of patients requiring hospital admission and intensive care overwhelms many healthcare systems and negatively affects standard of care, leading to collateral clinical damage. This position statement aims to assist cardiologists in the invasive management of ACS in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Modified diagnostic and treatment algorithms are proposed to adapt evidence-based protocols for this unprecedented challenge. Various clinical scenarios, as well as management algorithms for patients with a diagnosed or suspected COVID-19 infection, presenting with ST-segment and non-ST-segment elevation ACS, are described, as well as scenarios for re-organization of ACS networks, with redistribution of hub and spoke hospitals, in addition to in-hospital reorganization of emergency rooms and cardiac units.
