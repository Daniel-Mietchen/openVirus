 </xref> Even though viral pneumonia is regarded as a pulmonary disease characterized by dyspnoea and hypoxaemia, cardiovascular events outweigh all other causes of death in many viral pandemics. They pursued three aspects: (i) to summarize the knowledge about epidemiological characteristics and clinical manifestations of viral infections in recent pandemics; (ii) to explore the cardiovascular response to these infections; and (iii) to identify coping strategies as experienced in the Wuhan epidemic and future viral infection pandemics.
