<p>The current pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 predominantly affects elderly individuals, especially men and those with CVD who are often receiving ACE-Is. In their manuscript ‘
 <bold>Circulating plasma concentrations of ACE2 in men and women with heart failure and effects of renin–angiotensin–aldosterone-inhibitors: potential implications for coronavirus SARS-CoV-2-infected patients</bold>’ Adriaan Voors and colleagues from the University Medical Center Groningen in the Netherlands expand on this issue with heart failure patients.

 </xref> They measured ACE2 in 1485 men and 537 women with heart failure as the index cohort and validated it in 1123 men and 575 women. The strongest predictor of elevated plasma levels of ACE2 in both the index and validation cohort was male sex. In the index cohort, use of ACE-Is, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists was not an independent predictor of plasma ACE2. In the validation cohort, ACE-Is were independent predictors of lower plasma ACE2, and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists of higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. Thus, surprisingly, in patients with heart failure, plasma concentrations of ACE2 were higher in men than in women, but use of neither an ACE-I nor an ARB was associated with higher plasma ACE2 concentrations. These data might explain the higher incidence and fatality rate of COVID-19 in men, but do not support previous reports suggesting that ACE-Is or ARBs increase the vulnerability for COVID-19 through increased plasma ACE2 concentrations. These provocative findings are further discussed by in an
