<p>The challenges relevant to primary care in the UK, are the shortage of staff despite the variety of providers within the community. Furthermore, demographics vary greatly within the UK and some demographics such as elderly populations; high burden of chronic disease and lower socio-economic status groups may pose a challenging demand for care by the existing primary care services. Over the preceding years, the NHS 111 service has been improved to help non-clinicians direct patients to the appropriate service provider by using protocols and 111 has been a major role player in this current pandemic alongside secondary care and ambulance services in responding to cases requiring treatment. This can be adopted in other countries to help alleviate the demand burden from clinicians by providing a telephone advice and guidance service to the community.</p>
