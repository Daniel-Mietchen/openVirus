<p>Primary care plays a critical role in all historical five phases of DATER by drawing on the variety of its allied health services and professionals within the community to provide support throughout these phases. Specific to the recovery phase, staff working within primary care services are offered support following an epidemic including psychological support. Furthermore, primary care service providers are the frontline staff responsible for giving appropriate advice involving self-quarantine, self-help measures and education on reduction of transmission in the community. The close working relationship of primary and social care is integral to help provide professional advice as well as support to social care services to help mitigate the risks of viral transmission via health promotion and patient education. Therefore, not only is primary care pivotal in detecting and managing cases early, but also extremely vital in prevention and health promotion within the community by supporting mass communication delivered by DHSC, PHE and NHS England.</p>
