<p>The current structure of primary care may play a role in pandemic response. As part of the NHS Long Term Plan 2019, GP practices now sit within Primary Care Networks (PCNs), which serve populations of between 30 000 and 50 000 patients. Within these PCNs, GP practices work more closely alongside other practices as well as allied health professionals/services that include, but are not limited to; clinical pharmacists, paramedics, advanced nurse practitioners, link workers for social prescribing and others. GPs are well embedded within the community and are able to function within a multi-disciplinary team to provide holistic care by looking at the patient as a whole. The working relationship may be useful for swift communication updates at the primary care level between organisations. However, the majority of cases will be managed in secondary care.</p>
