<p>The government response is changing rapidly. At the time of writing this commentary, the public are being asked to stay at home and self-isolate if they have a fever or dry cough and not to attend their GP, pharmacies or hospitals. The recommended duration of self-isolation has changed from 2 weeks to 7 days. Health promotion in the form of hand-washing, social distancing and self-isolation is being advertised in mass communication. Diagnostic testing is arranged by the local Health Protection Team (HPT) in different settings; hospitals, designated hubs or patients’ homes. More specifically in primary care, measures must be put in place to reinforce the government’s approach. Examples include pre-recorded automated messages on telephone systems and screening questions on entry into the practice. Some practices have adopted a closed-door policy. Furthermore, GPs are advised to telephone triage all patients with suspension of face-to-face appointments. If a case is suspected on telephone triage, then the course of action depends on the severity of symptoms. For mild illness, patients are re-directed to contact 111. For severe disease or critically unwell patients, the GP will arrange an ambulance and alert the local HPT. Healthcare professionals in primary care are donning personal protective equipment (PPE) as standard practice. If patients are identified as suspected cases during face-to-face consultations undertaken for any reason, the healthcare professional must leave the room, change their PPE and ask the patient to call 111 with deep cleaning of the room afterwards.
