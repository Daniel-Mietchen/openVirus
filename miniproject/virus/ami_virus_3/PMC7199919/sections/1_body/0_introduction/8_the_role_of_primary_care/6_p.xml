<p>The health and social sector in the UK work closely together. For example, services such as nursing homes are supported by GPs and their staff provide the GP with insight into the social needs of the patient to provide a ‘whole-person, holistic approach’ in managing a patient. In epidemics, this working relationship proves useful as a resource to help detect suspected cases early by having social care sector staff alert the GP for a swift clinical response and assessment to be undertaken with support from the local HPT. This relationship is especially important for early testing and isolation of suspected cases to reduce transmission within multi-morbid and elderly populations that constitute the bulk of social care institutions.</p>
