<p>The delivery of services in an epidemic by primary care professionals is multi-faceted and operates similarly to day-to-day practice but under regular updates on advice and guidance from PHE. GPs triage patient calls to determine whether a face-to-face appointment is appropriate. Telemedicine has a major role to play in this current pandemic as GPs are opting to use video consultations where feasible. If the patient is deemed possibly infected with a virus causing an epidemic, they are advised to remain indoors and are offered disease prevention advice and symptom relief self-help measures. Nurses, healthcare assistants, advanced nurse practitioners, clinical pharmacists and clinical paramedics all work in GP practices and are also frontline in offering this advice. If a patient attends the practice and is deemed to be a suspected case of infection, then they are isolated in a room with their belongings, clinical examinations are not undertaken and the local HPT is called for further advice. In addition to this multi-disciplinary team within a GP practice setting, community pharmacies, dental clinics and optometrists form the remainder of primary care services. They are also resources of advice for the public and follow PHE guidance on epidemics similar to GP practices. Finally, in the context of out-of-hours, patients are able to contact NHS 111 for advice from protocol-guided telephone handlers and GPs.</p>
