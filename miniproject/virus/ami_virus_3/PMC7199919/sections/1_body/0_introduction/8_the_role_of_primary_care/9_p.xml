<p>Emphasis must be made on frontline staff well-being from both a mental and physical health point of view. Testing of suspected staff members must be highlighted and contact tracing deployed if they test positive. Primary care cannot afford to have infected staff members quarantined for up to 2 weeks as this will create a higher workload on other staff members and may possibly reduce primary care’s ability to respond swiftly. Furthermore, and most importantly, pandemic situations can result in frontline staff feeling overwhelmed. Steps must be taken to ensure they are well supported by ensuring that all staff members able to work are deployed, that the appropriate level of PPE is available and that services are available for mental health support. Social media seems to be playing an active role in the UK by providing regular updates on the situation between staff members, especially GPs, along with public health promotion advice and mental well-being advice focussing on meditation and mindfulness practice. Risk stratification for frontline staff members is also required for those at increased risk of having poorer outcomes if infected with COVID-19, such as those above 60 years of age and with co-morbidities. Risk stratification measures can include re-deployment from front line activities and if not feasible, then adopting strict telemedicine-only policies for those at risk.</p>
