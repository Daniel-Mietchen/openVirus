<p>In this commentary, we offer our experiences as primary care professionals in the UK as opportunities to inform others of alternative approaches that may help assuage their current burden during this difficult crisis. In order to provide these proposed solutions and recommendations, we need to discuss the organisation of the NHS and other sectors to set the directorial framework required to mount a structured emergency response. We also deem it necessary to discuss the experiences and challenges faced by the UK in responding to previous epidemics for lessons learnt. The role of primary care in epidemic management is also discussed and, finally, we offer our recommendations to the primary care system in optimising their preparedness for emergency response to the current coronavirus epidemic as well as future epidemics.</p>
