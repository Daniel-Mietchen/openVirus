<p>The response of the health system is also governed by statutory requirements and the bedrock of emergency preparedness, resilience and response. Under the Civil Contingencies Act (CCA) 2004 statutory requirements, Category 1 responders (primary responders) are organisations at the core of the emergency response and these comprise; DHSC, NHS England, PHE, acute service providers, ambulance services and local authorities which includes Directors of Public Health. Category 2 responders (supporting agencies) are expected to work closely with Category 1 organisations to optimise the response and this is the role of the CCGs. Primary care services are not included in the CCA 2004 but are expected to respond with a level that is pertinent to the scale of the event.
