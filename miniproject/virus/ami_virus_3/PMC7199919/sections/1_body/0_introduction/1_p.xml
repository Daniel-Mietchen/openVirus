<p>The emergence of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in China has resulted in catastrophic events that echo worldwide. Primary care physicians are carrying some of the burden of managing the epidemic alongside secondary care, which is struggling to maintain a concerted effort in the face of the mounting pressure of cases. Epidemics affect communities not only biologically but also psychosocially. General practitioners (GPs) in the UK are well positioned to deliver care via a ‘whole-person, holistic approach’ as they are the first point of contact and provide continuity of care within communities. By reviewing historical epidemics in different countries, we may be able to address the current issues in worldwide by providing pragmatic solutions. In the UK, the successful response to the influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemics was a result of effective collaboration between different organisations. Primary care services were considered a key player in delivering care as well as promoting protective behaviours to prevent the spread of infection. Effective communication, trust and the existence of primary care physicians within networks of allied health professionals allows for a variety of delivery mechanisms that offload pressures from GPs and ensure continuity of care. There is a need to evaluate the current epidemic to understand the challenges it poses. Finally, we recommend several solutions, one of which is a thorough assessment of the current community services and their ability to collaborate with GPs to jointly deliver care to their communities.</p>
