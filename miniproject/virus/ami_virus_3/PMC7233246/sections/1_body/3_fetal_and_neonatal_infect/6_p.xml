In these three children the possibility of perinatal or postnatal transmission is unlikely since they were born by cesarean section and were separated from their mother from birth. In the perinatal period, maternal SARS-CoV-2 infection can have harmful consequences on obstetric outcomes and on newborns, resulting in particular in respiratory distress, biological abnormalities, premature deliveries and even fetal death in utero [
