<p id="par0075">Very little data is available yet on neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2, with conflicting results. The studies published to date have very small numbers. While some teams do not find an infected newborn by testing for the virus in samples of placenta, amniotic fluid, cord blood and neonatal throat swabs. Other publications suggest a possible vertical transmission due to the presence of IgM in certain newborns born to mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2.</p>
