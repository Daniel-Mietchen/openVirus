<p id="par0085">Among the 179 newborns, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in nasopharyngeal samples from six of them, one at 16 h of life, two at 36 h of life and three at 48 h of life. Thus, the timing of transmission cannot be determined in these cases. Transmission may have occurred after birth via the inhalation of droplets produced by contaminated parents or professionals, or via breastfeeding. The authors state that the infants were delivered by cesarean section and immediately separated from their mothers and placed in isolation, suggesting that postnatal transmission by the mother was unlikely (
