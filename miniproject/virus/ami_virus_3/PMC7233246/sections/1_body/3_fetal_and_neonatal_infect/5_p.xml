<p id="par0090">Zeng et al. and Dong et al., described three cases of newborns with positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG serologies at birth from mothers infected with SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. While maternal IgG antibodies cross the placenta, IgM are of fetal origin, thus suggesting in utero exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus [
 <xref rid="bib0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. However, whether this is evidence of in utero transmission has been disputed [
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The sensitivity / specificity of IgM detection would be 88.2% / 96.2% and 70.2% / 99% according to these same studies and thus much higher than that observed for other viral infections. Furthermore, none of this children had a positive RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] nor in the blood [
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, the decrease in IgM is very rapid in the Dong L study, going from 45.83 AU / mL to 2 h of life compared to 11.75 AU / mL on the 14th day of life (for a positivity threshold of 10 AU / mL), which seems surprising in the case of a congenital infection.
