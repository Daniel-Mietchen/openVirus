<p id="par0045">The hypothesis of a lack of placental infection is reinforced by the fact that the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2) necessary for its cell integration, is present only at very low levels in the human placenta during the first third trimester of pregnancy [

However, in a hypertensive rat model induced by a saline diet, expression (mRNA) and significant enzymatic activity of the ACE2 receptor was observed in the uterus and the placenta in late gestation (day 19â€“20). Thus, the possibility of placental infection near delivery and therefore a potential passage to the fetus infection required further investigation. [
