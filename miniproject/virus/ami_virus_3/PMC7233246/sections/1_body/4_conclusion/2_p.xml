<p id="par0105">In summary, current data demonstrate very rare maternal-fetal transmission, but are largely incomplete. According to these data, the transmission risk is probably very low, possibly under 1% following maternal SARS-CoV-1 infection during pregnancy. However, taking in account only the severe or critical form of COVID end of pregnancy, it was shown that the virus can be found in the placenta. Thus, as shown by one of us, in a single case of vertical

The available studies concerned patients infected at the end of pregnancy, and in these studies, it should be noted that the time between maternal infection and delivery was often very short (of the order of a few days), which may not be sufficient for transplacental passage to occur.
