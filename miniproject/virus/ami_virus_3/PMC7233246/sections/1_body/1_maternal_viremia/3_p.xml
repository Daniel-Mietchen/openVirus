<p id="par0015">In previous epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome associated with SARS-CoV-1, ± 78% of patients had detectable viral RNA in blood within the week of onset of symptoms. The viremia was determined using a quantitative PCR test specific for the SARS-CoV-1 genome, with a detection limit of 74 copies / ml in plasma. The plasma viral load found in patients with so-called “moderate” symptoms was low with an average concentration of 140 copies / mL, close to the detection threshold [
