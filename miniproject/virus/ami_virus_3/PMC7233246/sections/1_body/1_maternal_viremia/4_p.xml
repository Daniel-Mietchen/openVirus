<p id="par0020">In patients with COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be undetectable by PCR tests on oropharyngeal samples. In two cohort studies of 205 and 40 patients, the presence of plasma viral RNA was detected in only 1% and 15% of patients, respectively [

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Finally, German researchers recently reported the failure to isolate infectious viruses from the blood of infected patients [
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The use of more sensitive SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests such as like a recently described assay that detected positive viremia in 11/80 samples from 15 previously negative (0/80) patients should increase the detection rate of the virus in blood as was observed in nasopharyngeal samples [

 <italic>in vitro</italic> the relationship between infectious virus and number of copies that is now estimated to be 1.8 TCID50 (approximately 4 infectious particles for 11 copies (95% confidence interval: 7.2â€“52.6 copies). A very recent submitted article shown that in a cohort of 50 COVID patient, but 78% male, the detection of viremia, using the WHO RT-qPCR protocol, rise significantly from 60% to 88% according to the severity of the disease [

 <sup>4</sup> copies/mL. These plasma viral load data will be invaluable in assessing the risk of 
 <italic>in utero</italic> virus transmission when the test becomes available and can be applied to pregnant women blood samples.
