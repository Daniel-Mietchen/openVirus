<p id="par0030">Thus, with regards to SARS-CoV-2, the presence of viral RNA in the blood therefore does exist, but at low levels, and its ability to transmit infection is still uncertain. Another study failed to demonstrate viral production following direct infection of blood monocytes with high infectious doses of SARS-CoV-2 virus (MOI 10, i.e. 10 infectious particles / cells) [

 <xref rid="bib0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Conversely, the authors described a gradual decrease in the intracellular amount of RNA over time. These results should however be put into perspective if we consider the experience of Chikungunya for which there is no infection of PBMC

 <xref rid="bib0065" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These data suggest that the frequency and titers of RNAemia in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients may be lower or at most equivalent to that seen in SARS-CoV-1 infected patients. In addition, the virus does not seem capable of developing a productive infection in the circulating monocytes, or at a very low level, in line with previous observations on SARS-CoV-1 [
