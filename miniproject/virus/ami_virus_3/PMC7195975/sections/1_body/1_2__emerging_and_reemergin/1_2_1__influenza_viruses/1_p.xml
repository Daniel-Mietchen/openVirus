<p>The influenza viruses are the world’s most critical epidemic viruses. Influenza pandemics occurred earlier in 1918 (swine flu), 1957 (Asian flu), 1968 (Hong Kong flu), 1977 (Russian flu), and the most recent pandemic in 2009 (pandemic influenza A H1N1) [9]. It belongs to the 
 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family. Influenza is an enveloped virus with negative-stranded RNA consists of 8 segments. There are 4 different types; A, B, C, and D [7, 10]. Influenza A virions possess 2 surface glycoproteins—the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA)-which exert different functions. Eighteen hemagglutinin and 11 neuraminidase subtypes are known to exist in nature [10]. They can infect birds and mammals, including man. Influenza B is restricted to human horde. Influenza C is isolated from humans, pigs and dogs [10]. Influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and human population in all age groups [11]. Seasonal influenza viruses kill 250,000–500,000, mostly older people each year around the world [3].
