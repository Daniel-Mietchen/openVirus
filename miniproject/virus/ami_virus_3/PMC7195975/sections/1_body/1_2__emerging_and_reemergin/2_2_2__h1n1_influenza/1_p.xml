<p>Influenza virus type A is very variable and shows a continuous antigen variation. It is a significant cause of epidemics and pandemics. The surface antigenic glycoproteins are subject to 2 main types of antigenic variation, namely: antigenic shift and antigenic drift. The antigen shift is an abrupt, significant change in an influenza A virus that leads to new HA and/or new HA and NA proteins in influenza viruses that infect man. The interruption can lead to a novel influenza A subtype in humans. These are small changes (or mutations) in the genes of influenza viruses that can guide to alterations in the surface proteins of the virus: HA (hemagglutinin) and NA (neuraminidase). The HA and NA surface proteins of influenza viruses are “antigens”, which implies that they are seen by the immune system and can activate an immune response, including the production of antibodies that can halt the contagion. The changes associated with antigen drift occur continuously over time as the virus replicates. Most flu shots target the HA surface proteins/antigens of an influenza virus.</p>
