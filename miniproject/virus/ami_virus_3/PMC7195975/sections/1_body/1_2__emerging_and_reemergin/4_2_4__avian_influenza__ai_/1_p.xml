<p>Humans are susceptible to avian influenza virus subtypes-A (H5N1), A (H7N9) and A (H9N2). Exposure to infected birds or contaminated environment is thought to underlie human infection with these viruses. There have been sporadic cases of human infections with AI and other zoonotic influenza viruses, but sustained human-to-human infection and transmission have been lacking. Although the public health risk from the currently known influenza viruses at the human-animal interface remains the same, the sustained human-to-human transmission of this virus is low. Avian influenza A viruses (AIVs) are among a terrifying emerging and reemerging pathogen because of their possible risk of causing an influenza pandemic. The growth in domestic animals and poultry worldwide is followed by the ascent of human AIV outbreaks [3].</p>
