<p>Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) has emerged from the infection with 
 <italic>Sin Nombre virus </italic>(SNV). It is a negative-sensed, single-stranded RNA virus. The virus was first identified in the United States in 1995. Since then, 71 people were diagnosed as HPS, and all patients were California residents.
 <italic>Â </italic>Persons were usually exposed to SNV through inhalation of aerosolized excreta (e.g., saliva, urine, and faeces) from infected wild animals (rodents, typically deer mice). HPS has demonstrated a severe disease characterized by pulmonary oedema, followed by respiratory failure than cardiogenic shock [16,17].
