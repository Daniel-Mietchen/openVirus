<p>HMPV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus of the family Pneumoviridae, cause of acute respiratory infection, particularly in children, immunocompromised patients, and the aged. HPMV genome was mostly similar to avian metapneumovirus serotype C. In 2001, researchers in the Netherlands identified HMPV from nasopharyngeal samples from 28 children. The virus is a leading cause of acute respiratory infection, particularly in children, immunocompromised patients, and the elderly. Almost every child is infected with HMPV by the age of 5 [18]. </p>
