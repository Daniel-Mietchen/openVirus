<p>Coronaviruses also have the largest positive-sense RNA genome, which is expressed by a complicated procedure. This genomic type allows the formation of encrypting RNA transcripts in a genome. Somehow, encrypted sequences are progressing during the replication cycle and produce new types of coronavirus. Coronaviruses are classified into 3 groups, grounded on the antigenic properties of virus proteins: the spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins [20].</p>
