<p>The emerging and reemerging respiratory virus infections are a continuing threat to human life [10]. Reassortment, chimerism, antigenic shift, antigenic drift, and other molecular mechanisms cause new epidemic and pandemic of coronaviruses. RNA viruses are much more vulnerable to a chromosome mutation mechanism [7,10] as an outcome of ecological change [10]. Human-animal interface [31], changing environment and tropical deforestation [32], rapidly increasing population, increasing international travel, immigrants and poverty enhance the spread of viral disease around the world [33].</p>
