<p>Currently, COVID-19 caused by a zoonotic virus u2959 (SARS-CoV-2) was first determined in 2019 in u295c, the capital of China’s u295d province. Epidemiologic data show exposures of some initial cases in Huanan seafood and live animal market and early phylogenetic results suggest initial human infection in November 2019 followed by ongoing human-to-human transmission. Animal source has not been identified yet; and COVID-19 has since spread globally, resulting in the current u295e. The majority of cases (approximately 96%) occur with mild respiratory symptoms, some progress to u295f, acute respiratory distress syndrome, respiratory insufficiency and u2960. The overall u2961 is 4.6%; ranging from 0.2% to 15% according to age group and u2962. </p>
