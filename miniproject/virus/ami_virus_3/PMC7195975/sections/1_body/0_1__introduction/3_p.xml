<p>In the last century, influenza originated avian, and swine, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were the most damaging respiratory infections for human being all over the world [5]. These emerging viral respiratory infections derived from the animal world [6]. Mutations in the genetic material of RNA viruses accumulate in years and produce new strains of the viruses with new antigenic properties resulting in a transmission in humans [7]. The probability of pandemics with new viruses would be high in the future as this type of mutations will reoccur. </p>
