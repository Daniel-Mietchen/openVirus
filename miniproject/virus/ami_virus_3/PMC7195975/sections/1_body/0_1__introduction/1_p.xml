<p>Infectious diseases that increase in incidence and tend to spread geographically within decades can be defined as emerging infections. Pathogens of these infections appear for the first time or they have existed previously and spread rapidly among the population and new geographical areas. The emergence of novel human pathogens and reemergence of several diseases is of particular concerns of the current century [1]. There is a dominance of zoonotic infections, mostly originating in wildlife, among emerging health threats with a rate of 70%. Pathogens first emerge in themselves and rapidly mutate, which result in a transmission in humans with subsequent dissemination. According to the extent of the transmission, epidemic outbreaks may occur and progress to a pandemic. Diseases that reappear after a significant decline are called as reemerging diseases. Reemergence may occur due to a breakdown in public health measures or the appearance of new strains of organisms [2]. Respiratory infections with epidemic and pandemic potential that cause a global burden have plagued people since the beginning of human history. In this review, the epidemic and pandemic, emerging and reemerging respiratory viruses are summarized in Table. </p>
