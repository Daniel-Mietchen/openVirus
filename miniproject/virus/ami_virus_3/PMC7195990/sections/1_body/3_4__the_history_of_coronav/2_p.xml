<p>In the Guangdong province of China during the winter of 2002 to 2003, an unusual and often deadly form of pneumonia appeared, a disease subsequently labelled severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [28]. This disease spread to Hong Kong in late February, and, within days, international air travel spread the virus over a wide area, seeding outbreaks in Vietnam, Singapore, Canada, and elsewhere. In July 2003, at the end of this outbreak, 8422 cases had been recorded, 916 (10.8 %) of them fatal, in 29 country across 6 continents [28]. The point of initial emergence of SARS-CoV an animal reservoir were the live animal markets in Guangdong, where diverse animal species are held, traded and sold to restaurants in response to the demand for exotic food [28]. Small mammals, such as civet cats, sold in these markets were found to harbour viruses closely related to SARS-CoV, and the initial interspecies transmission to humans probably came from these markets [29,30]. MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia. Live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swabs of dromedary camels, further indicating that camels serve as the bona fide reservoir host of MERS-CoV. As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory confirmed cases were reported with a high case fatality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to humans [28].</p>
