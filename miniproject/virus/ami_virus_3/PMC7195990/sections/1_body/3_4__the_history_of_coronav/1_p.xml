<p>IBV was the first coronavirus to be reported, a virus from chickens with respiratory disease reported by Beaudette &amp; Hudson in 1937 [20]. The murine and hepatitis viruses (MHV), another group of animalâ€™s viruses, were first identified by Cheever at al. in 1949 [1]. In 1946, transmissible gastroenteritis in swine was first recognized. However, it was not until after the human coronaviruses (HCoVs) were discovered in the 1960s and the coronavirus genus was defined that these 3 animal diseases were found to be related [1]. An organ culture of human embryonic trachea taken from a schoolboy with a cold was described by Tyrrell &amp; Bynoe as the first human coronavirus (B814) in 1965 [25]. When examined by an electron microscope, the virus was found to resemble avian IBV. Hamre &amp; Procknow recovered 5 virus strains in tissue culture taken from medical students with colds around the same time [26]. Almeida &amp; Tyrrell examined the prototype strain HCoV 229E, and its morphology was found to be identical to that of B814 and IBV [27]. Using the organ culture technique, 6 further strains were subsequently recovered including the prototype strains HCoV OC43 as well as 3 strains considered antigenically unrelated to either OC43 or 229E [1]. </p>
