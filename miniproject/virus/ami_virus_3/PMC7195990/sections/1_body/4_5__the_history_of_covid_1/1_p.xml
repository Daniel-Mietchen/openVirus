<p>A 41-year-old man was admitted to the Central HospitalÂ of Wuhan on 26 December 2019, 6 days after the onset of disease. He had no history of hepatitis, tuberculosis, or diabetes and reported fever, chest tightness, an unproductive cough, pain, and weakness for 1 week on presentation. The Wuhan Centre for Disease Control and Prevention conducted an epidemiological investigation and found that the patient worked at a local indoor seafood market where, in addition to fish and shellfish, a variety of live wild animals (including hedgehogs, badgers, snakes, and birds) were available for sale as well as animal carcasses. However, no bats were available for sale, and the patient recalled no exposure to live poultry although he might have come into contact with wild animals [31]. </p>
