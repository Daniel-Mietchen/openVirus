<p>Before December 2019, 6 strains of coronavirus (CoVs) were known to infect humans and cause respiratory diseases. HCoV‐229E, HCoV‐OC43, HCoV‐NL63, and HKU1 are coronaviruses (CoVs) that normally cause only mild upper respiratory disease with rare severe infections occurring in infants, young children, and elderly people [1]. More dangerous ones are SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, which can infect lower respiratory tract and trigger a severe respiratory condition in humans [2]. It is widely known that some CoVs affect birds, bats, mice, giraffe, whales, and many other wild animals, but they can also infect livestock, causing great economic loss [3,4]. Domestic animals can also play a role as intermediate hosts that enable virus transmission from the natural, wild animal hosts to humans [5,6]. In addition, domestic animals themselves can also contract bat-borne or closely related coronavirus diseases [4]. Genomic sequences that are very similar to porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) have been detected in bats. In 2016, a large‐scale outbreak of a disease in pigs in southern China that killed 24,000 piglets were caused by an HKU2‐related Bat-CoV, swine acute diarrhoea syndrome CoV [7,8]. This incident was the first documented case where a Bat-CoV caused a severe disease in livestock [8].</p>
