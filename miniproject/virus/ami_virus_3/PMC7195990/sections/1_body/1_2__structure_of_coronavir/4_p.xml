<p>In virus assembly, the M protein of coronavirus plays a central role as it turns cellular membranes into factories where virus and host factors join to make new virus particles. The M proteins from SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV, MHV, FCoV, IBV, TGEV, and BCoV are targeted to the vicinity of the Golgi apparatus. Reverse genetic studies and virus-like protein (VLP) assembly studies suggest that the M protein encourages assembly by interacting with the viral ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and S glycoproteins at the budding site and by creating a network of M-M interactions capable of excluding some host membrane proteins from the viral envelope [17].</p>
