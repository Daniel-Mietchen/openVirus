<p>The family 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> is a monophyletic cluster in the order 
 <italic>Nidovirales</italic> members of which are enveloped with a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome and measures, on average, 30 kilobases [9]. 
 <italic>Orthocoronavirinae</italic> subfamily contains 4 genera (Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus), and SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 belong to genus betacoronavirus [10,11,12]. The coronavirus (CoV) has a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity, and its virion contains 4 major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the transmembrane (M) protein, the envelope (E) protein, and the spike (S) protein (Figure 1). However, with some coronaviruses, the full ensemble of structural proteins is not necessary for the forming of a complete, infectious virion; additional proteins may be encoded with overlapping compensatory functions [10,11,12].
