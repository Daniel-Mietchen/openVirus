<p>The N protein is the only protein that forms the nucleocapsid and primarily functions to bind to the coronavirus RNA genome. While the N protein is involved in viral genome related processes, it plays a role in the replication of viral RNA and the hostâ€™s cellular response to viral infection. The endoplasmic reticulum localization of N protein carries a function for this in assembly and budding. Furthermore, in some coronaviruses, the N protein expression has been shown to significantly increase the production of virus-like particles [13].</p>
