<p>The smallest but also the most mysterious of the major structural proteins is the E protein. While the E protein is plentifully expressed inside the infected cell during the replication cycle, only a small portion is incorporated into the virion envelope [11]. Most of the protein is localized at the ER, Golgi, and ER-Golgi intermediate compartment, the site of intracellular trafficking, where it takes part in CoV assembly and budding. According to published studies, 3 roles have been proposed for the CoV E protein: a) the interaction between the cytoplasmic tails of the M and E proteins which suggests that E participates in viral assembly; b) its hydrophobic transmembrane domain is essential for the release of virions; and c) it is implicated in the virusâ€™s pathogenesis [11,18].</p>
