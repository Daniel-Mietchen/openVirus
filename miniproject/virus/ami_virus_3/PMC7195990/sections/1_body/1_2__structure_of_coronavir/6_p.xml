<p>Interactions between the S protein and its receptor initiate the initial attachment of the virion to the host cell. The receptor binding domains (RBD) sites within the S1 region of a coronavirus S protein vary depending on the virus; some have the RBD at the N-terminus of S1 (MHV), and others (SARS- CoV and SARS- CoV-2) have the RBD at the C-terminus of S1 [16]. To gain entry into human cells, many Î± coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, TGEV, PEDV, FIPV, CCoV) employ aminopeptidase N (APN) as their receptor, HCoV-NL63, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 utilize angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as their receptor, MHV enters through CEACAM1, and MERS-CoV binds to dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 (DPP4) [18]. After the receptor binding, the virus must next gain access to the host cell cytosol. This is usually accomplished by acid-dependent proteolytic cleavage of the S protein by a cathepsin, TMPRRS2, or another protease, followed by fusion of the viral and cellular membranes (16).</p>
