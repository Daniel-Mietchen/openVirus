<p>Changes in the S glycoprotein are largely responsible for the host variety of coronaviruses and the variety in tissue tropism. The S glycoprotein is a type 1 membrane glycoprotein with different functional domains near the amino (S1) and carboxy (S2) termini. While the S2 subunit is a transmembrane protein mediating the fusion of viral and cellular membranes, the S1 subunit is peripheral and is associated with receptor binding functions [13,14]. Generally speaking, the S glycoprotein facilitates viral binding to susceptible cells, causes cell fusion, and induces neutralizing antibodies. Of the 2 functional subunits containing several antigenic sites, S1 and S2, the S1 monoclonal antibody appears to occur most efficiently because it has a higher level of neutralizing activity [14,15,16].</p>
