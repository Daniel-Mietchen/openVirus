<p>Infectious disease experts and multiple international and domestic human and animal health organizations (CDC, OIE, and WHO) agree that there is no evidence at this point indicating that pets can spread COVID-19 to other animals, including people. Although there has not been reports of pets becoming sick with COVID-19, out of an abundance of caution,Â it is recommended that those of ill with COVID-19 should limit contact with animals until more information is known about the virus. On the other hand, Shi et al. [2020] report that cats and ferrets can be experimentally infected with SARS-CoV-2, but not dogs, pig, chickens, and ducks. In this study, which is the only one in this subject, they claim that cats can spread SARS-CoV-2 by respiratory and other cats can be infected [57].</p>
