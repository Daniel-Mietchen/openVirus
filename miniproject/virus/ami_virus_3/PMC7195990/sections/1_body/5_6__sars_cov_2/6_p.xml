<p>When the SARS-CoV-2 virus was compared with S gene of SARS-CoV, bat-CoV (As6526), bat-CoV (RaTG13), mink-CoV, and pangolin-CoV, it was found 71.41%, 68.17%, 92,86%, 30,89%, and 90% similarity, respectively [50]. When the homology of SARS-CoV-2 and these coronaviruses is less than 75%, it would be presumed that SARS-CoV-2 is not the same virus like the coronaviruses arising from these wild animals [50]. It is also clear from these results that the 2 viruses, SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus RaTG13, are closely related [50]. It was also reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus did not come directly from pangolins (24), so the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin coronavirus and whether the pangolin is the intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 requires further investigation [51,52].</p>
