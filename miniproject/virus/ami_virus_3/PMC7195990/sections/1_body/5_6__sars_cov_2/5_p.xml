<p>While it is believed that bats and palm civets were the natural and intermediate reservoirs for SARS-CoV, respectively, it has been isolated from animals and adapted to lab cell culture [46,47]. It is also believed that SARS-CoV was transmitted from palm civets to humans in an animal market in southern China, and while the animal source of the outbreak is currently unknown, SARS-CoV-2 also reportedly infected humans in an animal market in Wuhan. Critically, the capacity for SARS-CoV-2 to transmit from human to human has been confirmed [48]. An envelope-anchored spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells by first binding to a host receptor and then fusing viral and host membranes [49].</p>
