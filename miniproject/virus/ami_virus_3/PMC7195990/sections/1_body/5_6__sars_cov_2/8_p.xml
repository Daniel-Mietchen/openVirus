<p>The pathophysiology and virulence mechanisms of CoVs– and thus of SARS-CoV-2–have links to the function of the nonstructural protein (nsps) and structural proteins. For instance, a nsp can block the host innate immune response of the host, according to the research. It is known that the envelope, among the functions of structural proteins, plays a crucial role in virus pathogenicity because it promotes viral assembly and release, but many features (e.g., those of nsp 2 and 11) have not been described yet [56].</p>
