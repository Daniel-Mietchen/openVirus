<p>Spike protein contains 2 subunits, S1 and S2 [53]. S1 contains a receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for recognizing and binding with the cell surface receptor. S2 subunit is the “stem” of the structure, which contains other basic elements needed for the membrane fusion [53]. The spike protein is the common target for neutralizing antibodies and vaccines. It has been reported that COVID-19 can infect the human respiratory epithelial cells through interaction with the human ACE2 receptor (Figure 3). Indeed, the recombinant Spike protein can bind with recombinant ACE2 protein [54,55]. The ACE2 protein is reportedly present in type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes, enterocytes of all parts of the small intestine, the brush border of the proximal arteries, and veins of all tissues studied, and arterial smooth muscle cells [54]. This localization of ACE2 explains the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV for the lung, small intestine, and kidney. However, notable discrepancies include virus replication in colonic epithelium, which has no ACE2, and no virus infection in endothelial cells, which have ACE2, other receptors, or co-receptors such as LSIG that explain such discrepancies [54].</p>
