<p>In an early study, phylogenetic tree showed that 2019‐nCoV (previous naming of SARS-CoV-2) significantly clustered with bat SARS-like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. Thus, it is clear that the new 2019‐nCoV is distinct from the SARS virus which, after a mutation that gave it the ability to infect humans, was probably transmitted from bats [38]. Based on the phylogenetic tree, taxonomy, and established practice, this virus was officially identified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group, and the current outbreak of a coronavirus-associated acute respiratory disease was called Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) [39].</p>
