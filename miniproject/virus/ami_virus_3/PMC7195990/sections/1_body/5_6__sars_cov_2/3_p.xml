<p>SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 have similar stability. Both viruses could be detected in aerosols up to 3 h post-aerosolization, up to 4 h on copper, up to 24 h on cardboard and up to 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel. In aerosols, SARS-CoV-2, and SARS-CoV-1 exhibited similar half-lives with median estimates of around 2.7 h [43]. With the median half-life estimate for SARS-CoV-2 being around 13 h on stainless steel and around 16 h on polypropylene, both viruses exhibit relatively long viability on these surfaces compared to copper or cardboard [44].</p>
