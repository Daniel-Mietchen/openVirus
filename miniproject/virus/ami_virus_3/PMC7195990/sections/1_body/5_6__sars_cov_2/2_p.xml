<p>Human epidemics with variable clinical severity featuring respiratory and extra-respiratory manifestations have been caused by a number of CoVs: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV (betaCoVs of the B and C lineage, respectively) [40]. With SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mortality rates have been seen up to 10% and 35%, respectively which places SARS-CoV-2 in the betaCoVs category [41]. This variety has a round or elliptic, and often pleomorphic form and a diameter of approximately 60â€“140 nm. Like other CoVs, it is sensitive to ultraviolet rays and heat [42]. Another effective means of inactivation is by lipid solvents including ether (75%), ethanol, chlorine-containing disinfectant, peroxyacetic acid, and chloroform except for chlorhexidine [43,44].</p>
