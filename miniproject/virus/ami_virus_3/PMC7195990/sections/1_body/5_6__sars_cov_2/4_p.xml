<p>Chan et al. [45] have shown that, in genetic terms, the genome of the new HCoV, isolated from a cluster-patient who presented with atypical pneumonia after visiting Wuhan, had a 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV [45]. For this reason, the new virus was called SARS-CoV-2, its single-stranded RNA genome containing 29,903 nucleotides encoding for 9860 amino acids (Figure 2) [9]. While its origins are not completely understood, these genomic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 probably evolved from a strain found in bats. However, the possible intermediate between bats and humans, the potential amplifying mammalian is not known. It is not even certain that this intermediary exists since the virulence toward humans could have been directly triggered by the mutation in the original strain [46]. </p>
