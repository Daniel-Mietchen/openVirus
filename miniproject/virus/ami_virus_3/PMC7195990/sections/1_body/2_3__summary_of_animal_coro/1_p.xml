<p>A wide range of animal diseases are caused by coronaviruses, and significant research on these viruses in the second half of the 20th century was triggered by their ability to cause severe disease in livestock and companion animals such as pigs, cows, chickens, dogs, and cats [19,20,21]. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and PEDV, for example, cause severe gastroenteritis in young piglets that lead to significant morbidity and mortality and results in economic losses [22]. The feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) results in the development of a lethal disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) [23]. FIP has wet and dry forms and is similar to the human disease sarcoidosis. FIPV is macrophage tropic and may cause aberrant cytokine and/or chemokine expression and lymphocyte depletion, which results in a lethal disease [23]. The cattle industry has experienced significant losses from bovine coronaviruses (BCoV) that caused significant losses in the cattle industry, and its infection spread a variety of ruminants including elk, giraffe, deer, and camels [3,15,24]. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) affects the urogenital tract of chickens, causing renal disease. Egg production is significantly reduced by the infection of the reproductive tract with IBV, causing substantial industrial losses every year [20]. The most intensely studied animal coronavirus is murine hepatitis virus (MHV) which causes a variety of conditions in mice, including respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurologic infections. Thus, MHV is an excellent model for studying the basics of viral replication in tissue culture cells as well as for studying the pathogenesis and immune response to coronaviruses [22].</p>
