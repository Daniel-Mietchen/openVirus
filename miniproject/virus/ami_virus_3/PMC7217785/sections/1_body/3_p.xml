<p id="para0004">A number of COVID-19 patients with no previous psychiatric hx, who presented with psychotic symptoms were identified by the liaison and ED psychiatry departments at our hospital.Â  Some of them presented with comorbid acute delirium. Psychotic symptoms were characterised by thoughts of reference and structured delusional beliefs as in primary psychosis conditions, such as schizophrenia. To note that those patients with comorbid acute delirium, presented ongoing psychotic symptoms once delirium was resolved.</p>
