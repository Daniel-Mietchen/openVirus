<p>Since its identification in Kenya in 1921 (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), African swine fever virus (ASFV) has remained endemic in Africa, affecting up to 35 African countries (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Between the late 1950s and early 1980s, ASFV genotype I emerged in Europe, Russia, the Caribbean and South America. ASFV was first identified in Europe in 1957 in Portugal, then was re-introduced in 1960 from which it quickly spread into Spain, Italy, France, Sardinia, Malta, Belgium, and The Netherlands (
