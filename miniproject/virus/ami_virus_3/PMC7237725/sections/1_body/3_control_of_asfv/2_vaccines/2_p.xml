<p>Basic research to elucidate ASFV gene functions and the mechanisms of ASFV replication, pathogenesis and immune responses is critically needed to facilitate rational vaccine development (

 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B159" ref-type="bibr">159</xref>). This research will be important for identifying protective proteins as vaccine targets and feasible delivery systems that induce both humoral and cellular immune responses which correlate with protection. Other important elements needed for successful ASFV vaccine development are a permanent cell culture system for MLV vaccine production as well as the design of companion diagnostic assays that are capable of differentiating infected from vaccinated animals (DIVA) (
