<p>Methods for detection of virus and viral antigens include virus isolation and hemadsorption (HAD), fluorescent antibody testing, and antigen detection by ELISA or lateral flow tests (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>). A positive virus isolation or HAD test is considered definitive for ASFV; however, both assays are expensive, require primary cell cultures, and take &gt;7 days to complete, and are therefore only performed by a few reference laboratories (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B165" ref-type="bibr">165</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>). Furthermore, not all ASFV isolates are hemadsorbing and some would therefore test negative in the HAD test. Direct fluorescence antibody testing and a commercial antigen-based ELISA and lateral flow tests are available, but their utility is hampered by lower sensitivity and specificity (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). Because of these limitations, PCR is often the best methodology for detecting virus in clinical samples.
