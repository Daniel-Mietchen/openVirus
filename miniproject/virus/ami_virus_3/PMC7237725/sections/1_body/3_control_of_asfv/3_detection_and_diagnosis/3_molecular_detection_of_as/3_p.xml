<p>Progress toward field-deployable molecular diagnostics for ASFV has involved research into novel DNA amplification and detection strategies, as well as the usage of portable equipment which can be run independent of electricity (e.g., GeneReach Pockit
 <sup>TM</sup> or Biomeme Franklin
 <sup>TM</sup>), and lyophilized reagents which are stable at room temperature for several years (

In addition, portable next generation sequencing (NGS) devices (e.g., Nanopore MinION) can be efficiently utilized to rapidly determine the genotype of PCR positive ASFV isolates and even sequence a significant part or the entire genome for downstream phylogenetic analyses.
