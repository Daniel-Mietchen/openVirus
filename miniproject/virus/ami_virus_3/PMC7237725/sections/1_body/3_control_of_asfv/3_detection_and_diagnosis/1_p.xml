<p>Since its discovery over 90 years ago, an array of diagnostic assays have been developed and employed for ASF. However, current methods for ASFV diagnosis often possess significant limitations such as (i) suboptimal analytical and clinical sensitivity/specificity, (ii) inadequate ability to detect early acute or chronically-infected animals, (iii) high cost, (iv) long time intervals for receiving results, and/or (v) the need for specialized equipment and high containment facilities (
