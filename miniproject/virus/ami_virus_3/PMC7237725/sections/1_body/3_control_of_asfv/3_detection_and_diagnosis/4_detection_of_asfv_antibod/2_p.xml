<p>ELISA is the most commonly used method for high throughput ASF serological testing, with multiple commercial and in-house formats validated as fit-for-purpose by the OIE (
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>). Soluble antigens from the cytoplasmic fraction of ASFV-infected Vero cells are more sensitive than semi-purified viral p72 at detecting early antibody responses and can be used in an indirect ELISA format that is well-established but requires BSL-3 biocontainment facilities capable of handling live ASFV (
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B188" ref-type="bibr">188</xref>). Utilization of recombinant ASFV proteins as ELISA antigens circumvents the need for virus propagation in BSL-3 containment and can provide comparable or even improved sensitivity and specificity, as well as better consistency, compared to the indirect ELISA using native ASFV antigens, especially with poorly preserved sera (
 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B191" ref-type="bibr">191</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B192" ref-type="bibr">192</xref>). Variable sensitivity using sera from different geographic areas of East and West Africa have been demonstrated for recombinant ASFV protein ELISAs, depending on the ASFV protein used as target antigen (
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>). ELISAs have also been adapted to screen other clinical samples besides serum such as oral fluids or meat juice, which are easier or less invasive to collect than serum. A modified version of the OIE recommended indirect ELISA was able to detect ASFV-specific antibodies in oral fluids from pigs experimentally inoculated with the attenuated genotype I strain and challenged with virulent genotype II ASFV, albeit with reduced sensitivity relative to serum; this is likely due to the comparatively lower level of ASFV-specific antibodies in oral fluids (
 <xref rid="B193" ref-type="bibr">193</xref>). Indirect ELISAs using semi-purified p72 derived from genotype I ASFV isolate BA71V grown in Vero cell culture or using recombinant ASFV p30 have also shown positive reactivity with ASFV-specific antibodies present in feces from pigs infected with the attenuated Ken05/Tk1 isolate (
 <xref rid="B194" ref-type="bibr">194</xref>). Further evaluation of fecal, meat juice and oral fluid specimens collected from experimentally and field-infected pigs are needed to assess their viability and reliability as diagnostic samples for serological testing.
