<p>Duet to the lack of an available vaccine, ASFV-specific antibodies are always the result of current or prior ASFV infection (or are maternally-derived). ASFV-specific antibodies in convalescent animals can persist for months or years (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>). Several immunogenic proteins of ASFV have been previously identified, including both structural and non-structural proteins (

 <xref rid="B180" ref-type="bibr">180</xref>–
 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>). A variety of serological tests for the detection of ASFV-specific antibodies have been developed using multiple formats including ELISAs, immunoblots, indirect fluorescent antibody tests (IFATs), indirect immunoperoxidase tests (IPTs), and lateral flow tests (LFTs); several of these tests are recommended by the OIE for disease surveillance and for determining freedom from ASFV infection prior to animal movement (

 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>,

 <xref rid="B184" ref-type="bibr">184</xref>–
 <xref rid="B190" ref-type="bibr">190</xref>). The above-mentioned serological assays are limited by a low sensitivity in detecting ASFV-infected animals with early-stage infections (&lt;7 days post-infection) or swine which are infected with highly virulent strains that produce peracute ASF disease and death before the induction of ASFV-specific antibodies can occur (
