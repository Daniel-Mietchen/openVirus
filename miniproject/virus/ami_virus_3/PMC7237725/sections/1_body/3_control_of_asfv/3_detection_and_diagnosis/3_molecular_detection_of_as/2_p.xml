<p>Traditional real-time qPCR testing typically needs high-throughput thermocyclers and associated laboratory equipment such as automated RNA/DNA extraction instruments which are costly, difficult to transport, and require reliable access to electricity, as well as the use of reagents that must be kept cold (

 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>). Consequently, these assays are generally restricted to laboratory settings. Several challenges are associated with performing PCR in the field beyond the need for a portable, battery-operated thermocycler, which include performing nucleic acid extractions without a centrifuge/electricity, protecting samples against cross-contamination, and maintaining a cold chain for materials that may require refrigeration. Additionally, available portable thermocyclers for qPCR assays are low-throughput because they can only run a limited number of samples at one time. Selection of the proper thermostable PCR reagents and diluents can overcome some of the above mentioned issues (
