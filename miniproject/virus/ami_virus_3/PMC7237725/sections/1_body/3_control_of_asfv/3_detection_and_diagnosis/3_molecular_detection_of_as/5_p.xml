<p>Isothermal amplification strategies are performed at a single temperature, thereby avoiding the need for thermal cycling of traditional laboratory thermocycler. Early research into a linear isothermal amplification assay for ASF by combining an oligonucleotide with an overlapping probe and the cleavase enzyme (InvaderÂ®) showed high specificity but poor sensitivity relative to other molecular diagnostic techniques (

A study of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) targeting the viral topoisomerase II gene (P1192R) showed good sensitivity near that of the OIE TaqMan real-time PCR assay and demonstrated the potential feasibility of a lateral flow device for detecting LAMP amplicons (

Subsequent comparison of LAMP and TaqMan-based qPCR showed comparable sensitivity, depending on the cutoff value set for a positive LAMP reaction; the variability in reaction time to positivity for different samples on LAMP assays and its poor correlation with ASFV DNA levels as determined by qPCR Ct highlights the difficulty in establishing robust diagnostic parameters for LAMP assays (

Two studies using the recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) technique targeting the ASFV p72 gene have shown high sensitivity in this very rapid assay format that produces results in under 10 min; importantly, robust sensitivity could be maintained when the ASFV RPA assay was combined with a convenient lateral flow dipstick to detect ASFV amplicons (
