<p>Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) testing is the recommended method for screening and confirmatory testing during active infection, due to high sensitivity, specificity, and sample throughput (
 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B164" ref-type="bibr">164</xref>). Both, conventional and qPCR formats targeting conserved regions of the viral p72 gene and capable of detecting multiple genotypes have been developed and validated, though real-time qPCR assays are considered preferable (

 <xref rid="B168" ref-type="bibr">168</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>). The two OIE-recommended qPCR assays use TaqMan or Universal Probe Library (UPL) probes, the latter of which provides greater sensitivity for animals with low level viremia (

 <xref rid="B169" ref-type="bibr">169</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B171" ref-type="bibr">171</xref>). The two qPCR assays recommended by the OIE possess significantly greater sensitivity than commercially-available antigen detection ELISAs, for both experimental and field isolates, and can be useful for detecting ASFV in poorly preserved or degraded samples where virus isolation and direct antigen detection may not be viable (

 <xref rid="B166" ref-type="bibr">166</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B167" ref-type="bibr">167</xref>). In addition to its use as a diagnostic method in swine, conventional and qPCR formats can be used to detect ASFV in
