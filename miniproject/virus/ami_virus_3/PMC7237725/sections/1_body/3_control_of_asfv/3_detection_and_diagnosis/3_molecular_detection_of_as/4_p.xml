<p>The use of a commercial battery-powered portable thermocycler (T-COR 4
 <sup>TM</sup>) for the detection of ASFV via a real-time PCR assay has previously been evaluated (
 <xref rid="B174" ref-type="bibr">174</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>). In one study, reduced sensitivity of the portable thermocycler for clinical samples with very high Ct values on the gold standard qPCR was observed on a RT-PCR/PCR duplex assay for Classical and African swine fever viruses (
 <xref rid="B175" ref-type="bibr">175</xref>). In our hands, portable thermocyclers (e.g., GeneReach Pockit
 <sup>TM</sup> or Biomeme Franklin
 <sup>TM</sup>) show comparable clinical and analytical sensitivity and specificity using ASF positive and negative experimental and field samples when compared to a laboratory thermocycler (Bio-Rad CFX 96). Rapid detection of ASFV is key to activate respective control measures. To address this need and provide near immediate detection of ASFV infected swine at the farm, fair, the sale barn, or the slaughter house, our group has developed a point of need (PON) molecular detection method using the USDA-approved qPCR ASFV assay for the detection of the ASFV p72 gene (
 <xref rid="B170" ref-type="bibr">170</xref>). The POCKIT
 <sup>TM</sup> Nucleic Acid Analyzer (GeneReach USA) is a portable PCR device, which uses insulated isothermal polymerase chain reaction (iiPCR) technology and reports out plus/minus detection of the gene target for up to 8 samples within 1 h. DNA preparation is performed on the portable Taco
 <sup>TM</sup>Mini (GeneReach, USA) automatic nucleic acid extraction system using the GeneReach total NA extraction kit using a magnetic bead extraction protocol (
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>). EDTA whole blood was collected from swine experimentally infected with genotype II ASFV at various time points post-infection and the ASFV p72-specific qPCR was run side-by-side on the laboratory thermocycler BioRad CFX 96 and on the POCKIT
 <sup>TM</sup> portable iiPCR device. The results from this side-by-side analysis demonstrated similar sensitivity and specificity of the laboratory and portable PCR devices for the detection of ASFV p72 in blood samples.
