<p>Successful prevention and mitigation of ASF outbreaks is hindered by multiple factors, including the lack of an effective vaccine, the broad geographic distribution of wild and feral swine and potential arthropod vectors capable of maintaining the virus, as well as the increasingly globalized nature of animal agriculture. As a result, ASF control strategies primarily focus on early detection, restriction on livestock movement, and culling of herds affected by or potentially exposed to the virus. The development of effective countermeasures for ASF will be essential in combatting current and future epidemics, and the associated trade restrictions.</p>
