<p>In Africa, ASFV is mainly maintained in a sylvatic cycle between 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> soft ticks and warthogs (
 <italic>Phacochoerus africanus</italic>); warthogs become viremic but do not develop clinical disease after ASFV infection (

 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). The sylvatic cycle has been documented primarily for countries in southern and eastern Africa (

 <italic>Potamochoerus larvatus</italic>) can also become infected and transmit ASFV, but are generally considered to play a minor role compared to warthogs in the sylvatic cycle since their behaviors are less conducive for interactions with soft ticks; only one incidence of infection in a giant forest hog (
