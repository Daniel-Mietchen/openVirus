<p>Domestic pigs readily transmit ASFV to other susceptible swine, and outbreaks of virulent strains display high levels of morbidity and mortality (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Direct contact with infected pigs effectively spreads disease to other wild and domestic pigs (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>); however, varying levels of transmission efficiency have been observed for high-, moderate-, and low-virulence strains, likely due to differences in levels of viremia and virus shedding (

 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>â€“
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). Blood, body fluids, feces, and carcasses of infected pigs serve as indirect routes of infection (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Animals which recover from infection with low or moderate virulent strains can become subclinical carriers potentially capable of spreading the virus to other pigs (

 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>). The illegal movement of infected pigs by producers or pork products has played a significant role in outbreaks of ASF in Africa, Europe, and Asia (
