<p>Eurasian wild boar are highly susceptible to the virulent ASFV genotype II isolates circulating in Europe (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), and contact between infected wild boar and domestic pigs has been a significant contributing factor to the spread of ASFV in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and the Russian Federation, where small-scale backyard pig farms with poor biosecurity are common (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). ASFV has been detected in wild boar throughout Eastern and Central Europe, and as far west as Belgium (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The existence of a geographically widespread wild pig population in which ASFV can circulate poses a significant challenge to disease control and eradication efforts.
