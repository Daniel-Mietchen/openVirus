<p>Infection with ASFV can produce a variety of clinical presentations ranging from chronic, subclinical, or low-level disease to hemorrhagic fever and peracute death, depending on viral strain, and host susceptibility (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>). Studies of highly virulent Eurasian genotype II isolates have produced mortality rates of 100% in domestic pigs and wild boar, with disease rapidly progressing from non-specific clinical symptoms (fever, depression, anorexia, diarrhea) to death (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In contrast, the non-fatal genotype I isolates OUR T88/3 and OUR T88/4 obtained from 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> ticks on a farm in Portugal produce no clinical disease after experimental infection of pigs (

 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). However, attenuated ASFV strains including OUR T88/3 and NH/P68 can cause chronic infection in some pigs and have been associated with chronic lesions affecting the skin and joints (

 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>). Swine populations displaying increased resistance to clinical ASF have been previously described; however, offspring from these pigs reared in quarantine facilities showed no difference in survival rates compared to non-selected, susceptible animals after virulent ASFV challenge, suggesting resistance is not directly heritable (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>). Clinical outcomes of ASFV infection are therefore influenced by a variety of host, virus, and epidemiological factors.
