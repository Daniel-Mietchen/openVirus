<p>The 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> genus of soft ticks in the family 
 <italic>Argasidae</italic> serve as biological vectors and reservoir hosts for ASFV. To date, eight 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> species have been demonstrated as vector competent for ASFV (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). ASFV-infected 
 <italic>Ornithodoros porcinus porcinus</italic> soft ticks (often referred to as 
 <italic>O. moubata porcinus</italic> or 
 <italic>O. moubata</italic>) in Africa have been well-documented (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and have also been found in Madagascar (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Additionally, competent 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> vectors are also known to exist in parts of Europe and the Americas (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). 
 <italic>Ornithodoros erraticus</italic> (also known as 
 <italic>O. marocanus</italic> and renamed 
 <italic>Carios erraticus</italic>) soft ticks inhabit the Iberian Peninsula and Mediterranean areas of Africa and Asia, and were an important vector and reservoir for ASFV in Portugal and Spain during the ASF epidemic in the twentieth century (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–
