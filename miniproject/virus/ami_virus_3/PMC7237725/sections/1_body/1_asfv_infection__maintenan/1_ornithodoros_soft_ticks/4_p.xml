<p>Studies of ASFV infection and replication in soft ticks show that ASFV infection takes 15â€“21 days to reach the midgut epithelium where viral replication is initiated, with peak virus titers achieved by 28 days post-infection (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Restricted replication within midgut epithelial cells reduces the infectivity of the Malawi Li 20/1 strain for soft ticks orally exposed to the virus (
