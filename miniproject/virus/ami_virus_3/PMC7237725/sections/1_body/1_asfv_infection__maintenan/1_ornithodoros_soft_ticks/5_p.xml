<p>Within the tick life cycle, ASFV can be transmitted sexually from infected male to female (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), transovarially from infected female to offspring (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>), and maintained transstadially through the various life stages [(
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>); see 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>]. An increase in mortality rates in ASFV-infected ticks has been reported during the first three ovipositions (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The number of infected ticks observed under field conditions is typically lower than infection rates observed after experimental infections (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>).
