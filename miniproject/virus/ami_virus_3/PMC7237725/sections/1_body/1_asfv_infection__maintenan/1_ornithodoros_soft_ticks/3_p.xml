<p>Multiple ASFV genetic elements have been identified as being associated with infectivity, replication, and generalized dissemination of ASFV in 
 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> ticks. Deletion of three multigene family (MGF) 360 genes (
 <italic>3Hl, 3IL</italic>, and 
 <italic>3LL</italic>) from the tick-derived pathogenic ASFV Pr4 isolate resulted in reduced infectivity and a 2â€“3 log
 <sub>10</sub> decrease in viral titer within 
 <italic>O. porcinus porcinus</italic> ticks compared to the parental virus (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). CD2v, the protein responsible for viral hemadsorption (HAD) in ASFV strains displaying the HAD phenotype, has also been demonstrated to possess an important function in virus-tick interaction. Restoration of the HAD phenotype to the non-hemadsorbing NH/P68 strain carrying a CD2v gene interrupted by frameshift mutations results in an ~1,000-fold increase in viral titer within 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> ticks after feeding on infectious whole blood, most likely due to effects on virus uptake and replication in the tick midgut epithelium (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
