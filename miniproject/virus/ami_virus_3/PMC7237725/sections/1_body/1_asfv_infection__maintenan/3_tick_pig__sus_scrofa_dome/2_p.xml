<p>The genotype II Georgia 2007/1 strain responsible for the contemporary European epidemic has been experimentally demonstrated to replicate efficiently in live 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> ticks (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). However, it is unlikely that a soft tick cycle plays a significant role in the ongoing outbreak in Europe and most likely also Asia, as soft ticks are largely absent in Central Europe and the Baltic nations, and most of the soft tick species in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus region do not infest domestic and wild swine (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). A study investigating potential contact between wild boar and soft ticks in Germany via serum screening for antibodies against 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> in wild boar showed little evidence for feeding and infestation of wild boar by soft ticks, and limited interaction between these ASFV hosts is assumed (
