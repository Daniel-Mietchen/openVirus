 <italic>Ornithodoros</italic> soft ticks including species of 
 <italic>O. moubata</italic> complex in Africa and 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> in Europe are capable of transmitting ASFV to domestic swine (
 <italic>Sus scrofa domesticus</italic>), and can become infected after feeding on viremic animals [(

 <italic>O. moubata</italic> complex have been isolated from pig sties and farms in locations affected by ASF outbreaks, including sites where little or no contact between wild and domestic swine occurs, suggesting an important role for soft ticks in disease maintenance in these areas (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). A similar pattern was also observed in the Iberian Peninsula, where 
 <italic>O. erraticus</italic> ticks were associated with the persistence of ASFV (
