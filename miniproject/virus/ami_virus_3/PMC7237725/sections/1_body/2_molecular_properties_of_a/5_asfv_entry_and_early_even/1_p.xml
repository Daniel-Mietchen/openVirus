<p>Several modes of cell entry for ASFV have been demonstrated (

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>–
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Early studies on ASFV entry indicate receptor-dependent mechanisms including low pH and temperature-dependent events, and determined that ASFV binding to cell surfaces was saturable (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>–
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Given the cell tropism of ASFV, several macrophage receptors have been implicated as playing a possible role including CD163, CD45, MHC II, and others, although no specific receptor for ASFV has yet been identified (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>). Earlier 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> studies supported CD163 as being a significant receptor for ASFV, demonstrating that monoclonal antibodies could block infection (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). However, ASFV infection of gene-edited pigs lacking CD163 showed no difference in the course of infection or survival compared to wild type CD163-expressing pigs, indicating that other receptors or entry mechanisms are critical (
