<p>ASFV structural proteins involved in virus attachment to permissive cells include p12, p72, and p54 (
 <xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>–
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). ASFV p30 is an early and abundantly expressed phosphoprotein and is necessary for virus internalization (
 <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). The pp220 polyprotein is cleaved into 4 major protein components of the viral core, all of which are required for core detachment and release (
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>–
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). The internal envelope protein pE248R is essential for viral fusion with endosomal membranes and core release (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>).
