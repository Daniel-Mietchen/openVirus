<p>The current working model for ASFV entry includes both clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis (

 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Actin modulation through phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), Rac-1 Rho-GTPase and Pak-1 kinase signaling is important for ASFV internalization via macropinocytosis (

 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). PI3K is essential for ASFV infection, likely playing a critical role in endosomal trafficking of ASFV (

 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). Clathrin, dynamin, and cholesterol are required for ASFV transport through endosomes in both Vero cells and swine macrophages (

 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). Following internalization into early endosomes or macropinosomes, ASFV particles are transported to late endosomes where the cellular factor Rab7 was shown to play an important role (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). ASF virions can be found in early endosomes between 1 and 30 min post-infection (mpi) and in late endosomes at 30-90 mpi. Increasing acidification through endosomal trafficking plays an essential role in the uncoating of the ASFV outer envelope and capsid. A pH below 5.0 was shown to be required for virion uncoating (
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>). Fusion then occurs between the ASFV inner envelope and late endosomal membranes, releasing the viral core into the cytoplasm where viral factories will subsequently form and ASFV replication takes place. Host cell phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) and biphosphate PtdIns (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) diphosphorus are important for the progression of early infection events to the start of ASFV replication (
