<p>Fc-receptor mediated entry of ASFV into cells has also been proposed, although the results from one study indicated Fc-receptors do not mediate ASFV infection of macrophages (
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>). Nonetheless, several studies suggest antibody-dependent enhancement of ASFV infection characterized by early and increased viremia and accelerated disease, supporting

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). Antibody-dependent enhancement of infection occurs through entry of macrophage-tropic microorganisms facilitated by IgG antibody-antigen complexes and Fc-receptor signaling, and has been demonstrated for several viruses including porcine reproductive and respiratory virus, Dengue virus, and West Nile virus, among others (
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>–
 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>). Accelerated disease has been observed in vaccinated swine compared to non-vaccinated controls following virulent ASFV challenge (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>–
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>), and enhancement of ASFV infection was observed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> in the presence of sera from immunized animals, all of which coincide with the presence of non-neutralizing ASFV-antibodies (
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the mechanisms involved in ASFV enhancement of infection and pathogenesis.
