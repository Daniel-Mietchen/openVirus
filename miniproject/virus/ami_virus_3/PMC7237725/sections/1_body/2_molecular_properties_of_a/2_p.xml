<p>Genotyping of ASFV has historically been based on the nucleotide sequence of a 478 bp variable region in the C-terminus of the viral p72 gene (
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>), though other viral genes have also been used to further characterize ASFV strains (
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>–
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Currently, there are 24 genotypes based on the major capsid protein p72, and 8 serotypes based on the viral hemagglutinin CD2-like protein (CD2v) and C-type lectin (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>–
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>). All of the 24 ASFV genotypes have been identified in Africa (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Strain virulence cannot be accurately predicted by p72 genotype (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>). The first emergence of ASFV outside of Africa consisted of genotype I viruses, which are predominantly described in West Africa (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Genotype II ASFV was introduced into the Caucasus in 2007, most likely from East Africa, and remains the current ASFV genotype circulating throughout Europe, the Russian Federation and Southeast Asia (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>).
