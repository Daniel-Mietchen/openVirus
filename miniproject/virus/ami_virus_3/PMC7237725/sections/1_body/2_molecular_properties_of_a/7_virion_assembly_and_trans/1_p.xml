<p>Microtubules play an essential role in ASFV cellular transport and viral factory formation (

 <xref rid="B135" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). Microtubules and kinesin work together to support budding of ASF virions from the infected cell (
 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>). ASFV p54 interacts with microtubules and is required for formation of viral factories and the recruitment of envelope precursors to virion assembly sites (
 <xref rid="B137" ref-type="bibr">137</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>). The viral capsid protein pE120R facilitates transport of mature virus particles from assembly sites to the plasma membrane, where the virus acquires its host-derived outer envelope (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B139" ref-type="bibr">139</xref>). Altogether, an entire ASFV infection cycle, from attachment and entry to budding of mature virus particles, is completed within 24 hpi (
