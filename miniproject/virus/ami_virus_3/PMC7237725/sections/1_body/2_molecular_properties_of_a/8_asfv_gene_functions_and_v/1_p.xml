<p>ASFV encodes for at least 150 proteins. So far, 38 ASFV proteins are associated with known or predicted functions in nucleotide metabolism, transcription, replication and repair; more than 24 ASFV proteins are involved in virion structure and morphogenesis, and at least 8 ASFV proteins are likely involved in host cell interactions (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). However, the functions of a large number of ASFV-encoded proteins still remain unknown. ASFV encodes several gene products involved in virulence and counteracting host antiviral responses. The ASFV protein DP96R has been shown to inhibit the cGAS-STING pathway, thereby blocking IFN-β production, a key mediator between innate and adaptive immune responses (

 <xref rid="B141" ref-type="bibr">141</xref>); ASFV gene product I329L has been shown to inhibit toll-like receptor 3 signaling and type I interferon induction (
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>). In addition, ASFV proteins CD2v and I215L block the transcription of immunoregulatory genes, and ASFV proteins DP71L, A179L, A224L, and EP153R promote cell survival (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). CD2v has also been shown to bind to host adaptor protein 1 (AP-1) and localizes around viral factories, which suggests a role in subversion of cell protein trafficking to promote viral replication and packaging (
 <xref rid="B143" ref-type="bibr">143</xref>). ASFV genes of the multigene families MGF360 and MGF505/530 are also associated with counteracting antiviral host responses involving interferon-associated mechanisms (
 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>–
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>), and are host range determinants (
 <xref rid="B147" ref-type="bibr">147</xref>). MGF360 genes have the most copies and are the most variable among ASFV strains (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Naturally attenuated ASFV strains typically lack multiple copies of MGF360 and MGF505/530 genes as well as the CD2v gene (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that targeted deletion of certain genes within MGF360 and MGF505, or of CD2v, is capable of attenuating certain wild-type ASFV strains, but not all, indicating other ASFV virulence genes/factors are also important for the virulence of ASFV (
