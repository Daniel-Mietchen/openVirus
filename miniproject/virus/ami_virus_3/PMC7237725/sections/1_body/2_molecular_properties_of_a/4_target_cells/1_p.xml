<p>In swine, ASFV preferentially replicates in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>). It can also replicate in some established cell lines although with less efficiency (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>). The virulent ASFV BA71 strain was adapted to replicate in Vero cells (BA71V). Vero cells derived from African green monkey kidney, and have been widely used as a model for 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> ASFV infection and replication studies (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). However, adaptation in cell culture can cause genetic modifications to the virus that result in attenuation of virulence and decreased fitness in primary swine macrophage cultures, which is the case for BA71V and other cell-adapted ASFV strains (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>). Therefore, only virus derived from infected animal tissues or propagated in primary swine macrophage cultures usually retains the natural characteristics and phenotype of the original virus (
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>).
