<p>Similar to other large DNA viruses such as poxviruses and herpesviruses, ASFV uses a temporal gene expression strategy (
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). The viral RNA polymerase recognizes and initiates the expression of early, intermediate and late genes throughout the respective stages of the ASFV replication cycle. Early gene expression occurs around 4–6 h post-infection (hpi), and produces proteins necessary for viral replication. At 6–8 hpi, ASFV replication is initiated via its own DNA polymerase encoded by gene G1211R. While ASFV replication primarily occurs in viral factories in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, an initial brief replication phase takes place in the cell nucleus (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>). Intermediate and late gene expression then follows at 8–16 hpi producing structural proteins that are incorporated into the virion. ASFV encoded E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme [E215L; (
 <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>)], histone-like protein [pA104R; (
 <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>)], RNA helicases [QP509L and Q706L; (
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>)], and topoisomerase II [pP1192R; (
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B133" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>)] have all been shown to localize to viral factories as well as diffusely within the cell cytoplasm and nucleus. Localization and expression studies along with siRNA knockdown experiments indicate that these viral factors play important roles during ASFV gene expression, genome replication and packaging (
