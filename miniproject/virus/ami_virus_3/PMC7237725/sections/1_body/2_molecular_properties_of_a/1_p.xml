<p>ASFV has a large double-stranded DNA genome ranging from 170 to 190 kilobase pairs (kbp) that encodes more than 150 open reading frames (ORFs), depending on viral strain; it is the only known DNA arbovirus (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). The observed significant differences in genome size are primarily due to gain or loss of gene copies belonging to the multigene families (MGFs) and variation within the number of tandem repeats in non-coding regions of the ASFV genome (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). Mass spectrometry has identified 68 virion-associated structural proteins from purified virions of strain BA71V and up to 94 virion-associated polypeptides were detected in virions from 3 different mammalian cell lines infected with a recombinant OURT 88/3 strain; the precise function of a significant proportion of the structural and non-structural ASF viral proteins is unknown (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). The virion is ~200 nm in diameter and possesses a multi-layered structure consisting of the nucleoid, core shell, inner envelope, capsid, and a host-derived outer envelope (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). The p72 major capsid protein and four minor capsid proteins, M1249L, p17, p49, and H240R, make up the viral capsid (
