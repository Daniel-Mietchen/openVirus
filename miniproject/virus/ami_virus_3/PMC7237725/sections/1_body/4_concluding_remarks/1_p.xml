<p>ASFV is a complex DNA arbovirus having a significant impact on the global swine industry. The lack of a safe and efficacious vaccine and the reliance on culling of herds to prevent disease spread has resulted in in significant economic losses. Therefore, improved early detection, and on-farm biosecurity measures, as well as movement control continue to be of significant priority. Further studies on ASFV gene functions, virus and cellular factors involved in ASFV replication, pathogenesis, as well as host immune responses to determine the correlates of protection, will be critical for the development of a rationally-designed, safe, efficacious, and DIVA-compatible ASFV vaccine. In addition, given the vast distribution of susceptible soft tick vectors, wild boar, and feral pigs, methods to prevent and control ASFV establishment, and spread in populations of these species are also critically important.</p>
