  <p>ASFV replication cycle. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> ASFV entry is primarily mediated through an unknown receptor and/or macropinocytosis; Fc-receptor mediated entry and phagocytosis have also been suggested entry mechanisms. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The virus is then trafficked through early endosomes or macropinosomes to late endosomes, where viral uncoating takes place via endosomal acidification. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm in viral factories, with brief replication events occurring in the nucleus. Gene expression occurs temporally, first with early genes to produce replication proteins, followed by intermediate and late genes that produce structural proteins that are assembled into the virion. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Virions are assembled and bud from the infected cell within 24 hpi. Known major host (orange dots) and viral (blue diamonds) factors involved in the ASFV replication cycle, which are discussed in the text, are indicated. ASFV, African swine fever virus; mpi, minutes post-infection; hpi, hours post-infection; vRNApol, viral RNA polymerase; vDNApol, viral DNA polymerase; PI3K, phosphoinositide-3-kinase; Rac1, Rac-1 Rho-GTPase; Pak1, Pak-1 kinase; PtdIns3P, phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate; PtdIns (
