  <p>Schematic of ASFV transmission cycles. In Europe, Asia, and Africa, ASFV is readily transmissible between domestic pigs through direct contact and contaminated pork products and fomites. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> In Europe and Asia, two-way transmission between pigs and boars can occur at the livestock-wildlife interface, especially where poor farm biosecurity exists. Transmission between wild boar is capable of maintaining and spreading the virus across large geographic areas. ASFV can be transmitted between soft ticks of the 
   <italic>Ornithodoros erraticus</italic> complex and domestic swine, and soft ticks can serve as persistent reservoirs for the virus as seen in the Iberian Peninsula. There is little evidence to support transmission between soft ticks and Eurasian wild boar and domestic pigs in contemporary European and Asian epidemics. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The sylvatic cycle in Africa involves virus transmission between juvenile warthogs (
   <italic>Phacochoerus africanus</italic>) and soft ticks of the 
   <italic>Ornithodoros moubata</italic> complex. Infected ticks transmit ASFV to juvenile warthogs when taking a blood meal, and uninfected ticks are infected after feeding on viremic juvenile warthogs, while adult warthogs typically do not maintain high levels of viremia and are dead-end hosts. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> Within soft ticks of the 
   <italic>O. moubata</italic> and 
   <italic>O. erraticus</italic> complexes, virus is transmitted via sexual and transovarial routes and can be maintained across multiple life stages.
