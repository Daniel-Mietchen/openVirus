<p>COVID-19, an acronym for COronaVIrus Disease 2019, previously 2019‐nCoV, is an on-going pandemic attributed to a novel virus that belongs to the coronavirus (CoV) family, SARS‐CoV‐2. As of April 20th, 2020, the infection has spread to 210 countries with a total of 2,314,621 confirmed cases and 157,847 deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (https://covid19.who.int/). The CoVs are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can cross species barriers and cause illnesses in humans ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (

Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe who named them based on the crown-like morphology of the spherical virion with surface projections that resemble a solar corona. Among the four CoV sub-families (alpha‐, beta‐, gamma‐, and delta‐coronaviruses), SARS‐CoV‐2 belongs to the B lineage of beta‐CoV and is closely related to the SARS‐CoV. The widely reported initial clinical sign for case detection is pneumonia but gastro-intestinal and asymptomatic infections are also being reported in children (
