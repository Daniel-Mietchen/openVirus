 <p>We thank the Wallis authorities and the Futuna chiefs for their hospitality and authorization to collect mosquitoes, and the inhabitants of Wallis and Futuna who allowed us to carry out our surveys in the vicinity of their houses and in their gardens. We also thank Enelio Liufau and Iasinito Niutoua (
  <italic>Service de lâ€™Environnement</italic>, Wallis and Futuna) for their assistance during the collection of samples, Marie Vazeille (Institut Pasteur Paris, France) for preparing the viral strain used for the competence study, Gilbert Le Goff (IRD, France) for providing information for the 
  <italic>Aedes oceanicus</italic> identification, and Philippe Marmey (IRD, France) for the figure design. We are grateful to Laurent Guillaumot (Institut Pasteur New Caledonia) for sharing his entomological knowledge on the Wallis and Futuna Islands, which was invaluable in planning the entomological prospections.
