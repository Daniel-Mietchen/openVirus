<p>The prospecting work in the three islands of the Wallis and Futuna territory focused on mosquito species that could possibly transmit the main three arboviral diseases (dengue fever, Zika, chikungunya). The work allowed to collect and identify four species of the

 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>polynesiensis</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>futunae</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>oceanicus</italic>. In peridomestic areas, breeding sites were mostly found in containers used by humans, like coconut shells, bowls, dishes and plastic boxes, used tires, buckets and barrels, etc. Furthermore, breeding sites found in wilder environments also partly resulted from human activities, such as holes in the trunks of coconut palm trees or pierced coconuts. Some of the breeding sites, mainly barrels and used tires, were often highly productive with more than 200 immature stages each. Breeding sites were sometimes shared by two different species of mosquitoes. Associations were
