<p id="Par5">Guaranteeing safe water, collecting sewage, and maintaining effective hygiene during infectious diseases, including COVID-19 pandemic, play a key role in supporting human health (Eslami et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2018</xref>; WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020b</xref>). The risk of COVID-19 appears to be low through the stool of an infected person. There is evidence that SARS-CoV-2 may lead to intestinal infection and be present in the stool (Bhattacharjee 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2020</xref>). Studies show that approximately 2 to 10 percent of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases have been associated with diarrhea (Chen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2020</xref>; Huang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2020</xref>; Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2020a</xref>). Two studies have reported the detection of residual SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA in the stool of patients with SARS-CoV-2 (Holshue et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2019</xref>; Xiao et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2020</xref>). Yet, only one study has reported the SARS-CoV-2 from a cultured stool sample (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020b</xref>). In the latest study, the report of the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage has been confirmed. The presence of the virus in the wastewater, even when the prevalence of the virus is low, indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 can survive in the sewage. This finding could be a sensitive tool for tracking and monitoring the rate of virus rotation in communities (Lodder and de Roda Husman 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2020</xref>; Medema et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2020</xref>). Some studies have reported that coronavirus can remain in water or wastewater sources for days or weeks (Qu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2020</xref>). Due to the evidence of the virus surviving in aquatic and sewage environments, its presence in water resources is dependent on essential factors such as temperature, sunlight, and the presence of organic compounds that the virus can adsorb to and protect themself against sunlight. The presence of other antagonistic microorganisms can also affect its survival in water resources. According to the latest WHO report, there is no evidence that human-type coronavirus has been transmitted through contaminated drinking water (Naddeo and Liu 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2020</xref>). In general, coated viruses are less environmentally friendly and are more sensitive to oxidants such as chlorine. The SARS-CoV-2 is likely to be significantly inactivated more rapidly than human intestinal viruses without water-borne diseases in contact with oxidants (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2020b</xref>).
