<p id="Par10">Reviews of studies have shown that reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces can reduce the amount of coronavirus load on surfaces and the rate of transmission. The most important solution is to disinfect surfaces, clean surfaces with water and detergents, and then disinfect with ethyl alcohol (62–71%), or hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) or sodium hypochlorite (0.1%) with 1 min contact time. Despite the lack of evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by blood-borne arthropods such as mosquitoes, some studies have identified insects such as beetles and domestic insects, which are the main mechanical carriers of pathogens, through contact with contaminated surfaces and patients’ secretions. Also, its transmission through the air with a minimum distance of 6 feet, water and sewage, and food has not been provided so far.</p>
