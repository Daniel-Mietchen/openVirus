<p id="Par7">Numerous factors are contributing to the spread of global diseases such as COVID-19, which is spreading worldwide. These conditions include ecology and human behavior. These cases have been directly and indirectly involved in the occurrence of some problems and diseases (Barratt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>; Dehghani and Kassiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Most coronaviruses are pathogenic and can cause acute respiratory syndrome. So far, 7 types of them have been identified (Gorbalenya 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>; Roush et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2019</xref>). The transmission and evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 from bats to scaly anteaters (pangolins) and then to humans has been reported (Dehghani and Kassiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). This process is now present in humans through aerosols, but transmission through secretions such as stool has not been confirmed. In addition to these cases, the transfer through bandages can also be considered. There have been no reports of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by blood-borne arthropods such as mosquitoes (Shankar et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2020</xref>; Wu and McGoogan 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2020</xref>). Some studies have associated insects such as beetles and domestic insects, which are the main mechanical carriers of pathogens, by contact with contaminated surfaces and patientsâ€™ secretions involved in transmission (Graczyk et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2005</xref>; Kobayashi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">1999</xref>; Vazirianzadeh et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2014</xref>). SARS-CoV-2 excretion by stool has been confirmed in some patients. Therefore, feeding domestic insects and beetles from the stool and its mechanical transmission can play a significant role in the transmission of the disease (Parry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>). They can transmit more than 100 pathogens through the legs, body hair, mouth, feces, and vomit. In this regard, the elimination of mechanical carriers is very important not only in residential homes but also in public places. There are several ways to control these organisms, including improving environmental hygiene, such as putting garbage in closed bags and trash cans, controlling sanitary landfills, sanitary toilets, proper sewage disposal systems, and preventing the accumulation of manure nearby, and residential areas (Jobara 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2016</xref>). Clinical and laboratory wastes from SARS-CoV-2 detection in suspected individuals, secretions such as blood (1%) and feces (26%) can also be a major source of the virus (Chang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020</xref>; Iwen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2020</xref>). But no study has shown the presence of the virus in the urine (Wang et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">2020c</xref>). Finally, if such waste is not properly managed, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through mechanical transmission by insects (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2020a</xref>).
