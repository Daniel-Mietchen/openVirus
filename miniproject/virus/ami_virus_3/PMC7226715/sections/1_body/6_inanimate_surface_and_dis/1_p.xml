<p id="Par8">Human-to-human transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 occurs most often when people are in the communal stage of the disease or carrier and have no symptoms, or when they are with mild symptoms. The important ways of transmitting the virus are through Droplets, infected hands, and skin-to-skin contact, as well as inanimate surface contact (Kampf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>). Studies show that SARS-CoV-2 stays for more than 9 days and be resistant, like other coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), can live on inanimate surfaces such as metals, glass, and plastic at room temperature. Also, at ambient temperatures of 30 °C and above, the duration of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced (Kampf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>). Some studies have suggested that a temperature of 56 OC for 90 min or a temperature of 67 OC for 60 min can cause SARS-CoV-2 to be inactive (Henwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>). Kampf et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>) showed that at room temperature and 50% humidity, the resistance of the virus was more than 30%. In one study, the stability of SARS-CoV-2 on different surfaces confirmed that the virus was more resistant to smooth surfaces than others. According to the results of this study, the virus remains stable at temperatures of 22 oC and relative humidity of 65% for 4 days on surfaces such as glass and banknotes and 7 days on smooth surfaces such as steel and plastic. It also stays on rough surfaces such as fabric and wood for up to 2 days (Chin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). Another investigation, which examined environmental levels of SARS-CoV-2 virus in hospital centers, found that the most important environmental levels of infection were self-service printers (20%) (used in Chinese laboratories), desktops, and keyboards (16.8%), door handles (16%), telephones (12.5%), and medical equipment (12.5%) (Ye et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2020</xref>). Studies show that students touch their face with their hands an average of 23 times an hour. 56% of it is the touch of the skin, 36% is the lips, 31% is the nose, and 31% is the eyes (Kwok et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2015</xref>). Although SARS-CoV-2 is not available on the surface of complete information on viral load, it can be said that by reducing the frequency of touching surfaces by hands and disinfecting surfaces, the amount of virus load on surfaces can be reduced (Kampf et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2020</xref>). The WHO has recommended that cleanliness be done with water and detergents to ensure environmental cleanliness, and then the use of common environmental disinfectants, such as sodium hypochlorite (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2020c</xref>). The most well-known methods of surface disinfection to remove SARS-CoV-2 virus are, in short, the use of ethyl alcohol (62–70%), or hydrogen peroxide (0.5%) or sodium hypochlorite (0.1%, dilution ratio 1 to 50) with a contact time of 1 min (Henwood 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2020</xref>; WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>). Other biocidal agents such as benzalkonium chloride (0.05–0.2%) or chlorhexidine digluconate (0.2%) are also applicable, but their effectiveness is less than previous (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2014</xref>). The effect of hand soap on disinfecting surfaces from the SARS-CoV-2 virus was investigated. The results of this study show that the virus is inactivated by contact with soap for 5 min (Chin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020</xref>). The CDC has also recommended a water temperature above 65 degrees to disinfect surfaces (Seymour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020a</xref>). One of the most important concerns at the pandemic period of coronavirus is disinfection and sterilization of surgical masks and N95 for reuse. The significant thing is that these devices are disposable and cannot be reused in normal conditions. However, in cases of shortage and under certain conditions, they can be reused up to 5 times by disinfecting and sterilizing them. The use of thermal methods of at least 50 °C for at 30 min is highly recommended as a disinfection and sterilization method for n95 masks. In one study, the use of Uc radiation with a 100 µwcm
 <sup>−2</sup> power with a contact time of 15 to 20 min for sterilization of N95 mask was suggested (Card et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>). In another study, the use of hydrogen peroxide (HP) vapor was used in a short time to sterilize the N95 mask (Seymour et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2020a</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide gas is suitable for disinfecting devices used for patients with viral infections. It also does not hurt patients’ respiratory system and can be used to disinfect hospital rooms (Schwartz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2020a</xref>).
