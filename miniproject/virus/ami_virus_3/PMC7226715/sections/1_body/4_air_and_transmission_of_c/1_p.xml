<p id="Par6">Research has shown that newly infected patients have no clinical symptoms and can easily be the source of the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. This transmission can be through sneezing, coughing, talking to other people at close range, and through the foul airflow (Li et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2020</xref>; Zhi 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2020</xref>). Based on the available evidence, it is not thought that air diffusion is one of the main transmission routes (Dehghani and Kassiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). Non-invasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy, intubation/extubation, nebulization, open suctioning of airway secretions, bronchoscopy, induction of sputum, bag and mask ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, etc. are the principal causes of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol release in airflow (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2020d</xref>). For example, the role of environmental pollution in several hospitals has been evaluated following the outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015 in Korea, as well as experimental studies on the survival and stability of MERS-CoV on surfaces and air (Bin et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2016</xref>). There is also the possibility of air stability for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the use of viral filters and closed suctioning, airflow changes, and negative pressure air pollution in closed environments, with the probability of infection, is recommended (Malhotra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). Thus, people in contaminated environments should use a mask and, if there is no mask, should use face masks (Bowdle and Munoz-Price 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2020</xref>). Facial hair can provide a way for SARS-CoV-2, to penetrate (Malhotra et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2020</xref>). Using non-standard masks can also exacerbate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 (Jones and Xia 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2018</xref>). Besides, wearing a mask in some health workers has shown symptoms of claustrophobia, respiratory distress, discomfort, and skin irritation (Barratt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>). The most available type is the N95 mask, which according to studies can be sterilized and reused by hydrogen peroxide, gamma rays from CO60, UV rays, dry and wet heat, and ethylene oxide. In the meantime, the use of radiation is preferable to other methods (Card et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Cramer et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2020</xref>; Kenney et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2020</xref>). Gamma CO60 with a dose of 10 KG can sterilize the N95 mask used in SARS-COV environments, and kill the virus (Feldmann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2019</xref>). However, high doses of radiation may damage the fibers of the mask and allow air to pass through without purification, but it does not have secondary radiation and its side effects (Harrell et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2018</xref>). Hydrogen peroxide is also a useful antiviral and has no adverse effects on the respiratory tract (Viscusi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2009</xref>). Enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) was very effective at the time of the SARS-COV outbreak. Due to the similarity of this disease with COVID-19, the application of this strategy can prevent the transmission of the disease through the air. (Yen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">2020</xref>). In this way, patients with clinical symptoms quarantined, other people use disinfectant and PPE during patients’ visits to the hospital. This process has been approved in the control of other epidemic diseases such as Ebola and SARS-CoV and is currently being implemented in COVID-19 pandemics (Ong et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2020</xref>, Schwartz et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">2020b</xref>; Yen et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">2015</xref>). The possibility of transmitting bioaerosols with the ability to move up to 6 feet through the air has also been reported in the internal environment of ophthalmologists (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020c</xref>). As a result, HEPA filters have been used for ventilation. Still, air-born emissions for SARS-CoV-2 have not yet been reported. According to available evidence, it is not confirmed that air can be one of the principal causes of transmission. Therefore, it can be predicted that if any suspended matter is created in the air of medical centers, the transfer will be easy (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020a</xref>).
