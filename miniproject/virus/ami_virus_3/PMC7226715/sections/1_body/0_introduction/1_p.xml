<p id="Par2">The new outbreak of COVID-19 has recently become a serious threat to the health of people around the world. COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2, which is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that causes infection and respiratory failure (Swerdlow and Finelli 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2020</xref>; Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2020</xref>) and has led to the thousands of people deaths (Thienemann et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2020</xref>). Following the WHO announcement, the Global Emergency Committee identified the need for early detection, quarantine, and prompt treatment as a global concern (Sohrabi et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2020</xref>), because people with the virus do not have clinical symptoms such as fever, cough, etc., in the early stages. For this reason, there is not enough information on how to disinfect and disinfect surfaces and hands, human-to-human transmission through air, food, and water, and the presence of the virus in human wastewater and waste. There are several factors involved in transmitting the virus. These conditions can be included in environment and human behavior (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The distribution of human population, migration, social interactions, climate change (deforestation, habitat invasion), agricultural growth, and direct contact with domestic and wild animals fall into this category (Barratt et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2019</xref>; Dehghani and Kassiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). On the other hand, the effect of environmental factors such as ambient temperature, humidity, etc., relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) has not been sufficiently investigated. How the virus enters the body (eyes, ears, mouth, and nose) is not well known by the release of aerosols and droplets containing SARS-CoV-2 in human societies. However, previous findings in the epidemic of a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 can be used in this regard (Sun et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2020</xref>), because the methods of transmission are not currently known. Therefore CDC recommends standard precautions, contact and air, and eye protection (glasses or face shields) (CDC 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2020b</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">e</xref>). It has been reported that even with personal protective equipment (PPE), it is still possible to get infected (Dai 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2020</xref>) because there is no convincing evidence to support the effect of PPE use in the prevention of infection (Yang 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2020</xref>). The significant concern about SARS-CoV-2 is its transmission (Dehghani and Kassiri 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2020</xref>). According to the WHO, there is no certainty about the persistence of the SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces. However, the virus appears to act like other coronaviruses and can survive on the surface for at least several hours (Parry 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>). For this reason, the following health points in public places, hospitals, and residential houses has a significant role in controlling the transmission of the disease (WHO 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2020a</xref>). Dealing with COVID-19 and preventing its rapid and dangerous spread is a global challenge. Therefore, the fight against this disease requires global management. However, due to the potential variability of this disease, according to the type of climate and other environmental factors, its prevention and control should be investigated quickly and seriously (Askari et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2018</xref>). When a new pandemic occurs, a lot of health advice is given. Anyway, it should be noted that these methods may not be the most accurate and correct, but following them can be effective until sufficient knowledge is obtained. Nevertheless, a hierarchy to deal with SARS-CoV-2 transmission involves three steps: 1) self-care, 2) control of environmental factors, and 3) the use of PPE (Lai et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2020</xref>). This study aimed to investigate the effect and role of various factors, including environmental factors (climate change, water transfer, air, and food), disinfection of surfaces, and hands in the transmission and prevalence of COVID-19 pandemics.
