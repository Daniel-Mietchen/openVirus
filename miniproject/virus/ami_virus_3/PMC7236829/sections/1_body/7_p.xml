<p>It is worth noting that only throat-swab specimens were used for viral RNA detection, since this is a retrospective study. Evidence has shown that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected in stool samples as well. However, a recent study declared that infectious virus was predominantly derived from the respiratory tract and not from stools [

As rRT-PCR detects both viable and nonviable virus, more convincing studies are needed to investigate whether people just with persistent positive rRT-PCR results are capable of transmission or not.
