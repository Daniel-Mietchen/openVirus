<p>Our results first revealed that the median time from symptom onset to rRT-PCR conversion was 19 days, which was similar to what was uncovered in previous data reported by Z

 <xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], where the median time was 20 days for 137 cases. In this study, most patients showed a negative PCR for viral RNA within 30 days, and the longest time observed was 44 days. Moreover, many patients had a fever during the course of the disease, and the median time from fever resolution to rRT-PCR conversion was 7 days, with a range of 0–28 days. However, owing to the fact that PCR tests sometimes show false-negative results, it is best to repeat this at least twice. Based on the results, it is recommended that patients continue to follow prophylactic measures, including wearing masks, even after being discharged from the hospital.
