<p>A total of 410 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients were recruited to this study, who were discharged from Wuhan Tongji hospital, Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital and Wuhan Union hospital main district (all in Wuhan, China) between 1 February 2020 and 20 February 2020. Throat-swab samples were collected and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was detected using real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR). Data were extracted for demographic characteristics, comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory values and treatments using electronic medical records. All patients who were hospitalised received a standard diagnosis and treatment based on the Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol for Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia (Trial Version 7) [
 <xref rid="C3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Follow-up throat-swab specimens were obtained at intervals of 4±2 days from when symptoms began to improve, including fever reduction or improvement in chest computed tomography scans. The date of symptom onset was defined as the day when initial symptoms were noticed. T1 referred to the duration from the symptom onset to when SARS-CoV-2 RNA was negative for two consecutive times, which indicated the duration of viral RNA shedding. The date of fever resolution was defined as the first day after admission when the axillary temperature of a patient was no longer &gt;37.3°C. T2 was defined as the duration from the date of fever resolution to rRT-PCR conversion. A hazard ratio (HR) of &lt;1 indicated prolonged viral RNA shedding. This study was approved by the ethics commission of all hospitals (S2020-055, S2020-056, 2020-YJ-046.01) where patients were observed, and the requirement for informed consent was waived.
