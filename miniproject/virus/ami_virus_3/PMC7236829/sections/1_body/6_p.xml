<p>Based on these data, patients with decreased albumin levels experienced prolonged viral RNA shedding. As previously reported, hypoalbuminaemia has a negative impact on the immune response system and increases short-term mortality in hospitalised patients with acute infectious diseases [

 <xref rid="C6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, further studies are needed to address the mechanism underlying any link between albumin and viral RNA shedding. In addition, patients with comorbidities showed prolonged viral RNA shedding. Nevertheless, only CHD was proven to be an independent risk factor for prolonged viral RNA shedding. Similarly, major comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and malignancies have previously been found to be related to slower viral clearance in patients with SARS or influenza A [
 <xref rid="C7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As previously reported, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular diseases were at a higher risk for COVID-19 and experienced worse outcomes, showing a 5â€“10-fold increase in mortality [
 <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Hence, patients with chronic comorbidities, especially CHD, had more difficultly in achieving viral clearance.
