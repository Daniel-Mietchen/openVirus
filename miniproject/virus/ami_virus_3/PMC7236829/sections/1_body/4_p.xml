<p>Additionally, we explored the risk factors involved in prolonged viral RNA shedding using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model. Coronary heart disease (CHD) (HR 0.619, 95% CI 0.411–0.933; p=0.022), albumin levels (HR 1.027, 95% CI 1.005–1.049; p=0.014) and the initial time of antiviral treatment (HR 1.467, 95% CI 1.187–1.815; p&lt;0.001) were independent factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding. The median times for viral RNA shedding in patients with or without CHD were 21 days and 19 days, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1b</xref>). Patients with CHD showed prolonged viral RNA shedding (p=0.029). Patients with albumin ≥35 g·L
 <sup>−1</sup> had a shorter duration of viral RNA shedding compared to those with albumin &lt;35 g·L
 <sup>−1</sup> and the median times were 18 days and 20 days, respectively (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1c</xref>). The median times for patients who started antiviral therapy within or later than 7 days after symptom onset were 18 days and 21 days, respectively (
