<p id="par0040">Viral stock used to establish analytical sensitivity was the first Italian isolate obtained from a patient hospitalized in the Biosafety Level 3 facility at National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani” (INMI) in Rome, named 2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1 [
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The infectious titre of the viral stock used in the study, performed by Reed and Muench method on VeroE6 cells, was 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCDI
 <sub>50</sub>/mL; for the establishment of analytical sensitivity, the viral stock was spiked into oral swab-UTM matrix and serial dilutions (from 100 to 0.001 TCDI
 <sub>50</sub>/mL) were tested in multiple replicates. The evaluation of the corresponding RNA copies/mL was performed based on standard curve obtained by Corman’s E-SARS-CoV-2 gene.
