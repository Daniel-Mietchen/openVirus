<p id="par0060">The analytical sensitivity (SARS-Cov-2 copy number at a 95% detection rate and SARS-Cov-2 TCDI
 <sub>50</sub> at a 95% detection rate) was calculated with probit analysis, using the MedCalc statistical software, on the basis of results obtained by several replicates of serial dilutions of the 2019-nCoV/Italy-INMI1 spiked into oral swab-UTM matrix. The evaluation of the concordance between results obtained with Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay and with the Corman’s reference method was performed using GraphPad Prism statistical package.
