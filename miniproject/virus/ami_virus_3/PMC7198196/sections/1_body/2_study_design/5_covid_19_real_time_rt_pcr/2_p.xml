<p id="par0055">Total nucleic acids (DNA/RNA) were extracted from 200 μL of nasal and nasopharyngeal specimens. Clinical samples were pre-treated with 1:1 ATL lysis buffer and extracted using the QIAsymphony® instrument with QIAsymphony® DSP Virus/Pathogen Midi Kit (Complex 400 protocol) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (QIAGEN, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). The presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was assessed by Corman’s protocol, targeting E and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) genes as reference method [
