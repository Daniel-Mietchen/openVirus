<p id="par0030">The pandemic caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has generated global concern given its rapid spread in multiple countries and fatal progression of the Coronavirus infection disease (COVID-19) [
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic cases especially in the early phase of the infection have also been reported [

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Since the spread of SARS-CoV-2 out of China, one of the main concerns on the diagnosis of this new virus has been the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic assays. So far, nucleic acid amplification testing is the gold standard for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples [

 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Molecular assays as previously demonstrated for epidemics caused by other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV), are crucial for rapid application of infection control measures, case identification and contact tracing [
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. However, one of the major drawbacks of these assays is the need for viral nucleic acid extraction from clinical specimens. Recently, DiaSorin S.p.A. (Gerenzano, Italy) has developed a SARS-CoV-2-specific real-time RT-PCR (Simplexaâ„¢ COVID-19 Direct assay) performed directly on clinical samples.
