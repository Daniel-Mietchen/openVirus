<p id="par0080">Since the spread of COVID-19 in China, several SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-PCRs have been developed and commercialized in response to rising diagnostic demands. Prompt and rapid diagnosis are the main goals, particularly in the early phase of epidemics and are the first step towards limiting the propagation of the infection. In this scenario, we have evaluated the performances of the newly designed real-time RT-PCR Simplexaâ„¢ COVID-19 Direct assay. Overall, the test is fast, easy-to-use, does not need extra-equipment such as centrifuges or an extraction system, and can be handled by laboratory personal with very little extra training for the procedures and interpretation of results. Furthermore, the simplicity of design and the all-in-one coupled with easy-to-use design, makes it suitable for the field settings, and for near-to-patient diagnosis.</p>
