<p id="par0085">The LOD of the prototype assay, established with both SARS-CoV-2 viral particles and SARS-CoV2 extracted viral RNA, was less than 1000 cp/ml. All the SARS-CoV-2 samples resulted positive with the reference test (Corman’s method), also resulted positive with Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay, with a diagnostic sensitivity of 100% and “almost perfect” concordance. Notably, Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay showed a slightly higher sensitivity with respect of the reference test, identifying near 3% additional positive samples. An high performance of the test was also observed using different clinical specimens: among the BAL samples that were able to be analysed by both methods, a perfect agreement was observed; noteworthy, Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay was able to detect the virus in BAL samples resulted invalid with the reference method. The discrepancy in the processing capability between the two systems is attributable to the highly viscous composition of BAL, that could impair its accessibility to a traditional extraction method compared to a faster and easier sample processing method such as that used in the Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay. Moreover a 100% of clinical specificity was observed against swabs resulted positive to other viruses, particularly human coronaviruses, indicating no cross-reactivity with other similar viruses. Key advantages of this assay are simple operation procedures and high-speed of detection in just over an hour, which is significantly faster than the up to seven hours currently required by traditional extraction followed by amplification technologies. The lack of extraction reduces turnaround time (TAT) for the diagnosis of COVID-19, thus allowing prompt decision making regarding isolation of infected patients.</p>
