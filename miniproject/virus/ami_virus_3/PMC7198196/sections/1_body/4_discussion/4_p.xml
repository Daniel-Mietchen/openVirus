<p id="par0090">The only limitation of the assay is the small number of samples which can be tested in a run, since each instrument can support a ring of maximum eight position; this limitation is offset by the rapidity of the assay, due to the lack of extraction. Overall, the good analytical and clinical performances, coupled with user friendly architecture and short TAT indicate that it is promising for laboratory diagnosis of COVID-19 and field application.</p>
