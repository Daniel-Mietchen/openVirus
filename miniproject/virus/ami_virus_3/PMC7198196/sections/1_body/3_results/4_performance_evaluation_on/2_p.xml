<p id="par0075">A total of 278 nasopharyngeal swab were tested in parallel with the Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay and Corman’s reference method in two main reference centers (i.e. the Laboratory of Virology of National Institute for Infectious Diseases “Lazzaro Spallanzani” (INMI) IRCCS, Rome, and the Molecular Virology Unit, Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia). Results obtained from the two laboratories were all included in the study. All the 99 SARS-CoV-2 samples tested positive with the reference test showing median cycle threshold (Ct) of 24.2 (range 16.6–36.9), also resulted positive with Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay, with a clinical sensitivity of 100 %. Notably, Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay was able to detect 8 additional positive samples resulted negative with Corman’s method. In these samples, a median of 30.8 Ct (range 28.2–33.3) in FAM detector and 31.2 Ct (range 28.2–33.6) in JOE detector was observed, respectively. Concordance analysis showed an “almost perfect” agreement in SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection between the two assays, being κ = 0.938; SE = 0.021; 95 % CI = 0.896-0.980 (

Moreover, the performance of the assay in a different clinical specimen type, i.e. BAL, that is considered of utmost importance in patients with lower respiratory tract implication, was also evaluated: a total of 33 BAL samples were analysed in parallel with the Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay and Corman’s method. For these samples, the Abbot 
 <italic>m</italic>2000 extraction platform was used, due to temporary restriction of QIAsymphony® reagents. While with BAL samples, the reference method provided elevated number of invalid results (14 out of 33), with overall 12 positives out of 19 valid results, 33 out of 33 samples achieved a valid result with the Simplexa™ COVID-19 Direct assay, providing 20 positives out of 33 valid results. The concordance among the 19 samples with valid results in both assays was 100 % (12 positive and 7 negative).
