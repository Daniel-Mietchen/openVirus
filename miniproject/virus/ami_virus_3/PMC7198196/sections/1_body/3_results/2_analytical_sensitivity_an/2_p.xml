<p id="par0065">To assess the sensitivity of the prototype assay, both live SARS-CoV-2 and extracted viral RNA were tested. More in detail, for LOD calculation with live virus, SARS-CoV-2 particles from 2019nCoV/Italy-INMI1 isolate were spiked into oral swab-UTM matrix and serial dilutions from 100 to 0.001 TCDI
 <sub>50</sub>/mL were tested in replicates. We observed 100 % detection down to about 1 TCID50/ml, corresponding to 4 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> cp/mL (
 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The analytical sensitivity (i.e. the LOD, corresponding to the concentration of SARS-CoV-2-RNA detected with response probability of 95% for either S or ORF1ab) was determined by Probit regression model (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). More in detail, the LOD for both target genes resulted the same: 3.2 (CI: 2.9 to 3.8) log
 <sub>10</sub> cp/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>a) and 0.40 (CI: 0.2 to 1.5) TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>b) for S; 3.2 log
 <sub>10</sub> (CI: 2.9 to 3.7) log
 <sub>10</sub> cp/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>c) and 0.4 (CI: 0.2 to 1.3) TCID
 <sub>50</sub>/mL (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>d) for ORF1ab. Consistent, although slightly better results, were obtained for LOD calculated on extracted viral RNA. This was spiked in universal transport medium (UTM) additioned with RNasin (1.6 U/μL) to avoid RNA degradation, and replicate 10-fold serial dilutions of were loaded on the MDx instrument and tested with the Simplexa™COVID-19 Direct assay. The LOD obtained with extracted viral RNA for both S gene or ORF1ab was 2.7 log
 <sub>10</sub> cp/mL.
