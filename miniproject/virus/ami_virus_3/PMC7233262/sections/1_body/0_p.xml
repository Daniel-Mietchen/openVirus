 </xref>? Once this outbreak was recognized as a serious threat, a special team consisting of physicians, scientists, and epidemiologists began to investigate these possibilities. Within 9 days, SARS and MERS had been ruled out and a novel coronavirus had been isolated in Wuhan; this coronavirus is now officially named as the SARS‐CoV‐2 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses. The breadth and nature of the investigation that identified this novel SARS‐CoV‐2 is elaborately described by Zhu and colleagues in a recent publication in
