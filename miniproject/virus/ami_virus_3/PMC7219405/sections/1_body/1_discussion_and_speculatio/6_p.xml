<p id="par0110">When the 2001 UK foot-and-mouth outbreak emerged, outputs from infectious diseases models were directly used to inform policy and the decisions made. This was perhaps the start of using real-time epidemic modelling, and with the emergence of SARS, pandemic â€˜flu (2009), Ebola, Zika virus and now Covid-19 (this is far from an exhaustive list), the appetite of policy makers to use models to aid decision making has not abated. The field needs to keep ahead of the demand, and to this point rather sophisticated methods to infer R0 and other parameters have been developed so that they can be used rapidly and often by researchers with limited expertise (
