<p id="par0115">In conclusion, since its inception infectious disease modelling has already gone through two revolutions, and it appears that the field is rapidly transitioning into a new one. Can the field remain whole in this new era of Big Data and advanced computing? And if not, where will the splits be? Those who develop inference methods and those who have the infectious disease knowledge to implement them? Or rather into subject-specific domains: those who are able to work with spatial data, those with social data, those with missing dataâ€¦ What does remain clear is that despite extensive interventions and effort, infectious agents continue to cause widespread morbidity and mortality. Improving on our current systems and fully utilising new data streams remains a daunting task, and it is through collaboration within and outside our field that we will grow into this new revolution, make advancements in global health, and vitally, not misuse data that could cost lives.</p>
