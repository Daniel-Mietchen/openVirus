<p id="par0100">Another safe prediction is that data are only going to get “bigger”. The standardisation and integration of genomic sequencing, georeferencing, and the use of social media will only develop richer and more detailed data on which to build models. All these expansions contribute towards capturing heterogeneity in transmission, which is why their inclusion in many settings will be important. In particular, the inclusion of data-driven dynamic contact networks within infection models is starting to appear, particularly in veterinary disease contexts where the data exist (
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Orton et al., 2018</xref>). The embarrassment for the modeller will be not so much that there is no data to inform parameters (which was the norm 30 years ago), but that there is so much data that its not clear what the model structure should be to accommodate the data. In this context we are likely to see more and more machine learning approaches used to extract and simplify the relationships within the data. Big data and the associated tools to deal with big data might well be the third revolution for infectious disease modelling. With the increasing complexity of model and data streams it is likely that the field of infectious disease modelling will branch itself into many forms, if it hasn’t already.
