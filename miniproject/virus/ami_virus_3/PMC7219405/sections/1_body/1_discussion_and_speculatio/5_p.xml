<p id="par0105">The interaction between models and policy decisions are also likely to change dramatically in the foreseeable future. The quality of the evidence provided by different models fitted to different datasets is not well defined, and there has been recent interest in developing model ensembles and modelling consortia (

 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Hollingsworth and Medley, 2017</xref>). Although this solves the problem of basing policy on a single model, it raises the problem of how to combine different model outcomes. Weighting the strength of evidence from each model seems a sensible approach, but choosing the weights is problematic. The majority of the approaches in this issue work in a Bayesian context, where the data and model are combined with prior information to inform parameter estimates and therefore model behaviour. If the public health decision is also put into a Bayesian context, i.e. the model is part of the evidence, then it seems logically natural to treat models as “data”.
