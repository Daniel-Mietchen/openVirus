<p id="par0070">A particularly useful development has been Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) which can be used where the likelihood of a model is intractable. Whilst ideas related to this method have been circulating since at least the 1980s, only in the late 1990s did ABC in its current form start being applied, primarily in the field of genetics (
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Tavar√© et al., 1997</xref>). Central to ABCs usefulness is that instead of evaluating the likelihood, specific characteristics of the data are chosen by the researcher, and model output is compared to these characteristics (See 
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Minter and Retkute (2019)</xref> in this issue and Box 3). The simplicity of the approach enables parameter estimation which would not otherwise be feasible, thus enabling more complex models to be fitted to data. The challenge then becomes the need to identify appropriate summary statistics.
