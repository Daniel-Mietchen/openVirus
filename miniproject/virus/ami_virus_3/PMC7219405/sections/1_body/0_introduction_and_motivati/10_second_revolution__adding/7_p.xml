<p id="par0085">Contributing to the delay in complex inference methods entering mainstream usage is the computational skills of the researchers within the field. Many researchers using mathematical modelling do not have computational backgrounds, and therefore availability of reusable software is essential to methods being widely used. Additionally, providing code in a re-usable format was not initially routine and resulted in inefficiencies in carrying out research (in contrast to the practices of sharing code that perhaps stemmed from C++ users in physics). The practice of “reproducible research”, including the sharing of code and associated data has become increasingly common and is now frequently requested by research funders (

The STAN software platform is a great example of reusable software, as it allows researchers to efficiently implement complex methods such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Variational Inference (VI), both of which allow the fitting of more complex models than simpler MCMC algorithms. The paper by Chatzilena et al in this issue ((
