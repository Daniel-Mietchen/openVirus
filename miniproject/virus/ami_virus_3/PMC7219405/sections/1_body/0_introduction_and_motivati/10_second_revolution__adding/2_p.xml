<p id="par0060">As the field of mathematical modelling for infectious diseases has expanded, so has the complexity of models and their relation to data. Specific policy questions have triggered the need for including new layers of heterogeneity and complexity to existing models. A notable example of this type of change is the inclusion of the age structure within transmission models using contact surveys (
 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Mossong et al., 2008</xref>). This increase in model complexity has been driven by an improvement in understanding transmission; in the example by Mossong it has been the importance of age-structure in driving transmission of infectious diseases (in this case â€˜flu). Without including this model complexity, predictions in the effectiveness of interventions would be incorrect.
