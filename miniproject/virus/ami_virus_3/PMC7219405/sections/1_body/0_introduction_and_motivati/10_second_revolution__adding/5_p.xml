<p id="par0075">An interesting example of cross-discipline methodological developments is provided by particle MCMC. Particle filtering (which is the basis for particle MCMC) stems from fluid mechanics, where it has been used since the 1960’s. Particle MCMC (pMCMC) combines MCMC methods with Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods and is particularly useful when dealing with ‘hidden’ states (e.g. true numbers of infected cases in a community) which have to been inferred and are likely to be highly correlated parameters. Its first use in infectious disease modelling were (

However the development of this method has been hindered by the potentially complex mathematical background behind it, in particular in terms of the multiple indexes necessary to write the algorithms.
