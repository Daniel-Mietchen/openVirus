<p id="par0030">In this introduction, we put the methodological tools presented in this Special Issue in a historical context and briefly describe the contents of each paper. For example, at first it may not be obvious, and perhaps even confusing, why several methods are available using different software to estimate parameters of a transmission model. The intended readership of the Special Issue are early career researchers that may be less familiar with how the field has evolved to where it currently stands. Later career researchers may also find the papers interesting in order to keep up to date with recent methodological developments. Whilst it is far from compulsory, the order in which the papers are presented in this Introduction could be used to determine the order of reading.</p>
