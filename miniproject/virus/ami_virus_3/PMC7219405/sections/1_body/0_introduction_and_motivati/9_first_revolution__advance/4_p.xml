<p id="par0055">While the general principles behind MCMC are simple, the efficient implementation of even the most simple algorithms can be tricky. The arrival of Bayesian analysis Using Gibbs Sampling (BUGS) in the early 90â€‰s as a user-friendly software for implementing MCMC brought Bayesian analysis to the mainstream and spurred a revolution in infectious disease modelling. BUGS remains a widely used tool for analysing data including from the perspective of infectious disease models (see Box 2 and Auzenbergs et. al. (2019) in this issue). The use of the BUGS language for fitting complex models gained popularity in many areas of infectious disease research, but some challenges to using SIR-like models prevented their widespread use, such as the acyclic nature of non-linear models. Until MCMC samplers became easier to write, and researchers skills in computational methods improved enough to write them, a second revolution was required in methodological research in infectious disease epidemiology.</p>
