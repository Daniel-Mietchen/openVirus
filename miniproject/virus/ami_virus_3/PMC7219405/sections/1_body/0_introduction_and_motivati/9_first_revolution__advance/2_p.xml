<p id="par0045">Following the early achievements in epidemic modelling, interest grew in capturing the behaviour of more realistic and more complicated dynamic systems, yet this often resulted in problems which could no longer be solved analytically. Iterative methods therefore became a vital component in the modeller’s toolkit, alongside comparisons of model output to specific datasets by minimising the error between model and data, or by using approximations to simplify the set of estimated parameters. These approaches are illustrated within models applied to the use of the expectation maximisation algorithm to estimate parameters from HIV epidemics (
