<p id="par0010">Dynamic models are needed because the essence of infectious diseases is that transmission dynamics are non-linear: incidence is a function of current and past prevalence. Additionally, the dynamics are typically unobserved, for example asymptomatic infection frequently drives transmission and we rarely directly observe immunity of individuals. Consequently, it is impossible to make a rational decision on, say, vaccination policy simply from recent case numbers. To understand and predict what is happening, and to understand and predict the impact of interventions, the transmission processes must be properly described using a model (
