<p id="par0005">The motivations for transmission dynamic modelling are the motivations for this special issue: harnessing available data to inform policy on the control of infectious diseases. The focus is how to get the most valuable and actionable information out of data - models that translate data into evidence for policy. Transmission dynamic modelling is now central to designing and evaluating public health interventions against infectious diseases, especially for intervention programmes. Who should we vaccinate? Should we close schools to limit spread? What vector control option will save the most lives? These questions, if they are to be answered rationally, need a way of predicting the impact in terms of health outcome, e.g. numbers of clinical cases or deaths averted. Policy questions determine the necessary components and the complexity of the model; models need to be simple enough to analyse, but sufficiently detailed to address the questions.</p>
