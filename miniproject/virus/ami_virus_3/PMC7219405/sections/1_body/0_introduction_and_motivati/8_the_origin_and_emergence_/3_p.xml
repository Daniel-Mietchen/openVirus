<p id="par0040">A major step-change in the use of models to understand infectious diseases was apparent in the late 70’s and early 80’s where investigation began in full-swing in both the UK and the USA. These developments were motivated by understanding both the chronic effects of persistent parasite infection (for example hookworm), the regularity of viral epidemics such as ‘flu and measles, the emergence of epidemics such as HIV/AIDS, and the initiation of large vaccination programmes (

Whilst most modelling studies emerged from a small number of research groups, there are some notable exceptions (e.g. (Baroyan, 1963) for influenza in the USSR). Although the development of models in order to support policy making was well underway at the end of the 1980s, it was only later, with the emergence of affordable computational power following the advent of personal computers and the increasing availability of digital data, that effective tools to were developed or borrowed from other fields. This period ends about 1993 marked by the publication of Anderson &amp; May (1993) and the series of meetings at the Newton Institute (
