<p>Appropriate specimen collection and processing is the first and very important step for laboratory diagnosis. Specimen types of patients with respiratory virus infection are diverse. Viral RNA could be detected in upper respiratory tract (URT), lower respiratory tract (LRT), stool, blood, and urine of SARS‐CoV, MERS‐CoV, and SARS‐CoV‐2 infected persons. Among them, URT specimens, as well as available LRT specimens in severely affected patients must be collected for diagnosis and should be tested repeatedly if the first testing is negative in patients with epidemiological history and suspected symptoms of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. It was reported that SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA could be detected in stool, blood, or urine even if it could not be detected in URT specimens,

To demonstrate viral clearance during treatment, samples should also be collected and tested repeatedly. WHO recommended that the frequency of specimen collection should be at least every 2 to 4 days until there are two consecutive negative results in a clinically recovered patient at least 24 hours apart.
