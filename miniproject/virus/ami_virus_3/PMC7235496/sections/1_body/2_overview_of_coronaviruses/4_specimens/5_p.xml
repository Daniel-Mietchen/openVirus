<p>It has been reported that viral loads of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV in respiratory specimens always peak in the second week after symptom onset, and viral loads in LRT specimens were higher than in URT specimens.

 <xref rid="rmv2106-tbl-0003" ref-type="table">3</xref>, positive rate of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV RNA in LRT specimens was about 100% at the first 2 weeks of illness, while it remained relatively lower in URT specimens. So that LRT specimens are preferred to test if available. Now, several studies have shown the viral kinetics of SARS‐CoV‐2 in respiratory specimens. Zhang, et al. reported that only 50% of OP swabs were positive with a CT value of 32.1 (30.9‐32.75) at first sampling after symptom, while after 5 days, only 25% of oral swabs were positive with a CT value of 26.95 (25.98‐27.75).
