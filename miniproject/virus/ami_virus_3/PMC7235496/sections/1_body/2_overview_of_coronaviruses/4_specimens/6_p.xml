A study of 2134 SARS‐CoV infected specimens showed that the rate of viral shedding in feces was low in the first 5 days of illness (up to 28%), but rose gradually to peak at around 70% at 9 to 14 days with very high titers, even higher than in nasopharyngeal aspirates.

 </xref> Other studies also showed that the positive rate for stool specimens peaked at Weeks 2 and 3, with a higher diagnostic yield than pooled throat and nasal swabs, and nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens.

 </xref> Recently, viral RNA of SARS‐CoV‐2 was reported in stools, and the virus was isolated. The kinetics of viral loads in stools are still not very clear. Data showed that SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA can be detected in stools of 53% (9/17) confirmed cases at the first 2 weeks of illness, with viral loads ranging from 550 to 1.21 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies/ml.

 </xref> Another study showed that 25% SARS‐CoV‐2 infected patients had detectable viral RNA with a CT value of 31.65 (27.53‐33.23) in anal swabs at first sampling, while 5 days later, 37.5% patients could test viral RNA positive in anal swabs with a CT value of 26.5 (24.22‐29.38).
