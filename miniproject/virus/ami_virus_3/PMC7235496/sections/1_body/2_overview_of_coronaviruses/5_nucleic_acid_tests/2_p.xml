<p>Specific primers and standard operating procedures for nucleic acid tests (NAT) could be established as soon as the complete genome of the virus was sequenced, making NAT the optimal method for diagnosis. Current NAT tests for RNA viruses mainly include RT‐PCR, alternative isothermal amplification methods, and CRISPR‐Cas13a based Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing (SHERLOCK) system.
