<p>Due to its simplicity, easy methodology and extensively validated standard operating procedure, RT‐PCR is now the preferred and most widely used method for NAT. RT‐PCR assays targeting ORF 1a, ORF 1b, S gene, N gene of SARS‐CoV can detect &lt;10 genome equivalents.

 </xref> The primers target upstream of the E protein gene (upE), the ORF 1b, and the ORF 1a. Among them, sensitivity for upE target was 3.4 copies per reaction or 291 copies/mL of sample, which was considered highly sensitive and recommended for screening.

  <sup>63</sup>
 </xref> The ORF 1a assay was considered of equal sensitivity with the upE assay, while the ORF 1b assay was considered less sensitive than the ORF 1a assay.
