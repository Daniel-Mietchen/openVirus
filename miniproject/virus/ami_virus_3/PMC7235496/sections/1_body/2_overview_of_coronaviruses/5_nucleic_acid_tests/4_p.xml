<p>Several commercial and in‐house assays that detect SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA have been developed. Chu, et al reported two one‐step quantitative rRT‐PCR assays targeting ORF1b and N gene that could detect SARS‐CoV‐2 &lt; 10 copies/reaction, while the N gene assay was about 10 times more sensitive than the ORF1b gene assay in detecting positive clinical specimens.

 </xref> It might be possible that clinical samples contain infected cells expressing subgenomic mRNA, resulting in more N gene copies.

  <sup>66</sup>
 </xref> Corman, et al. developed assays targeting E gene and RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene that obtained best sensitivity with limit of detection (LOD) of 5.2 and 3.8 copies/reaction, respectively, while N gene assay was slightly less sensitive.

 </xref> Furthermore, when using other basic RT‐PCR reagents (Taqman Fast Virus 1‐step Master Mix), another lab obtained the sensitivity of 3.2 copies/reaction for E gene assay and 3.7 copies/reaction for RdRp gene assay.

 </xref> Some groups from different countries shared their protocols of in‐house developed molecular assays. In summary, Chinese CDC recommended primers and probes targeting ORF1ab and N gene.

 </xref> In Germany, Charité recommended E gene assay as first line screening assay with technical LOD of 5.2 copies/reaction, and RdRp gene assay as confirmatory assay with technical LOD of 3.8 copies/reaction.

 </xref> Scientists from Hong Kong University recommended the N gene RT‐PCR as a screening assay and the ORF1b assay as a confirmatory one.

 </xref> Ministry of Public Health of Thailand recommended assay targeting N gene.

 </xref> National Institute of Infectious Diseases of Japan recommended nested RT‐PCR assay targeting ORF1a and S gene, as well as RT‐PCR targeting N gene.

 </xref> The US CDC has developed assays including three pairs of primers targeting the N gene of SARS‐CoV‐2, and authorized emergency use by the US FDA.

 </xref> Details of these assays are summarized in Table 
 <xref rid="rmv2106-tbl-0004" ref-type="table">4</xref>. Most of the in‐house assays, as well as commercial kits are designed to detect two or three regions of SARS‐CoV‐2 genome. The different regions are amplified at the same time. Chinese National Health Commission recommended that both ORF1ab and N should be tested positive for a positive result. If only one region is positive, the result needs to be re‐tested.

  <sup>73</sup>
 </xref> The US CDC recommended that all the N region targets should be detectable for a positive result, or be undetectable for a negative result. If only one target is positive, the result is inconclusive and need to be re‐tested.
 <xref rid="rmv2106-bib-0074" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>74</sup>
 </xref> So, it is important that all the two or three regions tested should be positive to identify a positive case.
