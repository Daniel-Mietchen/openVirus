<p>RT‐PCR relies on sophisticated equipment that it may not be present in resource‐limited regions. These limitations gave birth to alternative isothermal amplification methods, such as transcription‐mediated amplification (TMA), nucleic acid sequence‐based amplification (NASBA), strand displacement amplification (SDA), loop‐mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), helicase‐dependent amplification (HDA), isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA), and rolling‐circle amplification (RCA).

 <xref rid="rmv2106-bib-0082" ref-type="ref">82</xref> Chantratita, et al developed a real time NASBA assay that could detect as little as one copy/reaction of SARS‐CoV RNA.

 </xref> Compared to RT‐PCR, a RT‐LAMP assay of SARS‐CoV showed 100‐fold‐greater sensitivity, with a detection limit of 0.01 PFU.

 </xref> In another study, detection rate of the RT‐LAMP assay was lower than the RT‐PCR assay for samples isolated from patients within the first 3 days of disease onset, and was similar to RT‐PCR when detecting specimens sampled from patients with more than 3 days of illness.

 </xref> A RT‐RCA assay for SARS‐CoV could detect as few as five copies of SARS viral genome.

  <sup>86</sup>
 </xref> For MERS‐CoV, a RT‐RPA method targeting the N gene could detect virus RNA with a sensitivity of 10 copies/reaction. In addition, the run time of the RT‐RPA was between 3 and 7 minutes for 10
 <sup>7</sup> and 10 molecules, respectively.
