<p>Although many RT‐PCR assays for the SARS‐CoV‐2 have been developed, NAT positive cases only account for about 50% of clinically confirmed cases. To raise the positive rate of NAT, standard collection, strict storage and transportation conditions, proper extraction and amplification procedures are needed. To increase test sensitivity, increasing the template volume and total reagent volume for a single run would be very useful. To improve test specificity, amplifying a second genome region for confirmation is suggested. Most importantly, appropriate controls should be established to ensure the results are reliable. For SARS‐CoV, which are also suitable for other viruses, WHO recommended one negative control and one positive control for extraction, one water control and one positive control for a PCR run, and the patient sample spiked with a weak positive control to detect PCR inhibitory substances (inhibition control).

 </xref> Except for these external controls, internal controls, including plasmid DNA, virus‐like particles (VLPs), RNase P gene, and housekeeping genes of airway epithelial cells such as beta‐actin have been used for NAT of respiratory viruses including SARS‐CoV‐2. Of all these kinds of internal controls, only RNase P presents in all types of SARS‐CoV‐2 infected samples and can control the quality of all procedures, from sample collection to amplification (Table 
 <xref rid="rmv2106-tbl-0005" ref-type="table">5</xref>). Thus, we recommend RNase P as internal control when amplifying SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA.
