<p>In 2002, Jansen et al. firstly discovered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) system.

 </xref> In 2003, it was confirmed for the first time that CRISPR‐Cas9 can be used to edit human genes.

 </xref> In 2017, combining RPA and CRISPR‐Cas13a, SHERLOCK system was developed for NAT.

 </xref> SHERLOCK detected viral particles down to 2 aM, and could discriminate between similar viral strains.

 </xref> Recently, a protocol for detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 using SHERLOCK system has been published.
 <xref rid="rmv2106-bib-0096" ref-type="ref">
  <sup>96</sup>
 </xref> This method can detect SARS‐CoV‐2 in a range between 20 and 200 aM (10‐100 copies per microliter of input) within an hour. However, this method has not yet been validated with real patient samples, so it should not be used for clinical purposes now.
