<p>WHO declared that positive antibody test results indicated a previous infection with SARS‐CoV. Seroconversion from negative to positive or a 4‐fold rise in antibody titer from acute to convalescent serum indicated recent infection. No detection of antibody after 21 days from onset of illness seemed to indicate that no infection with SARS‐CoV took place.

 </xref> For MERS‐CoV, the US CDC recommended ELISA as a screening test and microneutralization as a confirmatory test for MERS‐CoV antibodies.

 </xref> Where a patient has evidence of seroconversion in at least one screening assay and confirmation by a neutralization assay in samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, this patient can be considered a confirmed case. A 4‐fold increase in MERS‐CoV antibody titer by neutralization tests in acute and convalescent serum samples performed in parallel is needed for confirmation.

 </xref> For conducting serology of SARS‐CoV‐2, or broad CoV serology on paired samples (in the acute and convalescent phase), WHO recommended that the first serum sample should be collected in week 1 of illness and the second collected 3 to 4 weeks later, collecting at least 3 weeks after onset of symptoms if only a single serum sample can be collected.
