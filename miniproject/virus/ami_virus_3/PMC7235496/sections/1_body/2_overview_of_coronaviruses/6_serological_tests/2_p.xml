<p>Serological testing may be conducted for diagnosis in rare situations where NAT is not possible, for investigation of an ongoing outbreak, or for serological surveys, including to retrospectively assess the extent of an outbreak.

 </xref> Although antibody seroconversion provides reliable proof of infection, serological testing lags behind the detection of viral genome by molecular testing, making it not suitable for early diagnosis. In SARS, higher neutralizing antibody response was associated with a longer illness.

 </xref> In most MERS patients, the levels of IgG and neutralizing antibodies were weekly and inversely correlated with LRT viral loads.

 </xref> Thus, testing antibody is helpful for surveillance, prediction of disease outcome and epidemiological investigation, but not for early diagnosis.
