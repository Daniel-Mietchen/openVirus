<p>The basic issue in serological assays is the source of antigen. Once virus has been isolated from patients, cell lysate or supernatant of virus infected cells could be used for serological assays. These methods are most convenient and rapid, as they only need susceptible cell cultures and virus. However, they need to be performed in BSL‐3, and proper inactivation of the virus without reducing immunogenicity of antigens is required, thus limiting the widespread use of virus‐based serological testing. Furthermore, cross reaction is likely to happen because of the conserved sequence and structure between CoVs. By cloning immunogenic viral genes into prokaryotic or eukaryotic expression plasmids, transfecting the plasmids into bacterial or mammalian cells and purifying proteins, recombinant antigens can be developed to overcome the disadvantages of virus infected cells.

 </xref> Recombinant antigens are safe and do not require BSL‐3 containment. Importantly, although taking longer time and more steps for development, recombinant antigen based assays enable the selection of immunogenic and virus specific antigens to maximize both specificity and sensitivity, and more suitable for standardization.

 </xref> In SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, N and S protein are the major immunogenic proteins and the first choice for producing recombinant antigens. Antibodies to proteins S, 3a, N, and 9b were detected in the sera from convalescent‐phase SARS patients. Among them, anti‐S and anti‐N were dominant and could persist in the sera of SARS patients until week 30, while only anti‐S3 showed significant neutralizing activity.

 </xref> Anti‐N appeared earlier than anti‐S, indicating that S protein‐based assays may be preferable for use with convalescent sera.

 </xref> Cross reaction also happened in assays using recombinant antigens. Moderate cross‐reactivity between SARS‐CoV and porcine CoVs was mediated through amino acids 120 to 208 of the N protein.

 </xref> Thus, for SARS‐CoV‐2, specific recombinant antigens are required. Also, testing antibodies with different assays targeting different regions of antigens could avoid false‐positive results produced by cross reaction.
