<p>A variety of serological assays were established for detecting SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV, mainly including enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescence assay (CLIA), immunofluorescence assay (IFA), western blot (WB), protein microarray, and neutralization. Of these methods, ELISA and CLIA are suitable for first line screening because of the large throughput, short processing time, and simple operating procedure, while neutralization assay is used as the gold standard for confirmation in many laboratories.</p>
