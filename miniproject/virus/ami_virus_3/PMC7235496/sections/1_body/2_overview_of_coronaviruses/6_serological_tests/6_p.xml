<p>In SARS, IgG seroconversion was documented in 93% patients at mean of 20 days.

 </xref> This SARSr‐CoV NP is 92% identical to SARS‐CoV‐2 NP, thus this assay was used for serological testing of SARS‐CoV‐2.

 </xref> Both IgM and IgG titres were relatively low or undetectable in first sampling (not first day of illness). On Day 5, an increase of viral antibodies can be seen in nearly all patients. IgM positive rate increased from 50% to 81%, whereas IgG positive rate increase from 81% to 100%.

 </xref> This is in contrast to a relatively low detection positive rate from molecular test. Based on this result, serological testing might improve the detection positive rate. However, the clinical records of patients involved in this study were not available. Although the target patients were those who received around 10 days of medical treatments upon admission, it is not sure on which days of illness the high positive rate of IgG and IgM occurred. Diverse assays and more evidence are needed to confirm the IgG and IgM kinetics of SARS‐CoV‐2.
