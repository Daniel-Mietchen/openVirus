<p>With the progress of global integration, emerging and reemerging infectious diseases are becoming easier to transmit all over the world. The very important and first key to respond to outbreaks is early discovery. Laboratory testing plays the major role in early detection of infected persons, enabling recognition of the infection source and cutting off the transmission route. The results of laboratory testing are affected by various factors. To improve NAT capacity of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA, we summarized the literature and guidelines and suggested that: (a) If LRT specimens are unavailable, collect stool and blood samples at later period of illness to improve the positive rate of NAT. (b) Increase template volume to raise the sensitivity of detection. (c) Put samples in reagents containing guanidine salt such as TRIZOL, TRIZOL LS, or AVL buffer to inactivate virus as well as protect RNA. (d) Set proper positive, negative and inhibition controls for extraction and amplification to ensure quality results. (e) Simultaneously amplify human RNase P gene as internal control to avoid false‐negative results. At the time of writing this review, serological evidence of SARS‐CoV‐2 is still poor. Diverse assays targeting different antigens are needed. Also, collecting paired samples would help to monitor the kinetics and positive rates of serological testing in different periods of diseases.</p>
