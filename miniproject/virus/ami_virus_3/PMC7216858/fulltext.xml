Due to its capability for genetic re-assortment, this virus can emerge as novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. Even though the first Avian influenza incidence in humans in Nepal was reported in April 2019, the threat of the disease remains unmitigated. Limited resources for surveillance, disease tracking, and weak health care facilities in low and middle-income countries will increase the possibility of the outbreak. Therefore, timely management and preparedness by strengthening veterinary and medical services, operational capabilities of laboratories, and surveillance programs through the "One-Health" approach could be crucial for the control of possible outbreaks in Nepal.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Avian influenza</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>One health</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Approximately 66% of the population in Nepal depends on agriculture as a way of livelihood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and more than 70% of the population raises livestock and poultry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since around 75% of the population of Nepal lives predominantly in rural areas with low socio-economic status and depends on subsistence farming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], by no means they can get rid of direct exposure to poultry and their products. Urban Nepal, where less than 20% of the total population resides, relies on poultry meat as their primary source of animal protein. Increasing meat demand has ultimately led to intensive farming and confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which potentially amplify the possible public health threat of Avian Influenza (AI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Other factors, such as using poultry shed as a human shelter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and poor sanitation and hygiene status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], further substantiate the likelihood of AI transmission to humans. For example, recently, a 3-year-old girl in China tested positive for H<sub>9</sub>N<sub>2,</sub> possibly acquired the virus from poultry as she had contact with domestic poultry before falling ill [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such an incidence of acquiring Avian Influenza from poultry is much likely in Nepal. Also, there are significant concerns over the co-circulation of avian, human, and pig influenza viruses in pigs with the potential of a genetic re-assortment and emergence of a genetically proficient virus than we have yet well-thought-out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Considering widespread nature of the H5N1 outbreak in Asia, the capability of influenza viruses to jump across species barriers, and close association between wild birds (asymptomatic reservoir of HPAI viral strains), domestic birds and humans, the threat of emergence of novel influenza strains with pandemic potential cannot be denied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With these issues at hand, a vast majority of the Nepalese are under an imminent vulnerable situation to probable AI outbreak that could have devastating consequences. It is rational to expect worse aftermath due to limited resources for surveillance, lack of services to detect, track, report, and respond to the disease on time, and inadequate health care facilities.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Avian influenza in poultry in Nepal</title><p id="Par3">The first reported case of AI in birds in Nepal was confirmed on 16th January 2009 in the Jhapa district. Since then, several periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza subtypes H<sub>5</sub> and H<sub>9</sub> have been reported in poultry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds was caused by the influenza virus of the strains H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>1</sub> of the clade 2.2 and later by 2.3.2.1a and H<sub>5</sub>N<sub>8</sub> of the clade 2.3.4.4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which are the same viral clades reported from South Asian countries including China and India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, frequent outbreaks of HPAI of different strains in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] further increases the threat of HPAI in Nepal. This is not just due to the long porous border, and cross border movement of birds between its neighbors but also unmanaged local markets, informal trade and uncontrolled movement of birds (wild and domestic) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) in poultry have caused substantial economic loss to the Nepalese poultry industry and severely affecting the livelihood of poultry farmers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, from the first outbreak of 2009 to fiscal year 2016/17, a total of 237 outbreaks of HPAI have been documented, where 1,966,745 (around 2 million) poultry birds were slaughtered and compensation amount of NRs. 259,706,641 (US$2.5 million) have been paid to farmers by the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) (Annual Technical Report.

The person-to-person transmission was reported, and when it has been reported, it has been limited, inefficient, and not sustained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, considering the capability of frequent mutation and genetic re-assortment of avian influenza A viruses, the possibility of gaining high contagious and virulence property cannot be ruled out. Therefore, monitoring human infections and human-to-human transmission is crucial for public health. Infection in humans has ranged from mild to severe, including conjunctivitis, influenza-like illness, sometimes accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe respiratory illness. Complications include neurologic manifestations and the involvement of other organ systems. Diagnosis of human cases will usually require molecular and serological testing. CDC currently recommends a neuraminidase inhibitor (Oseltamivir, Peramivir, and Zanamivir) for the treatment of human infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], which are found to be 70&#x02013;90% effective.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>SARS-CoV-2 and Avian influenza</title><p id="Par7">Currently, the world is facing severe coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which is caused by a genetically proficient virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Although the origin of the COVID-19 virus and its pathogenicity and immunogenicity is not known entirely, it is speculated to have been developed by genetic re-assortment between the coronavirus of bat and pangolin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Apparently, this outbreak has no any relation with Avian Influenza as there is no resilient evidence of genetic recombination between Coronavirus and Influenza virus. However, Qinghong Zeng et al. speculated that some human coronaviruses could have acquired the hemagglutin in-esterase gene of the influenza C virus through a recombinant process as a result of mixed infections in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Additionally, Luytjes et al. opined a supportive view stating that recombination events as a result of the co-infection of corona virus with the influenza C virus might give rise to a new corona virus OC43 with acquired haemagglutinating properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. The previous experiences with human influenza pandemics have demonstrated the vital role of the avian influenza virus in the origin of pandemic influenza viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The viruses that caused the pandemics of 1918, 1957, and 1968 all had genes of avian influenza origin, which fomented the pandemic spread of such viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Recently, Wu et al. reported the first case of co-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza A virus in Wuhan, China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].

It is desirable for both cost and time-effective reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The Government of Nepal (GoN) should be vigilant on the possible outbreak of HPAI through the comprehensive risk analysis and robust surveillance system. Considering all favorable factors of AI outbreak, GoN had established a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIIPPRP) 2006; Bird Flu Control Order 2008 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], to control avian influenza in animal-health sector aiming to reduce economic loss and safeguard public health. Those plans were more focused on mass awareness through media, sensitization of high-risk areas, epidemiological investigations, outbreak control and containment measures, capacity building of concerned personnel, institutional strengthening, and inter-sectorial coordination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. GoN has been successful for the containment of AI outbreaks in the poultry sector by stamping out operations through culling/ killing of all infected and possibly infected poultry birds, disposal, cleaning and disinfection of infected premises, and quarantine and movement control in and out of infected premises [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, GoN has tried to halt transmission of AI virus by enforcing improved biosecurity measures in farms with intensified surveillance activities around infected zones and quarantine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, attempts have been made to prevent outbreaks by risk-based surveillance systems and early detection of the virus as per the provisions made by Bird Flu Control Order 2008 (last amendment 2017) and Standard operation procedures 2011 for control and containment of Avian Influenza in Nepal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, to strengthen the AI surveillance system in Nepal, GoN has developed AI contingency and surveillance plans, which is yet to be effectively implemented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Recommendations and implementation of action plans</title><p id="Par9">At present, Nepal seems not well prepared for any imminent pandemic situation. Further, GoN has not established any surveillance and containment plan for the detection of AI in occupationally exposed groups such as poultry farmers, farmworkers, veterinarians, and veterinary technicians. It is better idea that GoN develop a comprehensive AIV surveillance in all possible hosts of influenza virus using advanced nuclear techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as soon as possible. Deeming the situation as aforementioned, an effective implementation of plans with improved inter-sectoral collaboration is direly needed. The government of Nepal is strongly suggested to focus on advancement of existing plans while strengthening veterinary and medical services, operational capabilities of laboratories, and surveillance programs in action.
