<p id="Par2">Approximately 66% of the population in Nepal depends on agriculture as a way of livelihood [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and more than 70% of the population raises livestock and poultry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Since around 75% of the population of Nepal lives predominantly in rural areas with low socio-economic status and depends on subsistence farming [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], by no means they can get rid of direct exposure to poultry and their products. Urban Nepal, where less than 20% of the total population resides, relies on poultry meat as their primary source of animal protein. Increasing meat demand has ultimately led to intensive farming and confined animal feeding operations (CAFOs), which potentially amplify the possible public health threat of Avian Influenza (AI) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Other factors, such as using poultry shed as a human shelter [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] and poor sanitation and hygiene status [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], further substantiate the likelihood of AI transmission to humans. For example, recently, a 3-year-old girl in China tested positive for H
 <sub>9</sub>N
 <sub>2,</sub> possibly acquired the virus from poultry as she had contact with domestic poultry before falling ill [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such an incidence of acquiring Avian Influenza from poultry is much likely in Nepal. Also, there are significant concerns over the co-circulation of avian, human, and pig influenza viruses in pigs with the potential of a genetic re-assortment and emergence of a genetically proficient virus than we have yet well-thought-out [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Considering widespread nature of the H5N1 outbreak in Asia, the capability of influenza viruses to jump across species barriers, and close association between wild birds (asymptomatic reservoir of HPAI viral strains), domestic birds and humans, the threat of emergence of novel influenza strains with pandemic potential cannot be denied [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. With these issues at hand, a vast majority of the Nepalese are under an imminent vulnerable situation to probable AI outbreak that could have devastating consequences. It is rational to expect worse aftermath due to limited resources for surveillance, lack of services to detect, track, report, and respond to the disease on time, and inadequate health care facilities.
