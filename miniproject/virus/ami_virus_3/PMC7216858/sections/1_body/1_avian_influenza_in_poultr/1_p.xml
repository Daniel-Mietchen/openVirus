<p id="Par3">The first reported case of AI in birds in Nepal was confirmed on 16th January 2009 in the Jhapa district. Since then, several periodic outbreaks of Avian Influenza subtypes H
 <sub>5</sub> and H
 <sub>9</sub> have been reported in poultry [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in birds was caused by the influenza virus of the strains H
 <sub>5</sub>N
 <sub>1</sub> of the clade 2.2 and later by 2.3.2.1a and H
 <sub>5</sub>N
 <sub>8</sub> of the clade 2.3.4.4 [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], which are the same viral clades reported from South Asian countries including China and India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Moreover, frequent outbreaks of HPAI of different strains in China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and India [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">9</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] further increases the threat of HPAI in Nepal. This is not just due to the long porous border, and cross border movement of birds between its neighbors but also unmanaged local markets, informal trade and uncontrolled movement of birds (wild and domestic) [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The repeated outbreaks of highly pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) and low pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI) in poultry have caused substantial economic loss to the Nepalese poultry industry and severely affecting the livelihood of poultry farmers [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. For example, from the first outbreak of 2009 to fiscal year 2016/17, a total of 237 outbreaks of HPAI have been documented, where 1,966,745 (around 2 million) poultry birds were slaughtered and compensation amount of NRs. 259,706,641 (US$2.5 million) have been paid to farmers by the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) (Annual Technical Report. Department of Livestock Services F/Y 2016/17). Apart from this, millions of dollars of the poultry sector have been lost due to HPAI in Nepal.
