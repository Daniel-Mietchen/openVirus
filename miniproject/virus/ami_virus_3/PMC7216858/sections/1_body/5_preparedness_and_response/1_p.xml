<p id="Par8">The containment of epidemics and pandemics would result in an enormous economic burden to the resource-poor countries like Nepal [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], that is why it is better to be prepared to prevent well ahead of time. It is desirable for both cost and time-effective reasons [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The Government of Nepal (GoN) should be vigilant on the possible outbreak of HPAI through the comprehensive risk analysis and robust surveillance system. Considering all favorable factors of AI outbreak, GoN had established a National Avian Influenza and Influenza Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan (NAIIPPRP) 2006; Bird Flu Control Order 2008 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], to control avian influenza in animal-health sector aiming to reduce economic loss and safeguard public health. Those plans were more focused on mass awareness through media, sensitization of high-risk areas, epidemiological investigations, outbreak control and containment measures, capacity building of concerned personnel, institutional strengthening, and inter-sectorial coordination [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. GoN has been successful for the containment of AI outbreaks in the poultry sector by stamping out operations through culling/ killing of all infected and possibly infected poultry birds, disposal, cleaning and disinfection of infected premises, and quarantine and movement control in and out of infected premises [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Similarly, GoN has tried to halt transmission of AI virus by enforcing improved biosecurity measures in farms with intensified surveillance activities around infected zones and quarantine [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Moreover, attempts have been made to prevent outbreaks by risk-based surveillance systems and early detection of the virus as per the provisions made by Bird Flu Control Order 2008 (last amendment 2017) and Standard operation procedures 2011 for control and containment of Avian Influenza in Nepal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, to strengthen the AI surveillance system in Nepal, GoN has developed AI contingency and surveillance plans, which is yet to be effectively implemented.
