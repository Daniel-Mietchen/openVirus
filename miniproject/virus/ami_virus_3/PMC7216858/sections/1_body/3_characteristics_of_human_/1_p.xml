<p id="Par6">Avian flu virus gets transmitted to humans via droplets or possibly dust generated from saliva, mucous, and feces of the infected birds. The person-to-person transmission was reported, and when it has been reported, it has been limited, inefficient, and not sustained [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, considering the capability of frequent mutation and genetic re-assortment of avian influenza A viruses, the possibility of gaining high contagious and virulence property cannot be ruled out. Therefore, monitoring human infections and human-to-human transmission is crucial for public health. Infection in humans has ranged from mild to severe, including conjunctivitis, influenza-like illness, sometimes accompanied by nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and severe respiratory illness. Complications include neurologic manifestations and the involvement of other organ systems. Diagnosis of human cases will usually require molecular and serological testing. CDC currently recommends a neuraminidase inhibitor (Oseltamivir, Peramivir, and Zanamivir) for the treatment of human infection [
