 <p id="Par1">Avian influenza virus infection in humans is an emerging zoonotic disease having high economic and public health impacts. Due to its capability for genetic re-assortment, this virus can emerge as novel influenza strains with pandemic potential. Even though the first Avian influenza incidence in humans in Nepal was reported in April 2019, the threat of the disease remains unmitigated. Limited resources for surveillance, disease tracking, and weak health care facilities in low and middle-income countries will increase the possibility of the outbreak. Therefore, timely management and preparedness by strengthening veterinary and medical services, operational capabilities of laboratories, and surveillance programs through the "One-Health" approach could be crucial for the control of possible outbreaks in Nepal.</p>
