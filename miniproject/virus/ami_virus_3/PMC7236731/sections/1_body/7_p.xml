<p id="par0040">Additionally, considering that the virus cell entry also depends on S protein priming by host cell proteases, including transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), there is some early evidence coming from the Severe Asthma Research Programme-3 (SARP), that inhaled corticosteroid therapy is also associated with reduction in ACE2 and TMPRSS2 gene expression from sputum.

 </xref> Although gene expression for ACE2 and TMPRSS2 did not differ in healthy people and in asthmatics, the author's report that males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus have increased expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 in their sputum cells that can be associated with a poor prognosis when infected with the SARS-CoV-2.
