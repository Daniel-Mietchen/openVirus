<p id="para20">It will come as no surprise that this is a challenging time to launch a medical journal, particularly one focussing on research into pathogens. However, current events have also made it clear that a journal such as ours has arrived just in time to help the microbial research community as it works tirelessly to uncover the inner workings of SARS-CoV-2. Our first issue carries a variety of information on this new virus, from its stability in the environment to its behaviour in numerous cell lines. Furthermore, this issue includes discussion of the need for renewed vigilance around viruses that pose a zoonotic risk, a discussion of ultraviolet light as a sanitising agent, and a call for thorough scrutiny of co-infections in patients with COVID-19.</p>
