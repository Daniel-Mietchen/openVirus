<p id="para10">Welcome to the first issue of 
 <italic>The Lancet Microbe</italic>, an open access journal for which we have ambitious plans. Our aim is to publish research that sets this journal apart from others in the clinical microbiology sphere, by catering to work exploring microbes and infectious agents at all scales. We will publish research ranging from the nature of the pathogen (eg, antimicrobial resistance genes or plasmids, virulence factors), to the microbiome, to pathology (including immunology), and to population-level effects (eg, outbreaks, epidemiology). But we will not limit ourselves to this outline: we are motivated by a complete fascination regarding pathogens and will consider any research that adds to the understanding of pathogenic microorganisms or other transmissible agents. Also, in keeping with the ethos of the entire 
 <italic>Lancet</italic> family, we will strongly advocate for and collaborate with the microbial research community worldwide.
