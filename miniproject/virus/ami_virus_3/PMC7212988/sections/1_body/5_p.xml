<p id="para60">Much about SARS-CoV-2, and in turn COVID-19, is still unclear and it will take time to fully understand its nature; however, our knowledge of this pathogen can be built on our understanding of its close relatives and the incredible scale of ongoing work. An equally pressing concern is that the urgency of investigations into the nature of SARS-CoV-2 does not entirely overshadow other vital considerations, such as the study of antimicrobial resistance and the panoply of other infectious agents that remain a huge source of suffering.
