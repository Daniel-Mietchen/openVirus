<p id="para30">The first research Article in this issue is by Hin Chu and colleagues and compares the tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage profile of SARS-CoV-2 with SARS-CoV. Screening 25 human and non-human cell lines, the investigators uncover viral characteristics that potentially reflect the features of COVID-19 and SARS. Of course, we must be cautious when extrapolating disease characteristics from cell culture, but these are nonetheless intriguing insights. Furthermore, research into MERS-CoV showed that results such as these can closely accord with clinical findings. Chu and coworkers find that SARS-CoV-2 has broad affinity for human-derived cell lines, but the virus's most significant replication was in the same cell types favoured by SARS-CoV: pulmonary, intestinal, hepatic, and renal. However, the robust replication of SARS-CoV-2 did not lead to the same levels of cell damage as SARS-CoV. Providing a hint about what might be behind the differing pathogenesis of these two viruses.</p>
