<p id="para40">The understanding of SARS-CoV-2 has grown at a truly remarkable rate, with researchers scrutinising the virus from every conceivable angle. Our ambition is that 
 <italic>The Lancet Microbe</italic> will be a venue for work on this virus even when it is no longer newsworthy. Our commitment is to the fullest understanding of pathogens and pathological processes whatever the level of public attention they attract. This pandemic has become the centre of attention for obvious reasons, but this should not detract from attention on other pathogens. They have not disappeared because we have looked away.
