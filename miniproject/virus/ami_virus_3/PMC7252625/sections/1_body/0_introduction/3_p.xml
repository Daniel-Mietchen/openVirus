<p>In studies on viral persistence body fluids are sampled from male and female EVD survivors, often in resource poor settings. Broad acceptance and understanding of testing programs and research is essential for the success and sustainability of clinical studies, specifically for the enrolment and retention of study participants. It has been shown, for instance, that perceptions of blood sampling significantly influenced study uptake and loss to follow-up [

From anthropological research we know that Muslim men may be especially conflicted about delivering semen samples in a clinical setting [
