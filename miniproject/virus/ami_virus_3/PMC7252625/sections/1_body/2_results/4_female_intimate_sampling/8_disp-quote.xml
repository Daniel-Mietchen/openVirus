 <p>It was only for the collection of menstrual fluid I know that it was not fine because some women considered it as unclean. Former SLEVP study staff, female</p>
 <p>Part [A] As for me what I hate in the whole study process is the vaginal swabbing especially the menstruation. I always ask myself what they are going to do (with) it. (…)</p>
 <p>Part [B]: As my colleague said menstruation and the blood is the problem. We really want to know the reason for taken them. Because women find it very difficult to give it out especially to foreign people you don’t know. Former SLEVP study participant FGD, female group</p>
 <p>To do the menstruation test was the greatest difficulty I faced in the room. The nurse asked me to remove my pant in order to do the test I told her that I am ashamed to do it. Fortunately, for me the nurse also was on her menstruation period so as a result she removed her pant and shows me how to do the test. Former SLEVP study participant FGD, female group</p>
