<p id="Par15">Evidences of ZIKV presence in human populations in Senegal were shown by the detection of the virus by serological and virological tests in samples collected from several localities (Dakar, Casamance, Ferlo, Diourbel, Sine Saloum, southeastern Senegal, Bandia, and Meckhé) between 1962 and 2015 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In vectors, ZIKV was isolated in western Senegal from 
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic> collected in 1968 in the Saboya forest [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and from three mosquito species (
 <italic>Aedes luteocephalus, Aedes furcifer-taylori</italic> and 
 <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>) in Bandia. As part of a program to study the biodiversity of arboviruses and their vectors in southeastern Senegal (1972–2015), more than 400 strains of ZIKV were isolated from around 20 species of mosquitoes belonging to the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, 
 <italic>Anopheles</italic>, 
 <italic>Culex</italic> and 
 <italic>Mansonia</italic> [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Recent studies have detected ZIKV from mosquitoes collected in different types of land covers including forests, savannahs, barrens, agricultures and villages across a large geographical area indicating wide spread of ZIKV in southeastern Senegal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. However, the main vectors belong to the genera 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> (subgenera 
 <italic>Aedimorphus</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. dalzieli</italic>), 
 <italic>Diceromyia</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic>, 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic>) and 
 <italic>Stegomyia</italic> (
 <italic>Ae. luteocephalus</italic>)) accounting for more than 90% of the isolates.
