<p id="Par27">A total of 1768 mosquitoes (748 males and 1020 females, 82 pools) were tested for ZIKV infection by RT-PCR. Four (4) of the 28 pools of F0 generation collected in March 2017 were positive for ZIKV. Positive mosquitoes consisted of 2 pools of 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic> females (cycle thresholds: 39.53 and 34.79), 1 pool of 
 <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> females (ct: 33.02) and 1 pool of 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> males (ct:34.83) (Table 
 <xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">4</xref>). Mosquitoes were collected in tree holes from villages (20 females) and rock holes from forests (4 females) for 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic>, in tree holes from savannahs for 
 <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> (20 females) and rock holes from forests for 
 <italic>Ae. vittatus</italic> (8 males). MFIR of the infected species varied between 5% for 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. unilineatus</italic> in the breeding site and landcovers where they were positives to 25% for 
 <italic>Ae. bromeliae</italic> females collected from rock holes in forest. The MFIR of the infected species in the different land covers classes were statistically similar (
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.7).
