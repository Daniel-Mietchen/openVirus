<p id="Par31">Finding viable eggs of 
 <italic>Ae. taylori</italic> maintained in villages was not expected. Indeed, this species was almost never found biting humans within villages area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This species could feed on other animals within villages or breed in some villages close to wild environment before going back to forests and savannahs where it bites. The localized maintenance of 
 <italic>Ae. furcifer</italic> in tree holes from forests is consistent with its oviposition behavior but discordant with the fact that it could feed in all the land covers found in the area including villages indoors [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].
