<p id="Par30">The dominant species 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> was present in almost all breeding sites and land covers sampled. The plasticity of this species observed in our study is consistent with larval survey data in the area and elsewhere [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] but also with its oviposition behavior in Ivory Coast [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. This greater plasticity of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> suggests that its eggs are more resistant to desiccation and lower humidity than other species [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].
