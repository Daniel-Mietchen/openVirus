<p id="Par29">Our study also showed that fruit husks were not involved in vectors maintenance during the dry season. This result was not expected because between 89 and 100% of these fruit husks were positives for larvae or pupae of 8 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> species in a previous study in the same area [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The particular physical, chemical and biological conditions of water contained in these fruit husks could alter the potential of resistance of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs to desiccation resulting in the destruction of all eggs that did not hatch during rainy season. Further investigations on conditions that prevent fruit husks from being used as 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs maintenance sites could ultimately lead to the identification of substances or organisms that can be used for eggs destruction, and thus, in controlling major arboviruses of medical importance such as Zika, dengue, yellow fever and chikungunya. Maintenance rates were quite low compared to larval presence rates during the rainy season for all vectors listed, indicating an impact of the climatic conditions on the survival of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Indeed, even if 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> eggs are resistant to desiccation, their viability decreases with time. The low relative humidity of the air also reduces survival time of 
 <italic>Aede</italic>s eggs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. In addition, the proportion of resistant eggs during a given period is greater in shaded sites than those exposed to the sun [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].
