  <p>Expression levels of host genes in A549 cells verified using RT-qPCR. To validate the expression results observed in NGS, we selected a group of differentially expressed genes and performed qPCR. Overall, consistent with RNA-Seq analysis, the expression fold change of genes in innate immune response (
   <bold>a</bold>–
   <bold>f</bold>): RIG-I, TLR3, IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, IFNβ, and TNFα; viral resistance (
   <bold>g</bold>,
   <bold>h</bold>): ISG15 and Mx1; autophagy (
   <bold>i</bold>): AMBRA1; and apoptosis (
   <bold>j</bold>): CASP10 were highly expressed in later time points. (
   <bold>k</bold>) We measured the correlation of expression level change (log
   <sub>2</sub>) between RNA-Seq and qPCR, and the result showed a high and significant correlation (Pearson’s 
   <italic>r</italic> = 0.85, 
   <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).
