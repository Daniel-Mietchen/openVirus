 <caption>
  <p>Validation of expression levels of IRF3, IFN-α and IFNα-7 in A549 cells infected by IBV. RNAs from IBV-infected A549 cells were analyzed for IRF3 (
   <bold>a</bold>), IFNα (
   <bold>b</bold>) and IFNα-7 (
   <bold>c</bold>) mRNA transcripts using RT-qPCR. Fold changes in transcript levels at the indicated time-point were calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method so that data were normalized to both the uninfected control and the housekeeping gene GAPDH. Values represent results from three independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed by Student’s 
   <italic>t</italic> test. NS, no significant difference; *, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05; **, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; ***, 
   <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.
