<p>The global burden of annual influenza epidemics involving IBV, coupled with the increasing strong links between IBV and fatal infections in humans [

 <xref rid="B22-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], calls for an urgent need for more basic and clinical investigations of IBV. Despite significant progress on the characterization of host responses to IAV infections in a range of in vitro cell cultures and in vivo animal models, the interplay between IBV infection and host cells especially human epithelial cells remains poorly understood. A high-resolution analysis of dynamic changes in cellular response following IBV infection is also not available. Of many different cellular response pathways, innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection. The innate immune response modulates multiple pathways to signaling viral infection, inducing inflammatory reactions, clearing virus, and presenting viral antigens to the host immune system. It also determines how and when the adaptive immune responses will be activated. Thus, a thorough investigation of the innate immune response to IBV infection will shed light on the pathogenicity of IBV and help understand the severity of influenza syndromes and mechanisms of IBV resistance and disease tolerance. Such studies will also further provide clues on how to interfere or prevent IBV infection in humans.
