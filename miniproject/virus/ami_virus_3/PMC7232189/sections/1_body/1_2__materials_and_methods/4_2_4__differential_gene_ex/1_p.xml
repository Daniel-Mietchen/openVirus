<p>DESeq was used to identify differentially expression human genes [
 <xref rid="B27-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Briefly, samples of 6, 12, and 24 hpi were compared to control samples (0 hpi) to determine whether the expression level of a gene was significantly up- or down-regulated at each time point. To control false discover rate (&lt;10%), we used 
 <italic>P</italic> value adjusted according to the Benjamini–Hochberg method to identify differentially expressed genes (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). To further remove potential false positives, we removed differentially expressed genes with the changes of expression levels less than ±2 fold.
