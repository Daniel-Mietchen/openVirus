<p>Influenza B/Brisbane/60/2008 virus was used in this study (a gift from Robin Donis at Influenza Division, Center of Disease Control and Prevention, USA). Cell lines acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) for this work included Human lung alveolar carcinoma epithelial cell line A549 (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CCL-185) cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CCL-34), and human embryonic kidney cells HEK293T (ATCC
 <sup>®</sup> CRL-3216). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s minimum essential medium (DMEM) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Laboratories Inc., Dartmouth, MA, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (100 U/mL). MDCK cells were used initially to propagate IBV in T75 tissue culture flasks. Briefly, MDCK cells were cultured to reach only 60% to 70% confluence at the time of infection. After infection, fresh DMEM with 0.5 μg/mL tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added for additional 3-day incubation at 37 °C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. The infected cell cultures were then frozen and thawed. The supernatant was spun at 500× 
 <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the cellular debris, which was followed by traditional viral titration experiments in MDCK cells according to the method of Reed and Muench [
