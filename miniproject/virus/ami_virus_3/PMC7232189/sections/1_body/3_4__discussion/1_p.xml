<p>The innate immune system is the first line of host defense against invading pathogens. Analysis of changes in this intrinsic antiviral pathway in response to IBV infection is critical to elucidate IBV-host interaction. In this study, we examined IBV infection induced response in human lung epithelial A549 cells, a well characterized cell system that responds to infection robustly and has been extensively used to investigate innate immune response of pathogens, including but not limited to Ebola virus [

Upon IBV infection, we observed that both type I and III IFN responses were activated over time, which appeared to be triggered by dsRNA signaling pathways including RIG-I and TLR-3, The activation of RIG-1 and IFN response during IBV infection observed here (
