<p>In summary, the host transcriptomic analysis presented here sheds lights on host biological systems that are affected by IBV infection. These studies shall provide novel insights into the intricate host-pathogen interaction following IBV infection of human lung epithelial cells, which can be further explored toward the elucidation of the mechanisms by which IBV remodels the epithelial environment to promote its own replication and spread in humans.</p>
