<p>Antigen processing and presentation pathway is important for initiation of adaptive cellular and humor immune response. It has been shown that RIG-I and TLR3 can activate MHC-I system, which recruits CD8+ T cell for killing infected cells [

 <xref rid="B36-viruses-12-00383" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which is required for antibody response. However, we did not observe expression of TLR7/8 in A549 cells, and consistently, not many genes in the MHC-II signaling pathway were up regulated (
