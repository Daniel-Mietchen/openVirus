<p>Previous studies demonstrated that influenza A virus infection is mainly detected by three classes of pattern recognition receptors: Toll-like receptors TLR3 (double-stranded RNA, dsRNA), TLR7 and TLR8 (single-stranded RNA, ssRNA), retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (5â€™-triphosphate RNA) and NOD-like receptor NOD-LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3). These receptors activate different downstream pathways for antiviral activities as described below. As early as 6 hpi following IBV infection, genes in the RIG-I like receptor signaling pathway and TLR3 signaling pathway were up-regulated, including DDX58 (or RIG-I), IFIH1 (or MAD5) and DHX58 (or LGP2), IL12A, IL8, IRF7, ISG15, TRIM25, and TLR3 (
