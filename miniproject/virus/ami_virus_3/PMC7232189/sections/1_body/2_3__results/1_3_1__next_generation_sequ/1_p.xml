<p>To investigate the host response to IBV infection, we infected human lung epithelial cells (A549) in duplicate with human IBV strain (Victoria lineage-B/Brisbane/60/2008) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1.0 [

The principle component analysis showed that the cellular transcriptome profiles of duplicates were highly similar but diverged between time points, suggesting that IBV infection affected gene expression profiles of the host, which had been reported in our previous work [
