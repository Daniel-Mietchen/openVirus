<p>Overall, the number of significantly regulated genes increased over time. For all three time points post infection, a total of 4365 genes was differentially regulated. There are more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes at each time point (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="viruses-12-00383-f001">Figure 1</xref>a). The up-regulated genes (399, 1143, and 2600 genes at 6, 12, and 24 hpi respectively) are dominated by pathways and processes of the innate immune response to virus infection, followed by responses to small molecules, antigen processing and presentation, regulation of T and B cell activation, metabolism, and apoptosis (

 <xref ref-type="app" rid="app1-viruses-12-00383">Table S1</xref>). However, most of the down-regulated genes (17, 375, and 1538 genes at 6, 12, and 24 hpi respectively) are involved in mitosis and cell proliferation (
