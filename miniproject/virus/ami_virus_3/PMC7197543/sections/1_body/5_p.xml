<p>Risk matrices, with orthogonal banding of estimates of job exposure and of ‘odds’ of individual susceptibility, will be essential for the mitigation of risk (e.g. an anaesthetist or intensive care nurse with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma or diabetes might be in the highest risk ‘cell’). The author and others are working on relevant guidance. Such risk matrices would be used to guide iterations of policy on PPE (e.g. should it be necessary to provide military/industrial full face/powered respirators to those at highest risk). As validated antibody tests become available, and critically once vaccines are produced, such matrices will guide effective and efficient use of resource.</p>
