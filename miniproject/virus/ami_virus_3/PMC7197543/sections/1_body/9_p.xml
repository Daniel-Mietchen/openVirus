<p>As the data from MCCD citing Covid-19 ramp up at the Office for National Statistics (ONS), preliminary age and gender adjusted determinations of odds ratios can be undertaken comparing the distribution of Covid-19 deaths by occupational category to census data (e.g. in relation to NHS staff, care workers, prison officers, transport staff, etc.). In due course more sophisticated occupational epidemiology studies, such as using the UK Biobank cohort, would determine the risk of SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion, and Covid-19 morbidity and mortality in relation to exposure. The exposure variables would include occupation, extent of protection and if possible estimates of the very important metric of ‘viral dose’ from contending with patients shedding a high viral load [
