<p>Lessons must be learnt at several levels—not least from suspected adverse exposures of individuals at work. With at least 100 tragic deaths of UK health workers at the time of writing [
 <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] it is a matter of grave concern that Mr Hancock, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, when questioned at a House of Commons Select Committee sitting apparently only considered employers as investigators of the deaths of NHS staff [
 <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For reasons which should be obvious, exemplary British law has long provided for such matters to be investigated independently by other bodies. The HSE has confirmed that unintended occupational exposures to the SARS-CoV-2 (‘dangerous occurrences’), and Covid-19 disease or deaths with ‘reasonable evidence that it was caused by exposure at work’ are reportable (statutorily by employers) as a ‘dangerous occurrence’ or as a ‘disease’ under the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) [
 <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Such reports are then followed by HSE investigation, with the prospect of further action. Arguably an even higher degree of forensic scrutiny, and one which is held in public, can be expected from the coroners (or analogous officers such as the ‘Procurator Fiscal’ in Scotland). Doctors have a legal duty to notify a senior coroner of a death if ‘the registered medical practitioner suspects that the person’s death was due to … disease attributable to any employment held by the person’ [
 <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. As the statutory instrument makes clear, the obligation to notify the coroner is triggered by a mere suspicion on behalf of the notifying doctor. If the coroner deems that an inquest is necessary relevant witnesses can be summoned to testify. The coroner is entitled to make ‘Reports on Action to Prevent Future Deaths’ which may compel any addressees such as the HSE to respond. These legal provisions are designed to protect other workers. Therefore it is disappointing to note that NHS Covid-19 guidance makes no mention of RIDDOR responsibilities. Moreover the statement (3c) [
 <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that ‘Where an attending medical practitioner cannot complete an MCCD (Medical Certificate of Cause of Death), the death should only be notified to the coroner if there is no other medical practitioner who can complete the MCCD’ might lead readers to conclude that no other obligation exists besides the MCCD.
