<p>The UK Government’s response to the pandemic has been severely criticized because it did not follow through on the World Health Organization (WHO) exhortation to ‘test, test, test’ and it soon gave up on long-standing public health tenets of isolation, quarantine and determined contact tracing [

 <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] have had occupational health as well as public health consequences. Thus, National Health Service (NHS) staff who either had Covid-19 symptoms or were contacts have been denied RT–PCR swab tests for viral RNA with many NHS occupational health services (OHS) limited in their access to tests [

 <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. There are worrying reports of new or continuing swab positivity for SARS-CoV-2 RNA even after post-symptomatic quarantine, as well as of poor or inconsistent sensitivity of the swab tests [
 <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. These factors lead to a significant risk of health care-associated infection and of horizontal transmission among staff. A wide-ranging policy including an increase in widespread, repeated and reliable tests will be needed not only in the hospital front lines, but in primary and social care and other sectors which might be at risk of collapse while sustaining the fabric of our society [
