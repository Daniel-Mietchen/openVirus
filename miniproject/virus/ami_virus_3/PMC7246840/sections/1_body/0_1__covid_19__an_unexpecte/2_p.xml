<p>At the date of 23 April, there were about 2,700,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 (probably an under-estimated count, due to the high proportion of asymptomatic patients that are not tested) and almost 190,000 deaths recorded worldwide. The majority of diagnoses were made both in Europe (213,000 in Spain, 190,000 in Italy, 150,000 in Germany, 140,000 in United Kingdom, and 120,000 in France) and in North America (870,000 in USA and 42,000 in Canada). In Asia, Iran (87,000) and Turkey (100,000) had more infections than China (83,850), the country where the pandemic started and was subsequently well contained in the province of Wuhan. Surprisingly, the Indian sub-continent recorded only 23,000 cases, and a minor number of cases were diagnoses in South America (50,000 in Brazil, 21,000 in Per√π, and 10,000 in Chile), Africa (27,000) and Oceania (6600 in Australia and 1100 in New Zeland) [
