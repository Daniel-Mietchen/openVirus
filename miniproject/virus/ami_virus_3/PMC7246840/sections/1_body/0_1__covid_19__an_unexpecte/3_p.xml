<p>The Italian population is less than 20% of that of the United States, but the number of deaths recorded in Italy (25,500) are up to 50% of those reported in the U.S. (50,000). These epidemiological figures are mainly due to the rapid spreading of COVID-19 in Lombardy and Northern Italian regions of the Po Valley (Padana Plain), an area characterized by constant high concentrations of particulate matter (PM
 <sub>10</sub> and PM
 <sub>2.5</sub>), already recognized as one of the most polluted zones in Europe [

Lombardy accounts for 56% of the overall COVID-19 confirmed cases, 45% of hospital admissions and 55% of total deaths, followed by Emilia Romagna (15% of cases and 13% of deaths), Piedmont (12% of cases and 8% of deaths), and Veneto (11% of cases and 5% of deaths) [
