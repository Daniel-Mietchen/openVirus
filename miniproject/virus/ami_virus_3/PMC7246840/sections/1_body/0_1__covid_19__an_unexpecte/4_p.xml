<p>The Italian Society of Environmental Medicine (SIMA) has been the first to hypothesize—by releasing a specific Position Paper on 16 March—a possible link between the high mortality rates observed in Northern Italy due to COVID-19 and the PM concentrations [

 <sub>10</sub> exceedances in 110 Italian Provinces (number of days exceeding the PM10 law limit of 50 µg/m
 <sup>3</sup>) and the spreading of the COVID-19 infection before the shutdown decided by the Government [

 <sub>10</sub> exceedances was much more frequent in Lombardy and in cities located in the Po valley than those observed in Rome and Southern Italy, where the diffusion and lethality of the virus was significantly lower when compared to those of Northern regions [

These first observations suggest that particulate matter could be regarded—if not as a “carrier” or a “boosting factor”—at least as an indicator of the severity of COVID-19 infection in terms of diffusion and health outcomes observed in Northern Italy. At the same time, it must be pointed out that long term exposure to high levels of particulate matter may chronically impair human health and possibly influence the clinical course of infections acquired by already debilitated individuals, especially in most vulnerable age groups [
