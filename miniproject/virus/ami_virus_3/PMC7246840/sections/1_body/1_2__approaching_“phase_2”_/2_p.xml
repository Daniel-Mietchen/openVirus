<p>The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on the particulate matter of Bergamo, which is not far from Milan and represents the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, seems to confirm (at least in case of atmospheric stability and high PM concentrations, as it usually occurs in Northern Italy) that the virus can create clusters with the particles and be carried and detected on PM10 [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-02986" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The presence of SARS-COV-2 RNA on PM10 of outdoor air samples in any city of the world could represent a potential early indicator of COVID-19 diffusion. Searching for viral genomes on particulate matter could therefore be explored among the possible strategies for adopting all the necessary preventive measures before future epidemics start.
