<p>In Italy, lethality rates showed a remarkable increase in the oldest age groups, reaching 40% in men aged &gt;80 years old (20% in women), and 30% in males between 70 and 79 years old (16% in females). People aged 60–69 still present a lethality rate as high as 12% in men and 5.6% in women, accounting for 15% of infections and 11% of deaths. Elderly people &gt;80 years old represent 22% of positive cases and 50% of the deaths, while patients aged 70–79 account for additional 16% of infections and 30% of deaths [

These figures, along with the very high ageing index which characterizes Italy (174 elderly people aged &gt;65 years old every 100 children aged 0–14) can raise questions about the baseline frailty of the population who has experienced the diffusion of SARS-COV-2 in such a rapid way, possibly explaining the high lethality rates observed. Actually, it could be proposed that air pollution could influence the COVID-19 outbreak progression in a direct way or also indirectly, by enhancing the host susceptibility to viral infection and independently increasing the baseline risk of cardiovascular events or complications, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and other conditions that are known to increase the severity of viral infections.
