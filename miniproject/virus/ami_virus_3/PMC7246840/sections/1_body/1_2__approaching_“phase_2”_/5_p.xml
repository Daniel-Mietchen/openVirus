<p>On the other hand, COVID-19 has clearly shown its potential to become a hospital infection, at least in Europe and U.S. (whose healthcare systems are usually centralized at hospital level), with 10% of infected people being healthcare workers, and a huge proportion of cases and deaths possibly related to infections acquired in hospital setting or nursing homes [

Indeed, the possibility of contagion from asymptomatic people and the epidemics disseminating within cruise ships has already demonstrated that the virus spreads very quickly in indoor environments, with this issue representing one of the most remarkable challenges during the re-opening of social activities (i.e., restaurants, offices, bars, pubs, etc.) [

At the present, many research groups are working on COVID-19 clinical features and on the diffusion of SARS-COV-2 in outdoor or indoor air (especially in hospital settings) as well as in water/wastewater. There is the rationale for carrying out experimental studies at European and international level, specifically aimed at confirming the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 as already demonstrated in Bergamo area [

An additional relevant step would consist of investigating the potential virulence of SARS-COV-2 present on particulate matter in order to verify (under prescribed condition of safety) if the virus can remain vital and infectious for a defined time on outdoor particulate matter as well as on droplet nuclei exhaled by infected people in indoor environments [
