<p>The SARS-CoV-2 differs from the previous SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses. Although the early clinical manifestations are similar, SARS presented a higher virulence, reaching a mortality rate during the 2002 epidemic of about 9.5% [

 <xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. At the time of this writing, SARS-CoV-2 appears to be more contagious than these other two viruses with over 30â€‰000 cases in a 2-month period; however, the mortality rate has not exceeded 2%, targeting mainly the elderly and the fragile.
