<p>We followed guidelines for the conduct of rapid reviews.
 <xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> One of the authors, who was a research librarian (CD), searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO from inception to late March 2020. No language restrictions were applied. The search terms are described in the supplementary file. Three of the authors (LM, IH, and NW), working in pairs, independently screened records, abstracts, and full text articles. Two authors extracted data (LM and NW). When consensus was lacking, a third reviewer was consulted (SK). The reference lists of selected retrieved papers were screened to identify additional studies that met inclusion criteria. To locate the most recent papers on covid-19, we also searched medRxiv, an online archive and distribution server, for complete but unpublished manuscripts (preprints) in the medical and health sciences.
