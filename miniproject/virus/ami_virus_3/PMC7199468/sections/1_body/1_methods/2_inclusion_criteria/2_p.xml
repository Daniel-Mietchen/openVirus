 <xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> This covered the three broad areas of selection of the study groups in terms of case definition, representativeness, and source of controls; comparability of the groups, such as the use of matching or multivariate techniques; and measurement of exposure and outcomes in a valid and reliable way. The version for cross sectional studies has eight items and the one for longitudinal designs has 11, with a score of 7 and above an indicator of study quality. The qualitative version has 10 items.
