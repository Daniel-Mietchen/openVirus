<p>When data were available for three or more studies, we used RevMan and Win-Pepi programs to combine the data in a meta-analysis.
 <xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> As we could not definitely exclude variation between studies, we used a random effects model for all the analyses and an I
 <sup>2</sup> statistic estimate of 50% or more as an indicator of possible heterogeneity. When there were 10 or more studies for any outcome, we tested for publication bias with funnel plot asymmetry; low P values suggesting publication bias. Finally, we undertook a sensitivity analysis of the effect of restricting analyses to studies with a Joanna Briggs Institute score of 7 or higher, or of excluding preprint studies that had not undergone peer review.
