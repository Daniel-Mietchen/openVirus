<p>One (uncontrolled) study evaluated the effect of a SARS prevention programme in Taiwanâ€™s largest hospital for the treatment of the disease.
 <xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> This incorporated many of the mentioned recommendations and consisted of intensive in-service training covering basic knowledge of protection and patient care, the removal and disinfection of P100 masks, the procedures for entering isolation wards, and hospital control of SARS infection. Shifts were limited to eight hours to avoid fatigue and the hospital had comprehensive PPE, including scrub suits, isolating dresses, surgical caps, sterilised gloves, foot wraps, N95 masks, surgical masks, P100 masks, and safety glasses. Both patients and staff had access to a multidisciplinary mental health team. Ratings of depression and anxiety showed statistically significant improvements in the two to four weeks after introduction of the interventions.
