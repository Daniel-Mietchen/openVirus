 <xref rid="ref43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref> Support from colleagues, sufficient time off, adequate protective equipment, stringent infection control, and patient improvement were common to both settings. A study of staff caring for patients with MERS found that adequate hospital resources were associated with reduced burnout, as was support from the family, and this was reflected in a study of SARS, where organisational support, adequate resources, and time in quarantine predicted psychological outcomes.
