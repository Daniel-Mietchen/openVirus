<p>In two of the four outcomes it was possible to test for publication bias with funnel plots: psychological distress as a dichotomous variable and acute or post-traumatic stress as a continuous variable. Egger’s regression asymmetry test was non-significant for psychological distress (1.18, 90% confidence interval 0.33 to 2.03; P=0.09) indicating the possible absence of publication bias. Similar results were found for Egger’s regression asymmetry test in the case of acute or post-traumatic stress (2.07, 90% confidence interval 0.23 to 3.91; P=0.15)</p>
