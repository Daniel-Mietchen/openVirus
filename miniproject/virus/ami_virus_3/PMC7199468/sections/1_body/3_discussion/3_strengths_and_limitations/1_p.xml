<p>Strengths of this study are consideration of a range of emerging viral illnesses worldwide, including early experience with covid-19, and a search that included low and middle income countries that are at equivalent potential risk and where solutions from North America or East Asia might be less applicable. We combined the relevant data in a meta-analysis, and collected data on the primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention of psychological morbidity in healthcare workers. Our findings on the psychological effects on clinicians are the same as those in an earlier systematic review without a meta-analysis, which was restricted to the SARS outbreak in Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and mainland China.
