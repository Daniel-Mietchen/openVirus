<p>Care of both the patients with covid-19 and their healthcare workers extends beyond their immediate needs to also tackling the discrimination and stigma that was identified in many of the studies. WHO has produced guidance for opinion makers and the media on how to describe the outbreak. For example, the illness should be described by its official name (covid-19), which was deliberately chosen to avoid stigmatisation, rather than by reference to specific locations or ethnicity.
 <xref rid="ref72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref> WHO also recommends highlighting the effectiveness of preventive measures rather than focusing on individual behaviour and presumed responsibility for having or spreading covid-19. In addition, featuring people who have recovered, or healthcare workers who supported them through recovery, can emphasise that most people recover from covid-19.
