<p>Coronavirus S protein is a large multifunctional class I viral transmembrane protein, whose size varies from 1,160 amino acids in Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) in poultry to 1,400 amino acids in Feline Coronavirus (FCoV) (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). It is a trimer located on the virion surface, giving the virion a crown-like appearance. As for its function, it mediates the entry of the infectious virion particles into the cells by making attachments between virion particles and host cell membranes through interaction with various host cellular receptors (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). S1 functions as the receptor-binding domain (RBD) while S2 acts as a membrane fusion subunit. The S1 domain can be further divided into two subdomains, named the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD). Both of these subdomains act as the receptor-binding domains, interacting efficiently with various host receptors (
