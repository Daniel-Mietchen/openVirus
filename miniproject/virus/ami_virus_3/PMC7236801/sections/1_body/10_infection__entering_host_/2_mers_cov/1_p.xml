<p>MERS-CoV has been reported as being able to infect and kill not only alveolar epithelial cells but also T cells (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). MERS-CoV enters host cells by binding to a DPP4 receptor expressed in the kidney and other organs (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>), and uses proteases of the host to enter lung cells. Furin activates the S protein on the viral envelope, mediating the membrane fusion and virus entry into host cells (
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV can overcome the host's natural immune response, produce high virus titers, and induce cytokine imbalance (
