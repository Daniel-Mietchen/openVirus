<p>As for the susceptibility of different population groups to SARS-CoV-2, Chen et al. (
 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>) showed that the expression of ACE2 in Asians was similar to that in other races, and was also not related to sex. Surprisingly, ACE2 was shown to be significantly upregulated after virus infection, including SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). According to the public data analysis, the level of ACE2 expression in adipose tissue was higher than that in lung tissue, which was indicative of the possibility that adipose tissue was also a potential target of SARS-CoV-2 (
