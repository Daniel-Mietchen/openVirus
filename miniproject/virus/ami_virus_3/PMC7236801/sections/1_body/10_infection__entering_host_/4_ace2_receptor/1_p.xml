<p>Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an essential component of the renin-angiotensin system (

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>). Xu et al. (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>) drafted the currently available world's largest human kidney cell atlas with 42,589 cells and identified 19 clusters through unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. ACE2 and TMPRSS genes were significantly co-expressed in podocytes and proximal convoluted tubules as potential host cells targeted by SARS-CoV-2. Comparative analysis showed that ACE2 expression in kidney cells was no less than that in the lung, esophagus, small intestine, and colon, suggesting that the kidney may be an important target organ for SARS-CoV-2.
