<p>The immune response mechanism triggered by MERS-CoV has still not been fully studied. It is known that the S protein of MERS-CoV can upregulate the levels of the repressors of the TLR signaling pathways, such as of IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK-M) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARY). IRAK-M and PPARY negatively regulate IRF7, which normally induces the expression of IFN-alpha and IFN-beta (
