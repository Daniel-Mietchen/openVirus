<p>As for humoral immunity, antibody response to MERS-CoV is typically detected on the second and third week after the onset of infection. But the longevity of the antibodies seemed to be correlated to the severity of disease. In patients who had pneumonia caused by MERS-CoV, the antibodies were still detectable 13 months after infection (
