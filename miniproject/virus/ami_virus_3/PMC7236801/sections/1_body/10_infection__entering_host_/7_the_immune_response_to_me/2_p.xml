<p>Comparatively less is known about the fate of T cells in MERS-CoV infection and little information is known about the recognized epitopes (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Similar to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV-specific CD8+ T cells are also important for clearing the virus (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Though both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infects monocyte-macrophages, DCs, and activated T cells, only MERS-CoV was able to replicate in the infected immune cells, which consequently resulted in aberrant induction of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and DCs (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>) and of both extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway in T cells (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Such active replication of MERS-CoV in these immune cells may underlie the comparatively higher fatality rate of MERS disease.
