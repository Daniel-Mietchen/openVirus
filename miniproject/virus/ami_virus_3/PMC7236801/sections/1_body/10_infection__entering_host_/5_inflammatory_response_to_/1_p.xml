<p>Human coronaviruses can be divided into two groups by their pathogenicity. Whereas, low pathogenic coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1) cause mild cold-like respiratory illness, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause immunopathological events that result in fatal pneumonia. The invasion of such coronaviruses is associated with severe immune responses, which may eventually lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The innate immune system constitutes the primary line of defense against the invading viruses. The pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), represented by the viral RNA or dsRNA formed during viral replication, are recognized by intracellular sensors such as RIG-I and MDA5. After recognition, the downstream signaling cascade results in activation of NF-ÎºB and IRF3 transcriptional activity (
