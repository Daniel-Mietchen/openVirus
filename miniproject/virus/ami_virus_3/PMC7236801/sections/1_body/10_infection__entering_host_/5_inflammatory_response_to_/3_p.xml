<p>As part of the adaptive immunity, T cells also play important roles in the primary defense line against coronaviruses. There are many T cell epitopes identified to induce an IFN-Î³-specific T cell response or cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) response. Studies have found that epitopes in the S protein (

 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>) and the N protein of coronaviruses (
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>) can induce antibody responses in both mice models or patients. IgM and IgG, produced by B lymphocytes, are formed after the infection of coronaviruses (

 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The induction of IgM is an early and transient response to neoantigens, which is later replaced by the induction of IgG to play the role as the predominant and long-term antibody. IgG is characterized by a longer half-life and lower molecular weight, which gives it the ability to provide long-lasting protection and effective tissue penetration (
