<p>SARS-CoV-2 is mainly considered to infect respiratory epithelial cells, but a recent study confirmed that it can also infect T lymphocytes (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), spleens, and lymph nodes (
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). There are already some solid studies that confirm that ACE2 serves as the receptor for the entry of SARS-CoV-2. Analysis of the receptor binding motif (RBM), a portion of the receptor binding domain (RBD) that makes contact with ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>), revealed that most amino acid residues essential for ACE2 binding by SARS-CoV were conserved in SARS-CoV-2. Hoffmann et al. blocked ACE2 in Vero cells and found that both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection was dramatically inhibited, and that serine protease TMPRSS2 played an important role in SARS-CoV-2's infection (
