<p>As for adaptive immunity, it is known that the low levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are related to the mortality of SARS-CoV-2 patients (

 <xref rid="B105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>). The up-regulation of apoptosis and autophagy in PBMC of SARS-CoV-2 patients (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>), SARS-CoV-2 may cause lymphocytopenia through inducing T-cell apoptosis or autophagic cell death. It was supported by a recent report showing that SARS-CoV-2 could infect T cells through receptor-dependent or S protein-mediated membrane fusion (
