<p>As for the antibody response, it was reported that in 23 patients with COVID-19, the viral load peaked during the first week and then began to fall. Both IgG and IgM antibodies which targeted the nucleoprotein and the surface spike receptor began to rise around 10 days after symptom onset, and the seroconversion of most patients happened within the first 3 weeks (
