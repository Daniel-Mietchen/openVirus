<p>Secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), which is mostly triggered by virus infection in adults, is a condition in which the body makes too many activated immune cells (macrophages and lymphocytes) (

The cytokine profile of sHLH is associated with the severity of COVID-19, which is characterized by increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, GCSF, IP10 (CXCL10), MCF1 (CCL2), MIP1A (CCL3), and TNF-Î± (

The current explanation for the sHLH phenomenon is that the body has experienced a cytokine storm caused by excessive immunity. However, the details of immune and inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 infection are still under scrutiny.
