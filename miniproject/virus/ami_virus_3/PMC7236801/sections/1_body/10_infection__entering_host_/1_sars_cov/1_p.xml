<p>Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV enters cells through endocytosis and membrane fusion, and its host receptor is ACE2 (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). SARS-CoV enters into target cells and can be inhibited by polyanionic compounds, suggesting that the SARS-CoV envelope protein may be positively charged. At the same time, SARS-CoV needs to be in the acidified endosome to produce effective infection, indicating that its effect is pH-dependent (
