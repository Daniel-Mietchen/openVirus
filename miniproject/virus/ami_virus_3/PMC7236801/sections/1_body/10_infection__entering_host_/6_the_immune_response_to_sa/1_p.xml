<p>The combined induction of antibodies and virus-specific T cells provides optimal protective immunity. Following the infection, a strong humoral immune response with a high titer of neutralization antibodies targeting the SARS-CoV S protein that show a protective effect are found in the serum of most patients. In addition, CD4+ T cells targeting N protein and HLA-A2 restricted CD8+ T cells targeting S protein were observed in SARS patients (
 <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>–
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). However, the dramatic loss of CD4+ T cells (in ~90–100% of patients) and CD8+ T cells (in ~80–90% of patients) was observed in the acute phase of SARS patients (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). The delayed adaptive immune response resulted in prolonged virus clearance and correlated with the severity of the SARS disease (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). One possible reason for the decreased number of T cells is that after infecting alveolar epithelial cells, SARS-CoV encodes multiple structural and non-structural proteins that antagonize innate IFN response (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>–
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>). The delayed IFN response orchestrates infiltration of pathogenic inflammatory monocyte-macrophages (IMMs) and elevation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). IMM-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as type I INF (
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>), may sensitize T cells to undergo apoptosis through Bim (
 <xref rid="B81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>) or Bcl-xL (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>)-mediated intrinsic pathway by E protein, thus consequently impeding the viral clearance (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Depletion of IMMs or neutralization of pro-inflammatory cytokines was shown to protect mice from lethal SARS-CoV infection (
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>). Another possible explanation of the reduction of virus-specific T cells is the alteration in antigen presenting cell (APC) function and impaired dendritic cell (DC) migration, resulting in the reduced priming of T Cells (
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). This mechanism was supported by animal studies using SARS-CoV-MA15, the mouse-adapted strain of SARS-CoV. Inefficient activation of respiratory DCs by SARS-CoV-MA15 attributed to poor virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells responses (
 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Moreover, the age-dependent reduction in the magnitude of T cell response may also explain the higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV with advanced age (
 <xref rid="B85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>). Consistently, depletion of CD4+ T cells delayed SARS-CoV (Urbani strain) clearance and enhanced pneumonitis (
 <xref rid="B86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>). In contrast, transfer of SARS-CoV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells resulted in rapid virus clearance and amelioration of the disease (
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>). Mechanistically, the pattern recognition receptors such as MyD88 (
 <xref rid="B88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>) and TRIF (
 <xref rid="B89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>) are required for protection against SARS-CoV infection.
