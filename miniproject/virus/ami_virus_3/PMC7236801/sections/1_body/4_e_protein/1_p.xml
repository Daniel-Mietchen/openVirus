<p>The E protein is the smallest structural protein (~8â€“12 kDa) within the virion. It plays a multifunctional role in the pathogenesis, assembly, and release of the virus. The virulence of the virus is also related to the E protein (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The E proteins from different coronaviruses are highly diverse in their amino acid sequences but are characterized by a common structure (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). There are three domains in the E protein: short hydrophilic amino-terminal domain, large hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and C terminal domain (
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). The deletion of the E protein-encoding gene results in slower amplification of the virus, but the protein does not seem to be essential for the replication of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Besides its role in assembly and release of the virus, the E protein still has other functions, for instance, the ion channel activity. Compared to SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 (2019-nCoV) E protein reveals a similar amino acid constitution without any substitution (
