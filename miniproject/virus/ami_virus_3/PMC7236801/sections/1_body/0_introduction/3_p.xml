<p>Therefore, in this review, we discuss three coronaviruses, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS CoV-2, from an immunological point of view. We describe their structure and protein composition, mechanisms of entering host cells, and mechanisms to evade innate immune responses. Comparing their hosts, invading mechanisms, and inflammatory responses will help us understand more about coronaviruses, aid in solving the global SARS-CoV-2 epidemic happening now, and find out possible effective treatments to deal with the public health crises caused by coronaviruses in the future.</p>
