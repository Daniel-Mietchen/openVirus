<p>Coronaviruses have a long history of infecting humans. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 are the prevalent human coronaviruses, which are estimated to have been circulating in the human population for centuries (

 <italic>Betacoronavirus</italic> genus were zoonotically transferred to humans from other mammalian species in the past two decades and caused major epidemics with high mortality rates. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), caused by SARS-CoV, started in Guangdong province of China in 2002 and affected 8,096 people worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths (10% mortality rate) (

Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) caused by MERS-CoV started in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and affected 2,506 people, causing 862 deaths worldwide with a 35% mortality rate (

In December 2019, a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, caused an outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan city in China, which quickly spread throughout the world and grew into a global pandemic affecting hundreds of thousands of people as of March 2020. Notably, although SARS-CoV-2 is characterized by higher contagiousness in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, it causes a much lower mortality rate (2.3% from the epidemic in China in Jan.-Feb, 2020) (
