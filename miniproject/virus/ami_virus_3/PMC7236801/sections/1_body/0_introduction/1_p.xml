<p>Coronaviruses belong to the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family of the subfamily 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic>. The viruses of this family have a broad range of animal hosts, and zoonotic transfer between species is common. Within the 
 <italic>Coronavirinae</italic> subfamily, there are four genera: 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Deltacoronavirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses, whose RNA is covered by the solar corona-shaped envelope, from which they acquired their name. They are characterized by having the largest genome among all RNA viruses with an average size of 30 kb (
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Two-thirds of the coronaviral genome encodes non-structural proteins responsible for the virus replication, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, proteases, and helicase. The 3â€² end of the genome encodes four main structural proteins of the coronavirus particles, which are the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins (
