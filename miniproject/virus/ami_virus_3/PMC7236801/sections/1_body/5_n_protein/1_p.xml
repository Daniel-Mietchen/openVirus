<p>The N protein is the only structural protein present in the nucleocapsid. It is composed of three highly conserved and separate domains: an N-terminal domain (NTD), RNA-binding domain or a linker region (LKR), and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). The NTD binds to the 3â€² end of the viral RNA and is highly divergent from virus to virus (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). The LKR region [also called SR (Serine and Arginine) domain] is charged because of its serine and arginine-rich sequence (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). It has been reported to interact directly with RNA 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and play a part in cell signaling (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). The N protein has two RNA substrates that have already been identified, the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) and the genomic packaging signal (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). In addition, it can also act as a viral suppressor of RNA silencing in mammalian cells (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). N protein is also heavily phosphorylated (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), so that it can change its conformation to enhance the affinity for viral vs. non-viral RNA. N protein also binds nsp3 (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) and the M protein (
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). These proteins may interact to help tether the viral genome packaging.
