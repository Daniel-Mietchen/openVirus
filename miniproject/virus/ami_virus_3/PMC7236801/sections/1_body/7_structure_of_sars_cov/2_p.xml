<p>The SARS-CoV genome contains a total of 11 ORFs and encodes 23 mature proteins (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Among them, two major ORFs (ORF1a and ORF1b) account for about two-thirds of the genome size and encode two important polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab. Polyproteins are proteolytically cleaved to produce non-structural proteins, the most important of which are RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and ATPase helicase. Only several nucleotides are different among different viruses (
