<p>SARS-CoV virus particles are spherical with an average diameter of 78 nm. The virus contains a helical nucleocapsid, surrounded by an envelope (
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), covered with rod-shaped long envelope particles of about 20 nm in length, with typical coronal features. The structure of SARS-CoV is similar to that of other coronaviruses. The gene sequence is 5′ end, replicase [rep], spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], nucleocapsid [N], 3′ end. There are short untranslated regions at both ends. The sequences of the other five non-structural proteins may be distributed between ORF S and N (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>).
