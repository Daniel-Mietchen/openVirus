<p>As was demonstrated by cryoelectron tomography and cryoelectron microscopy, coronavirus virions are of spherical shape with diameters of approximately 65–125 nm (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). The club-shaped spikes on the surface of the virion are the most prominent feature of coronaviruses. These spikes confer them a solar corona-like appearance from which the name “coronavirus” is derived. The nucleocapsids are helically symmetrical and are packed by the envelope of the virion (
