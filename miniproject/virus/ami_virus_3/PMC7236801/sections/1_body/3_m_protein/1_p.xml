<p>The M protein is the most abundant structural protein of the coronavirus virion. It is a small (~25–30 kDa) protein with three transmembrane domains that is responsible for maintaining the shape of the virion (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). The amino acid sequences of the M protein are diverse in different coronaviruses, however, the structural similarity is maintained overall (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). It has a short N-terminal glycosylated domain outside the virion and a much larger C-terminal domain inside the virion that extends 6–8 nm into the viral particle (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). Most M proteins are co-translationally inserted into the ER membrane without a signal sequence. The viral scaffold is maintained by interactions between M proteins. Recent studies suggest that the M protein exists as a dimer in the virion, and may adopt two different conformations allowing it to promote membrane curvature, as well as bind to the nucleocapsid (
