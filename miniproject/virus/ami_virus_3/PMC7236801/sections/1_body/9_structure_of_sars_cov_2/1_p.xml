<p>Basically, the structure of SARS-CoV-2 shares all the typical characteristics with other coronaviruses. Several recent studies considering the structure of SARS-CoV-2 were all focused on the S protein. Wrapp et al. (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) reported a structure at 3.5 Ã… resolution of SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Yan et al. (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) reported the complex structure of B
 <sup>0</sup>AT1, an amino acid transporter protein, with human host cell binding receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which provided important insights into the molecular basis of coronavirus infection. Lan et al. (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) reported a crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 S protein's receptor binding domain (RBD) region bound to ACE2. The viral architecture of SARS-CoV-2 with post-fusion spike was observed by Cyro-EM, which showed the image of disassociated spikes (
