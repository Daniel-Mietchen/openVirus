<p>Following the invasion of a pathogen, the host triggers a serious response from the immune system. SARS-CoV does not directly lyse and kill T cells, but indirectly induces T cell apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>). MERS-CoV, which is a more severe and aggressive virus, directly targets T cells and undergoes lytic replication, thus directly causing their death (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Therefore, MERS-CoV has a direct impact on the immune system. SARS-CoV-2 is reported to infect T lymphocytes (
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>), but we still don't know how this affects the immune system in particular (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). A severe reduction of immune cells was observed in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, but whether this phenomenon is directly caused by the virus or indirectly caused by dysregulated cytokine production by immune cells has yet to be determined (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Direct viral effects require treatment strategies that target viral replication. Indirect viral effects through dysregulated cytokine production by residential macrophages/dendritic cells or antigen presentation by APCs can now be treated by immune therapy approaches. Understanding the behavior of SARS-CoV-2 in the host cells of the human body and its effect on the immune system may provide important tips for combating the disease.
