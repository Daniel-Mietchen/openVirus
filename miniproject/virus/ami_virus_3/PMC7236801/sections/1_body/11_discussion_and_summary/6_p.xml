<p>To deepen the research on coronavirus, humans must learn enough lessons from this pandemic. In the wave of globalization and scientific and technological progress, infectious diseases have become more prone to spreading, which has made it harder for humans to deal with them. How to understand the infectious biomolecular mechanism and immune pathological environment in the future will be a more important proposition for us than ever before. According to China's response to the epidemic, it did not take long to identify what the pathogen was, but the imperfect public health emergency system is the main reason for the spread of the epidemic. Therefore, in addition to developing drugs, vaccines, and updating treatment plans, scholars should also call on governments to strengthen the construction and improvement of social public health emergency systems to prevent similar pandemics from happening again.</p>
