<p>SARS-CoV is mainly replicated in respiratory epithelial cells, though it can also infect a variety of immune cells such as monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and activated T cells (

 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). MERS-CoV, in contrast, not only infects the immune cells and epithelial cells, but is also able to replicate in the former cells and lyse them, which may be one of the reasons for the high mortality of MERS (
