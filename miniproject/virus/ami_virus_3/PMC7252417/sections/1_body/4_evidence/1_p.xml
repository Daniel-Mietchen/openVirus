<p id="Par14">As previously reported, the presence of ACE2 in adult Leydig cells in the testis was proven long ago, with a putative steroidogenesis regulatory role [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], but its precise function, as well as the role for the entire renin-angiotensin system in testicular function regulation, has been investigated with respect to gender differences but not yet fully elucidated [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. It is possible that viral binding to this metalloprotease might compromise testicular function and the consequent inflammation might lead to epididymo-orchitis with long lasting testicular damage and spermatogenesis impairment. While such occurrence has not yet been described for SARS-CoV-2, it was instead reported for a similar coronavirus SARS-CoV [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Alternatively, the orchitis could be the result of a vasculitis as COVID-19 has been associated with abnormalities in coagulation and the segmental vascularization of the testis could account for an orchitis-like syndrome. These observations indicate that it is imperative to monitor recovered COVID-19 men reproductive functions for any abnormalities that might impair future fertility. Accordingly, limited evidence documented that when compared to age-matched healthy men with normal fertility, COVID-19 patients showed a significant increase in serum LH level and a dramatic decrease in serum testosterone (T) to luteinizing hormone (LH) ratio, supporting the presence of a subclinical or compensated hypogonadism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The latter is supported by the epidemiological observation of a higher incidence of complications in older diabetic men that have hypogonadism [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Finally, a rise in LH levels is known to increase testicular vascularization [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Another hot topic would be the safety and potential consequences of utilization of reproductive cells from SARS-CoV-2 positive subjects: the lack of knowledge currently prevents us from performing a thorough and exhaustive risk analysis regarding possible adverse events in the short or long term. The possible presence of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reported and there are only a few case reports investigating this issue. Recently, Paoli et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] reported the absence of viral RNA in the semen fluid of a man with history of COVID-19. This was also confirmed by Pan et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] in a small cohort of Chinese subjects. The latest research letter from Li et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] drew attention for reporting 6 cases of positive SARS-CoV-2 semen samples in severe COVID-19 cases (about 16% of the tested subjects). However, several concerns were raised for methodological issues [
