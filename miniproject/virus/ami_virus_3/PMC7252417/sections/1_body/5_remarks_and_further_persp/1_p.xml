<p id="Par15">It is important to recognize that all available data on the specific effects of SARS-CoV-2 on testicular function are derived from clinical cases or case series, which represent a major limitation for the data analysis. Hence further studies are required to draw final conclusions. However, data derived from other SARS-CoV infections suggest that in patients recovered from COVID-19, especially for those in reproductive age, andrological and sexological consultation and gonadal function evaluation including semen examination should be suggested [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] can allow to speculate that SARS-CoV-2 clearance in seminal fluid overlaps with the clinical recovery or that the virus has never been present in the seminal fluid of the subject. The evaluation of the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in seminal samples is particularly important for semen cryopreservation, because viruses stored in liquid nitrogen retain their pathogenic properties [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. For this reason, studies in larger cohorts of currently infected subjects are warranted to confirm (or exclude) the presence of risks for male gametes that are destined either for cryopreservation in liquid nitrogen or for assisted reproduction techniques.
