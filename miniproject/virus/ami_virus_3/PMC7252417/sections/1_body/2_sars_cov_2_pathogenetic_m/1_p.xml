<p id="Par9">As previously reported, SARS-CoV-2 is a novel β-coronavirus sharing 80% sequence homology with the earlier SARS-CoV virus causing the SARS outbreak in 2003 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, SARS-CoV-2 presents distinct characteristics. Its 3D structure shows a more compact configuration, which increases its binding affinity for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) that serves as a viral receptor [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, SARS-Cov-2 presents a polybasic (furin) cleavage site increasing the virus’ ability to internalize into cells. All these features can explain, at least partially, the strongest clinical impact when compared to the other coronavirus [
