<p id="Par10">ACE2 is highly expressed in a wide range of human tissues including testis [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In particular, within the testis ACE2 expression has been documented on seminiferous ducts cells, as well as on spermatogonia, Leydig and Sertoli cells confirming the potential risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the reproductive system [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In addition, furin domains are expressed in the epididymis of various domestic mammals including humans, further supporting the risk of genitalia localization of SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. If SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for cell entry, the transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for S protein is priming such internalization resulting in an enhanced isolation of SARS-CoV-2 in cells expressing this type II transmembrane serine protease [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. TMPRSS2 is highly expressed in the prostate epithelial cells, including the apical plasma membrane of the prostate luminal cells. Its expression is regulated by androgens (apparently an androgen responsive elements is the only known promoter enhancer of this gene) and is also released into semen as a component of prostasomes, organelle-like vesicles that may facilitate sperm function and enhance male reproduction [
