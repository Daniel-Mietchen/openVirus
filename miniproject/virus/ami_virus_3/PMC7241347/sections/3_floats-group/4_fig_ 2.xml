  <p>Tridimensional structure of envelope proteins from coronavirus representatives and epitope mapping. Epitope sequences are coloured as follow: blue: LIVNSVLLFLAFVVFLLVTLAILTALRLCAY; cyan: LLVTLAILTALRLCA; green: LTALRLCAY; olive green: CNIVNVSLVKPSFYV; red: SLVKPSFYV; orange: LVKPSFYVYSRVKNL; yellow: LVKPSFYVY; magenta: KPSFYVYSRVKNLNS. A) Homopentameric form of the envelope protein from SARS-CoV (PDB database identifier 5 × 29). Selected epitopes sequences are mapped in each monomer. B) Monomer for of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein coloured according to the selected epitopes. C) Predicted 3D structure (monomeric form) of the bovine CoV, dog CoV and human enteric CoV. Selected epitopes sequences are mapped in the monomer. D) Consensus structural mapping of the selected epitopes by overlaying the monomeric form of the E proteins coloured as in the panels B and C.</p>
