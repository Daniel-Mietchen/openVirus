<p id="p0025">Along with Spike (S) and Nucleocapsid (NC) protein, Envelope (E) is a structural protein involved in diverse phases of the virus infection. E protein of SARS-CoV-2 is a 75 amino acids long protein existing in both monomeric and homo-pentameric form. Approximately 20 copies of the protein have been found in the viral particle and previous mutagenesis-based studies demonstrated its pivotal role in the onset and development of the viral infection [
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Specifically, E protein lacking virions are associated with incapability of infecting host cell or very low viral titers [
 <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Other functions have been predicted for E protein within the infected cells. E protein localizes within the secretory pathways at the interspace between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Here, the arrangement of the hydrophobic transmembrane domain into a homo-pentamer has been predicted to form an ion channel (

Besides its multifunctional properties, E protein is also highly immunogenic attracting the attention of diverse research groups that target this protein for the development of antigen-based studies including those aimed at developing immunodiagnostic tools and prophylactic oriented studies [

 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To date, immunoinformatic is among the most promising approaches to survey the antigenic determinants of novel and unknown molecules. It is based on the use of computational resources (e.g. software, algorithms and statistic models) to investigate protein sequences and predict the antigenicity of molecule portions (epitope prediction). It is based on different parameters such as the physicochemical properties of the amino acids, their spatial localization, and the complementarity and affinity with models of the immune response effectors such as the B-cells and T-cells [
