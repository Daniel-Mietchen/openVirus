<p id="p0100">In the present study, we employed an immunoinformatic approach to investigate the major SARS-CoV-2 E protein distribution among the pool of animals most frequently interacting with the human population all over the world. Coronavirus members were already known as the responsible agents of past epidemics in both humans and animals [

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. This aspect has also been taken into account while choosing the viral specimens to be included in this survey. Being all selected coronavirus taxonomically related, we believe that some immunological features can be shared between these viruses with tropism for different animals and, at the same, time this can be exploited for obtaining a partial cross-protection against the circulating SARS-CoV-2. Such thought might be partially supported by previous studies reporting early detection of IgG in the very first phase of the infection along with the heterogeneous clinical manifestation of the SARS-CoV-2 infections, other than preventing epitopes-exposed subjects from the severe form of COVID-19 [

On the other hand, the “shared” immunostimulant domains can be used for the design of a more accurate and efficient immunodiagnostic tool, enabling a detailed tracking of the infected patients and the fair discrimination of the SARS-CoV-2 infected ones from the others that came in contact with the antigens carried by other coronaviruses. This might be of great help, especially among the population of individuals diagnosed as infected but without clinical signs.
