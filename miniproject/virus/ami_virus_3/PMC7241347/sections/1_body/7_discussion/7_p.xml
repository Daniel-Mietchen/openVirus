<p id="p0120">To conclude, we strongly believe that synergistic cooperation elucidating multiple aspects of the virus biology and pathology enables the success in a fast and effective control of the SARS-CoV-2 infections. The thorough survey of the SARS-CoV-2 epitopes and their mapping in the diverse geographical areas and among the major animal species involved in animalâ€“human interactions represents a valuable approach. Providing such knowledge is indeed of pivotal importance for fighting the current COVID-19 pandemic through innovative solutions such as the personalized medicine and the design of specific community-based prophylactic measures.</p>
