<p id="p0115">Moreover, the structural mapping of the predicted epitopes sequences highlighted the adjacent mapping of some of the SARS-CoV-2 E domains suggesting the most immunogenic portion of the E protein in both its monomeric and homopentameric forms. In addition, structural mapping of some of the investigated epitopes in the human enteric CoV, bovine CoV and canine CoV demonstrated a consensus in both the location of the sequence along the aminoacidic chain and their 3D folding. Such an evidence suggests, once again, their potential immunogenicity and possible implication for the design of immunodiagnostic tools and/or the plan of prophylactic-oriented investigations, even though showing reduced sequence homology with the SARS-CoV-2 E counterpart.</p>
