<p id="p0105">Structural proteins are among the most antigenic components of the coronaviruses. Previous studies performed by this group already highlighted the diffusion of the Spike and Nucleocapsid protein of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 among the taxonomically related coronaviruses [
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Envelope protein is featured by multiple functions in the diverse phases of the infection. Although present in a relatively low number of copies per viral particle, it has shown important immunostimulant activity. Multiple sequence alignment of the E protein sequences reveals bat coronavirus and pangolin coronaviruses as the most similar viral specimens to SARS-CoV-2. Although very high, SARS-CoV has scored a minor sequence homology than the E protein of the virus with tropism for bat and pangolin. This is also true when analyzing the diffusion of the predicted SARS-CoV-2 sequence epitopes and the relative matching scores. Although all predicted sequence epitopes have been matched in the SARS-CoV E protein sequence, some of the epitopes capable of binding the class II MHC molecules scored a lower identity percentage when compared with bat and pangolin coronavirus, supporting our hypothesis that investigating synanthropic and/or domestic animals might be a promising strategy that provides interesting research suggestions.
