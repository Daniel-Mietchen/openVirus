<p id="p0110">Envelope proteins of the human enteric coronavirus along with the bovine coronavirus and canine respiratory coronavirus have scored a low percentage of identity at the level of the whole E protein sequences. Nevertheless, also these viral specimens are sharing a number of SARS-CoV-2 epitopes in their E protein amino acid chain. Also, the structural comparison performed between the newly released high-definition 3D structure of the SARS-CoV E-protein and the predicted 3D model of the E protein of human enteric-, bovine- and canine-coronaviruses confirms the maintaining of the conformational structure of the overall monomer regardless the amino acid sequence of each protein.</p>
