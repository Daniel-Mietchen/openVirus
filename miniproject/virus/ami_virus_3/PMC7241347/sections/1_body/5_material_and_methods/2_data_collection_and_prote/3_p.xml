<p id="p0040">Protein sequences as of 
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">TableÂ 1</xref> were analyzed via the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool for protein sequences (pBLAST) [
 <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. This tool implements BLOSUM62 algorithm to compare protein sequences and calculates the statistical significance of matches as means of e-values. Multiple sequence alignment was performed by keeping default settings. Only statistically significant matches were considered for drawing the similarity tree. Fast minimum evolution algorithm was employed to produce a tree from given distances between sequences by setting a maximum fraction of mismatch between pairs of sequences of 0.75.
