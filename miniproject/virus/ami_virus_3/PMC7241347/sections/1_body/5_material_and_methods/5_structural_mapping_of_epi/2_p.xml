<p id="p0055">The protein epitopes of SARS-CoV E protein were mapped on the available PDB structure (5 × 29) whereas predicted PDB files were used for the proteins whose high definition crystallographic structure was not available. PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.4 (Schrödinger, LLC.) was employed for the structural mapping of the selected epitopes over the coronavirus E protein structures.</p>
