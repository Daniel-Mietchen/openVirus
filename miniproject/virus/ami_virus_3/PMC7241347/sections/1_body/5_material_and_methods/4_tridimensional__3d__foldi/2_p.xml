<p id="p0050">Tridimensional structure of the SARS-CoV E protein has been recently elucidated and made available in the RCSB PDB database under the identifier 5 × 29 [
 <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Acknowledged the high similarity occurring among the E protein sequences of SARS-CoV, SARS CoV-2, bat CoV and pangolin CoV we considered 5 × 29 as unique reference structure for the E proteins of these viral specimens. The E proteins of the other coronaviruses whose 3D structure has not yet been elucidated were computationally predicted by using homology modeling tool [
 <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Predicted models were exported as PDB files to be employed in the next step of structural mapping of the epitopes.
