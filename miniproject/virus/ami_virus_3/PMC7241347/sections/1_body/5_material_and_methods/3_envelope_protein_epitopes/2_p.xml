<p id="p0045">SARS-CoV-2 E protein epitopes prediction was performed by means of the IEDB prediction tools. Both B-cell and T-cell predictions were performed. Prediction of linear B-cell epitopes was performed through BepiPred algorithm. It predicts the location of linear B-cell epitopes using a combination of a hidden Markov model and a propensity scale method [

T-cell epitopes were predicted by using the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm. The list of epitopes binding to MHC class I and class II molecules was obtained via MHC–I Binding and MHC–II Binding tools respectively. In line with a very recent study [
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], epitopes sequences with a minimal length of 10 amino acids were selected and immunogenic domains binding to MHC I and II molecules scoring respectively a median inhibitory concentration (IC50) equal or less than 100 and 1000, were employed for the sequence alignment against the E protein sequence of the taxonomically related coronaviruses with tropism for other synanthropic and/or domestic animals. The BLAST-based alignment was performed using BLOSUM62 algorithm to compare protein sequences and calculate the statistical significance of matches as means of e-values. Only the best hits were considered for each virus and hits with alignment length minor or equal to 4 amino acids were manually removed.
