<p id="p0015">The circulating SARS-CoV-2 is a novel strain of the coronavirus genus. Coronaviruses are spherical viruses of large dimension with a positive-sense unsegmented RNA genome of approximately 30 kilobases. Coronavirus specimens are already known in veterinary medicine since capable of infecting an extended spectrum of both wild (e.g. bat, palm civet) and domestic animals (e.g. bovine) including the companion ones (e.g. dogs). The infection is commonly manifested as respiratory illness along with other mild signs such as enteritis [

Unfortunately, no vaccines or therapy were made available from the previous outbreaks and the recent warningly predictions justify the overwhelming effort being performed worldwide under diverse perspectives.
