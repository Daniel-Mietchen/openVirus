<p id="p0080">Mapping of the epitopes between the selected coronavirus with tropism for synanthropic and/or domestic animals reveal that all the predicted epitopes are “shared” between the closest relatives in taxonomic terms, complete identity. This consideration includes the SARS-CoV that, although showing matches for all the predicted epitope sequences, scored a minor percentage of similarity in a handful of epitopes predicted to be capable of class II MHC binding.</p>
