<p id="p0085">Nevertheless, some epitopes are also shared between the circulating SARS-CoV-2 and the causal agent of a previous outbreak such as the MERS-CoV and the related camel-CoV and dromedaries-CoV. Despite the relatively weak similarity observed at the level of the whole E protein sequence (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), bovine CoV, canine CoV, human enteric CoV and avian-CoV are also sharing interesting epitope sequences, as supported by the epitope length and the relative e-value (
 <xref rid="tbl3" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). In addition, structure prediction of the E protein of the human enteric coronavirus, bovine coronavirus and dog coronavirus resulted in a very similar 3D structure among each other and, in turn, with the high-definition 3D structure of SARS-CoV-2 E protein suggesting that the low sequence similarity might not hinder the antigenic properties of the E protein from diverse coronaviruses (
