<p id="p0090">Structural mapping of selected epitopes highlights a plurality of epitopes adjacent each other, forming a conformational immunogenic domain of the protein that might exist either in its monomeric form or associate as a homo-pentamer (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Interestingly, structural mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 E epitopes in the 3D structure of the bovine CoV, dog CoV and the human enteric CoV highlights conserved structure and mapping position of some immunogenic domains, suggesting a potential interest for conferring partial cross-protection against the circulating SARS-CoV-2.
