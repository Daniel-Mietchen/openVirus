<p id="p0070">Once assessed the overall sequence similarity among the diverse coronavirus representatives, the major immunogenic domains of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein were predicted by following an immunoinformatic approach. Prediction of the B-cell epitopes failed to predict epitopes sequence that meets the quality filter prefixed (score threshold of 0.350 and minimum 10 amino acid length). A further prediction employing a lower score threshold (0.250) predicted one epitope sequence, but it was subsequently discarded since redundant with the prediction of T-cell epitopes.</p>
