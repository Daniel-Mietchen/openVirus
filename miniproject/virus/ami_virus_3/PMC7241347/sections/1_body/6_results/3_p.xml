<p id="p0065">Depiction of the virus specimens by means of the distance matrix calculated from the E protein sequences comparison is in line with the observation summarized in 
 <xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">TableÂ 2</xref>. Indeed, the bat coronavirus RaTG13, pangolin coronavirus and the circulating SARS-CoV-2 are grouped in the same clade, supporting the occurrence of a very strong similarity. These are followed by the SARS-CoV, whose E protein sequence enables a close classification between the past and the current epidemic causal agents. A separate clade is reserved to the E protein of the MERS-CoV and the coronaviruses with tropism for camels and dromedaries. These are displayed as the sister group of another clade including the human enteric coronavirus along with the coronaviruses with tropism for dog and bovine; whilst avian coronavirus is placed apart since featured by a lower degree of similarity with respect to SARS-CoV-2 E protein sequence,
