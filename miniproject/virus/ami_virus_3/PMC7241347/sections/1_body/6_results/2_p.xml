<p id="p0060">The full protein sequence of the E proteins from the selected coronavirus specimens was employed to assess the virus similarity on the basis of the conserved protein sequences. The multiple sequence alignment of the entire E protein sequences reveals that SARS-CoV-2 E protein is 100% identical to the bat coronavirus and the pangolin coronavirus counterparts as also supported by the nucleotide-based investigations performed at the level of the whole genome sequence. Slightly less than 95% of sequence similarity is observed between the query sequence (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> SARS-CoV-2 E protein) and the E protein sequence of SARS-CoV, the causal agent of the previous outbreak. Minor sequence similarity was observed in regard to the E protein of the causal agent of MERS, MERS-CoV, and the (
 <italic>Camelus bactrianus</italic>) and dromedaries (
 <italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic>) coronavirus, scoring an amino acid sequence similarity below 40%. Finally, the whole sequence similarity between the SARS-CoV-2 E protein and the homologues from the human enteric coronavirus as well as those with tropism for the bovine and dogs is slightly below 31%. Even minor is the sequence similarity observed with the chicken coronavirus, where 20% of the overall protein sequence is shared with SARS-CoV-2,
