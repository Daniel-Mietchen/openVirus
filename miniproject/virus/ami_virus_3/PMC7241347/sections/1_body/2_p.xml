<p id="p0020">According to the One-Health concept, extending the target of studies to the major animals the humans are most frequently interacting with would provide valuable information for a better comprehension of the virus biology and pathogenetic mechanisms. This is of pivotal importance for the adequate design of effective diagnostic tools and control measures. Elucidating immunological properties of the circulating SARS-CoV-2 along with the tracking of the epitopes distribution among coronaviruses with tropism for the most common synanthropic animals might provide a clear depiction of the co-shared epitopes. Such approach might, from one side, suggest the occurrence of partial protection arising from the human-animal interrelation while, on the other hand, it might provide a valuable list of epitope candidates to be used for the differential diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Investigation of the major viral structural proteins (

Our previous studies investigated epitope diffusion of the Spike and Nucleocapsid SARS-CoV-2 proteins, highlighting some epitopes sequences as conserved among a restricted group of taxonomically-related specimens while other epitopes sequences were shared between coronavirus with tropism for the animalâ€™s human are continuously interacting with [
