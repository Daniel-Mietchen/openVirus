<p id="p0030">In the present study, we employed the immunoinformatic approach to evaluate the antigenicity potential of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein. Major epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 E protein are predicted and resulting sequences compared with the homologue immunological domains of taxonomically related coronaviruses with tropism for the synanthropic animal species that are most commonly interacting with the human beings population all over the world. The epitope mapping and comparison among the cross-species presented in the present study might provide a keystone for assessing the potential occurrence of partial protection arising from the human-animal interaction besides their importance for the development of immunodiagnostic tools and/or the design further efficient prophylactic-oriented studies.</p>
