<p>Yes, Americans have higher BMI than those from China—the prevalence of obesity in the US was 42.4% in 2017‐2018—but Americans also have a high burden of class III obesity, with 9.2% of the population with BMI &gt; 40 kg/m

Persons with severe obesity who become ill and require intensive care (5% of infections) present challenges in patient management—more bariatric hospital beds, more challenging intubations, more difficult to obtain an imaging diagnosis (there are weight limits on imaging machines), more difficult to position and transport by nursing staff. And like pregnant patients in ICUs, they may not do well when prone. Special beds and positioning/transport equipment are available mostly in specialized bariatric surgery units but may not be widely available elsewhere in hospitals. We are likely to see a collision of the two public health epidemics in the US with obesity and COVID‐19 interacting to further strain our health system.
