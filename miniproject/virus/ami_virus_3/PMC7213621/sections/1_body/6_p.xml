<p>Using valuable epidemiological data from the SARS outbreak, we systematically evaluated and compared the characteristics of the 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV outbreaks. The two outbreaks share many similarities, and the ongoing 2019-nCoV outbreak situation seems to be a repetition of the SARS-CoV outbreak situation. Fortunately, the Chinese government is implementing many efficient measures, including shutting down public transportation in Wuhan and other cities, reducing population migration, and encouraging personal protection such as face mask-wearing. With these measures, case numbers could be reduced significantly. However, due to the lack of awareness regarding the human-to-human transmission capability of 2019-nCoV in the early stages, there is a possibility that super-spreaders exist.

 </sup> These super-spreaders may be distributed in different places and are difficult to track. This represents the most important problem for this outbreak.
