<p>The incidence and development process of the SARS outbreak has valuable implications for the 2019-nCoV outbreak. After discovering the earliest case identified on November 16, 2002, the incidence remained low until January 2, 2003. The peak of the incidence was observed between January 3 and February 4, 2003, and the number of cases accounted for 54.7% of the total cases (Wikipedia). According to the case numbers and the developmental characteristics, the SARS epidemic can be roughly divided into four stages: stage 1, from November 16, 2002 to January 31, 2003; stage 2, from February 1 to March 2, 2003; stage 3, from March 3 to April 2; and stage 4, after April 4 [Supplementary Figure 2D]. Coincidentally, the SARS outbreak duration also coincided with the Chinese spring festival. Each year, the Chinese government launches a 40-day spring festival transport support system, and during this period, billions of people migrate around China. In 2003, the spring festival transport period started from January 17 to February 25, 2003 and coincided with the peak incidence [Supplementary Figure 2D, purple box]. The spring festival travel period in 2020 started from January 10 to February 18, which coincided with the rapid increase in 2019-nCoV cases between January 10 and 22, 2020 [Supplementary Figure 2D, red box]. Both outbreaks happened in the winter, when the two provinces have similar climate patterns suitable for virus survival and spread. Temperature and weather are risk factors of natural infectious diseases, and those in Wuhan and Guangzhou seem to be suitable for disease transmission. Given previous trends, this is unlikely to be the incidence peak of this new virus outbreak. The daily counts of 2019-nCoV cases were higher than the daily counts of SARS cases during its peak in 2003, implying a possibly higher number of cumulative cases.

 </sup> We analyzed the transportation between different and large cities. High frequency transportation is mainly distributed among megacities [Supplementary Figure 2E]. The highest ranked cities include Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shanghai.

 </sup> Wuhan has a population of 10 million and is also a major hub of the spring festival transportation network.

 </sup> The predicted number of passengers traveling during the 2020 spring festival is 3.11 billion, 1.7 times the total number in 2003 (1.82 billion) [Supplementary Figure 2F]. This large-scale migration has brought favorable conditions for disease spread that are difficult to control.
