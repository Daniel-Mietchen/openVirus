<p>As for the 2019-nCoV outbreak, the first patient with unexplained pneumonia was identified on December 12, 2019. On December 31, 2019, 27 cases of viral pneumonia were officially announced; seven of these patients were in a severe condition.

 </sup> Respiratory infectious diseases, including influenza, SARS, and Middle East respiratory syndrome, were screened for and excluded.

 </sup> On January 3, 2020, only 1 week later, a new type of coronavirus was discovered. The identification of pathogenic nucleic acids was completed on January 10,

 </sup> and on January 12, the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus the “2019 novel coronavirus.” It took less than 10 days from the first official announcement to the identification of the pathogen. In contrast to that of SARS-CoV, the discovery of human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV came relatively late. On December 31, 2019, 27 confirmed pneumonia cases were officially reported, no human-to-human transmission case was identified.

 </sup> On January 19, 2020, a cluster of cases, including 15 healthcare workers, were confirmed to have been infected via patients, confirming that 2019-nCoV also has human-to-human transmission capability.

 </sup> Based on these results, it was concluded that 2019-nCoV also has high human-to-human transmission capability. It remains unclear whether earlier cases also showed this capability, and if so, how many victims were not identified. The close contacts of these unidentified patients might act as new infection sources and could become super-spreaders.
