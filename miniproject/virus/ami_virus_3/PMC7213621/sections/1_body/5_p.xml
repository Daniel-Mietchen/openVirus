<p>Because we are now in the early stage of the outbreak, we must be prepared for subsequent larger-scale outbreaks and predict the scale of the outbreak. Since 2019-nCoV is highly similar to SARS-CoV, some important characteristics of SARS-CoV could be used for this prediction. By combining the reported daily counts of 2019-nCoV cases and data from the SARS outbreak, we constructed a logistic model and predicted the incidence of 2019-nCoV over time. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, a total of 8000 cases were reported.

 </sup> With this data and the present situation, we predict that the cumulative number of 2019-nCoV cases might be 60,000 to 70,000. Logistic models were fitted to these data, and the cumulative and daily counts of 2019-nCoV cases were predicted. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1B and 1C, we also calculated the time needed to reach the peak of incidence under different scenarios. Setting the upper limit of cumulative incidence (K) to 50,000, 60,000, or 70,000, the end date of incidences will be in 56 days (March 6, 2020), 60 days (March 10, 2020), or 62 days (March 12, 2020), respectively.
