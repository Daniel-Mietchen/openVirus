<p id="Par4">The COVID-19 is neither the first pandemic nor is going to be the last one. During the second, third, sixth and fourteenth centuries, when not much science has developed, about 250 million lives were lost due to plague. In the sixteenth century, the smallpox virus killed over 50 million people across the world. More recently, plague in the eighteenth century and the Spanish flu in the early twentieth century also took a heavy toll close to 200 million lives. The twenty-first century witnessed its first pandemic caused by an influenza virus (H1N1 swine flu) that claimed 1,00,000â€“4,00,000 lives in the first year itself. The deaths due to COVID-19 could have been higher if there were no public health measures in place. Such pandemics will certainly continue in the years to come. Nevertheless, to contain such infectious agents and spread of disease, public health measures on the one hand and the availability of drugs/vaccines on the other, will minimize the casualties. The SARS-CoV-2, apparently evolved from a virus infecting the bats, is threatening to take lives of a large number of humans irrespective of the region, religion, ethnicity, wealth, gender, age (although people over the age of 65 and comorbid patients are likely to be more vulnerable), and such other considerations. There has been a larger question for the experts working with pathogens on how, when and why the pathogens evolve.</p>
