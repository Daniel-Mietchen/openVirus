<p id="Par20">We have witnessed several catastrophes and global crises, and the way governments handled them with inputs from the science and technology sectors. In the absence of tested chemical/antibiotic treatments, interventions by the governments have focused on contact tracing, quarantine, social distancing and related measures. An assumption that intensive public measures can eradicate the SARS-CoV-2 seems unlikely, as per the public health authorities. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 could circulate seasonally after the initial wave. Reliable mathematical models have projected the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV through the pandemic and post-pandemic periods. At least three major factors seem to be regulating the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, viz., degree of seasonal variation of transmission, the duration of immunity, and the degree of cross-immunity between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses (Kissler et al.

To mitigate the possibility of resurgences of COVID-19, the lessons learned during the first cycle of infection, especially on social distancing, need to be continued at least intermittently if not for prolonged periods. Failure to understand the transmission of COVID-19 and handle the first and the recurring cycles of disease, especially in a world that has been reduced to a ‘global village’ due to internationalization, will attract heavy penalties.
