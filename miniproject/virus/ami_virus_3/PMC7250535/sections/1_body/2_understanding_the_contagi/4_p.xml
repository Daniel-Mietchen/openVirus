<p id="Par10">The newly evolved SARS-CoV-2, traced to Wuhan in China, is behaving differently in different populations. The most recent analysis of the 3636 sequences (from 55 countries) of SARS-CoV-2, available at GISAID as on 6th April 2020, was carried out by the National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBG), India. The results indicated that at least ten types of the virus evolved from the ancestral Wuhan strain (O type) in the last 4 months. The A2a type that evolved towards the end of March 2020, probably replaced others and evolved as the dominant type. SARS-CoV-2 being a virus with single-stranded RNA as its genome, is less stable, particularly in the absence of a proof-reading mechanism during replication in the host tissue. It is not entirely clear whether the mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 or ‘some other’ factors are responsible for the virulence and rapid spread of COVID-19, as an adequate number of genomes from all parts of the world has not been analyzed sufficiently. Large scale analysis of the sequence information, with increased global efforts, will provide unique vaccine markers with specific target(s) and also helps in designing vaccines against different types of the COVID-19.</p>
