<p id="Par11">Sequence information of Indian strains of SARS-CoV-2 (scanty in the public domain), available now due to efforts by Indian scientists, requires a thorough analysis to understand the origin and similarity/uniqueness in comparison with the A, B and C variants. A mere change in a nucleotide (which can happen for different reasons) cannot be treated as mutation. If a stable change occurs in the nucleotide sequence and is passed on to the next generation, it is referred to as a mutation. Further, a mutation need not always drastically affect the virulence of the virus, unless the mutation has occurred in a most crucial portion of the genome. India has to analyze a few hundreds of sequences from the COVID-19 strains in different geographical locations and link to the suspected origin of infection from the patients across India to understand if any mutations were affecting the virulence. Once we trace the sources of undocumented COVID-19 infection, the evolutionary networks can help to prevent a recurrent spread of the disease.</p>
