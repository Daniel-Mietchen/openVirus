<p id="Par7">The more we understand the contagion, the easier it is to develop measures to prevent or control the spread of disease. Identification and sequencing of the agent responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak showed that it was a novel CoV. The new virus shared 88% and 79.5% sequence identity with two bat-derived SARS-like CoV and SARS-CoV, respectively (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020a</xref>). The coronaviral genome encodes four major structural proteins: the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein (Schoeman and Fielding 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>).Â The S protein facilitates the entry of CoV into the target cell. Detailed analysis of the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed that it was only 75% identical with the SARS-CoV S protein (Lu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2020</xref>; Zhou et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020a</xref>). On the other hand, the receptor-binding motif (RBM) analyses indicated that the amino acids playing a role in receptor binding in the RBM are conserved. Based on these observations, Wan et al. (
