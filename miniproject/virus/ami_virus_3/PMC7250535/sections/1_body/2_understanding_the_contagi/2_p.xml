<p id="Par8">The structural and genetic make-ups of the SARS-CoV-2 have been analyzed using different approaches in just 4Â months. It has about 30,000 ribonucleotides that constitute the single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of this CoV. A helical nucleocapsid protects the viral genome. It is covered by a spherical envelope embedded with the E, S, and M proteins (Schoeman and Fielding 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2019</xref>) that appears like a crown under the electron microscope. Global initiatives such as the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data (GISAID) enable curation and real-time sharing of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 across the globe to provide a better understanding of the disease and evolutionary network of the virus. Forster et al. (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2020</xref>) analyzed the genome of 160 SARS-CoV-2 sequences at GISAID as of 4th March 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 sequence has a 96% similarity with the bat coronavirus, as was known from an earlier study (Wu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2020</xref>). There are three central variants (A being the ancestral type, B, and C), distinguished by amino acid changes. Interestingly, the B type is most common in East Asia. In contrast, the A and C types are predominantly found outside East Asia (Europe and America), which points to an immunological or environmental resistance against B type outside East Asia.
