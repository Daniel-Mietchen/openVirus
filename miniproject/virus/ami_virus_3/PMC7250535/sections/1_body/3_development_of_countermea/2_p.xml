<p id="Par13">Developments in life sciences with the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA and subsequent technologies associated with the nucleic acid on the one hand and the availability of high-performance computing facility that can analyze several gigabytes of sequence information in a short time on the other, paved way to significantly reduce the time required for drug discovery or vaccine development. A century ago, in a similar pandemic, it took almost 20 years for the vaccine to be made available. The disease was managed by herd immunity in the absence of drugs and vaccines. Recently, the Ebola vaccine was developed in 5 years, and Zika vaccine was developed in less than 2 years. However, for COVID-19 the vaccine may be available in a record time of about 12 months more due to international collaboration, rather than competition. In the meanwhile, there would be a few promising drugs repurposed.</p>
