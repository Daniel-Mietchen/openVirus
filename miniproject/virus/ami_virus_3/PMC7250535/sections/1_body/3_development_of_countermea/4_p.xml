<p id="Par15">Experimental evidence indicates that the Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine (primarily used against tuberculosis disease) may have some non-specific effects on the immune system. However, neither these effects have been well characterized, nor were validated in clinical trials. There is not enough evidence that the BCG vaccine can provide immunity against the COVID-19 virus infection. Clinical trials addressing this question are underway. WHO has not recommended BCG vaccination to prevent COVID-19 as it awaits evidence through scientific evaluation.</p>
