<p id="Par17">Important proteins encoded by the virus could become the best drug targets. The main protease, one of the well-characterized drug targets in the case of coronaviruses, is essential for the processing of polyproteins translated from the viral RNA, along with the papain-like proteases (Anand et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2020a</xref>) obtained the X-ray crystal structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 main protease and its complex with an Î±-ketoamide inhibitor which was developed into an effective inhibitor of the main protease. The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor revealed the suitability of the compound by the inhalative route. The approach, by and large, has been the most rapid way to design a drug.
