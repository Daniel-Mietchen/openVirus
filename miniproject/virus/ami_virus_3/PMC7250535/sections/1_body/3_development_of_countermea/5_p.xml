<p id="Par16">To devise viable therapeutic strategies, it is essential to understand the biology of the virus—its detailed structure, the way it causes disease (pathogenesis), the way it infects people, and the way it progresses and, more importantly, the way it interacts with the host. The past experience suggests that understanding the key cellular factors used by an infectious agent for entry into the host can provide insights into disease transmission and also reveal therapeutic targets. The entry of coronaviruses, in general, into the cells depends on the binding of the viral S proteins to cellular receptors. The process of binding of the pathogen-derived molecules to the cellular receptors happens in a precise lock and key model. In the SARS-CoV-2, the process is initiated by the S protein priming by host cell proteases. Hoffmann et al. (

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2020a</xref>) and the cellular serine protease TMPRSS-2 for priming of the S protein. As expected, the clinically proven TMPRSS-2 inhibitor camostat mesylate could block the viral entry and might be a potential target for therapeutic intervention.
