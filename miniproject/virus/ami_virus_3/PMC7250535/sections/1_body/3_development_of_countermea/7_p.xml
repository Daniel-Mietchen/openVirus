<p id="Par18">Scientists are relentlessly working on the design and testing of antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 in animals. Immunodiagnostic and immunotherapeutic strategies are being tried out against COVID-19, with a handful of them reaching advanced stages of testing. SelectedÂ antimalarials and antivirals, which could interfere with the function of one or the other important proteins of the SARS-CoV-2, are being repurposed to find the most appropriate drugs to treat COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 can possibly be restricted by drugs previously used for other RNA viruses. Trials are currently underway with a combination of two antiretroviral drugs: lopinavir and ritonavir (used to treat HIV-AIDS). Other combinations with antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (the latter reported to be more potent in treating COVID-19 by Yao et al.

Apart from these, several potential therapeutic approaches have been reported for tackling COVID-19, including repurposed antiviral agents like remdesivir (drug against Ebola virus), favipiravir, EIDD-2801; corticosteroids; anticoagulants like heparin; human monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab, tocilizumab, and sarilumab; immunoenhancers like interferons, intravenous gamma globulin, natural killer (NK) cells, etc. (Zhang et al.
