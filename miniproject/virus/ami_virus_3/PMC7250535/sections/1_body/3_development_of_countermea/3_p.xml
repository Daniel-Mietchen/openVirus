<p id="Par14">Over 100 vaccine candidates against COVID-19 agent are at various stages of development. At least seven of them are in Phase 1 clinical trials. China, Germany and the USA are testing two vaccines each, and one vaccine from the UK is also under clinical trials. China is moving to Phase 2 clinical trials, at least for one vaccine. The vaccine being developed by Moderna Inc and backed by the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) could be the front runner. The vaccine being developed by Jenner Institute of the University of Oxford is aggressively pushing to make at least one million doses of vaccine available by September 2020. In India, the immunomodulatory Mycobacterium w (Mw) vaccine, developed initially to treat leprosy, is being repurposed as an adjunct to treat critically ill COVID-19 patients in clinical trials. It is possible that most of the international efforts may succeed in fight COVID-19 with an efficient vaccine by early 2021. These vaccines, however, necessarily need to prove safety and efficacy against COVID-19.</p>
