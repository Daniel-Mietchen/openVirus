<p id="Par12">For centuries, scientists have found solutions to several dreaded diseases caused by invisible microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, and viruses, which otherwise took heavy tolls. They were successful with the two major approaches, prevention or control, to save lives. Antibiotics or synthetic drugs were discovered to control, and vaccines were developed to prevent.
