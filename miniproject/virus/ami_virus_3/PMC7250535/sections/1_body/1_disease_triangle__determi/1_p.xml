<p id="Par5">The occurrence of a disease is dependent on three critical factors viz., pathogen, host and the environment, which pathologists define as the disease triangle, each one representing one of the three faces of the triangle. Intricate interactions and interplay between these three factors determine disease outcomes and implications on public health. The ability of a pathogen to cause the disease being primary, the degree of successful expression of the ability to cause disease plays a crucial role from the pathogen's side. Similarly, the susceptibility/resistance of the host plays a dominant role, while the predisposing factors (of the host) contribute to susceptibility. The often neglected third face of the triangle is the environment, in terms of how conducive it is to the host and the pathogen. If the pathogen has the ability to cause the disease, it may affect a few individuals. However, if its virulence is high, it has the power to kill several individualsâ€”should the environment enable its transmission. For the SARS-CoV-2 to play havoc, the virulence of the strain (the one causing disease in an area) is to be high, and the environment has to be conducive, besides the availability of a susceptible host (in terms of over-aged population or comorbid in the known cases). If the host is resistant or not susceptible to the SARS-CoV-2 strain under circulation, the epidemic will inevitably fade away. If the environment is not favourable for the development of the disease, the pathogen will meet the same fate as in the case of a resistant host. The relation between these three components of the disease triangle looks so simple, but determines the extent of damage due to a disease like COVID-19.</p>
