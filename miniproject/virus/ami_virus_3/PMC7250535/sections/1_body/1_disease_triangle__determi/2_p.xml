<p id="Par6">The mysterious new illness is widely reported to have variation and severity as the distinctive and perplexing features. Scientists hypothesized differently to explain the variation. While many may look at the variation in the virus as a reason, there is a strong reason to look at the host genetics as a significant factor for this variation and severity. Most of them are asymptomatic, while others suffer severe damage to the lungs, which could be fatal. Many more are in the middle. The dramatic difference in the response of the people to this virus has been a major question that bothers everyone around. In the disease triangle, the interaction between partners (host and pathogen) is always considered as the most crucial step in deciding the outcome and severity of the infection. The host genetic differences can either increase or decrease a person's risk of certain diseases. Knowledge of the response of the host genes could help the development of both preventive (vaccines) and curative (drugs) measures for several diseases, including COVID-19.</p>
