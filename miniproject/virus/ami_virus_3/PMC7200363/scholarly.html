Abstract</div> <p>The COVID-19 outbreak may profoundly impact population mental health because of exposure to substantial psychosocial stress. An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted. Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis. Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria. Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%. Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress. Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging. Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted. How to support adherence to physical distancing requirements and engagement with services in patients with existing psychosis requires careful consideration.</p> <p>Registration details: <a href="https://osf.io/29pm4">https://osf.io/29pm4</a>.</p> </div> <div class="kwd-group"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Introduction</div> <p id="p0005">The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in China in December 2019, and by March 2020 had spread across the globe. While the development of a vaccine continues, public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country (<a href="#bb0180">World Health Organization, 2020</a>). These include quarantine (self-isolation) of people potentially exposed to the virus, and social distancing (more accurately termed â€˜physical distancingâ€™) of the general population (<a href="#bb0180">World Health Organization, 2020</a>). While physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus (<a href="#bb0025">Center for Disease Control et al., 2003</a>), this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects, including fear, anxiety, and worry (<a href="#bb0020">Brooks et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bb0065">Gardner and Moallef, 2015</a>), in addition to the physical effects of decreased motor activity, changes to diet, and exposure to sunlight (<a href="#bb0105">Lippi et al., 2020</a>). Such impacts are likely to differ across pandemics and populations, for example, <a href="#bb0175">Wang et al. (2011)</a> reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of University students in China during the H1N1 flu outbreak. The incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted (<a href="#bb0020">Brooks et al., 2020</a>) and there has been media speculation around this issue, with some Governments actively recognising and funding mental health services to respond to this potential surge in mental ill-health (<a href="#bb0195">Zhou et al., 2020</a>). The implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex, however. Potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on, for example, a renewed sense of shared social purpose (<a href="#bb0055">Fransen et al., 2015</a>), such as, â€˜everyone is in this togetherâ€™, and â€˜we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare systemâ€™. There may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety, with the expectation to stay at home, reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work, for example.</p> <p id="p0010">Psychosis is one mental health condition that requires specific attention. For one, the association between influenza infection and psychosis has been reported since the Spanish Flu pandemic in the eighteenth century and subsequent acute â€œpsychoses of influenzaâ€� have been documented during multiple pandemics (<a href="#bb0090">KÄ™piÅ"ska et al., 2020</a>). A further point is that this population may be particularly at risk from the stress associated with physical distancing measures. While the use of mobile phones and technology continues to increase for people with psychosis, rates are still lower than in the general population (<a href="#bb0050">Firth et al., 2015</a>). This may mean that physical distancing and reduction in social connectedness has a substantial effect on this group of individuals as they do not compensate as much with other methods of communication.</p> <p id="p0015">Another impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have is on the nature and content of the psychotic pathology of people with psychosis or at risk of psychosis. Clinicians working in mental health services have given anecdotal reports of increased paranoia [content] around contamination from being in close contact with other people. The association between psychosis and a range of psychosocial factors, including stressful life events, has been extensively explored, suggesting it is an important risk factor for both the onset and exacerbation of symptoms (<a href="#bb0060">Fusar-Poli et al., 2017</a>).</p> <p id="p0020">The medium- and long-term social effects of COVID-19 may disproportionately impact people with psychosis or at risk of psychotic disorder. For example, social isolation, unemployment, homelessness, relationship breakdown (divorce/separation), domestic violence, and worsening physical health, may all particularly effect people with psychosis given their vulnerability to social determinants of health (<a href="#bb0010">Anglin et al., 2020</a>). Again, the direction of this impact is not known as there is the potential for pandemics to strengthen social inequities and thus impact associated risk factors. There is also the potential for an increase in the number of people with psychosis who suicide or attempt suicide, with some evidence of more suicides occurring after previous pandemics (<a href="#bb0030">Chan et al., 2006</a>). What may complicate the interaction between psychosis and COVID-19 further is that the treatment of COVID-19 may involve the use of high doses of steroids to modulate the inflammatory response (<a href="#bb0135">Russell et al., 2020</a>); steroids have been known to trigger psychotic symptoms (<a href="#bb0170">Wada et al., 2001</a>).</p> <p id="p0025">How the specific psychosocial factors associated with an epi- or pandemic affect people with psychosis, including their use of health services, is unlikely to be well understood by policymakers or clinicians who have not previously lived and worked through such an outbreak. There may be valuable lessons about the impact an epi- or pandemic can have on psychosis that can be learned from other virus outbreaks, including the recent SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and Ebola epidemics.</p> </div> <div class="whyisthisreviewneeded?" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Why is this review needed?</div> <p id="p0030">Social distancing and other public health interventions to combat the spread of COVID-19 may have immediate and longer-term effects on people with, or who are at risk of, psychosis. Statutory (health and social care) and non-government services that support and treat people with psychosis need guidance on how COVID-19 may impact on their services and the people that use them, and how they may respond accordingly. The World Health Organization (<a href="#bb0160">Tricco et al., 2017</a>) advocates that rapid reviews are essential in providing informative summaries of these issues in such circumstances. We, therefore, aimed to undertake a rapid review of research on the impact of epidemics and pandemics on people with psychosis and the mental health services they use. Our review aimed to address the following questions related to living in a community exposed to an epidemic or pandemic: </p><ul> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">1.</span><p id="p0035">Is there a change in the incident cases of psychosis/being identified as ultra-high-risk (<a href="#bb0190">Yung et al., 2004</a>) of psychosis?</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">2.</span><p id="p0040">Are changes reported in the form and content of psychotic symptoms (i.e., do people incorporate beliefs about the virus into their symptoms)?</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">3.</span><p id="p0045">Is there a change in demand for inpatient and community-based crisis services by people with psychosis?</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">4.</span><p id="p0050">Is there a deterioration in the physical health of people with psychosis?</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.</span><p id="p0055">Does the number of people with psychosis suiciding or attempting suicide change?</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">6.</span><p id="p0060">Is there an increase in the number of people with psychosis who experience social issues such as homelessness, unemployment, domestic violence, and loneliness?</p> </li> <li><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">7.</span><p id="p0065">How do people with psychosis experience the preventative measures put in place in pandemics (e.g. social distancing, increased handwashing)?</p> </li> </ul> <p /> </div> <div class="methods" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">3</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

Eligibility criteria</div> <p id="p0075">We included studies that reported primary research; included participants that had a psychotic disorder (e.g., first-episode psychosis, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) or were considered to be at high risk of psychosis; and had been exposed to an epidemic or pandemic (e.g., SARS, MERS). We excluded studies that tested the association between maternal influenza and adult schizophrenia, in part because this has been extensively reviewed previously (<a href="#bb0090">KÄ™piÅ"ska et al., 2020</a>).</p> <p id="p0080">We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science on 23 March 2020.

This tool facilitates the rating of the quality of each paper across six domains: selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection method, and withdrawals and dropouts. These component ratings are then used to make a global rating, with strong equating to â€œno weak ratingsâ€�, moderate to â€œone weak ratingâ€� and a global rating of weak if there are â€œtwo or more weak ratingsâ€�.</p> </div> <div class="amendments" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">3.5</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Amendments</div> <p id="p0130">Following our initial search, we made the following amendments to our study protocol. We excluded papers that related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic for two main reasons: the mode of transmission is different (i.e. it is not an airborne transmission), and psychosis related to HIV/AIDS is comparatively well understood and unlikely to be relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic (<a href="#bb0070">Gray et al., 2002</a>).

The characteristics of the included studies are shown in <a href="#t0005">Table 1</a> . Included studies were published between 2004 and 2020 and were undertaken across nine countries, mostly Hong Kong. Included studies were a mix of surveys (5), case reports (3), chart reviews (3), a service evaluation (1), and a cohort study (1). The epidemics/pandemics under investigation were SARS (6 studies), Ebola (1), MERS (1), the 2009â€"2010 H1N1 (swine) influenza pandemic (2), coronaviruses (1) and COVID-19 (2). </p><div class="fig" title="fig"> <div class="figure" title="figure"><a href="http://doi.org/"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Fig. 1</span></a></div>   <p>PRISMA flow diagram.</p>   </div> <div class="table-wrap_UNKNOWN" position="float" id="t0005"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">Table 1</span> <p>Characteristics of included studies.</p>  <div tag="alt-text">

Incident cases of psychosis (patients not infected with a virus)</div> <p id="p0140">One observational study (<a href="#bb0075">Hu et al., 2020</a>) and a single case report (<a href="#bb0200">Zulkifli et al., 2020</a>) examined incident cases of psychosis in people living in a geographical area where COVID-19 was prevalent. Hu reported a 25% increase - compared to previous years - in incident cases of schizophrenia in January 2020, which the authors attributed to the psychosocial stress and physical distancing measures associated with the COVID-19 outbreak (<a href="#bb0075">Hu et al., 2020</a>). The authors extracted data from 13,783 outpatients (of which 1210 presented for the first time) attending the Xuzhou Oriental People's (psychiatric) hospital in January 2020, the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors adjusted for a limited number of potential covariates - age, gender and place of residence - in their analysis. The absolute number of new cases of schizophrenia is comparatively small and may be explained by simple random variation. No data are reported in terms of the difference in presentation - other than that patients were seemingly older, with median age increased from 39 to 50. At the time of writing, these data were published on a Chinese open science platform, rather than a peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, of concern is the use of the diagnosis â€˜schizophreniaâ€™ when typically symptoms are required to be present for six months before this diagnosis to be reached.</p> <p id="p0145">We identified a single case report from Malaysia, of an acute episode of psychosis seemingly precipitated by fear and distress associated with COVID-19 (<a href="#bb0200">Zulkifli et al., 2020</a>).

Incident cases of psychosis (patients infected with a virus)</div> <p id="p0155">In total, we identified seven papers addressing incident cases of psychosis linked to a virus. This included four observational studies (<a href="#bb0095">Kim et al., 2018</a>; <a href="#bb0100">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bb0120">Mak et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bb0145">Sheng et al., 2005</a>), of which three were associated with exposure to SARS (<a href="#bb0100">Lee et al., 2004</a>; <a href="#bb0120">Mak et al., 2009</a>; <a href="#bb0145">Sheng et al., 2005</a>), and one MERS (<a href="#bb0095">Kim et al., 2018</a>). Additionally, we identified two case reports of patients with the H1N1 (<a href="#bb0035">Chang et al., 2015</a>) and SARS (<a href="#bb0040">Cheng et al., 2004</a>) and one study examined coronavirus immunoreactivity in people with recent-onset psychosis (<a href="#bb0140">Severance et al., 2011</a>). All of the studies included in the review indicated a link between exposure to the virus and psychosis.</p> <p id="p0160">In the first observational study, <a href="#bb0145">Sheng et al. (2005)</a> surveyed 308 SARS patients discharged from hospital, and identified psychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Checklist (NPSC) developed by the authors for this study. Auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations and persecutory ideas were reported by 3.9%, 2% and 3.9% of patients respectively (although it is unclear from the data presented if these are unique participants or if single participants were reporting multiple symptoms) and declined at follow-up. The severity of SARS symptoms and higher doses of corticosteroid were significantly associated with an increased risk of experiencing psychosis symptoms.</p> <p id="p0165">In the second observational study following the SARS outbreak, <a href="#bb0120">Mak et al. (2009)</a> administered the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, <a href="#bb0165">Validity, 2004</a>) to 90 SARS survivors 30Â months after the outbreak. Four (4.4%) participants were identified as experiencing post-SARS psychotic symptoms, with three other participants reporting transient auditory and visual hallucinations during admission for SARS treatment but did not meet diagnostic criteria. The authors report no details about the treatment and response. <a href="#bb0100">Lee et al. (2004)</a> undertook a retrospective chart review of SARS survivors in Hong Kong to test the hypothesis that post-SARS psychosis was associated with treatment with steroids. An incident rate of 0.9% (nÂ =Â 15) was reported in the 1744 SARS patients reviewed for the study. They subsequently matched these to 30 control patients who had SARS but did not experience psychosis. All participants in the study were treated with steroids. Patients in the psychosis group received significantly higher doses of steroids while inpatient than controls (median dose in hydrocortisone equivalent, 10,975Â mg v. 6780Â mg). The authors also suggest that a family history of mental illness and psychosocial stressor may have been associated with an increased risk of psychosis in their sample.</p> <p id="p0170">In the final observational study, we identified, <a href="#bb0095">Kim et al. (2018)</a> completed a retrospective chart analysis of all patients admitted to an acute MERS inpatient unit in Seoul, South Korea. Of the 24 MERS survivors, 17 (70.8%) exhibited psychiatric symptoms, of which 2 (11.8%) experienced auditory hallucinations.</p> <p id="p0175">In the two case reports where psychosis followed virus infection, one reported two patients infected with the H1N1 (<a href="#bb0035">Chang et al., 2015</a>) and the other, three patients who had the SARS virus (<a href="#bb0040">Cheng et al., 2004</a>). In both reports, authors observed that psychotic symptoms seemed to be attributable to a combination of virus symptom severity, the isolation during treatment, and administration of steroids. Of the three patients in the Chang case series, it was noted that hallucinations seemingly worsened in two patients when steroid treatment was stepped down at the end of acute treatment. Both of the patients in the Chang H1N1 case series were young (girl 14, and boy 13, years old) and were treated with an antiviral agent (oseltamivir) but not steroids. Both patients responded well to treatment with low dose antipsychotic medication (aripiprazole, 5Â mg/day). The authors concluded that exposure to antiviral treatment induced the psychosis (<a href="#bb0035">Chang et al., 2015</a>).</p> <p id="p0180">In a cross-sectional survey, the association between four coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63 and OC43) and psychosis was examined in a study involving 106 people with recent-onset psychosis and 196 non-psychiatric controls (<a href="#bb0140">Severance et al., 2011</a>). All four coronaviruses were more common in people with psychosis compared to controls. After adjusting for confounding variables (age, gender, socioeconomic status and smoking status), the odds of the HKU1 and NL63 coronavirus were associated with a 32% and 142% increase in the odds of psychosis suggesting that coronavirus' may be important risk factors for psychosis.</p> </div> <div class="adherencewithprotectivemeasures" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">4.3</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

There was a consistent conclusion that adherence was markedly more problematic in people with psychosis, although included studies had important methodological limitations.</p> <p id="p0190">A single cross-sectional study examined willingness and perceived barriers to adopting protective measures in 71 adults with and 238 without schizophrenia attending primary care (<a href="#bb0110">Maguire et al., 2018</a>). People with schizophrenia were less willing to receive a vaccination and were more concerned about vaccination side effects. People with schizophrenia were also less willing to be isolated compared to those without schizophrenia. There was no difference in willingness to hand wash or perceptions of the effectiveness of handwashing between people with and without schizophrenia.</p> <p id="p0195"><a href="#bb0130">Pang (2004)</a> reports a service evaluation of the impact of SARS on psychiatric services; however, the author does not provide any empirical data within the publication. They reported that while psychiatric inpatients were taught self-hygiene measures and provided with face masks, their adherence to these measures was inadequate. In the <a href="#bb0040">Cheng et al. (2004)</a> case series, it was noted that psychotic symptoms were linked to poor adherence with infection control measures. Clinicians working on the SARS unit were concerned about mental health clinicians visiting the ward unless necessary, which they reported complicated access to treatment.</p> </div> <div class="riskperceptioninpeoplewithpsychosis" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">4.4</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Risk perception in people with psychosis</div> <p id="p0200">Two papers were identified that examined perception of the risk of infection in people with psychosis (<a href="#bb0080">Iancu et al., 2005</a>; <a href="#bb0115">Maguire et al., 2019</a>). One study examined if the SARS epidemic caused anxiety and worry in 30 inpatients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia compared to a control group of 30 staff members in Israel where the virus was not endemic (<a href="#bb0080">Iancu et al., 2005</a>). Most patients were aware of the SARS epidemic. Compared to the control group, patients reported they were more protected from SARS in hospital, perceived that staff did all they could to protect them, and believed that there would be no SARS cases in Israel. Patients were also more likely to accept psychotic explanations for the SARS virus, such as it is a punishment, a sign the world is coming to an end, and a sign for humankind.</p> <p id="p0205">In a second paper (<a href="#bb0115">Maguire et al., 2019</a>) â€" derived from the <a href="#bb0110">Maguire et al. (2018)</a> survey - the authors reported that in participants with schizophrenia, affect seems to play a role in risk perception of swine flu infection and willingness to adhere with protective measures. For example, they reported that higher levels of reported anxiety in those with schizophrenia were associated with a reduced likelihood of perceiving they were at substantive risk from swine flu. Maguire also reported a trend in perception towards people with schizophrenia - compared to controls - being less likely to get swine flu (<a href="#bb0115">Maguire et al., 2019</a>).</p> </div> <div class="impactonpsychiatricservices" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">4.5</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">

In both studies, services were impacted. <a href="#bb0130">Pang (2004)</a> reported a significant reduction in demand for psychiatric services in Hong Kong following the SARS outbreak. There was a 6% reduction in the number of acute admissions from the emergency department, a 14% reduction in the length of hospitalisation, and a 5% drop in outpatient attendance. Community visits reduced by 50% seemingly because home visits to patients were suspended. Clinicians compensated by making telephone contact.

Discussion and clinical considerations</div> <p id="p0230">There has been considerable media speculation about how COVID-19 will impact global mental health. Predictions have focused on an increase in common mental disorders such as depression and anxiety and PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder) (<a href="#bb0020">Brooks et al., 2020</a>). Consequently, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the number of people who die by suicide, with evidence from the MERS and SARS outbreaks that this is likely (<a href="#bb0015">Barbisch et al., 2015</a>; <a href="#bb0030">Chan et al., 2006</a>). Less has been made of the impact on those experiencing more severe and enduring mental illnesses, such as psychosis, despite these vulnerable individuals being at the highest risk (<a href="#bb0045">Druss, 2020</a>). The aim of this rapid review was therefore to explore the potential effect the COVID-19 pandemic may have on people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, psychosis given what we know from previous contemporary epi- and pandemics. We broadly aimed to synthesize the existing evidence on; 1. how viruses have impacted the number of people experiencing psychosis, and 2. what effect viruses have on people with psychosis.</p> <div class="clinicalmanagementofinfectioncontrol" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.1</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Clinical management of infection control</div> <p id="p0235">There was evidence that people with psychosis may be less motivated to comply with infection control/physical distancing measures that are likely to raise some practical and ethical issues, particularly for clinicians running inpatient psychiatric units (<a href="#bb0080">Iancu et al., 2005</a>). In Hong Kong, during the SARS epidemic - a notably less contagious virus - patients who did not comply with required infection control practices were placed in enforced quarantine (<a href="#bb0130">Pang, 2004</a>). In some countries, such practices may be considered unethical and potentially incompatible with mental health laws. Helping people with psychosis maintain physical distancing and infection control requirements may be challenging, particularly while they are inpatients. For clinicians working in mental health services where personal protective equipment (PPE) may be limited, this may cause concern in the longer term. Tailored patient education about the importance of complying with infection control measures was recommended by <a href="#bb0130">Pang (2004)</a>. In the absence of any high-quality evidence about how to ensure compliance with infection control behaviours, clinicians may need to consider applying other psychoeducation techniques (<a href="#bb0185">Xia et al., 2011</a>), particularly for individuals with prominent disorganisation symptoms.</p> </div> <div class="clinicalmanagementofpatientswithvirus-inducedpsychosis" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.2</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Clinical management of patients with virus-induced psychosis</div> <p id="p0240">Behavioural issues have been reported as challenging and timely recognition and initiation of treatment may be helpful. Notably, reports are emerging of new incident cases of psychosis - seemingly in an older group of people - associated with exposure to the psychosocial stress of COVID-19 (<a href="#bb0075">Hu et al., 2020</a>; <a href="#bb0200">Zulkifli et al., 2020</a>). While extreme caution should be applied in inferring an association given the limited amount of available data, increased awareness and vigilance may be justified.</p> <p id="p0245">The increased risk of psychosis in people exposed to a virus during an epi- or pandemic is more compelling. Between 0.9% and 4% of people exposed develop psychosis or psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and/or delusions). This is in contrast to a median incident rate of 15.2 in 100,000 (<a href="#bb0125">McGrath et al., 2004</a>). In some cases the psychosis seemed to be associated with treatment with steroids used to treat the infection, e.g. <a href="#bb0120">Mak et al. (2009)</a>. Treatment with low doses of antipsychotic medication - notably aripiprazole - seems to have been effective in patients with an emerging infectious disease and those associated with psychosocial stress associated with an emerging infectious disease.</p> </div> <div class="scalingbackofcommunityservices" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.3</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Scaling back of community services</div> <p id="p0250">During the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong, community services were suspended (<a href="#bb0130">Pang, 2004</a>). Policymakers and service managers may consider that the protection of their staff is paramount, and it should be possible to provide some form of community support using telehealth technology. People with psychosis do - at least in advanced economies - have access to online and mobile-based technologies that seem to be acceptable and feasible in this population (<a href="#bb0005">Alvarez-Jimenez et al., 2014</a>; <a href="#bb0050">Firth et al., 2015</a>). The safety, effectiveness and acceptability of telephone/internet-based delivery of community-based mental health services for people with psychosis need to be carefully monitored, as will their potential use of other medical services (for example, emergency departments).</p> </div> <div class="gapsintheevidence" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.4</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Gaps in the evidence</div> <p id="p0255">We found no studies or case series of people with existing psychosis that had been infected by a virus during an epi- or pandemic. Presumably, this is because infection is a comparatively rare occurrence in this group of patients in pandemics to date. Given that we identified that people with psychosis are seemingly less adherent with protective measures it seems reasonable to hypothesise that during the COVID-19 outbreak â€" where a large number of people can expect to be infected â€" mental health clinicians will likely be in a position where they need to encourage patients to physically distance and self-isolate. There was little evidence to guide how best to address this issue clinically.</p> <p id="p0260">Inevitably patients with psychosis and COVID-19 will require admission to medical wards. Studies of patients with coronavirus induced psychosis have reported that this is a complex and extremely challenging group of people to treat. It may be reasonable to suggest that consideration will need to be given at a hospital and Government level about how best to support these individuals accessing medical facilities.</p> </div> <div class="considerationsinemergingeconomies" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.5</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Considerations in emerging economies</div> <p id="p0265">There was limited evidence from emerging economies, with only one study (<a href="#bb0085">Kamara et al., 2017</a>) reporting on the impact the Ebola epidemic had on mental health service delivery. In contrast to the relatively contained outbreaks of SARS, MERS and Ebola, COVID-19 is spreading across the globe. Mental health care in these economies tend to already be neglected services and Governments and hospitals may have to be creative in their treatment delivery, perhaps expediting a move away from hospital-based care that can still dominate in these economies. Another novel shift in service provision could be making use of a peer-based workforce (<a href="#bb0150">Stastny, 2012</a>) to reinforce infection control measures.</p> </div> <div class="limitations" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">5.6</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Limitations</div> <p id="p0270">There are some important limitations to this rapid review that should be considered when appraising our findings. Amendments were made to our registration entry after we had undertaken our initial search. This could be interpreted as a post hoc effort to amend the aims of the study after we had started to read the available studies. Our search strategy was not externally peer-reviewed. While it would have been helpful to have our search further scrutinized, it was felt that this would have delayed the review process and we decided to omit this step. Only three databases were searched. We did not search key databases such as CINAHL that indexes research not covered by the databases we used. The decision to restrict the databases we searched was based on our experience of the likely relevance of studies indexed in CINAHL (primarily focused on nursing) and other candidate databases. That said, there may be relevant studies that we omitted as a consequence. Finally, data extraction was undertaken by a single researcher; although this was done carefully, there is a possibility that errors may have occurred. Because this was a rapid review that we aimed to complete in a timely way to inform policymakers, we judged that the time saved by only having a single researcher undertake data extraction was warranted.</p> </div> </div> <div class="conclusions" title="sec"><span class="label" tagx="label" title="label">6</span><div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
Conclusions</div> <p id="p0275">The main finding from our rapid review is that there is moderate (if low quality) evidence to suggest a small but important number of patients will develop coronavirus related psychosis that is likely associated with steroid or viral exposure, pre-existing vulnerability and psychosocial stress. Psychosis in patients with coronavirus may present a major challenge and potential infection control risk to clinical teams. There was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole. In addition to steroid-induced psychosis, there was some limited and poor-quality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected. Of importance to current mental health service provision, patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease, representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians. The current COVID-19 pandemic offers a global opportunity to explore the findings of this rapid review in greater depth and quality.</p> <p id="p0280">There is much to speculate upon regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with psychosis. Our review highlights that, within the current literature at least, minimal consideration has been given to this disadvantaged population and proactive research is required.</p> </div> <div class="contributions" title="sec"> <div class="title" tagx="title" title="title">
