<p id="p0270">There are some important limitations to this rapid review that should be considered when appraising our findings. Amendments were made to our registration entry after we had undertaken our initial search. This could be interpreted as a post hoc effort to amend the aims of the study after we had started to read the available studies. Our search strategy was not externally peer-reviewed. While it would have been helpful to have our search further scrutinized, it was felt that this would have delayed the review process and we decided to omit this step. Only three databases were searched. We did not search key databases such as CINAHL that indexes research not covered by the databases we used. The decision to restrict the databases we searched was based on our experience of the likely relevance of studies indexed in CINAHL (primarily focused on nursing) and other candidate databases. That said, there may be relevant studies that we omitted as a consequence. Finally, data extraction was undertaken by a single researcher; although this was done carefully, there is a possibility that errors may have occurred. Because this was a rapid review that we aimed to complete in a timely way to inform policymakers, we judged that the time saved by only having a single researcher undertake data extraction was warranted.</p>
