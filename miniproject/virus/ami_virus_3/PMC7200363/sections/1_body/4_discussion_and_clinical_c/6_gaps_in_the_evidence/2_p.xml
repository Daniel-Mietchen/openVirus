<p id="p0255">We found no studies or case series of people with existing psychosis that had been infected by a virus during an epi- or pandemic. Presumably, this is because infection is a comparatively rare occurrence in this group of patients in pandemics to date. Given that we identified that people with psychosis are seemingly less adherent with protective measures it seems reasonable to hypothesise that during the COVID-19 outbreak – where a large number of people can expect to be infected – mental health clinicians will likely be in a position where they need to encourage patients to physically distance and self-isolate. There was little evidence to guide how best to address this issue clinically.</p>
