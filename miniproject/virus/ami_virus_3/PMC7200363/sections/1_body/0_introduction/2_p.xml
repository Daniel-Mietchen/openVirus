<p id="p0005">The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in China in December 2019, and by March 2020 had spread across the globe. While the development of a vaccine continues, public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). These include quarantine (self-isolation) of people potentially exposed to the virus, and social distancing (more accurately termed ‘physical distancing’) of the general population (
 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). While physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Center for Disease Control et al., 2003</xref>), this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects, including fear, anxiety, and worry (

 <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011)</xref> reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of University students in China during the H1N1 flu outbreak. The incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted (

 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). The implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex, however. Potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on, for example, a renewed sense of shared social purpose (
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fransen et al., 2015</xref>), such as, ‘everyone is in this together’, and ‘we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare system’. There may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety, with the expectation to stay at home, reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work, for example.
