 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Maguire et al. (2018)</xref> survey - the authors reported that in participants with schizophrenia, affect seems to play a role in risk perception of swine flu infection and willingness to adhere with protective measures. For example, they reported that higher levels of reported anxiety in those with schizophrenia were associated with a reduced likelihood of perceiving they were at substantive risk from swine flu. Maguire also reported a trend in perception towards people with schizophrenia - compared to controls - being less likely to get swine flu (
