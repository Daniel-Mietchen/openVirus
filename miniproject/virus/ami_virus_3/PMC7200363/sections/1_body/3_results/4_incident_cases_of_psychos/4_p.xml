<p id="p0165">In the second observational study following the SARS outbreak, 
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Mak et al. (2009)</xref> administered the SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, 
 <xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Validity, 2004</xref>) to 90 SARS survivors 30 months after the outbreak. Four (4.4%) participants were identified as experiencing post-SARS psychotic symptoms, with three other participants reporting transient auditory and visual hallucinations during admission for SARS treatment but did not meet diagnostic criteria. The authors report no details about the treatment and response. 
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. (2004)</xref> undertook a retrospective chart review of SARS survivors in Hong Kong to test the hypothesis that post-SARS psychosis was associated with treatment with steroids. An incident rate of 0.9% (n = 15) was reported in the 1744 SARS patients reviewed for the study. They subsequently matched these to 30 control patients who had SARS but did not experience psychosis. All participants in the study were treated with steroids. Patients in the psychosis group received significantly higher doses of steroids while inpatient than controls (median dose in hydrocortisone equivalent, 10,975 mg v. 6780 mg). The authors also suggest that a family history of mental illness and psychosocial stressor may have been associated with an increased risk of psychosis in their sample.
