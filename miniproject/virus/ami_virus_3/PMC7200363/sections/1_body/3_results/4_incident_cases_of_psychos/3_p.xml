 <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Sheng et al. (2005)</xref> surveyed 308 SARS patients discharged from hospital, and identified psychiatric symptoms using the Neuropsychiatric Symptoms Checklist (NPSC) developed by the authors for this study. Auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations and persecutory ideas were reported by 3.9%, 2% and 3.9% of patients respectively (although it is unclear from the data presented if these are unique participants or if single participants were reporting multiple symptoms) and declined at follow-up. The severity of SARS symptoms and higher doses of corticosteroid were significantly associated with an increased risk of experiencing psychosis symptoms.
