In both reports, authors observed that psychotic symptoms seemed to be attributable to a combination of virus symptom severity, the isolation during treatment, and administration of steroids. Of the three patients in the Chang case series, it was noted that hallucinations seemingly worsened in two patients when steroid treatment was stepped down at the end of acute treatment. Both of the patients in the Chang H1N1 case series were young (girl 14, and boy 13, years old) and were treated with an antiviral agent (oseltamivir) but not steroids. Both patients responded well to treatment with low dose antipsychotic medication (aripiprazole, 5Â mg/day). The authors concluded that exposure to antiviral treatment induced the psychosis (
