<p id="p0210">Two studies examined the impact of an outbreak of a virus on psychiatric services (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kamara et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Pang, 2004</xref>). In both studies, services were impacted. 
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Pang (2004)</xref> reported a significant reduction in demand for psychiatric services in Hong Kong following the SARS outbreak. There was a 6% reduction in the number of acute admissions from the emergency department, a 14% reduction in the length of hospitalisation, and a 5% drop in outpatient attendance. Community visits reduced by 50% seemingly because home visits to patients were suspended. Clinicians compensated by making telephone contact. The long-term implications of the scaling back of community services were not reported, and it is unclear if this was done to protect clinicians or patients.
