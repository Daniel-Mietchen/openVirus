 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Kamara et al. (2017)</xref> described the outcomes of 143 patients (of whom 30 had psychosis) attending nurse-led mental health services during the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone. The epidemic had a substantial impact on the provision of already fragile health services in the country. While the authors noted an increase in numbers of people attending mental health services during the outbreak, no primary evidence is reported to support this claim. Accessing medication was one of the major challenges reported in this paper.
