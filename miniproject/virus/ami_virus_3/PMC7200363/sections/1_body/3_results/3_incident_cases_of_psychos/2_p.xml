<p id="p0140">One observational study (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2020</xref>) and a single case report (
 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Zulkifli et al., 2020</xref>) examined incident cases of psychosis in people living in a geographical area where COVID-19 was prevalent. Hu reported a 25% increase - compared to previous years - in incident cases of schizophrenia in January 2020, which the authors attributed to the psychosocial stress and physical distancing measures associated with the COVID-19 outbreak (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). The authors extracted data from 13,783 outpatients (of which 1210 presented for the first time) attending the Xuzhou Oriental People's (psychiatric) hospital in January 2020, the start of the COVID-19 outbreak. The authors adjusted for a limited number of potential covariates - age, gender and place of residence - in their analysis. The absolute number of new cases of schizophrenia is comparatively small and may be explained by simple random variation. No data are reported in terms of the difference in presentation - other than that patients were seemingly older, with median age increased from 39 to 50. At the time of writing, these data were published on a Chinese open science platform, rather than a peer-reviewed journal. Additionally, of concern is the use of the diagnosis ‘schizophrenia’ when typically symptoms are required to be present for six months before this diagnosis to be reached.
