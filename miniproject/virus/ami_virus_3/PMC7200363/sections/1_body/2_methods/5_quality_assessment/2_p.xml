<p id="p0125">Quality of included studies was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP) tool (
 <xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al., 2004</xref>). This tool facilitates the rating of the quality of each paper across six domains: selection bias, study design, confounders, blinding, data collection method, and withdrawals and dropouts. These component ratings are then used to make a global rating, with strong equating to “no weak ratings”, moderate to “one weak rating” and a global rating of weak if there are “two or more weak ratings”.
