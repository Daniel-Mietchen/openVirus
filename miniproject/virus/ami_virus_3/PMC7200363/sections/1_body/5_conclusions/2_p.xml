<p id="p0275">The main finding from our rapid review is that there is moderate (if low quality) evidence to suggest a small but important number of patients will develop coronavirus related psychosis that is likely associated with steroid or viral exposure, pre-existing vulnerability and psychosocial stress. Psychosis in patients with coronavirus may present a major challenge and potential infection control risk to clinical teams. There was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole. In addition to steroid-induced psychosis, there was some limited and poor-quality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected. Of importance to current mental health service provision, patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease, representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians. The current COVID-19 pandemic offers a global opportunity to explore the findings of this rapid review in greater depth and quality.</p>
