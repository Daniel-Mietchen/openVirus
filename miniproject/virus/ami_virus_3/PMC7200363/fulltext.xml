An increase in incident cases of psychosis may be predicted. Clinical advice on the management of psychosis during the outbreak needs to be based on the best available evidence. We undertook a rapid review of the impact of epidemic and pandemics on psychosis. Fourteen papers met inclusion criteria. Included studies reported incident cases of psychosis in people infected with a virus of a range of 0.9% to 4%. Psychosis diagnosis was associated with viral exposure, treatments used to manage the infection, and psychosocial stress. Clinical management of these patients, where adherence with infection control procedures is paramount, was challenging. Increased vigilance for psychosis symptoms in patients with COVID-19 is warranted. How to support adherence to physical distancing requirements and engagement with services in patients with existing psychosis requires careful consideration.</p><p>Registration details: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/29pm4" id="ir0005">https://osf.io/29pm4</ext-link>.</p></abstract><kwd-group id="ks0005"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Psychosis</kwd><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Pandemic</kwd><kwd>Epidemic</kwd><kwd>SARS</kwd><kwd>MERS</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s0005"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p id="p0005">The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started in China in December 2019, and by March 2020 had spread across the globe. While the development of a vaccine continues, public health strategies to contain the spread of the disease have been put in place in nearly every country (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). These include quarantine (self-isolation) of people potentially exposed to the virus, and social distancing (more accurately termed &#x02018;physical distancing&#x02019;) of the general population (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">World Health Organization, 2020</xref>). While physical distancing may be the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus (<xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Center for Disease Control et al., 2003</xref>), this measure may be associated with a range of adverse psychological effects, including fear, anxiety, and worry (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>; <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Gardner and Moallef, 2015</xref>), in addition to the physical effects of decreased motor activity, changes to diet, and exposure to sunlight (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Lippi et al., 2020</xref>). Such impacts are likely to differ across pandemics and populations, for example, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2011)</xref> reported no immediate negative psychological effect of quarantine in their sample of University students in China during the H1N1 flu outbreak. The incidence of depression and anxiety in populations where physical distancing is enforced may be impacted (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Brooks et al., 2020</xref>) and there has been media speculation around this issue, with some Governments actively recognising and funding mental health services to respond to this potential surge in mental ill-health (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). The implications for wellbeing are likely to be complex, however. Potential positives arising from the situation have also been speculated on, for example, a renewed sense of shared social purpose (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Fransen et al., 2015</xref>), such as, &#x02018;everyone is in this together&#x02019;, and &#x02018;we must all act to protect the vulnerable and the healthcare system&#x02019;. There may also be short term benefits for individuals who experience social anxiety, with the expectation to stay at home, reducing typical stresses they experience from having to attend school or work, for example.</p><p id="p0010">Psychosis is one mental health condition that requires specific attention. For one, the association between influenza infection and psychosis has been reported since the Spanish Flu pandemic in the eighteenth century and subsequent acute &#x0201c;psychoses of influenza&#x0201d; have been documented during multiple pandemics (<xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">K&#x00119;pi&#x00144;ska et al., 2020</xref>). A further point is that this population may be particularly at risk from the stress associated with physical distancing measures. While the use of mobile phones and technology continues to increase for people with psychosis, rates are still lower than in the general population (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Firth et al., 2015</xref>). This may mean that physical distancing and reduction in social connectedness has a substantial effect on this group of individuals as they do not compensate as much with other methods of communication.</p><p id="p0015">Another impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have is on the nature and content of the psychotic pathology of people with psychosis or at risk of psychosis. Clinicians working in mental health services have given anecdotal reports of increased paranoia [content] around contamination from being in close contact with other people. The association between psychosis and a range of psychosocial factors, including stressful life events, has been extensively explored, suggesting it is an important risk factor for both the onset and exacerbation of symptoms (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Fusar-Poli et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0020">The medium- and long-term social effects of COVID-19 may disproportionately impact people with psychosis or at risk of psychotic disorder. For example, social isolation, unemployment, homelessness, relationship breakdown (divorce/separation), domestic violence, and worsening physical health, may all particularly effect people with psychosis given their vulnerability to social determinants of health (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Anglin et al., 2020</xref>). Again, the direction of this impact is not known as there is the potential for pandemics to strengthen social inequities and thus impact associated risk factors. There is also the potential for an increase in the number of people with psychosis who suicide or attempt suicide, with some evidence of more suicides occurring after previous pandemics (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2006</xref>). What may complicate the interaction between psychosis and COVID-19 further is that the treatment of COVID-19 may involve the use of high doses of steroids to modulate the inflammatory response (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Russell et al., 2020</xref>); steroids have been known to trigger psychotic symptoms (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Wada et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p id="p0025">How the specific psychosocial factors associated with an epi- or pandemic affect people with psychosis, including their use of health services, is unlikely to be well understood by policymakers or clinicians who have not previously lived and worked through such an outbreak. There may be valuable lessons about the impact an epi- or pandemic can have on psychosis that can be learned from other virus outbreaks, including the recent SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), and Ebola epidemics.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Why is this review needed?</title><p id="p0030">Social distancing and other public health interventions to combat the spread of COVID-19 may have immediate and longer-term effects on people with, or who are at risk of, psychosis. Statutory (health and social care) and non-government services that support and treat people with psychosis need guidance on how COVID-19 may impact on their services and the people that use them, and how they may respond accordingly. The World Health Organization (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Tricco et al., 2017</xref>) advocates that rapid reviews are essential in providing informative summaries of these issues in such circumstances. We, therefore, aimed to undertake a rapid review of research on the impact of epidemics and pandemics on people with psychosis and the mental health services they use.

At the time of writing, these data were published on a Chinese open science platform, rather than a peer-reviewed journal.

Both of the patients in the Chang H1N1 case series were young (girl 14, and boy 13, years old) and were treated with an antiviral agent (oseltamivir) but not steroids.

Consequently, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in the number of people who die by suicide, with evidence from the MERS and SARS outbreaks that this is likely (<xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Barbisch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2006</xref>).

In some countries, such practices may be considered unethical and potentially incompatible with mental health laws. Helping people with psychosis maintain physical distancing and infection control requirements may be challenging, particularly while they are inpatients.

While it would have been helpful to have our search further scrutinized, it was felt that this would have delayed the review process and we decided to omit this step. Only three databases were searched. We did not search key databases such as CINAHL that indexes research not covered by the databases we used. The decision to restrict the databases we searched was based on our experience of the likely relevance of studies indexed in CINAHL (primarily focused on nursing) and other candidate databases. That said, there may be relevant studies that we omitted as a consequence. Finally, data extraction was undertaken by a single researcher; although this was done carefully, there is a possibility that errors may have occurred. Because this was a rapid review that we aimed to complete in a timely way to inform policymakers, we judged that the time saved by only having a single researcher undertake data extraction was warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0120"><label>6</label><title>Conclusions</title><p id="p0275">The main finding from our rapid review is that there is moderate (if low quality) evidence to suggest a small but important number of patients will develop coronavirus related psychosis that is likely associated with steroid or viral exposure, pre-existing vulnerability and psychosocial stress. Psychosis in patients with coronavirus may present a major challenge and potential infection control risk to clinical teams. There was limited evidence to suggest that patients that developed psychosis responded well to low dose antipsychotics such as aripiprazole. In addition to steroid-induced psychosis, there was some limited and poor-quality evidence which suggested that extreme psychosocial stress-triggered incident cases in people previously unaffected. Of importance to current mental health service provision, patients with existing psychosis may be less likely to comply with physical distancing and personal hygiene requirements required during an outbreak of an infectious disease, representing a potential risk to the community and mental health clinicians. The current COVID-19 pandemic offers a global opportunity to explore the findings of this rapid review in greater depth and quality.</p><p id="p0280">There is much to speculate upon regarding the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with psychosis. Our review highlights that, within the current literature at least, minimal consideration has been given to this disadvantaged population and proactive research is required.</p></sec><sec id="s0125"><title>Contributions</title><p id="p0285">EB and RG conceived the study, completed the screening and completed the first draft.
