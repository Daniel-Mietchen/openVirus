<p id="Par11">It is a compelling tale, but it is not the whole story. This chapter will provide both a prequel and a sequel to the standard three-act viral sovereignty story. It will demonstrate that while Indonesia was the first to invoke the United Nations’ 
 <italic>Convention on Biological Diversity</italic> (CBD) to claim sovereignty over its viruses, it was not the first country to deny the WHO access to influenza viruses. Nor was Indonesia the first to raise the types of distributive justice issues that they framed as access and benefit-sharing (ABS), using the language of the CBD.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> Furthermore, this chapter will outline some of the viral sovereignty disputes that have played out since the introduction of the PIP Framework in 2011. Far from being the legal resolution to a problem posed by Indonesia in 2007, the PIP Framework is responsible for legitimising the concept of viral sovereignty as a legal norm. The only thing that has really changed since 2011 is the language that the WHO and the rest of the international community uses to discuss viral sovereignty. “Access” to viruses (or other pathogens) is now usually referred to as “sample sharing” or “material transfer”. “Benefit-sharing” contracts are now referred to almost exclusively as “material transfer agreements”. The term “sovereignty” has fallen out of use altogether, despite becoming an entrenched conceptual norm.
