<p id="Par160">This is a particularly interesting case because China is exercising sovereign control over an influenza virus with human pandemic potential,

 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn113">113</xref> China is choosing instead to determine the terms of influenza sample sharing itself. This is its sovereign right, a right that the WHO has recognised repeatedly. While it does go against the object and intent of the PIP Framework, there are absolutely no direct legal ramifications for not sharing pandemic influenza viruses with the WHO. The PIP Framework was a political salve for a legal problem that persisted despite, and perhaps even because of, the PIP Framework. Put slightly differently, the CBD enables each nation to establish its own laws; the PIP Framework provides one possibility, although it is for the host country to decide whether to follow the PIP Framework or some other legal, administrative or policy arrangement. That is the basis of sovereignty.
