<p id="Par157">One U.S. source in the 
 <italic>New York Times</italic> was quoted as saying that “[c]ountries don’t own their viral samples any more than they own the birds in their skies”,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn110">110</xref> which, as this chapter has described, is not quite true. It turns out that countries do own their viruses in the very same sense that they own the birds in their skies (which are also within the purview of the CBD and Nagoya Protocol and therefore subject to the environmental laws of the nation state in whose territories those birds happen to be in at any given time). The U.S. is not a signatory to the CBD and is one of the last hold-outs on the issue of whether viral sovereignty is a legitimate claim under the CBD and Nagoya Protocol. The fact is, countries are exercising their sovereign authority over pathogens (which, granted, is not 
 <italic>exactly</italic> the same thing as ownership).
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn111">111</xref> The U.S. can resist the theory as much as it likes, but it must work within this new reality if it wants to secure access to virus samples from now on.
