<p id="Par199">Benefit-sharing was a core component of all three of the CBDâ€™s objectives. The international community must come up with a solution to facilitate access to pathogen samples and epidemiological information that respects the sovereign rights of nation states and shares the benefits associated with the use of their resources. If we fail to find a solution that aligns with the object and purpose of the CBD, then individual nations will simply opt to negotiate access terms on an ad hoc basis, and lives will likely be lost in the process. As the examples here indicate, many of those lives are likely to be in the rich countries of the world. This suggests that a solution is possible because the consequences of inaction are not just the burden of the LMICs.</p>
