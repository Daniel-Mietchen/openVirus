 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) is a binding agreement, it is regularly criticised as being toothless. Any amendment to mandate sample sharing under the IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) would require a rider detailing sanctions if it is to affect any nations’ cost-benefit analysis during a public health emergency. Attaching sanctions to the IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) is likely to be unpalatable for many countries, not just LMICs. Therefore, Article 4(4) of the Nagoya Protocol on specialised ABS instruments may provide the only avenue to deal with the issue of viral sovereignty. It would allow for the adoption of a multilateral agreement that, like the PIP Framework, would put the WHO at the centre of a constellation of stakeholders. Carter has argued “that the WHO must offer positive incentives so developing countries will have a compelling reason to share samples of newly discovered viruses with the international scientific and health communities”,
