<p id="Par93">The IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) were adopted by the 58th WHA on 23 May 2005, but did not enter into force until 15 June 2007,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn65">65</xref> around six months after Indonesia had claimed viral sovereignty. Even if the IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) were in force at that time, there are no provisions in this treaty that mandate the sharing of virus samples.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn66">66</xref> Indonesia was not, in any technical sense, in violation of the newly negotiated IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>). The fact is that if the IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) adequately addressed the virus sharing issue, there would have been no need to negotiate an entirely new agreement in the PIP Framework. The IHR (
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) does not provide a solution to the problem of viral sovereignty or virus ABS. There is just the PIP Framework, a highly specific (and imperfect) framework for the sharing of pandemic influenza viruses, and everything else is left, by default, within the domain of the CBD and Nagoya Protocol.
