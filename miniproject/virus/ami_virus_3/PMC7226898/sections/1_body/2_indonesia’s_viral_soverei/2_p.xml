<p id="Par53">The calculus changed for Indonesia in 2006 when the epidemiological situation saw the value of their influenza viruses appreciate. Indonesia had been reporting clusters of human influenza A (H5N1) infections since July 2005.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn36">36</xref> In 2006 the number of new cases spiked to 55 infections, up from 19 the year before.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn37">37</xref> The case fatality rate had also risen to 80.4% from 63.2% in 2005, and in 18% of cases it was unclear if the patient had interacted with sick or dead poultry.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn38">38</xref> These trends were extremely concerning: the data were indicative of the emergence of a more virulent form of H5N1 and the start of human-to-human transmission of a virus that was previously transmitted to humans only through close contact with infected birds.
