<p id="Par49">The WHOâ€™s GISN laboratories operate to monitor the spread of seasonal influenza, the background against which the emergence of potentially pandemic strains can be detected. The network relies on the provision of clinical specimens and virus isolates from countries around the world to create risk assessments and recommend candidate vaccine virus strains to vaccine manufacturers.
