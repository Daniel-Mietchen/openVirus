<p id="Par106">The outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2012 was the first incident after the introduction of the PIP Framework that demonstrated the broader and longer-lasting effects of Indonesia’s viral sovereignty claim. Coming hot on the heels of the PIP Framework, the discussion about sovereign rights over pathogens was still raw for many in the global health community. The situation surrounding the discovery of the MERS coronavirus was controversial. Working from a hospital in Jeddah, Egyptian microbiologist Dr. Mohammed Ali Zaki was unable to determine the causative agent of his patient’s pneumonia. He sent a specimen to Dutch virologists at Erasmus Medical Center (EMC), apparently without the consent of the Saudi Ministry of Health. The researchers at Erasmus were able to isolate the virus and sequence its genome. Just days after Dr. Zaki posted the discovery on ProMED-mail, the research team at EMC, together with Dr. Zaki, applied for a patent on the genetic sequence of the virus.

  <p id="Par108">Saudi Arabia has not yet appealed to ‘viral sovereignty,’ the argument that Indonesia advanced during the 2007 controversy over sharing avian influenza A (H5N1) samples, namely that the state in which a virus is isolated has sovereign rights over that virus under international law, specifically the Convention on Biological Diversity. But Riyadh’s complaints echo this reasoning: Zaki violated Saudi law, [the Saudi government] says, so Erasmus is benefiting from an illegal act. If Saudi Arabia has sovereign rights over the sample, moreover, Erasmus is ignoring these rights and engaging in a form of ‘biopiracy’ by exploiting a Saudi genetic resource without Saudi consent. This argument implicates the Dutch government because the Netherlands and Saudi Arabia are CBD parties, and the Dutch government has not intervened to protect Saudi Arabia’s rights recognised by this treaty.
