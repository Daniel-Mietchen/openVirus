<p id="Par141">In 2015, Hinterberger and Porter conceptualised viral sovereignty as a “tether” connecting virus samples to the political territories within which they were isolated.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn98">98</xref> Up to now, the discussion about viral sovereignty has been about controlling access to viruses that are within the physical control of the nation state claiming sovereignty authority. In fact, regarding the MERS coronavirus dispute, one observer stated that “any claim by Saudi Arabia to viral sovereignty is essentially moot because [EMC] already possesses the MERS-CoV genome”.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn99">99</xref> This statement implies that the existence of a nation state’s sovereign rights over those resources is exhausted (legally or functionally) once those viruses are out of the physical control of that state. The WHO Consultation about the West African biobanks demonstrates that the sovereignty “tether” is more robust than that. Hinterberger and Porter note that the “tethering effect permits new modes of ownership and control to be exercised over biological entities as they circulate in transnational research arenas”.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn100">100</xref> Thus, viral sovereignty is no longer a right that nation states must exercise prior to virus samples leaving their territorial borders in order for that right to be invoked,
