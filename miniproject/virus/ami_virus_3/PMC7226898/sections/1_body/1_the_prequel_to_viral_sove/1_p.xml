<p id="Par16">Indonesia’s claim of viral sovereignty in 2007 is usually represented as being an unprecedented move on Indonesia’s part. What has been lost is that the incident occurred in a contemporary context where nation states had already been exercising a level of authority over virus samples for years.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref> This first appears in the media coverage about the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. One news story published in 
 <italic>Nature</italic> in April 2003 stated that after 23 probable cases of SARS arose in Taiwan, Taiwanese epidemiologists requested Chinese SARS virus samples and related information from the WHO and were reportedly told to instead approach the People’s Republic of China.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref> Given the political sensitivities surrounding the relationship between China and Taiwan, it is understandable that the WHO may not have wanted to act as an intermediary to this transfer. This is despite the WHO having the samples in its possession and the supposed custom of free and open sharing of viruses that was said to have existed prior to Indonesia’s sovereignty claim in 2007. Thus, there was an implicit acknowledgement that the viruses belonged to China, not the WHO.
