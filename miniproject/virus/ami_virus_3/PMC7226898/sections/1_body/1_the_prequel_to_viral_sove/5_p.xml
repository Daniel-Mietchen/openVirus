<p id="Par30">The article did not directly accuse any particular Asian nation of not providing samples, although it did imply that Vietnam was withholding data and samples because it was concerned about “losing control over information”.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref> Vietnamese government officials contested the article, stating that they had been sharing information with the WHO since the outbreak of bird flu.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn20">20</xref> The WHO also released a statement about the 
 <italic>Nature</italic> article stating that “[t]here is no refusal to share human samples by Vietnam or any country with avian influenza cases”.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn21">21</xref> It is not clear whether the 
 <italic>Nature</italic> article, Vietnamese government officials and the WHO are talking about the same things here. The 
 <italic>Nature</italic> article mentions both human and animal-derived influenza virus samples, the Vietnamese statement refers to information, and the WHO statement refers to human samples. What is clear though, is that there are influenza virus ownership disputes involving multiple countries and UN agencies (WHO and FAO) well before 2007.
