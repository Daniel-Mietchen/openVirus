<p id="Par20">In September 2003, Russian news agency Tass reported that “Russian and Chinese Public Health Ministries agreed to share virus samples with each other to study infectious diseases, including SARS” as part of a broader programme “for cooperation in education, culture, public health and sport”.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> Again, this indicates that viruses like SARS were already thought of as belonging to the nation state from which they originated as early as 2003. While the media coverage of virus transfers during the SARS outbreak did not yet embody any notion of sovereign rights over those viruses, there was still an implicit recognition that the originating nations had a level of functional control over their movement and use. In the example between China and Taiwan, this control also extended to the information that was associated with the SARS viruses, not just the physical virus samples themselves.
