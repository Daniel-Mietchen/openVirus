<p id="Par183">In 2007, Indonesia first connected the issue of accessing viruses to that of access to vaccines and antivirals using the language of ABS. The CBD gave Indonesia the legal backing to claim sovereignty over viruses as genetic resources. This was the one and only opportunity that the WHO had to make it clear that global health emergencies were one instance where the world should consider foregoing a measure of sovereignty to prioritise the outbreak and research response required in such instances. Undoubtedly this was an extremely difficult situation for the WHO to have to arbitrate. But with hindsight we can now see that Indonesia’s sovereignty claim in 2007 may have been the WHO’s only chance to take a firm stance on this issue and call for the broad exemption of all pathogens during a global health emergency. It is an oft-noted fact that pathogens pay no mind to the Westphalian principles of international law, and the WHO had reason to likewise sideline that system when lives are threatened by the international spread of infectious diseases. This would, however, undermine the sovereignty of nation states, and as a UN agency, the WHO could not endorse such a proposition.</p>
