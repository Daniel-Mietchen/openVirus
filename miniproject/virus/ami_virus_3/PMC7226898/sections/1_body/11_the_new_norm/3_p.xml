Scientists are sometimes reluctant to share, sitting on samples and data until they can be guaranteed publication in peer review journals,

Furthermore, biosecurity considerations are often the impetus to deny access to pathogen samples or sensitive data. Indeed, one 2012 influenza experiment branded “dual use research of concern” (DURC) led to a sovereignty-like claim by the Netherlands in an effort to supress publication of the experiment’s results using export control laws.
