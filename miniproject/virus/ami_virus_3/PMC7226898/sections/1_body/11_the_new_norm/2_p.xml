<p id="Par184">This criticism ignores the fact that Indonesia’s sovereignty claim in 2007 was situated in a global context where countries had been exercising sovereign control over virus samples and associated data since the early 2000s, though it was never referred to as such. Perhaps the writing was on the wall. But, as Kamradt-Scott and Lee have pointed out, the PIP Framework simply “papers over fundamental disagreements regarding authority in global health governance, the relationship between the WHO and governments, and the role of private industry”.

This is a bargaining chip that has its greatest value precisely when the most lives are at stake, and it could just be the only option available to LMICs to redress some of the “embedded structural inequalities” of global health preparedness and response.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn124">124</xref> The CBD gave us the language of resource sovereignty; the Indonesians applied it to a human pathogen; and the PIP Framework locked it in as a legal norm. The transfer of pathogen samples, and now the epidemiological data related to the pathogen, must now be negotiated with reference to the principles of ABS: prior informed consent, mutually agreed terms, and benefit-sharing. The message from the WHO’s handling of the Indonesia situation was clear: if your country happens to be the emergence site of a pathogen that is sufficiently interesting to scientists that it is deemed valuable, then your best bet is to control access to that pathogen to leverage some sort of benefit for your country.
