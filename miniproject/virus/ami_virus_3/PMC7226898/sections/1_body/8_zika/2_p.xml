<p id="Par153">The experience with Zika in 2016 serves to demonstrate that the international regime on ABS created by the CBD and Nagoya Protocol is not the only set of rules that users of viral genetic resources have to navigate. This regime relies on the domestic implementation of national legislative, administrative or policy measures to regulate international transfers of genetic resources. Again, this illustrates the futility of arguing against the inclusion of pathogens within the definition of genetic resources under the CBD and Nagoya Protocol. Nation states have every right to include pathogens within their domestic ABS rules, and when accessing genetic resources from another country, the party accessing the resources must abide by the domestic laws of the provider nation.</p>
