<p id="Par72">It is this third objective, which has been abbreviated to “access and benefit-sharing” (ABS) that was at the core of the Indonesians’ sovereignty claims. In order to ensure the “fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources”, the CBD reaffirms “the sovereign rights of states over their natural resources”, and clearly states that “the authority to determine access to genetic resources rests with the national governments”.

This was supposed to address (or perhaps redress) the market failure of conservation, capturing the genetic resources in the sovereign domain of the nation state so that access to those resources could be traded for money or other benefits, ultimately creating an economic incentive to conserve them. This then delivered on the CBD’s other objective of sustainable development.
