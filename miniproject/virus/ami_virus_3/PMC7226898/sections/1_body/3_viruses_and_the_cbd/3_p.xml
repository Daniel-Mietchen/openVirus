<p id="Par74">The GISN’s continued operation after the adoption and entry into force of the CBD was an implicit statement by the WHO that it did not consider viruses to be within the remit of the CBD.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn50">50</xref> That the GISN informally transferred influenza viruses to privately owned and operated pharmaceutical companies was a further reiteration of this position. Viruses are unequivocally “genetic resources” within the remit of the CBD.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn51">51</xref> But this does not necessarily mean that they should be.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn52">52</xref> The CBD, and its supplementary Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation (Nagoya Protocol)
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn53">53</xref> prescribes a default bilateral ABS system. That is, the party that wants to utilise genetic resources (whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, including research and development) must obtain “prior informed consent”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn54">54</xref> from the originating nation state
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn55">55</xref> and negotiate “mutually agreed terms”
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn56">56</xref> for the sharing of associated benefits. This bilateral mode of ABS is cumbersome as it requires parties to negotiate terms anew every time a user party requires access to genetic resources; the process is slow and the transaction costs are high. It is evidently ill-suited to the rapid sharing of ever-evolving pathogens, particularly highly variable RNA viruses like influenza. While the Nagoya Protocol does ask parties to “[p]ay due regard to cases of present or imminent emergencies that threaten or damage human, animal or plant health” this provision on special considerations merely calls for ABS to be “expedited” in such situations; it cannot be ignored.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn57">57</xref> The Nagoya Protocol also recognises that alternative modes of ABS might be more appropriate for certain subsets of genetic resources,
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn58">58</xref> and allows for the adoption of specialised international ABS instruments “that [are] consistent with, and [do] not run counter to the objectives of the [CBD] and [Nagoya] Protocol”.
 <xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn59">59</xref> This is likely where the PIP Framework is situated within the international regime of ABS created by the CBD and Nagoya Protocol, and as such, the PIP Framework might be a specialised instrument.
