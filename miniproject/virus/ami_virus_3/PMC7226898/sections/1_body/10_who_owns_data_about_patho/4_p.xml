<p id="Par175">So in three consecutive communications from the WHO about the same consultation, the stance changes from data belonging to the originating countries, to countries just being the arbiters of its dissemination. The WHOâ€™s outward stance on data ownership is muddled and adds to the confusion around whether the use of epidemiological data requires permissions or some form of benefit-sharing. Much like the pathogens themselves, the data are likely to have their greatest value when the risk to the rest of the world is high. Without clear rules as to who can control access to epidemiological data, there is the potential that the data, like physical samples, will be withheld in order to leverage benefits.</p>
