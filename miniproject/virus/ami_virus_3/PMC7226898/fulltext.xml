Indonesia&#x02019;s sovereignty claims conflicted with the decades-long practice of sharing influenza samples with the WHO, and was seen as an affront to scientific norms of cooperation and openness. The conflict was ostensibly resolved in 2011 with the introduction of the WHO&#x02019;s Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (PIP Framework), which was intended to secure access to influenza viruses from around the world and effect a fairer distribution of vaccines and other benefits associated with the use of pandemic influenza samples. The problem is, the PIP Framework did not resolve the issues created with the concept of viral sovereignty. In fact, by recognising the sovereign rights of states over this subset of pathogens, the PIP Framework legitimised viral sovereignty as a broader legal norm. Instead of resisting this concept, the WHO quietly acceded to it and reinforced a set of perverse incentives for countries to restrict access to pathogens precisely when those pathogens embody the greatest value: during a public health emergency. This chapter demonstrates that the concept of viral sovereignty did not begin with Indonesia in 2007, and more importantly, it did not end with the PIP Framework in 2011. Despite the term &#x0201c;viral sovereignty&#x0201d; fading into relative obscurity, the concept itself is now an established legal norm that could delay efforts to save lives during epidemics and pandemics.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Viral sovereignty</kwd><kwd>Biopiracy</kwd><kwd>PIP Framework</kwd><kwd>Virus sharing</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par3">Viral sovereignty is the concept that virus samples isolated from within the territorial boundaries of a nation state are the sovereign property of that state. The history of viral sovereignty as a concept in international law is always told in the classic three-act narrative structure: the setup, the confrontation, and the resolution. The first act plays out across the latter half of the twentieth century, with the development of the World Health Organisation&#x02019;s (WHO) global network of more than 100 influenza laboratories. The system that became known as the Global Influenza Surveillance Network (GISN)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn1">1</xref> and now known as the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS), depended on the open sharing of influenza viruses from around the world to monitor the spread of seasonal influenza and detect the emergence of novel pandemic strains. The second act is the confrontation, set in 2007 when the Indonesian Health Minister refused to share H5N1 influenza viruses with the GISN, troubled by the fact that the WHO was giving their virus strains to pharmaceutical companies who used them to develop vaccines that were unaffordable to Indonesia and other lower and middle-income countries (LMICs).<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn2">2</xref> The Indonesians cited an environmental conservation treaty as the legal basis for claiming sovereignty over the viruses isolated within their territorial borders. This is the time at which the notion of viral sovereignty first entered the public discourse.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn3">3</xref> The standoff between Indonesia and the WHO split global opinion along the old North-South political divide: developed countries were indignant at such a &#x0201c;morally reprehensible&#x0201d; move on Indonesia&#x02019;s part,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn4">4</xref> and developing countries were largely sympathetic to Indonesia&#x02019;s claim.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn5">5</xref> The third and final act is neatly wrapped up by 2011 with the adoption of the WHO&#x02019;s <italic>Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework</italic> (PIP Framework). Indonesia was apparently placated and access to influenza viruses with pandemic potential was secured by this &#x0201c;innovative&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;enforceable&#x0201d; international agreement.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn6">6</xref> Viral sovereignty as a concept&#x000a0;in law was seen as nothing but a blip on the international radar; a problem both created and resolved in less than five years.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn7">7</xref>
</p><p id="Par11">It is a compelling tale, but it is not the whole story. This chapter will provide both a prequel and a sequel to the standard three-act viral sovereignty story. It will demonstrate that while Indonesia was the first to invoke the United Nations&#x02019; <italic>Convention on Biological Diversity</italic> (CBD) to claim sovereignty over its viruses, it was not the first country to deny the WHO access to influenza viruses. Nor was Indonesia the first to raise the types of distributive justice issues that they framed as access and benefit-sharing (ABS), using the language of the CBD.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn8">8</xref> Furthermore, this chapter will outline some of the viral sovereignty disputes that have played out since the introduction of the PIP Framework in 2011. Far from being the legal resolution to a problem posed by Indonesia in 2007, the PIP Framework is responsible for legitimising the concept of viral sovereignty as a legal norm. The only thing that has really changed since 2011 is the language that the WHO and the rest of the international community uses to discuss viral sovereignty. &#x0201c;Access&#x0201d; to viruses (or other pathogens) is now usually referred to as &#x0201c;sample sharing&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;material transfer&#x0201d;. &#x0201c;Benefit-sharing&#x0201d; contracts are now referred to almost exclusively as &#x0201c;material transfer agreements&#x0201d;. The term &#x0201c;sovereignty&#x0201d; has fallen out of use altogether, despite becoming an entrenched conceptual norm.</p><p id="Par13">Despite the abundant praise for the PIP Framework, the problem of viral sovereignty remains entirely unresolved. This is not news for anyone working in the realm of pandemic preparedness or involved in responding to international public health emergencies. But the typical three-act portrayal of this saga means that the viral sovereignty issue is depicted as having been settled by the PIP Framework. This is not the case. It should be clearly stated that there is absolutely nothing about or contained within the PIP Framework that could stop a repeat performance of the 2007 viral sovereignty episode today.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn9">9</xref> Meanwhile, the PIP Framework explicitly &#x0201c;recognise[d] the sovereign right of states over their biological resources&#x0201d;, making it very difficult for the WHO to fight for a future exemption to this notion for any pathogens that pose a threat to global health. Their reinforcement of sovereign rights over pathogens actually strengthens the incentives for countries to restrict access to dangerous pathogens with the hopes of trading access for related benefits, potentially delaying the global health response to infectious disease outbreaks. Furthermore, the WHO has now extended this notion to data and information related to pathogens, stating that &#x0201c;epidemiologic data belong to the countries where they are generated&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn10">10</xref> Without constant access to up-to-date pathogen samples and epidemiological data, the international public health community is working blindfolded. This chapter aims to demonstrate that viral sovereignty did not start with Indonesia in 2007, and it certainly did not end with the PIP Framework in 2011. The intention is to reinvigorate the conversation about viral sovereignty and the effects that this international legal concept continues to have on infectious disease preparedness and response.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>The Prequel to Viral Sovereignty</title><p id="Par16">Indonesia&#x02019;s claim of viral sovereignty in 2007 is usually represented as being an unprecedented move on Indonesia&#x02019;s part. What has been lost is that the incident occurred in a contemporary context where nation states had already been exercising a level of authority over virus samples for years.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn11">11</xref> This first appears in the media coverage about the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003. One news story published in <italic>Nature</italic> in April 2003 stated that after 23 probable cases of SARS arose in Taiwan, Taiwanese epidemiologists requested Chinese SARS virus samples and related information from the WHO and were reportedly told to instead approach the People&#x02019;s Republic of China.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn12">12</xref> Given the political sensitivities surrounding the relationship between China and Taiwan, it is understandable that the WHO may not have wanted to act as an intermediary to this transfer. This is despite the WHO having the samples in its possession and the supposed custom of free and open sharing of viruses that was said to have existed prior to Indonesia&#x02019;s sovereignty claim in 2007. Thus, there was an implicit acknowledgement that the viruses belonged to China, not the WHO.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn13">13</xref>
</p><p id="Par20">In September 2003, Russian news agency Tass reported that &#x0201c;Russian and Chinese Public Health Ministries agreed to share virus samples with each other to study infectious diseases, including SARS&#x0201d; as part of a broader programme &#x0201c;for cooperation in education, culture, public health and sport&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn14">14</xref> Again, this indicates that viruses like SARS were already thought of as belonging to the nation state from which they originated as early as 2003. While the media coverage of virus transfers during the SARS outbreak did not yet embody any notion of sovereign rights over those viruses, there was still an implicit recognition that the originating nations had a level of functional control over their movement and use. In the example between China and Taiwan, this control also extended to the information that was associated with the SARS viruses, not just the physical virus samples themselves.</p><p id="Par22">In April 2004, Japanese scientists reported delays in accessing South Korean samples of influenza viruses.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn15">15</xref> The <italic>Yomiuri Shimbun</italic> story out of Tokyo headlined &#x0201c;D<sc>ispute over ownership of virus could cost lives</sc>&#x0201d; refers to viruses as valuable &#x0201c;assets&#x0201d;, mentions the &#x0201c;tacit agreement in the world of researchers that a disease agent belongs to whoever found it first&#x0201d;, and concludes with the following:<disp-quote><p id="Par24">There currently are no international rules on the exchange of viruses. If researchers cannot work out the common ownership issue themselves, governments will be forced to step in. Negotiations between nations on the matter are expected to be conducted under the auspices of the World Health Organization. Even so, international dialogue between scientists will be an essential part of finding a solution.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn16">16</xref>

</p><p id="Par26">In May 2005 another news story in <italic>Nature</italic> stated that it had been &#x0201c;nearly eight months since the [WHO] last saw data on [H5N1 avian influenza virus] isolates from infected poultry in Asia&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn17">17</xref> The article states:<disp-quote><p id="Par28">Affected countries are failing, or refusing, to share their human samples with the WHO&#x02019;s influenza programme in Geneva.

</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par30">The article did not directly accuse any particular Asian nation of not providing samples, although it did imply that Vietnam was withholding data and samples because it was concerned about &#x0201c;losing control over information&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn19">19</xref> Vietnamese government officials contested the article, stating that they had been sharing information with the WHO since the outbreak of bird flu.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn20">20</xref> The WHO also released a statement about the <italic>Nature</italic> article stating that &#x0201c;[t]here is no refusal to share human samples by Vietnam or any country with avian influenza cases&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn21">21</xref> It is not clear whether the <italic>Nature</italic> article, Vietnamese government officials and the WHO are talking about the same things here. The <italic>Nature</italic> article mentions both human and animal-derived influenza virus samples, the Vietnamese statement refers to information, and the WHO statement refers to human samples. What is clear though, is that there are influenza virus ownership disputes involving multiple countries and UN agencies (WHO and FAO) well before 2007.</p><p id="Par34">The WHO had also published numerous documents referring to virus sharing in the years before 2007. In 2005 the WHO released &#x0201c;Guidance for the timely sharing of influenza viruses/specimens with potential to cause human influenza pandemics&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn22">22</xref> The guideline document included &#x0201c;[p]rinciples for sharing influenza viruses/specimens with the WHO Global Influenza Programme&#x0201d;, one of which stated that &#x0201c;designated WHO Reference Laboratories will seek permission from the originating country/laboratory to co-author and/or publish results obtained from the analyses of relevant viruses/samples&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn23">23</xref> Another principle stated that &#x0201c;[t]here will be no further distribution of viruses/specimens outside the network of WHO Reference Laboratories without permission from the originating country/laboratory&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn24">24</xref>
</p><p id="Par38">In 2005, the 58th World Health Assembly (WHA) adopted Resolution 58.5, urging member states &#x0201c;to facilitate the rapid sharing of clinical specimens and viruses through the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance Network&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn25">25</xref> Then in 2006, the 59th WHA adopted Resolution 59.2 on the application of the International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>). It urged member states to disseminate to WHO collaborating centres information and relevant biological materials related to highly pathogenic avian influenza and other novel influenza strains in a timely and consistent manner.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn26">26</xref>
</p><p id="Par41">Clearly this issue was on the radar of the WHO before Indonesia made its move in 2007, only it was not yet labelled viral sovereignty. Furthermore, upon her appointment as Director General of the WHO in 2006, Margaret Chan was asked about the issue of China not sharing influenza samples with the WHO.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn27">27</xref> Chan responded, &#x0201c;I will definitely speak out and urge China to share specimens and information&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn28">28</xref> China resumed sharing viruses with the WHO (via the United States&#x02019; Center for Disease Control and Prevention) shortly thereafter.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn29">29</xref>
</p><p id="Par45">This demonstrates that Indonesia&#x02019;s claim of viral sovereignty in 2007 was not unprecedented. It occurred in a diplomatic context in which many other nation states had exercised control over the viruses isolated from within their territories. Not only that, the arguments that these nations proffered in defence of withholding samples often related to the attribution of credit for their research: credit they felt was unfairly assumed by scientists from other nations using <italic>their</italic> virus isolates.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn30">30</xref> This was nominally addressed by the abovementioned WHO guidelines<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn31">31</xref> but was still a major point of contention for the Indonesians in 2007.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn32">32</xref> There was already a growing sense of unease about the informal and unfair sharing practices of the WHO&#x02019;s GISN well before the Indonesians forced the WHO and the rest of the international community to grapple with that unfairness in spectacular fashion.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Indonesia&#x02019;s Viral Sovereignty Claim</title><p id="Par49">The WHO&#x02019;s GISN laboratories operate to monitor the spread of seasonal influenza, the background against which the emergence of potentially pandemic strains can be detected. The network relies on the provision of clinical specimens and virus isolates from countries around the world to create risk assessments and recommend candidate vaccine virus strains to vaccine manufacturers.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn33">33</xref> These surveillance activities began in 1952<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn34">34</xref> and the WHO had never developed any formal protocols or legal agreements for the sharing of virus samples.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn35">35</xref> The viral inputs to the system had little value to the countries that were contributing the virus samples, whereas the value to the world in having a continuous influenza monitoring system was clearly very high.</p><p id="Par53">The calculus changed for Indonesia in 2006 when the epidemiological situation saw the value of their influenza viruses appreciate. Indonesia had been reporting clusters of human influenza A (H5N1) infections since July 2005.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn36">36</xref> In 2006 the number of new cases spiked to 55 infections, up from 19 the year before.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn37">37</xref> The case fatality rate had also risen to 80.4% from 63.2% in 2005, and in 18% of cases it was unclear if the patient had interacted with sick or dead poultry.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn38">38</xref> These trends were extremely concerning: the data were indicative of the emergence of a more virulent form of H5N1 and the start of human-to-human transmission of a virus that was previously transmitted to humans only through close contact with infected birds.</p><p id="Par57">This is when Indonesia made its move. In December 2006, Indonesian Health Minister, Dr. Siti Fadilah Supari announced that Indonesia was withdrawing its support from the GISN. It would no longer be sharing its virus samples until it could be guaranteed fairer access to the vaccines and antivirals created using them.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn39">39</xref> The Indonesians cited the CBD as the basis for their argument, claiming sovereign control over the influenza viruses isolated within their territory.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn40">40</xref> Since ratifying the CBD in the mid-1990s, Indonesian domestic law required that international transfers of biological materials occurred under material transfer agreements (MTAs), but Indonesia had apparently &#x0201c;made a dispensation and had faithfully shared the specimens to the WHO system&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn41">41</xref> Indonesia highlighted what it saw as the unfair practices of the GISN: expecting individual nations to freely provide the raw materials required by pharmaceutical companies to produce vaccines and antivirals, that were then patented and sold at a profit to those provider nations.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn42">42</xref>
</p><p id="Par62">As stated, Indonesia&#x02019;s refusal to share its influenza viruses was not quite as out of the blue as most accounts portray it to have been. What was different this time was that the epidemiological data pointed to Indonesia being the probable emergence site of the next influenza pandemic strain. The thing that could inflict great devastation for Indonesia&#x02019;s people was also the thing that gave the Indonesian government enough leverage to negotiate with the WHO and put them on a better footing to deal with that very possibility. At the time, Indonesia&#x02019;s actions were described as &#x0201c;a form of moral blackmail&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn43">43</xref> and denounced as &#x0201c;morally reprehensible&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn44">44</xref> However, such condemnation failed to acknowledge that domestic governments can be claimed to have &#x0201c;a moral obligation to provide for the health and wellbeing of its citizens&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn45">45</xref>
</p><p id="Par66">One other point of difference was the framing of Indonesia&#x02019;s argument. The invocation of the CBD to claim sovereign authority over their virus samples meant that this issue and the ensuing discussions about this issue were couched in the access and benefit-sharing (ABS) language of the CBD. This was significant because the CBD provided a very clear statement about the sovereign rights of nation states over their genetic resources.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn46">46</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Viruses and the CBD</title><p id="Par68">The United Nations&#x02019; CBD was signed at the Rio Earth Summit in 1992 and now has 196 State Parties.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn47">47</xref> It is an environmental conservation treaty with three objectives:<disp-quote><p id="Par70">the conservation of biological diversity, the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn48">48</xref>
</p></disp-quote>
</p><p id="Par72">It is this third objective, which has been abbreviated to &#x0201c;access and benefit-sharing&#x0201d; (ABS) that was at the core of the Indonesians&#x02019; sovereignty claims. In order to ensure the &#x0201c;fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources&#x0201d;, the CBD reaffirms &#x0201c;the sovereign rights of states over their natural resources&#x0201d;, and clearly states that &#x0201c;the authority to determine access to genetic resources rests with the national governments&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn49">49</xref> In controlling the terms of access to their genetic resources, countries are able to demand a quid pro quo. This was supposed to address (or perhaps redress) the market failure of conservation, capturing the genetic resources in the sovereign domain of the nation state so that access to those resources could be traded for money or other benefits, ultimately creating an economic incentive to conserve them. This then delivered on the CBD&#x02019;s other objective of sustainable development.</p><p id="Par74">The GISN&#x02019;s continued operation after the adoption and entry into force of the CBD was an implicit statement by the WHO that it did not consider viruses to be within the remit of the CBD.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn50">50</xref> That the GISN informally transferred influenza viruses to privately owned and operated pharmaceutical companies was a further reiteration of this position. Viruses are unequivocally &#x0201c;genetic resources&#x0201d; within the remit of the CBD.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn51">51</xref> But this does not necessarily mean that they should be.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn52">52</xref> The CBD, and its supplementary Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilisation (Nagoya Protocol)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn53">53</xref> prescribes a default bilateral ABS system. That is, the party that wants to utilise genetic resources (whether for commercial or non-commercial purposes, including research and development) must obtain &#x0201c;prior informed consent&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn54">54</xref> from the originating nation state<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn55">55</xref> and negotiate &#x0201c;mutually agreed terms&#x0201d;<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn56">56</xref> for the sharing of associated benefits. This bilateral mode of ABS is cumbersome as it requires parties to negotiate terms anew every time a user party requires access to genetic resources; the process is slow and the transaction costs are high. It is evidently ill-suited to the rapid sharing of ever-evolving pathogens, particularly highly variable RNA viruses like influenza.

The situation surrounding the discovery of the MERS coronavirus was controversial. Working from a hospital in Jeddah, Egyptian microbiologist Dr. Mohammed Ali Zaki was unable to determine the causative agent of his patient&#x02019;s pneumonia. He sent a specimen to Dutch virologists at Erasmus Medical Center (EMC), apparently without the consent of the Saudi Ministry of Health. The researchers at Erasmus were able to isolate the virus and sequence its genome.

The CBD gave Indonesia the legal backing to claim sovereignty over viruses as genetic resources. This was the one and only opportunity that the WHO had to make it clear that global health emergencies were one instance where the world should consider foregoing a measure of sovereignty to prioritise the outbreak and research response required in such instances. Undoubtedly this was an extremely difficult situation for the WHO to have to arbitrate. But with hindsight we can now see that Indonesia&#x02019;s sovereignty claim in 2007 may have been the WHO&#x02019;s only chance to take a firm stance on this issue and call for the broad exemption of all pathogens during a global health emergency. It is an oft-noted fact that pathogens pay no mind to the Westphalian principles of international law, and the WHO had reason to likewise sideline that system when lives are threatened by the international spread of infectious diseases. This would, however, undermine the sovereignty of nation states, and as a UN agency, the WHO could not endorse such a proposition.</p><p id="Par184">This criticism ignores the fact that Indonesia&#x02019;s sovereignty claim in 2007 was situated in a global context where countries had been exercising sovereign control over virus samples and associated data since the early 2000s, though it was never referred to as such. Perhaps the writing was on the wall.

This is a bargaining chip that has its greatest value precisely when the most lives are at stake, and it could just be the only option available to LMICs to redress some of the &#x0201c;embedded structural inequalities&#x0201d; of global health preparedness and response.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn124">124</xref> The CBD gave us the language of resource sovereignty; the Indonesians applied it to a human pathogen; and the PIP Framework locked it in as a legal norm. The transfer of pathogen samples, and now the epidemiological data related to the pathogen, must now be negotiated with reference to the principles of ABS: prior informed consent, mutually agreed terms, and benefit-sharing. The message from the WHO&#x02019;s handling of the Indonesia situation was clear: if your country happens to be the emergence site of a pathogen that is sufficiently interesting to scientists that it is deemed valuable, then your best bet is to control access to that pathogen to leverage some sort of benefit for your country.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn125">125</xref>

One of the objectives of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) is to &#x0201c;[s]trengthen the global norm of rapid, transparent reporting and sample sharing&#x0201d;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn129">129</xref> but as we have seen, this is no longer the norm.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par193">The legal concept of viral sovereignty is a phenomenon of the new millennium, and it is one we are stuck with. The international regime created by the CBD and Nagoya Protocol defaults to bilateral ABS negotiations on a case-by-case basis.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn130">130</xref> This default mode of ABS is extremely time consuming and not appropriate in global health emergencies where time costs lives. The PIP Framework uses an alternative mode: a multilateral agreement that might be considered a specialised ABS instrument under the Nagoya Protocol. But the PIP Framework has major flaws as an ABS instrument<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn131">131</xref> and, as we have seen with H7N9 influenza in China, can be easily circumvented by any party not wishing to accept its standardised terms and conditions.</p><p id="Par196">One option would be to amend the IHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) to mandate the sharing of biological samples.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn132">132</xref> But this, like an overarching exemption to ABS for pathogen samples and epidemiological data during public health emergencies, is not an acceptable solution because it completely ignores the demands of LMICs for equitable benefit-sharing. While the IHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) is a binding agreement, it is regularly criticised as being toothless. Any amendment to mandate sample sharing under the IHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) would require a rider detailing sanctions if it is to affect any nations&#x02019; cost-benefit analysis during a public health emergency. Attaching sanctions to the IHR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR02">2005</xref>) is likely to be unpalatable for many countries, not just LMICs. Therefore, Article 4(4) of the Nagoya Protocol on specialised ABS instruments may provide the only avenue to deal with the issue of viral sovereignty. It would allow for the adoption of a multilateral agreement that, like the PIP Framework, would put the WHO at the centre of a constellation of stakeholders. Carter has argued &#x0201c;that the WHO must offer positive incentives so developing countries will have a compelling reason to share samples of newly discovered viruses with the international scientific and health communities&#x0201d;,<xref ref-type="fn" rid="Fn133">133</xref> and a multilateral instrument might be a mechanism through which to do that.</p><p id="Par199">Benefit-sharing was a core component of all three of the CBD&#x02019;s objectives. The international community must come up with a solution to facilitate access to pathogen samples and epidemiological information that respects the sovereign rights of nation states and shares the benefits associated with the use of their resources. If we fail to find a solution that aligns with the object and purpose of the CBD, then individual nations will simply opt to negotiate access terms on an ad hoc basis, and lives will likely be lost in the process. As the examples here indicate, many of those lives are likely to be in the rich countries of the world. This suggests that a solution is possible because the consequences of inaction are not just the burden of the LMICs.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="Fn1"><label>1</label><p id="Par4">After the adoption of the <italic>Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework</italic> in 2011, the GISN was renamed the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS).</p></fn><fn id="Fn2"><label>2</label><p id="Par5">Sedyaningsih et al.
