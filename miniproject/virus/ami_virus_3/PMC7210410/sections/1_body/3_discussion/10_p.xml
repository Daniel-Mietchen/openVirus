<p id="p0135">In conclusion, this study demonstrates the occurrence of high rates of acute and long-term or persistent B19V infections, as well as a high prevalence of anti-B19V IgG, among blood donors in a post-epidemic period. It also provides the first data on the prevalence of B19V in this population in Argentina. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and factors influencing B19V persistent infection, as well as follow-up studies of recipients in the context of haemo-surveillance programs.</p>
