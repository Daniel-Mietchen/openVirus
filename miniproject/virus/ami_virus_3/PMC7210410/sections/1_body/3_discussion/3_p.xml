<p id="p0100">DNA-positive individuals were 32–53 years. This contrasts with the report from Ke et al. [
 <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], where 21 of 23 positive donors were &lt;35 years old. A high frequency of the virus in older donors might seem striking. However, persistent infections for long periods of time, decades and possibly life-long, have been reported [
 <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. In line with this, in our series only one individual had ongoing acute infection while the remaining six had long-term/potentially persistent infections (all of them but one with low/medium levels of IgG). Less plausibly, the occurrence of asymptomatic re-infections could also be considered, although reinfections are rarely described events that have been confirmed in specific cases [
 <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
