 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. B19V DNA was determined in two independent repetitions by PCR, using 2-μl DNA extract in TE buffer with primers 5′CACTATGAAAACTGGGCAATAAAC and 5′AATGATTCTCCTGAACTGGTCC. The target is a 242-nucleotide NS1 fragment (2035–2276 on GenBank NC_000883.2), which was amplified at an annealing temperature set at 55 °C (35 rounds) [
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The reaction contained 5% DMSO, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.8 mM nucleotide mixture, 0.2 μM each primer, and 0.02 U/μl Taq DNA polymerase in the provided buffer (Invitrogen). PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in silver-stained 10% polyacrylamide gels [

 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The technique was validated previously, using different panels of serum samples, such as 26 known B19V-positive specimens (by a nested PCR technique) [
 <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] of which 25 were also positive with protocol used in the present study, and 35 known B19V-negative samples (25 random serum specimens and 10 serum with confirmed post-vaccine measles/rubella after MMR inoculation), all of which resulted negative, accounting for 96,2% sensitivity and 100% specificity.
