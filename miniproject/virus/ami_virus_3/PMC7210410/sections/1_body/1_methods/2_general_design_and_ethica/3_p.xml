<p id="p0030">A minimum sample size was estimated to study B19V DNA prevalence using PCR. All PCR-positive samples were subsequently subjected to quantitative PCR and specific IgM and IgG testing to identify acute and persistent infections in the study population. Taking into account that all the individuals in the study group were asymptomatic, the following combination of immunological parameters were considered: I. DNA-positive/IgG-negative and IgM-positive or negative accounting for ongoing acute infection; II. DNA-positive/IgG-positive/IgM-positive, recent acute infection; III. DNA-positive/IgG-positive/IgM-negative was interpreted as long-term infection or potentially persistent infection.</p>
