<p id="p0075">Plasma samples from 731 donors were assayed by PCR. The age range of donors was 16–68 years (mean 34.6 ± 10.5, 95%CI: 33.8–35.4); 599 (82%) were &lt;45 years old (estimated population odds 4.5, 95%CI 3.6–5.5) and 419 (57%) were male (estimated population odds 1.3, 95%CI 1.2–1.6). The sampling was distributed homogeneously through the entire study period (
