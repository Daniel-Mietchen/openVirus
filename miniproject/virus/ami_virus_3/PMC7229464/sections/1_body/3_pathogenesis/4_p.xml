<p id="par0115">The discrepancies in the results from different challenged studies are very confusing since these SeACoV strains were obtained from the same source in the first outbreaks. One explanation may be attributed to the sequence differences in the SeACoV cell adapted strains used for challenge. By comparative analysis, we found that the sequences of CH/GD-01/2017 and CN/GDWT/2017 are almost identical at the genome level (99.9 %), with no insertions and deletions, whereas GDS04-P12 shares 99.7 % or 99.8 % nt identity with CH/GD-01/2017 or CN/GDWT/2017, repectively. GDS04-P12 has 14 nt in gaps, including a 1-nt deletion (A) at nt 179, a 10-nt insertion (GACTAGAGCC) at nt 12,483-12,494, a 1-nt insertion (A) at nt 27,058-27,059, a 1-nt insertion (T) at nt 27,067-27,068, and a 1-nt insertion (A) in nt 27,074-27,075. The other factors, such as the age of the piglets (all were 3- or 4-day-old), the source of the piglets (conventional status), and the geographical environment where these experiments were performed (all were done in Guangdong), may not contribute to the observed differences.</p>
