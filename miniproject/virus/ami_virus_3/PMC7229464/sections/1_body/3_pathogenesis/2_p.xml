<p id="par0105">The molecular mechanism of how SeACoV antagonizes the host innate immune response has been preliminarily studied. SeACoV interfered with the activity of IPS-1 and RIG-I to inhibit the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3 to block IFN-Î² production (

A mouse infection model has been established for SeACoV with active viral replication in splenic dendritic cells, which suggests that SeACoV may be susceptible to rodents (
