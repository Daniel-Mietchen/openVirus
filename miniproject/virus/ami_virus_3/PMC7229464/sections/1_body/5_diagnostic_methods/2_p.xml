<p id="par0145">With increasing throughput and decreasing costs, next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology is increasingly being used for diagnosis of pathogens in clinical samples. In fact, except for initial isolation (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>), complete genome sequences of SeACoV strains have been determined by assembling and mapping sequencing reads with NGS data initially by two independent groups (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>). Current SeACoV diagnostic assays can be divided into two categories: molecular and serological methods. Molecular methods detect viral nucleic acid, while serological assays detect the antibodies induced in host immune responses to infection. Since the initial outbreak of SeACoV in 2017, multiple detection methods have been established to monitor the epidemic. A summary of current SeACoV diagnostic assays and their properties are presented in
