<p id="par0155">The most commonly used serological assays include the indirect fluorescent assay (IFA) and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The IFA detection method is mainly used in laboratory research on the mechanism of viral replication and infection. SeACoV is antigenically distinct from PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV, and antibodies against the N protein do not cross-react (

In addition, our preliminary result showed that virus-specific sera from SeACoV, PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV-infected pigs do not cross-react in IFA tests (unpublished data). Since SeACoV was first isolated in pigs vaccinated with PEDV vaccines (
