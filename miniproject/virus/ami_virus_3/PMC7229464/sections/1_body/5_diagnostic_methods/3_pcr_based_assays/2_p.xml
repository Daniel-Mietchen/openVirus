<p id="par0150">PCR is one of the most commonly used rapid detection methods in clinical diagnosis. In order to identify the etiological agent associated with outbreaks of diarrhea in newborn piglets, a pair of conserved primers was used to confirm a 251bp fragment in ORF1b by conventional RT-PCR of a region 100 % identical to the corresponding part of four bat HKU2-CoV strains (

In addition there is a multiplex real-time RT-qPCR assay for simultaneous detection of swine enteric PEDV, PDCoV (both targeting the M gene), TGEV and SeACoV (both targeting the N gene) (
