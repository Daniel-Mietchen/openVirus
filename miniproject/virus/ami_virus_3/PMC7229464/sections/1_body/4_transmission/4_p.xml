<p id="par0135">The direct progenitor of SeACoV is not the prototype HKU2-CoV identified in 
 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> in 2004 and 2006, due to a low sequence identity (86 %) of the S gene (

 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic>, 
 <italic>Rhinolophus sinicus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Rhinolophus rex</italic> from seven different locations in Guangdong province between 2013 and 2016 (

 <italic>Rhinolophus affinis</italic> were more closely related to that of SeACoV (âˆ¼98 % aa sequence identity), indicating that horseshoe bats are reservoirs of HKU2-like CoVs. The phylogenetic, haplotype network and recombination analyses suggested that SeACoV had probably been introduced from these HKU2-like CoVs independently, and that some strains might have undergone further intragenotypic recombination (
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>). However, it is still not clear how the virus was transmitted from bats to pigs. In fact, it is hardly possible that pigs in captivity could contact flying bats directly in the four pig farms with disease outbreaks.
