<p id="par0125">Like other porcine enteric viruses, SeACoV is transmitted through the fecal-oral route. This has been demonstrated by challenge experiments in pigs using the cell-cultured SeACoV strains (

Other swine CoVs may be able to utilize different routes of infection. For example, PEDV invasion through the nasal cavity (respiratory tract) can also cause intestinal mucosal disease (
