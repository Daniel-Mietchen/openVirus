<p id="par0130">Considering that the zoonotic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from bats and jumped between intermediate hosts (civets and camels, respectively), SeACoV may pose a similar risk to human health through transmission from pigs or other potential intermediate hosts (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019b</xref>). The zoonotic potential of SeACoV was assessed 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, showing that SeACoV was able to grow efficiently in nine human and monkey cell lines. As a conserved receptor across different animal species for SeACoV cell entry has been proposed, SeACoV may pose a similar risk to human health through interspecies transmission from pigs in the future (
