<p id="par0025">SeACoV was discovered in Guangdong province, China in 2017. Initially, outbreaks of severe diarrhea of suckling piglets occurred in four swine herds in a mountainous area of northern Guangdong (
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). Our laboratory was the first group to isolate and characterize this new virus in Vero cells, and determined its genome to be closely related to the species 
 <italic>Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2</italic> in the subgenus 
 <italic>Rhinacovirus</italic> (

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>). The latter nomenclature is attractive, likely due to name similarity to SARS-CoV (
 <italic>severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV</italic> of humans) which may make it easier to gain media attention. However, since the actual pathogenicity of this new virus is still controversial based on current evidence (see main text below), the presumed name “SADS” (also easily confused with “SARS”) may not be appropriate in the future in our opinion. Therefore, SeACoV is the name we will use to refer to this new virus in this review.
