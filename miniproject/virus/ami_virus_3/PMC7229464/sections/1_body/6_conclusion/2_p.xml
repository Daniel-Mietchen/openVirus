 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>). Although the virus reemerged in Fujian in 2018 and Guangdong in 2019, there have not been large-scale losses reported, which is positive news for its prevention and control. However, it is strange that SeACoV has not resulted in a large-scale epidemic in the pig industry in Guangdong in recent years, similar to the way SARS-CoV emerged in 2003 and then basically disappeared (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Ksiazek et al., 2003</xref>) until the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 at the end of 2019 (
 <xref rid="bib0205" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). This outbreak of the novel SARS-CoV-2 and current pandemic also requires strict control to ensure the health of people around the world. Since all CoVs have the capability for recombination, no CoV epidemic can be taken lightly, even those in pigs (
