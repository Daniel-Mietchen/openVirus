<p id="par0170">More research is needed to understand the infectious properties of SeACoV and HKU2-related CoVs, especially given their broad ability to infect cell lines from various animal origins (
 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019b</xref>). The presumed name “SADS-CoV” may not be appropriate since the available pathogenicity studies have not provided strong evidence of high virulence. The reverse genetic system for SeACoV has been established successfully in our lab (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>), which will facilitate future studies exploring the molecular mechanisms of SeACoV replication and pathogenicity. With the structural analysis of SeACoV and HKU2 S glycoproteins, it is also important to identify the primary receptor and study the mechanism of receptor binding. It is clear now more than ever that CoV-induced diseases not only pose a huge threat to the pig industry but also to human health. If HKU2-related CoVs emerge again, causing unknown damage to the pig industry, such basic research on SeACoV will be necessary to prevent and control future epidemics.
