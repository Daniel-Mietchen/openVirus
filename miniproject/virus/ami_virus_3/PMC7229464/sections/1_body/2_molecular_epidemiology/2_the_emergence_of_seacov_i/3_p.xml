<p id="par0075">During early outbreaks, the SeACoV genome sequences identified from three independent groups were 99.8–100 % identical to each other (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> ). These SeACoV strains from the same source include “PEAV” GDS04 and GDS04-P12 (GenBank accession nos. MF167434 and MH697599) (
 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Gong et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2019</xref>), “SeACoV” CH/GD-01/2017 (MF370205) (

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>). Except for an extra 7 nt (ACATGGG) at the 5′-terminus of the genome, no insertions/deletions were found among the five SADS-CoV strains in comparison with SeACoV and its cell adapted strain P10 (MK977618) which is 27,155 nt in genomic length (

 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>), we suggest that MK977618 may represent a reference strain for sequence comparison. MK977618 is 6 nt longer than the prototype bat CoV HKU2/GD430 strain (27,149 nt), including a 3-nt (TTG) insertion at nt 4,555-4,557 in the nsp3 region, a 6-nt (GGCCTC) insertion at nt 20,508-20,513 in the S gene, and a 3-nt (GTT) deletion at nt 24,780- 24,781 in the M gene.
