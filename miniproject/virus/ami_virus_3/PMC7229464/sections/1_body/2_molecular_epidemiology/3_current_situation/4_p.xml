<p id="par0100">SeACoV has not been reported in other provinces in China or in any other regions in the world. All the identified sequences in pigs to date belong to a sublineage “SeACoV/PEAV/SADS-CoV” which shares &gt;99.5 % nt identities, and is closely related to the bat “HKU2-like CoV” sublineage, together forming the species 
 <italic>Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2</italic> in the genus 
 <italic>Alphacoronavirus</italic> (
 <xref rid="fig0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, some globally distributed rodent CoVs are phylogenetically related to this species (

 <xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr">Tsoleridis et al., 2019</xref>). Taken together, it is not clear whether the sporadic emergences of SeACoV in Guangdong and Fujian from 2016 to 2019 resulted from multiple instances of bat HKU2-like CoVs spillover. Thus, it is necessary to track the evolution of the species 
 <italic>Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2</italic> in order to better understand its epidemiology and prevent further outbreaks and spread in China. Further discussion is in Section
