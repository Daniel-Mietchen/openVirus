<p id="par0045">M and E proteins are major components of the viral envelope and are required for the viral assembly process (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">de Haan et al., 2000</xref>). Apart from that, the N protein is the most highly conserved structural protein among CoVs, and plays an important role in the packaging of virus particles

 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al., 2000</xref>). Specific polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) are usually generated based on viral structural proteins, and immunofluorescence assay using pAbs against N, M and S1 proteins have been used to detect SeACoV infection in cultured cells. Anti-N and anti-M pAbs have also been used for specific detection of SeACoV infection with expected molecular size (42- and 25-KDa, respectively) by western blot (

 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>). In addition, rabbit antiserum against SeACoV Nsp3 acidic domain has been validated for use in the time course analysis of viral protein expression using confocal images, which detected the Nsp3 expression as early as 4 h post-infection in SeACoV-infected cells (

 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Three accessory proteins (ORF3, NS7a and NS7b) have been identified within the SeACoV genome based on analysis of leader-body junctions in specific subgenomic mRNAs, though their functions remain to be confirmed experimentally (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>). Similar to the other CoVs like PEDV and TGEV (
 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Ji et al., 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">Ortego et al., 2003</xref>), ORF3 is dispensable for SeACoV infection 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> since replacement with green fluorescent protein (GFP) in this position does not affect recovery of the recombinant virus (unpublished data).
