<p id="par0040">Among the four viral structural proteins, the S glycoprotein of SeACoV is the major protein involved in the viral entry 
 <italic>via</italic> cellular receptor binding, and it induces host immune responses through the induction of neutralizing antibodies. The SeACoV S protein shares 86.4 % amino acid (aa) identity with the bat HKU2/GD430 strain, supporting a common ancestry (

 <xref rid="bib0175" ref-type="bibr">Yu et al., 2020</xref>). The trimeric structures of HKU2 and SeACoV S proteins (resolutions of 2.38 Å and 2.83 Å, respectively) are very similar, with differences mainly found in the N- and C-terminal domains of the S1 subunit, which is responsible for cell attachment and receptor binding. Both the HKU2 and SeACoV S protein carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) structures have a single-layer core consisting of a twisted, five-stranded antiparallel β sheet similar to the betacoronaviruses (

This suggests recombination between alpha- and betacoronavirus S glycoproteins, and reflects the evolutionary origin of the HKU2/SeACoV S protein at a structural level. Although the S2 subunit (which mediates membrane fusion) is also conserved, the conformation of the region after the fusion peptide of the HKU2-CoV and SeACoV S2 subunits are different from other CoVs. These results provide structural evidence of the close evolutionary relationship between HKU2-related CoV and betacoronavirus S proteins, and provide new insights into CoV evolution and cross-species transmission (
