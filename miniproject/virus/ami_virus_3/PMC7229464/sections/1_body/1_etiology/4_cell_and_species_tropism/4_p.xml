<p id="par0060">CoVs are known to utilize different primary cellular receptors to gain entry into host cells, including angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV), aminopeptidase N (APN) for TGEV and PDCoV and mouse carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (
