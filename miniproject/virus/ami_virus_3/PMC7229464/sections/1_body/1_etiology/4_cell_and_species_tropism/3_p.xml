<p id="par0055">Furthermore, cell lines originating from various tissues of humans and several animal species including bats, mice, rats, gerbils, hamsters, pigs, chickens and nonhuman primates, were tested for viral susceptibility and species tropism. Twenty-one of the 24 tested cell lines showed significant susceptibility to SeACoV infection, defined by efficient viral antigen expression and increased viral RNA titers (

Notably, SeACoV infects both primary and passaged cell lines of rodent origin, suggesting that rodents may be susceptible to SeACoV infection. In most cases, exogenous trypsin enhanced the propagation of SeACoV in susceptible cell lines. HeLa cells showed the highest susceptibility based on viral load detected in culture supernatants by quantitative RT-PCR (
