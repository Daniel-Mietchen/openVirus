<p id="par0035">Like the other CoVs, morphological observations by electron microscopy have revealed that SeACoV has the crown-like characteristics typical of the spike (S) protein distribution on the surface of the viral envelope (

 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>). SeACoV particles are round with a diameter of 100–120 nm (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> A), and are covered with dimly visible trimers of S protein (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A and B). Bat enteric alphacoronavirus HKU2 strains were first reported from Guangdong province and Hong Kong in 2004 and 2006 during the search for the source of SARS-CoV (
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Lau et al., 2007</xref>). The prototype SeACoV (CH/GD-01/2017 strain) shares 94.9 % nucleotide (nt) sequence identity with the four bat HKU2 strains (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>). The SeACoV genome is 27,155 nt long with a 5ʹ cap and a 3ʹ polyadenylated tail, and contains a 5ʹ untranslated region (UTR) followed by nine open reading frames (ORFs) and a 3ʹ UTR (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C). RNA synthesis in SeACoV is carried out by a replicase-transcriptase composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b, which are located in the 5ʹ two-thirds of the genome (
 <xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr">Pan et al., 2017</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>). The 3ʹ third harbors ORFs that encode four structural proteins [S; envelope (E); membrane (M); nucleocapsid (N)], an accessory ORF3 between S and E, and two overlapping ORFs (NS7a and NS7b) following the N gene (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018b</xref>) (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B and C). These structural and accessory genes are expressed from six subgenomic mRNAs including a bicistronic mRNA containing the accessory NS7a and NS7b genes (
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>D), which have been experimentally confirmed in SeACoV-infected cells (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>). The leader-body junction sequences of these subgenomic mRNAs are identical to the leader core sequence AACTAAA (
