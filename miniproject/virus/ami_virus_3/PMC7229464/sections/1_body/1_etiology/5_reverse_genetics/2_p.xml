<p id="par0065">Recovery of infectious virus from plasmids or RNA transcripts encoding cloned cDNAs corresponding to the viral genome is one of the most important experimental platforms for CoV research (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Almazan et al., 2014</xref>). Recently, our lab developed a DNA-launched reverse genetics system for SeACoV (the infectious clone “pSEA”) (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019a</xref>). The full-length consensus cDNA sequence of SeACoV (27,155 nt) was assembled and inserted into a modified bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) backbone plasmid that contains a cytomegalovirus promoter, a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme sequence and a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence and terminator. In addition, two silent mutations (A24222T and G24223C) in ORF3 were introduced in pSEA as a genetic marker to differentiate the parental virus. The recombinant SeACoV with the genetic marker can be recovered by direct transfection of cells with pSEA and a helper plasmid expressing the N gene, with similar growth kinetics to the parental virus (

 <xref rid="bib0170" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2019b</xref>). By introducing desired mutations into viral structural and nonstructural genes, the SeACoV reverse genetics system will facilitate functional analysis of replication and packaging signals, and can be exploited to engineer recombinant SeACoV for design of attenuated vaccines. Most recently, a reporter virus expressing GFP by replacement of ORF3 was generated to track SeACoV in cell culture based on this system in our lab (unpublished data), which will also allow for high-throughout screening of antivirals in the future.
