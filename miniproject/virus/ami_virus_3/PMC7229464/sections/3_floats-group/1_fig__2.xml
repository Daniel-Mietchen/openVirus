   <bold>Schematic representations of SeACoV genome organization and virion structure.</bold> (A) Electron micrograph of a purified SeACoV virus particle, clearly showing the typical viral surface projections of S protein. The scale bar represents 100 nm. (B) Schematic diagram of SeACoV virion structure with color-coded protein components. (C) The structure of SeACoV genomic RNA (27,155 bp) is shown at the top with 5สน and 3สน UTRs. ORF1a and ORF1b are co-translationally or post-translationally processed to encode a replicase-transcriptase complex composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16). Four structural proteins [spike (S); envelope (E); membrane (M); and nucleocapsid (N)] are encoded along with three accessory proteins (ORF3, NS7a and NS7b). (D) Genomic and subgenomic mRNAs containing the leader-body junction sites (LS) are shown with colors corresponding to the genome structure.
