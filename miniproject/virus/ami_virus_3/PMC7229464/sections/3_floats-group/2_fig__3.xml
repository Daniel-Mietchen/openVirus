   <bold>Phylogenetic analysis of the species 
    <italic>Rhinolophus bat coronavirus HKU2</italic> and other representative coronaviruses based on nucleotide sequences of the complete genomes.
   </bold> The tree was constructed by the neighbor-joining method using the MEGA X 10.1 software. Bootstrap values are indicated for each node from 1000 resamplings. The names of the viruses and strains as well as their GenBank accession numbers are depicted. The black solid circle indicates the reference sequence SeACoV p10 corresponding to the infectious clone capable of recovering the virus.
