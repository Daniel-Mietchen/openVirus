   <bold>Potential routes of interspecies transmission between HKU2-origin SeACoV and different hosts.</bold> The ability of SeACoV to infect various rodent cell lines and replicate in a murine infection model suggests rodents as a potentially susceptible host. The solid arrow indicates the known SeACoV transmission event from bat to pig that occurred in 2017. The dashed arrows with question marks indicate hypothetical or potential transmissions from bat to rodent, pig to rodent or 
   <italic>vice versa</italic>, and pig to human. See Section 
   <xref rid="sec0055" ref-type="sec">5</xref> for details of the proposed model.
