<p id="Par8">In determining the fate of novel coronavirus, measurements should be conducted with great care regarding conditions and characterizing the media composition. The purity of theÂ stock of virus must be checked fully. Many efforts should be made to explain the novel coronavirus concentrations in gene copies and infected units. The recommendation of using oxidants and disinfectants to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 must be experimentally based, which includes testing dose demand and contact time under the environmental conditions at which the virus would be presented. In applying light-based processes to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2, attenuation through the treated water must be fully reported. Researchers should also study the surrogate virus, similarly as the well-investigated nonenveloped bacteriophage MS2, thus enabling different laboratories in world to compare their findings among different global communities.</p>
