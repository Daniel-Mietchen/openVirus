<p id="Par4">The survival of SARS-CoV-2 on solid surfaces might be of high importance. For example, the novel coronavirus may survive for prolonged periods on surfaces such as latex gloves, sterile sponges, aluminum, wood, laminate, steel and plastics. Viruses usually have longer survival in a host and thus may have increased likelihood of transmission. Similarly, complete information is essential on how the novel coronavirus interacts with surfaces on a mask that vary in composition, material Â and pore size to understand survival and protection. Systematically designed experiments will help us gain insight into the virus survival on various surfaces, thus minimizing the exposure of the novel coronavirus to the humans. Here, recent research in environmental chemistry has shown the role of surface materials on antimicrobial resistance (Khan et al.
