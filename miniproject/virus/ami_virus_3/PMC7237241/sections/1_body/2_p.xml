<p id="Par3">In the environment, SARS-CoV-2 may survive in the air, on the surfaces, in water and wastewater (Qu et al. 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2020</xref>). In the air, the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be present as droplets, or as dust, or particulate matter (PM). The decay of the virus under various environmental conditions would determine the survival of the virus. These conditions may include the size of particulate matter and aerosols, humidity and temperature. These suggest the potential role of climate change on occurrence and the fate of the virus. Environmental chemistry research on the fate of pollutants in air (Kfoury et al.

Future detailed investigations about the physiochemical role of environmental parameters of air might therefore address the control of future outbreaks or pandemics with greater efficiency.
