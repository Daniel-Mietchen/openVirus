<p id="Par7">The first detection of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage occurred on March 5, 2020 in the sewage systems of the Schiphol airoport and major cities in the Netherlands, only one week into the epidemic (Medema et al.

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2020</xref>). However, many poor communities lack the infrastructure to provide clean water, and therefore would face exposure of infectious viruses. Additionally, faulty plumbing in buildings may increase exposure to the viruses. Very limited data sets are available on human viruses in the literature. Research on enveloped-virus transmission and on the treatment of wastewater must include a wide range of enveloped viruses. Here, environmental chemists have developed a wide array of wastewater treatment techniques (Crini and Lichtfouse
