<p>It is clearly apparent that the work done thus far in the quest to contain the current 2019-nCoV outbreak is massive, focused, and resolute. It is also abundantly evident that a large quantum of work remains to be done in order for the current public health effort to be successful in containing the present outbreak. Managing this requires international cooperation using traditional and proven public health strategies that ultimately succeeded in the SARS epidemic. It is, however, inevitable that new zoonotic infections will emerge in the future. It is, therefore, an urgent priority for local and international health and wildlife regulatory authorities to structure and implement robust control mechanisms that effectively reduce human exposure to wild game meat and their products. In contrast to Africa, the consumption of wild game meat in Asia is not generally motivated by poverty, hunger, or starvation. The common motivations for the human consumption of wild game meat in Asia are for their purported medicinal value, and the supposed health-enhancing effects of certain varieties of wild game meat, or their products. Specific rare and exotic Asian and other international wild game and their products, are also consumed and offered to guests and influential persons in an effort to project status, prestige, and wealth, depending on the rarity of the animal involved. There is also the existence of wildlife trafficking between Asia and other regions of the world, which has created an international supply and demand chain, with savvy wildlife entrepreneurs marketing wild game meat and products as “traditional specialties,” in their effort to boost sales. The existence of local and international wildlife trade for meat and animal products needs urgent and decisive change. It is fervently hoped that the steadfast efforts by China, in partnership with the international community, will reap positive results with respect to 2019-nCoV control in the future weeks and months. Additionally, urgent international attention to and curtailment of the hitherto unregulated and commonplace trade in wild game, meat and products is essential if a repeat of the human and economic loss, and public fear and social disruption wreaked by the current 2019-nCoV outbreak is to be avoided in the future.</p>
