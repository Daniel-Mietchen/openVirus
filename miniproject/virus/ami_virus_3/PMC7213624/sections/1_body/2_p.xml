<p>Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are believed to have originated from bats, with common masked civets and dromedary camels respectively being intermediary hosts.

 </sup> SARS-like coronaviruses have been isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats, and may attach to and utilize the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in human lower respiratory tract cells to gain entry into these cells, thus facilitating transmission to, and initiating infection in, humans.

 </sup> The genomic sequence of 2019-nCoV is strikingly similar to that of SARS-like coronaviruses found in bats, and phylogenetic data from recent genomic studies on bat-associated coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV suggest that bats are the natural reservoir for coronaviruses in general, and 2019-nCoV in particular.

 </sup> It has been postulated that the reservoir for 2019-nCoV is the Chinese horseshoe bat, which is known to host SARS-like coronaviruses. It is now hypothesized that one of the reservoir coronavirus species in bats crossed the species barrier to an intermediate mammal host (presumed to be a masked civet) sold at the wet market at the epicenter of the current epidemic, with subsequent mutation and transmission to humans, initiating the present epidemic of COVID-19.
