<p>Coronaviruses have in the past been known to be the etiologic agents of mild upper respiratory infections in humans, similar to the ubiquitous and relatively benign “common cold”-type upper respiratory illnesses induced by the human rhinoviruses in adults and children. Subsequent to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak in the Middle East in 2012, global concerns regarding the pathogenicity and epidemic/pandemic potential of novel human coronaviruses began to emerge, with some experts predicting that novel coronaviruses could likely again cross the species barrier and present humans with future pandemic-potential infections.
