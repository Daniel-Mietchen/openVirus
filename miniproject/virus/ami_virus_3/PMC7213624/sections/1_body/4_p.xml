<p>The putative zoonotic origin of 2019-nCoV, and the zoonotic origins of the SARS and MERS epidemics, brings into sharp focus the existence of unregulated wet markets in China, trading in live wild game, game meat, and game products. Zoonotic origins for emerging viral infections are not new, with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, Ebola, influenza viruses, SARS, MERS, and a multitude of other viral illnesses all crossing the species barrier and causing devastating illness in humans, at enormous economic and human cost.

 </sup> The presence and availability of markets that trade in wild animals for human consumption, and for purchase as pets, greatly increases the potential for viral infections originating from these reservoir animals to jump to human populations. The complete ban on market trading and sale of wild game meat in China on January 26th, 2020 will help prevent zoonotic transmission of 2019-nCoV in the current epidemic and, to a certain degree, help prevent emergence of new zoonotic infections. Further social and cultural changes regarding wild game trading and consumption is required in China and worldwide, to prevent scenarios where regular emergence of zoonotic infections becomes commonplace, with their inevitably attendant economic and human costs. It is estimated that the SARS epidemic cost the global economy approximately $ 54 billion in 2003 alone. The 2015 MERS outbreak in the Republic of Korea resulted in a $2.6 billion loss for the South Korean tourism industry alone. The 2014 outbreak of Ebola in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone cost their already lean economies approximately $300 million. The human and economic costs of the 2019-nCoV outbreak to the global economy will, without doubt, be scrupulously studied after the present outbreak ends, and the global economic costs will be immense, and the human cost, agonizing. Each preventable zoonotic outbreak costs the country of origin and the world vast amounts of money and resources, and an inestimable cost in human lives, and if emerging zoonotic outbreaks can be prevented by severely limiting human exposure to wild animals and their trade, then effective measures to ensure that this occurs should be implemented by regulatory government authorities globally as soon as it is practicable.
