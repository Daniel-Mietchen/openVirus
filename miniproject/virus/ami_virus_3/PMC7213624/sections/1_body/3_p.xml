<p>It has been noted that the two previously known human coronaviruses causing epidemic disease and spread, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, had a relatively low rate of spread from an individual infected patient (an index referred to as its basic reproductive number- 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>°</sub>). The 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>°</sub> of SARS was estimated to be around 3, meaning that on average, each infected patient is presumed to spread the virus to three other individuals.

 <sub>°</sub> for 2019-nCoV is between 2.2 and 2.7.

 </sup> However, approximately 10% of individuals infected with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were associated with a phenomenon referred to as “super spreading,” associated with an

 </sup> Wide transmission and spread of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV occurred to a large extent by means of super-spreading events.

 </sup> Human super spreaders for 2019-nCoV have not been identified thus far in limited epidemiological studies conducted in the past 6 weeks of the outbreak.

 </sup> However, clinicians and researchers should be acutely aware of the likelihood for the potential existence of such transmitters of 2019-nCoV infection in the general population, and of the means to identify and isolate such individuals expeditiously to prevent a reduction of the current epidemic doubling time of approximately 7 days, and to limit viral transmission and spread.

 </sup> A compelling mathematical modeling study done by researchers at the Hong Kong University indicates, despite limitations to their study, that these figures may not be a fair representation of the actual scale of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in China. They estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2.68 (95% confidence interval 2.47–2.86) and the epidemic doubling time was 6.4 days (95% Confidence interval 5.8–7.1 days).

 </sup> Ominously, a further mathematical model, proposed by Tang 
 <italic>et al</italic>,

 </sup> suggests that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV might be as high as 6.47.
