<p id="Par3">Influenza A virus (IAV) is a highly infectious upper respiratory tract (URT) disease in humans and animals caused by a negative-sense segmented RNA virus. It is recognized as a major public health concern resulting yearly in significant disease and economic burden. Frequent nucleotide substitutions lead to changes on the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase glycoproteins on the surface of IAV particles (also known as antigenic drift) that contribute to the need for continuous vaccine updates. This evolutionary arms race between vaccine design and viral mutation contributes to annual influenza epidemics worldwide, which on average results in 3–5 million cases of severe illness and up to 291,000 to 646,000 deaths annually

 </sup>. The modular architecture of the segmented IAV genome allows for genetic re-assortment (antigenic shift) with other divergent IAVs, resulting in the sporadic emergence of novel viruses capable of causing large epidemics or pandemics. Circulation of a new IAV in the naive human population has caused pandemics in the past resulting in significant morbidity and mortality, the most notable in 1918 and 1919, when the Spanish flu killed ~20 to 50 million people worldwide
