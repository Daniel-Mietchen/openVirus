 </sup>. This has made the ferrets an ideal model to study the dynamics of IAV infection in URT. However, it is unknown whether there is similarity between the ferret and human URT microbiome in terms of composition and its temporal dynamics and modulation upon IAV infection. In this study, we examine the longitudinal diversity of the URT microbiome of influenza-infected and uninfected human cohorts, as well as control uninfected and experimentally infected ferrets. These experiments reveal a strong consistency in the microbiome composition and dynamics between the two host systems, demonstrating that experimentally infected ferrets recapitulate closely the modulation of the microbiome observed in naturally infected humans. Our results suggest that microbiome disturbance and resilience dynamics may be critical to addressing the bacterial co-infections associated with influenza-derived morbidity.
