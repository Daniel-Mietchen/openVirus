<p id="Par30">To further investigate the phylogenetic placement of the infected OTUs observed in our study among known Pseudomonas/Acinetobacter strains found in NCBI, we analyzed the infected OTUs (Otu000002_human, Otu000003_human and Otu000004_ferret) using BLAST against the “16S ribosomal RNA sequences (Bacteria and Archaea)” database and picked the top 25 reference hits that aligned with 100% coverage to each query sequence. Additionally, a few Euryarchaeota strains were also included as the outgroup. These reference sequences were then trimmed to extract the V1–V3 region, aligned to the query OTU sequences using clustalo (v 1.2.1), followed by phylogenetic tree building using RAxML (v 8.1.20) for 100 bootstrap iterations.</p>
