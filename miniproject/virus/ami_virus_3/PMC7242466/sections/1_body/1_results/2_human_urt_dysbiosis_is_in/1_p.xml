<p id="Par8">To complement the qualitative overview of the IAV-infected data points, we integrated additional clinical metadata including gender, antibiotic usage, and age, and included details of the amplification of IAV genomes from these samples to more accurately classify these data points as either positive or unknown for the presence of virus. Positive and unknown infected microbiomes were tested to determine if they were distinct enough to cluster separately based on their beta-diversity. Analyses of the beta-diversity metrics using PCoA, focusing just on the IAV-infected samples, did not allow deriving any conclusions from this analysis alone. In addition, the grouping of infected samples based on gender did not show any significant association (ANOSIM 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.01, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.118 d
 <italic>f</italic> 1), implying that there was no significant effect of gender on the clustering of the samples (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). When we used distances between the samples as the response variable (ADONIS d
 <italic>f</italic> 1, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.009), only 0.9% of the variation in the distances was explained when the gender of the patients was accounted for as a predictor of the model. Hence, sex could not be correlated with the microbiome of the infected human samples. Age and effects of post visit antibiotic treatment on the microbiome trends were also examined. Little association could be observed between post visit antibiotic usage and clustering of the infected human samples in two statistical tests (ANOSIM d
 <italic>f</italic> 1 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.242, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001, and ADONIS d
 <italic>f</italic> 1, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.042), which was surprising. However, the age of the patients seemed to have some influence on the sample grouping when all 26 categorical values were taken into consideration (ANOSIM d
 <italic>f</italic> 37 
 <italic>R</italic> = 0.402, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001). The statistical analyses show that while the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value was significant, the clustering on the basis of age was only moderately strong (ADONIS 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.427, d
 <italic>f</italic> 37; Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Since there was no indication of this effect among IAV-infected patients in the ordination plots (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>), it is possible that the significant 
 <italic>p</italic>-value could be attributed to the high number of samples or the differences in dispersion among the different sample groupings, emphasizing the importance of considering in the analysis both the 
 <italic>p</italic>-value and the effect size. Finally, while both vaccination status (ADONIS d
 <italic>f</italic> 2 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.24, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) and viral subtype (ADONIS d
 <italic>f</italic> 2 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.25, 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001) were examined and found to be significant, there was little indication of a real grouping in the ordination plot (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">2</xref>).
