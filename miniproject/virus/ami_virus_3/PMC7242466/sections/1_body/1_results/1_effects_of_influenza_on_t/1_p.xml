<p id="Par6">In order to determine if the human microbiome structure is modulated by the IAV infection, we established a human cohort study and obtained nasopharyngeal swabs at multiple time points after the initial influenza-prompted hospital visits (days 1–37 after initial onset of symptoms) from 28 human subjects recruited during 2011 and 2012. As healthy controls, we included nasal swab samples taken at six time points (days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and 28) from 22 healthy human subjects free of any respiratory infections (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). At the extreme age ranges, the case and controls were not age balanced, with a lack of healthy controls for the nine cases older than 65 years in age and the two cases that were younger than 5 years in age. Our goal was to assess and compare the temporal microbiome biodiversity in response to ecological disturbances of the URT caused by viral infection.
