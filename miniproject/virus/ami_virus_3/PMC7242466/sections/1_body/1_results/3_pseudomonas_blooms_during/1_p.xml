<p id="Par9">We examined taxonomic profiles for all the infected and healthy patients across all the time points using the taxa abundance values for the top ten most prevalent taxa at the class level, sorted by the most prevalent taxa in each cohort; 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> in the infected patient cohort and 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> in the healthy patient cohort (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). All other taxa were pooled into an additional taxon named “Other”. 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was the most abundant taxonomic group in all samples from influenza-infected individuals (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; and Supplementary Figs. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">3</xref> and 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). A phylogenetic inference places this OTU robustly as the genus 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>; however, this analysis cannot resolve the OTU to the species level (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">5</xref>). Less-abundant phyla included 
 <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, 
 <italic>Firmicutes</italic>, 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic>, and some other families of 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, like 
 <italic>Rhodanobactereceae</italic> and 
 <italic>Pasteurellaceae</italic> (c. 
 <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>) and 
 <italic>Brucellaceae</italic> of the 
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic> order (c. 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>). 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was also clearly identified as the predominant taxon when temporal dynamic analyses were done on individuals independently (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). As for the uninfected subjects, 
 <italic>Actinobacteria</italic> was the most dominant taxon, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> was the least-abundant taxonomic group present, also seen when individual subjects were analyzed (Supplementary Fig. 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">6</xref>). Other less-abundant phyla included 
 <italic>Verrucomicrobia</italic> and within the 
 <italic>Proteobacteria</italic>, the 
 <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic>, and 
 <italic>Epsilonproteobacteria</italic> classes.
