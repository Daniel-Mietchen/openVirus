<p id="Par13">A random-forest analysis was also used to identify predictive features in the data. The method we developed iterates through unique random-forest models (each seeded with a different random state), and attempts to fit the model to a random subset of the data with five samples removed from the training set (see “Methods”). If the model could accurately predict all five of the omitted samples during the cross-validation step, then its feature importance vector (mean decrease gini index), including weights for every OTU’s predictive capacity, was collected. The results from the random-forest classification aligned with our diagnostic iDMM OTU prediction in the human samples (Supplementary Table 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">4</xref>). The analysis showed Otu000002 (unclassified 
 <italic>Pseudomonadales</italic>) to be the most predictive of the IAV-infected samples, followed by Otu000001 (
 <italic>Rhizobiales</italic>) and Otu000003 (
 <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>) with a maximum accuracy of 71%. When we examined the taxonomy of Otu000001 in detail, it was classified with 100% confidence down to Genus 
 <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic>, at which point the read length is unable to differentiate the species any further. Nevertheless, the actual OTU sequence is 100% identical to 
 <italic>Ochrobactum anthropi</italic>, an opportunistic human pathogen

 </sup>. Similarly, the in depth analyzes of Otu000006 identified the taxonomy of this OTU as uncultivated lineages of Rhodanobacter, which have also been previously associated with human respiratory tract microbiomes

 </sup>. Comparison with our negative controls confirmed that these were not contaminants and supported the notion that 
 <italic>Ochrobactrum</italic> was also diagnostic for the infection state in humans, which is likely to be consistent with the presence of 
 <italic>O. anthropii</italic> or similar opportunistic species.
