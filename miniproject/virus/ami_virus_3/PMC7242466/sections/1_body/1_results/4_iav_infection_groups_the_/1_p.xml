<p id="Par10">Due to the dynamic nature of the human URT microbiome during IAV infection, we hypothesized that infection perturbs the microbiome structure resulting in distinct signature microbiomes that differentiate infected from uninfected individuals. Thus, we used the Infinite Dirichlet-multinomial Mixture Model (iDMM)

 </sup>, which is an extension of the Dirichlet-multinomial mixture model (DMM)

 </sup> that helps understand and interpret taxon abundance data by adding statistical validation if a taxa is associated with a given caseâ€“control condition. This is an un-supervised clustering method that applies Bayesian statistics to quantitatively assess the data and accurately capture the features that are present. Essentially, given a set of subsampled distributions, the iDMM model predicts the original number of full-size distributions together with their composition. The nonparametric nature of the iDMM model makes it ideal for understanding the complex ecological data in this study, where the original number of the sampled communities (known as ecostates) is unknown.
