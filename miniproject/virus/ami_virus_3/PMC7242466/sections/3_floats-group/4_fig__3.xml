  <title>Diversity of the URT microbiome in ferrets during IAV infection.</title>
  <p>Beta-diversity analysis for longitudinal URT samples taken after experimental infection with the A/Netherlands/602/09 H1N1 strain (Infected) or in control animals. Principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) of Bray–Curtis distances was performed for all samples. Data points for uninfected ferrets are in blue, the 
   <italic>T</italic> = 0 for the infected ferrets in lavender, the 
   <italic>T</italic> = 14 for infected ferrets in cyan, and all other infected time points were collected at 1–7 days post infection and shown are in red. The total variability explained by all three principal coordinates (PCs) is shown on the axes. Each group of ferret was composed of seven animals. Source data are provided as a Source Data file.
