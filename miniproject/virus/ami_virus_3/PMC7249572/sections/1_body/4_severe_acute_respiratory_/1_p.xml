<p> The β-coronavirus genus is the etiological agent responsible for viral acute respiratory syndromes; the pandemic sarbecoviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and merbecovirus, MERS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the current pandemic of COVID-19 and is distinct from other coronavirus strains. SARS-CoV-2 relies on S1/S2 cleavage at viral entry as compared with SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Following the attachment of the receptor-binding domain (S1) to the ACE2-binding cellular site, the affinity of which is 10- to 20-fold higher than SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], the S1 subunit is shed resulting in a stable and accessible fusion domain (S2) subunit [
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the plasma membrane fusion pathway rather than the more immunogenic endosomal membrane fusion pathway, which is used by SARS-CoV. Amino acid sequence differences in the SARS-CoV-2 HR2 region enhances binding affinity between heptad repeat-1 (HR1) and HR2 thereby accelerating viral membrane fusion [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The presence of a unique furin cleavage site (RRAR) at the S1/S2 boundary and the furin-like S2′ site located between fusion peptide (FP) and internal fusion peptide (IFP) sites on the S2 subunit may provide a gain-of-function allowing cleavage during viral egress thereby directly or indirectly contributing to increased replication rate, transmission and disease severity [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Note that proteolytic cleavage of the S glycoprotein can determine whether the virus can cross species, e.g. from bat. While structurally similar to SARS-CoV-2, the RaTG13/2013 virus lacks a unique peptide PRRA insertion region at the S1/S2 boundary [
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Further, the S glycoprotein from a MERS-like coronavirus isolated from Ugandan bats can bind to human cells but cannot mediate virus entry unless incubated with trypsin prior to transduction allowing S glycoprotein cleavage and virus entry [
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These observations suggest that cleavage of the S glycoprotein may be a prerequisite to coronavirus cross-species transmission. A recent publication from Nankai University (Tianjin, China) on SARS-CoV-2 reported that genome sequence analysis revealed a section of genes that was not present in SARS-CoV that had a cleavage site similar to HIV and Ebola which carry viral proteins necessary for fusogenic activity of viral species to the human cell membrane. To be activated, the viral fusogenic surface glycoprotein has to be cleaved by furin [
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. As mentioned, viruses contain surface glycoproteins which when cleaved by furin or other proprotein convertases (PC) are activated and viral propagation is achieved (i.e., avian influenza, HIV, Ebola, Marburg and measles viruses) [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21–23</xref>]. Another PC necessary for viral entry is the transmembrane serine protease TMPRSS2, which is known to contribute to efficient SARS-CoV cell entry and Hoffman 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, has produced 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> data showing that SARS-CoV-2 also uses TMPRSS2 priming [
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, further assessment of furin cleavage 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> is appropriate given fusion-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV-1 rather than SARS-CoV via endocytosis, the presence of a unique furin cleavage site (RRAR) at the S1/S2 boundary and the furin-like S2′ site in SARS-CoV-2 and the combination of cell membrane entry fusion and differences in the SARS-CoV-1 HR1 domain, which may contribute to the typical syncytium growth pattern in infected cells rarely reported in SARS-CoV [
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Inhibition of furin may be a therapeutic approach that has efficacy in SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that contain a furin cleavage domain. Another immunotherapeutic intervention would be to increase the pulmonary expression of GM-CSF, which, 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, redirects macrophages from an M1 state of activation to an M2 activation state and enhances expression of anti-inflammatory mediators and perhaps allow more time for patients to mount an effective immune response against SARS-CoV-2 [
