<p>In addition to interfering in viral dynamics, a therapy-targeting host proteases rather than a viral epitope could also reduce the development of vaccine resistance due to mutation of nonessential viral-targeted antigens. For both reasons, furin is an attractive therapeutic target. It is highly conserved and genomically unrelated to viral replicative functions and antigenic drift [

We do not know how effective vaccination will be with SARS-CoV-2 given the low titers of NA in patients with COVID-19 and antigenic drift characteristic of human host RNA viruses. Vaccination for influenza virus is only effective in 60% of individuals due to rapid antigenic evolution.
