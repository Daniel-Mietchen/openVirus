<p>SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the current coronavirus outbreak is genetically distinct from both the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses. The first patient was diagnosed in Wuhan, China and subsequently, the virus spread rapidly locally and then escaped regional containment. Over 80,000 cases and 3000 deaths were observed early on. Worldwide travel restrictions and social distancing measures have since been implemented in an attempt to slow the spread and thereby ease the global burden on healthcare workers and facilities. However, worldwide spread continues to occur although regional containment in China and South Korea has been reported but thus far no well-documented effective therapeutic approach has been found. Although discovery of rapid SARS-CoV-2 infection testing and antibody assessment diagnostics have facilitated identification of hot spot regions. Continued manufacturing of these tests will allow for rapid identification of individuals with SARS-CoV-2Â or who have recovered and those who have antibody protection which will facilitate easing social-distancing measures.</p>
