<p>Viral pneumonia, particularly in elderly or immune compromised patients, can be associated with devastating medical consequence [
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>]. Pulmonary delivery via aerosolized systems are simple, nonexpressive, noninvasive and allow for pain-free access of therapeutic and minimization of possible systemic side effects [

 <italic>et al.</italic> successfully demonstrated the use of a SAW liquid nebulization device for the generation of aerosolized pDNA with suitable size and stability characteristics to facilitate effective pulmonary delivery particularly for IV vaccination [

 <italic>In vivo</italic> studies have shown successful pDNA delivery in both small and large animals. SAW nebulization used to deliver a plasmid vaccine demonstrated expression of protective anti-hemagglutinin (HA) antibodies. Anti-HA antibody titers detected were comparable to vaccination outcomes of other similar pDNA influenza vaccines not using a nebulizer [
 <xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>]. These results support use of naked pDNA for effective delivery via pulmonary distribution while also demonstrating product stability and function. Following pDNA vaccination in rats, revealed higher serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers which were identified as protective according to WHO standards [
 <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>]. However, at this time, the SAW nebulizer approach has not demonstrated scale up capability for use in a pandemic event.
