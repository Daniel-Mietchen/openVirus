<p>Aerosolized ribavirin however has demonstrated large volume capacity and adequate aerosolized delivery and clinical benefit including use in morbid condition patients. Ribavirin is indicated therapy for severe RSV infection in children. The conventional continuous treatment of 60 mg of ribavirin/ml for 18 h was found to be effective. Aerosolized ribavirin (administered 20 mg/ml for 2 h three times daily) has also been effective in cancer patients with RSV infection [

Ribavirin inhalation method at intermittent high doses (60 mg/ml) over the same schedule in immune suppressed children with RSF infection was also well tolerated. Moreover, results demonstrated similar improved clinical response compared with standard therapy. There was also less adverse exposure to healthcare workers [

 <xref rid="B136" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Inhaled ribavirin in this population was associated with clinical improvement [

 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>]. Recently, aerosolized ribavirin (100 mg/ml) was shown to be effective in mice infected with lethal IV-A H3N2 virus, and resulted in &gt;0% survival when given early (within 24–48 h) after infection [

 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>]. Moreover, in treatment of pneumotropic human adenovirus, aerosolized ribavirin demonstrated greater benefit over intravenous ribavirin likely related to the more robust drug concentration achieved in the alveoli with aerosolized product compared with intravenous ribavirin therapy. Additionally, the aerosolized delivery did not appear to lead to cytotoxic effect [

Data reveal that immunization with S-FLU–expressing H1 HA (H1 S-FLU) DNA reduces the viral load in lungs after aerosolized challenge with the closely matched pdmH1N1 virus strain [
 <xref rid="B142" ref-type="bibr">142</xref>]. The reduction of viral load was shown to be optimal using aerosol administration when compared with intravenous S-FLU. However, viral neutralizing Ab was not observed in S-FLU–immunized pigs, and the reduction of viral load in the H1 are group correlated with the presence of IFNg–producing CD8 or CD4/CD8 double-positive cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage suggest adequate product delivery. These data provide proof of principle that S-FLU DNA can be efficiently delivered by aerosol to a large animal, supporting possible use of a nebulizer device as a method of immunizing patients. Aerosolized delivery may be further optimized with use of lipid-DNA complexes [
