<p>The challenge to this approach is how to introduce plasmid DNA into the lungs without loss or damage to the plasmid. Plasmid DNA is highly prone to shearing, therefore methods with low shear forces are necessary for effective delivery of the supercoiled DNA. Both nebulizers and dry powder inhalers use low amounts of shear forces. Nebulizers however use aerosol droplets to deliver particles into the lungs, which may not be an effective method to deliver plasmid DNA, as DNA degrades while in solution if not stored appropriately. Additionally, nebulizers limit the concentration of product that can be delivered due to solubility. Dry powder inhalers are not limited by solubility and plasmid DNA would not need to be stored in solution [
