<p>Many viral pathogens including, coronavirus, flavivirus, pneumovirus, avian influenza, influenza A and HIV, utilize furin-mediated membrane glycoprotein cleavage facilitate viral entry and, for certain viruses, egress from target host cells [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. HIV-1 utilizes furin to cleave the viral membrane protein (Env) gp160 into gp120 and gp-41 prior to mature virion assembly. Conversely, flavivirus rely on furin cleavage after formation of packaged virions. SARS-CoV-2, as noted above, is cleaved at two sites, S1/S2 furin cleavage site (P
