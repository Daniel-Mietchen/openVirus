<p> Furin, was first described in 1986 and is the product of the 
 <italic>fur</italic> gene [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. It is an evolutionarily conserved family member of the proprotein convertases which contain a subtilisin-like protease domain and was the first proprotein convertase (PC) to be identified in humans [
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29–31</xref>]. Furin is a type I transmembrane protein that is ubiquitously expressed in vertebrates and invertebrates [
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. It is localized to the Golgi and 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network where it cleaves multiple proteins and is also located on the outer membrane where pathogens utilize it to cleave glycoproteins, a step essential for entry into host cells [
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. It can be secreted as a soluble, truncated active enzyme [
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The correct folding of furins catalytic domain relies on the inhibitory function of the N-terminal 83-amino acid propeptide [
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. To gain its enzymatic activity, the inhibitory propeptide is removed during transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the 
 <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network [
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In order to be released into the extracellular space, the membrane localization is cleaved at the C-terminus [
 <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Due to furin's ubiquitous expression and localization it is able to process a large amount and variety of proteins including growth factors, cytokines, hormones, adhesion proteins, collagens, membrane proteins, receptors as well as other classes [
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furin cleavage can also inactivate other proteins [
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Its cleavage consensus sequence is Arg-Xaa-(Lys/Arg)-Arg↓-Xaa [
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].
