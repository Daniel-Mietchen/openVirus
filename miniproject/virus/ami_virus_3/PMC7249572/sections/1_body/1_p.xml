<p>In particular, patients who recover from SARS-CoV-2 show evidence of an effective immune response to clear the infection and stop viral shedding within approximately 3Â weeks [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. This is particularly important since the virus generally does not persist and viral clearance is achievable, although feasibility of reinfection is unknown given pulmonary site of infectivity and propagation. Efforts can be made to minimize the risk of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), by enhancing the existing immune response, and slowing the viral propagation process. We will discuss repurposing Vigil plasmid, which expresses GM-CSF and decreases furin expression. This approach inhibits multiples steps of viral propagation including viral entry, protein assembly and egress while GM-CSF confers cellular immune antiviral and lung protection activity. Pre-clinical and clinical data will be reviewed to highlight the rationale and evidence for combination approach.
