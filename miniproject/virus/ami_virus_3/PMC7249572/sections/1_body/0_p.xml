<p> Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is thought to have naturally evolved from two existing coronavirus strains (L and S) near Wuhan, China. Origin is presumed due to zoonotic transfer: the SARS-CoV-2 genome is 96.2% homologous to the bat RaTG13 coronavirus [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. From 31 December 2019 to 4 April 2020, 1,133,373 confirmed coronavirus cases have been reported worldwide resulting in 60,375 deaths. Encouragingly, 235,999 patients have shown validated recovery. SARS-CoV-2 is emerging as a potentially greater morbidity and economic threat than the pandemic Spanish flu which infected 500 million people worldwide and resulted in 50 million deaths. The viral reproductive number (R

The current reported mortality rate seems to be holding at approximately 2% worldwide (although age and country related), however, considering shifting denominators, the case fatality rate may be lower; for example, 1.4% of those with laboratory-confirmed disease [

Since the pandemic of 1918, influenza has become endemic but with use of vaccines the infection rate has been reduced and the case fatality rate has dropped significantly to 0.1%. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, its rate of infectivity, related death, medical system overload and the consequent financial damage (due to disease, fear and quarantine) highlights the urgent need to develop new therapeutics as well as rapid response techniques to combat this and other novel pandemic virus outbreaks in the future.
