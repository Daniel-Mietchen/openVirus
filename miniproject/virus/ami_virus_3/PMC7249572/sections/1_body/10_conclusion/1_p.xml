<p>Accumulating knowledge of intracellular viral processing, molecular biology, viral dynamics, host immune mechanisms and immunokinetics will allow for the development of tools and methods to protect lung function, delay or prevent ARDS, enhance anti-viral resistance and institute prophylactic measures. The unique role of furin and the demonstration of robust viral clearance in all patients who survive SARS-CoV-2 infection supply the rationale and support for repurposing Vigil for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Knockdown of furin with Vigil would target multiple steps of viral propagation, including viral, entry, protein assembly and egress. Expression of GM-CSF would provide further therapeutic benefit, enhancing the immune response and AEC protection. The data, limited as it is, showing no obvious correlation between seroconversion and viral clearance, gives additional support to a multifunctional therapeutic approach to COVID-19, in other words, combining inhibition of a protease critical to viral entry and cell to cell transmission with an immune response modulator. Vigil is already involved in FDA characterization with a known product safety profile. Further testing will be necessary, including
