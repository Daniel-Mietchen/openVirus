<p>VP constructed by Gradalis, Inc. (TX, USA), consists of two stem-loop structures with a miR-30a backbone [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. The bi-shRNA
 <sup>furin</sup> DNA as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A uses a single targeted site to induce both mRNA cleavage and sequestration in P-bodies (translational silencing) and/or GW-bodies (repositories) [
 <xref rid="B112" ref-type="bibr">112</xref>]. By the use of this proprietary process, the encoding bi-shRNA can accommodate mature shRNA loaded onto more than one type of RNA induced silencing complex (RISC) [
 <xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>]. Also, with the bi-shRNA
 <sup>furin</sup> molecular design focusing on a single site potential toxic effects are reduced. Targeting of multiple sites increases chance for a ‘seed sequence’ being induced and leading to off-target effect that could result in increased clinical toxicity. Synthetic complementing and interconnecting oligonucleotides via DNA ligation were used to assemble the two stem-loop double stranded DNA sequences [
 <xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>]. The 241 base pair DNA constructed with Bam HI sites at both ends was inserted into the Bam HI site of a prior clinically validated plasmid called TAG [
 <xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>] in which we removed a TGFβ2 antisense DNA sequence and placed the bi-shRNA
 <sup>furin</sup>-GMCSF DNA sequence. Orientation of the inserted DNA was validated by the appropriate PCR primer pairs designed to screen for the shRNA insert and orientation. Safety profile defined with the prior TAG clinical therapeutic was used to support clinical advancement of VP in experimental cancer management testing under FDA guidance.Vigil is designed with the mammalian promoter cytomegalovirus [CMV] that drives the cassette. In between the GM-CSF gene (with a stop codon) and furin bi-shRNA there is a 2A ribosomal skip peptide followed by a rabbit poly-A tail. The picornaviral 2A sequence allows the production of two proteins from one open reading frame, by causing ribosomes to skip formation of a peptide bond at the junction of the 2A and downstream sequences [
 <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Since we previously demonstrated the 2A linker to be effective for generating similar expression levels of GM-CSF and anti-TGFβ transcripts with the TAG vaccine and we observed robust activity in product release testing of therapeutic effector components expressed with this plasmid design along with clinical benefit and safety, we maintained the same design for VP. Transient expression of bi-shRNAfurin-GM-CSF plasmid and diluted expressive cell numbers in patients would not be expected to approach continuous toxic effect of transgenic models.
