<p>Gradalis has been clinically testing this plasmid since 2009 [
 <xref rid="B111" ref-type="bibr">111</xref>]. Aldevron (ND, USA) and Waisman (WI, USA) have participated in lot manufacturing. This plasmid, which consists of a bi-shRNA
 <sup>furin</sup> DNA sequence and a GM-CSF DNA sequence (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>b), has been validated for FDA registration trial based on significant cancer patient benefit for use of transfection (via electroporation) into an autologous tumor for vaccine (Vigil) construction in Ewing's sarcoma [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>,
 <xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117–121</xref>]. Additional benefit has also been suggested in a variety of other cancer types in Phase I and II testing, most notably ovarian cancer [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>,
 <xref rid="B109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>,
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122–124</xref>]. The current active lot of Vigil plasmid was manufactured in 2015 by Waisman. The plasmid concentration per vial is 2.2 mg/ml which provides 770 μg of plasmid. Yearly stability testing has passed all measures of evaluation under US FDA review. Recent double blind randomized control trial involving 25 nationally acclaimed sites unblinded and revealed OS advantage (HR: 0.417, p = 0.020) and RFS advantage (HR: 0.459, p = 0.007; stratified Cox's proportional Hazard Model) [
