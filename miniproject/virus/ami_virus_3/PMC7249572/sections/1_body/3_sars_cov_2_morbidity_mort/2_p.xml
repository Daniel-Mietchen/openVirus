<p>Nasopharyngeal swabs from 79 patients at the First Affiliated Hospital, Nanchang University were obtained to serially assess viral dynamics via PCR-RT [
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Using the ΔCT method, estimates of viral load were significantly higher by a factor of 60× in severe compared with mild cases and 90% of the latter tested negative by day 10 post onset whereas all the severe cases tested positive beyond that demonstrating both a higher viral load and prolonged shedding time. Using IgM and IgG immunofluorescence (IFA) in 16 patients in Munich, no detectable neutralizing antibody (NA) was detected between days 3 and 6 [

In a recent study of 173 documented (rRT-PCR) cases (161 with serial assessment) of COVID-19 admitted to Shenzhen Third People's Hospital (11 January–9 February 2020), 32 (18.5%) with severe and 141 (81.5%) with mild disease, seroconversion rates in those with serial assessment (ELISA) for IgM and IgG using double-antigen sandwich ELISA for total Ab was 100% (median day 11) [
