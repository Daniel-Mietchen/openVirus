<p> Preliminary investigation of the first 191 patients in Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital revealed that 54/191 (28%) died and 137/191 (72%) were able to be discharged [
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Analysis of these first 191 patients determined that several factors significantly correlated with risk of death, including age &gt;63 years old, high sequential organ failure assessment score (&gt;1), high D dimer (&gt;1 ng/ml), respiratory rate &gt;24 breaths/min, lymphocyte count &gt;.0.6 × 10
 <sup>9</sup>/l, elevated LDH (median 521 u/l) and elevated IL6 (median 11 μg/ml) as well as comorbidities, hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease and COPD [

Ninety three percent of the deaths were associated with ARDS and biopsy from one patient showing regions of pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation (early-phase ARDS) in one lung and desquamation of pneumocytes and hyaline membrane formation in the other (late-phase ARDS) [

 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Notably, ARDS is also observed in chimeric antigen receptor CD-19 (CAR-T-CD19) therapy, which targets CD19 antigen and results in rapid induction of IL-6. Given that IL-6 is elevated to greater degree in patients who died from SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with healthy controls, tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted to IL-6, and used to manage ARDS associated with CAR-T therapy, may be a therapeutic component for those patients with elevated IL-6 [
