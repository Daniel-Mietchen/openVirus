<p>Relationship of GM-CSF to immune response activation against cancer and viral infection is well described [
 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71–75</xref>]. GM-CSF also regulates the differentiation, proliferation and activation of alveolar macrophages [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B77" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies indicate that GM-CSF causes rapid proliferation of alveolar type II epithelial cells thereby serving in repair and barrier protection of the respiratory epithelium at early stages of acute inflammation [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. It is also known that GM-CSF expression from alveolar type II epithelial cells facilitates surfactant homeostasis further enhancing protection of viral induced pathology [
 <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>,
 <xref rid="B78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>,
 <xref rid="B79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. GM-CSF also enhances the antiviral responses of alveolar macrophages. Indeed, elevated levels of GM-CSF may elicit a biphasic M1↔M2 response pattern [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. Although a number of studies show that GM-CSF and type I interferon act together to modulate macrophage polarization toward the M1 state of activation, recent 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> studies conclude the opposite [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80–82</xref>]. GM-CSF enhances viral clearance through expression of scavenger receptors, SR-A and MARCO [
 <xref rid="B83" ref-type="bibr">83–86</xref>]. These two receptors aid in viral clearance through activation of receptors TLR-3, TLR-9, NOD-2 and NALP-3 [
 <xref rid="B87" ref-type="bibr">87–89</xref>]. GM-CSF enhances mucosal immune responses and the effectiveness of DNA vaccines [
 <xref rid="B90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>,
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. Recombinant human GM-CSF has been delivered to the lung and conferred resistance to IV infection [
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. Transgenic mice that constitutively expressed human GM-CSF exposed to IV, were able to mount and effective antiviral response that resulted in increased numbers of human alveolar macrophages [
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>]. Halstead 
 <italic>et al.</italic>, also showed how GM-CSF overexpression after IV virus infection in a GM-CSF transgene mouse model prevents mortality [
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Protective effects of GM-CSF against IV-A pneumonia have been seen in mice with constitutive and inducible GM-CSF expression models in alveolar type II epithelial cell transgenic mice with GM-/- and 
 <italic>GM +/+</italic> pulmonary specific promoters (
 <italic>SFTPC</italic>, 
 <italic>SCGB1A1</italic>), respectively [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. This model was able to show GM-CSF enhancement of alveolar cell activity as indicated by increased expression of SP-R210 and CD11c expressive mononuclear cells. In mice lacking SR-A and MARCO, two receptors regulated by GM-CSF, MARCO was shown to increase expression of SP-R210 on alveolar macrophages and decrease resistance to IV. However, although continuous 
 <italic>SP-C-GM+/+</italic> transgenic mice resisted early mortality from IV, concern was raised to continuous high GM-CSF exposure over prolonged time. Late assessment of lung tissue sections revealed the histological features of degenerative desquamative interstitial pneumonia at day 29. Degeneration of alveolar structure and large spaces containing desquamated cells characterized the lungs of high GM-CSF exposed mice. The results indicate that excessively high levels of GM-CSF impair appropriate tissue healing resulting in development of interstitial lung disease secondary to IV pneumonia and provide guidance for early large animal assessment and Phase I monitoring of patient safety. However, results support that the conditional GM-CSF expressive mice do well and have long-term survival advantage to IV infection and have significant advantage over untreated controls. Expression of GM-CSF either through transgenic or pulmonary delivery conferred survival advantage to influenza virus compared with WT mice that did not survive infection. When alveolar phagocytes were depleted, the protective effect also diminished suggesting that these cells are necessary to induce the innate immune response [
