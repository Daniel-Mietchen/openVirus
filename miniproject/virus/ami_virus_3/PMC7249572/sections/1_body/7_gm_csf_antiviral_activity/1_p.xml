<p> Similar to SARS-CoV-2, alveolar epithelial cells are the primary target of influenza virus (IV) and are the first site of entry and support for viral propagation and replication. Proinflammatory immune response is rapidly initiated toward viral cytopathogenic effect which leads to alveolar epithelial cell (AEC) apoptosis [
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>]. However, when infection persists and viral propagation continues leading to intensified inflammatory response, capillary and alveolar leakage occurs, followed by severe hypoxemia and eventually ARDS which requires hospitalized management, oxygen support and often ventilation assistance [

 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Clearance of the viral pathogens from the lung by immune effector cells and the initiation of epithelial repair processes including expansion of local epithelial progenitor cells to begin resealing of the epithelial layer are critical for medical recovery and prevention of hospitalization, oxygen and ventilation support in IV-induced lung injury. The majority of mortality in relation to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been related to ARDS leading to hospitalization and ventilation support which is testing our medical capacity [

 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. However, the inflammatory immune response against the virus needs to be balanced between the elimination of virus and toxic effect of immune-mediated pulmonary injury in order to limit damage to the respiratory tract and alveolar cells which prevent ARDS [
 <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Mononuclear effector cells (macrophages, dendritic cells, CD8
 <sup>+</sup>, neutrophils and lymphocytes) carry the bulk of the load in IV clearance and ‘balanced’ immune response against IV [
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Similar activity demonstrated with IV is important for clearance of SARS-CoV-2. GM-CSF has been shown to promote proliferation, differentiation and immune activation of monocytes, granulocytes, macrophages [
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>,
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. GM-CSF in the lungs is mainly expressed by AEC type II cells [
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>] and is a first cytokine responder in protection of the lung environment, AEC survival and function, and is a positive prognostic factor in clearance of IV infection. Expressed GM-CSF in pulmonary secretions can potentially be used as an indication in bronchial lavage samples of early response and resistance thereby affecting medial need involving O2 support. Other cell types produce GM-CSF, but AECs have been shown to upregulate GM-CSF in the distal lung parenchyma upon IV infection, and then produce high levels of GM-CSF in the alveolar surrounding secretions [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. AEC GM-CSF secretion with IV infection resolution appears to be further mediated via HGF/c-Met and TGF-α/EGFR signaling [
