<p>The data discussed above regarding targeting furin and increasing GM-CSF expression warrants further investigation to target SARS-CoV-2 infection. Vigil, which combines bifunctional shRNA targeting furin and incorporating a GM-CSF DNA sequence in a plasmid delivery vehicle (pbi-shRNA
 <sup>furin</sup>-GM-CSF) has been described as the most advanced anti-furin technology in clinical testing [
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Vigil is an autologous tumor cell vaccine, with dual function that knocks down furin expression as seen by decreased expression of downstream proteins TGFβ1/2 and expresses GM-CSF [
 <xref rid="B106" ref-type="bibr">106</xref>]. It has demonstrated clinical success in several cancer populations but especially Ewing's sarcoma and ovarian cancer [
 <xref rid="B107" ref-type="bibr">107–110</xref>]. It has a demonstrated safety profile with no evidence of grade 3 product related toxicity effect following 1406 doses in 233 cancer patients. The potential efficacy and use of Vigil for COVID-19 is an example of the rational repurposing of drugs from indicated to nonprimary target disease alternatives. Such an approach could accelerate the clinical development process particularly urgent given the current COVID-19 pandemic.
