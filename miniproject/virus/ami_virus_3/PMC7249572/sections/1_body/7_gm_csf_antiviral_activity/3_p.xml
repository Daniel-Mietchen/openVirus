<p>As described, infection with SARS-CoV-2 can progress to rapid induction of viral pneumonia and ARDS resulting in fatal outcome [
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. AECs play a critical role in orchestrating the pulmonary antiviral host response [
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>]. However, with early IV and SARS-CoV-2 infection AEC's release GM-CSF. GM-CSF heightens immune function of alveolar cells which leads to improved epithelial repair processes. During IV infection, AEC-derived GM-CSF also enhances a lung-protective mechanism. Similar results are seen with local rhGM-CSF application. This early use and/or enhancement of immune function and alveolar protection with elevated GM-CSF expression appears to overwhelmingly benefit clinical response. However, GM-CSF expression late in the inflammatory lung response is less well characterized. Although correspondence by Herold S 
 <italic>et al.</italic> in using recombinant GM-CSF (leukine, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, WA, USA) and an Aeroneb Solo nebulizer to administer leukine (125 μg/dose) demonstrated significant clinical benefit in four of six patients with ARDS related to infectious pneumonia (including two with H1N1 virus) [
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Immune function enhancement was also shown in the leukine treated patients compared with untreated ARDS patients in analysis of pulmonary immune response, which is similar to preclinical evidence (
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal models) [
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>,
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>,
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. GM-CSF treated patients demonstrated alveolar cell protection, enhanced alveolar cell activity toward viral and other infectious clearance and shift to M1 response as assessed by increased alveolar CD80
 <sup>+</sup> cells and CD206 drop. These results support enhancement of GM-CSF expression even late in pulmonary inflammatory response to viral infection may be of benefit which suggest therapy benefit in late stage ARDS patients. Safe administration of GM-CSF via inhalation therapy in 19 patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis was also demonstrated to show benefit by Ohashi 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Elevated IL-17 in bronchial alveolar lavage fluid was shown as a GM-CSF induced cytokine and may serve as a biomarker associated with benefit.
