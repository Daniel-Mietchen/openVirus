<p>Sever-Chroneos 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>], found worsening IV infection and response in GM-CSF deficient mice was due to impaired IV clearance by macrophages. This work is supported by Berclaz 
 <italic>et al.</italic> who demonstrated that the Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-mediated opsonophagocytosis of invaded pathogens by alveolar macrophages is related to GM-CSF [
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>]. T-cell-produced interferon γ (IFN γ) also effects alveolar macrophage FcγR expression which in turn stimulate production of IFN γ and other cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-12 supporting involvement of both innate and adaptive immunity turn on. Elevated alveolar GM-CSF level in transgenic mice also improves resistance of alveolar cells in association with IV infection [
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. GM-CSF has also been shown to be an important stimulator of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes and further enhances their role to activate DC priming in lymphoid tissue, thereby providing a positive feedback in further stimulation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell expansion [

 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>], also showed GM-CSF to be critically important for induction of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell immunity. Chen 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>] also found GM-CSF to promote B-cell maturation and production of IV specific antibodies. During IV pneumonia, extensive additional 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> data support the role of GM-CSF as a lung barrier-protectant and positive immune response factor [

 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>,
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>]. AEC-expressed GM-CSF directly benefits the injured epithelium and is important in enhancing epithelial proliferation in the setting of hypoxic lung injury via repair of barrier function, reduction of capillary leak and return of tissue to homeostasis [
