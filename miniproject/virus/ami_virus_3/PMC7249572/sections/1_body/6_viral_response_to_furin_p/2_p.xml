<p>Although mechanisms have evolved enabling RNA viruses to invade host cells, host defense mechanisms have also evolved. Innate and adaptive immune responses have been shown to target viral antigens. Additionally, targets critical to viral entry, protein assembly and egress are also of high therapeutic value. These are ‘virus dependency factors’. Various host proteins such as IFI16 and SAMHD1 have been shown to inhibit both RNA and DNA viral gene expression and replication, respectively [
