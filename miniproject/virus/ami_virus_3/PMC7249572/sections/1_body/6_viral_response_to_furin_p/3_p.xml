<p>Multiple furin inhibitors have been developed and tested 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and in animal models. Initial targets were peptide and protein inhibitors which target active sites and competitively inhibit binding sites. As example, two IFNχ-inducible GTPases, guanylate-binding proteins 2 and 5 (GBP2 and GBP5), with inhibitory furin activity have demonstrated cleavage inhibition of the HIV Env precursor gp160 and reduced HIV virion infectivity [
