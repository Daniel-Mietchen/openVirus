<p>Interestingly, corneal damage in mice related to 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> has been shown to be reduced by non-D-arginine (D9R) and other furin inhibitors [
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Nonpeptidic furin inhibitors have also demonstrated antifurin activity in the nanomolar dose range [
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. 2,5-dideoxystreptamine shows unusual furin inhibiting activity whereby a complex is formed with furin involving twoÂ molecules with separate functions, which interfere with the catalytic triad conformation and binding to an adjacent peptide stretch to inhibit furin activity [
