<p>Toxic effects related to furin inhibitors have not been observed outside of embryonic models. A study of furin-deficient mice demonstrated a critical role of furin during embryogenesis in which knock-out of the 
 <italic>fur</italic> gene led to death by day 11 due to the failure of ventral closure and embryonic turning [

Liver-specific interferon-inducible furin knock-out mice have not demonstrated adverse effects outside of embryogenesis implying that other proprotein convertases may compensate for furin deficiency given overlapping activity [

 <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Targeting furin, a host enzyme, also avoids the emergence of resistance due to viral antigenic drift as described earlier as furin genome is highly conserved and maintains a stable genomic structure, while SARS-CoV-2 target sites undergo mutational changes throughout the viral life span and pandemic period [
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Furin inhibitors also function as mentioned previously via knockdown at the RNA level [i.e., Regnase-1 (ZC3H12A), Roquin (RC3H1)] [
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. A concern, however, with modulation of Regnase-1 and Roquin is that both agents will most likely result in off-target effects as these products both degrade off target mRNA. The results outlined and safety profile support potential role of furin inhibitors within a pandemic and possibly even within the anti-terrorist government protection ‘tool box’.
