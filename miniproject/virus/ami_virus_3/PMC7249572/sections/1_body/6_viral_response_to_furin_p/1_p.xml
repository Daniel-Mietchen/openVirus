<p> RNA viruses such a SARS-CoV-2 have several critical functions dependent upon protease activity. Consequently, modulation of protease activity may provide therapeutic function in SARS-CoV-2 in a variety of other RNA viruses. Furin is a particularly promising opportunity for therapeutic intervention. As previously described it cleaves and activates numerous mammalian, viral and bacterial substrates [
