<p id="Par35">Based on the above findings, the lowest record of local confirmed cases of dengue fever in Kaohsiung City in the past few years was the result of its unique geographical location used to strengthen the efficiency of quarantine outside the battle zone, optimize medical network resources against dengue, construct specific quarantine and epidemic prevention networks, and effectively shorten the incubation period of cases. In other words, the dengue protection network has successfully utilized the natural advantages of Taiwan for disease control to adopt an effective quarantine strategy. In spite of this, the threat posed by dengue (as well as other communicable diseases) is likely to increase in line with increases in international exchange and trade. Local networks must be able to constantly innovate and adopt an international focus to effectively combat dengue and prevent future outbreaks of dengue in Taiwan.</p>
