<p>At the beginning of the pandemic (until mid‚ÄêFebruary), when 99% of the cases were focused in continental China, the death toll was about 2%. As the virus is spread by travelers, the number of cases and death occurrence has increased in other territories like South Korea, Iran, and Italy. In this last country the death toll up to date reaches the 6.2%, this number is still far from statistics of other related human coronavirus epidemics, like SARS (9.5%) and MERS (34.4%).
