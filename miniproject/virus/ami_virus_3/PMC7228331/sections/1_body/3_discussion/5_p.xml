<p>In conclusion, our work presents the complete genome analysis for the first cases of COVID‚Äê19 in Chile, detecting at least two different viral variants entries to Chilean territory. This information contributes to monitoring the spread of the infection and the surveillance for eventual recombination or genome mutations that the diversity of host, countries, weather conditions and other selective pressures that this new coronavirus could face. The globalization, increment of worldwide travelers and the high contagious rate of this virus require severe control measures to control infection dissemination.</p>
