<p>In this early stage of the epidemic, sharing data and information is crucial and the efforts of the scientist worldwide are admirable. After a few weeks since the outbreak started in Wuhan province, the full genome sequence of SARS‐CoV‐2 was available, and this information paved the way for the development of better detection protocols techniques, antiviral strategies, and phylogeny studies, among others scientific challenges. Here we report the first four cases of COVID‐19 and the complete genome sequencing for these strains. We developed an RT‐PCR based strategy to amplify the whole genome in two steps, followed by the library construction and further NGS using Illumina MiSeq. In less than 5 days since we detected the first case, the whole genomes for the first four cases were assembled. We implemented in early January the complete detection system by real‐time RT‐PCR for this new virus in the Public Health Institute of Chile, according to international guidelines.</p>
