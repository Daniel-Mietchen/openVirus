<p>The phylogenetic analysis plus the travel information of each patient, allows us to infer about the viral entries to Chilean territory. We detected two different viral variants entries to Chile, the S and G. For S variant, the viral genome distribution of Chilean isolates allows to associate these in two different clades, one related to the Wuhan province in China and Taiwan, and a second clade related with Spanish isolates, coincident with the patient's travel record. COVID‐19 cases in Spain started to be reported since February 1st with a very low number of cases for about a month, where the reported cases may be underestimated, and after a month the infected people started to raise over a hundred patients.
