<p>A maximum‐likelihood phylogeny tree was constructed using 218 complete genome sequences plus the four Chilean cases. Our first two samples, the married couple, mapped together (100% nucleotide identity) and with strains from Wuhan, China and Taiwan. The third sample groups in a well‐defined clade with Spanish isolates. The fourth Chilean strain, groups in a European clade with samples from Switzerland, Netherlands, and Germany. In this same clade, we can identify one of the Brazilian and Mexican isolates, representing isolates from Latin America. In addition, the complete genomes were colored according to the variant groups, defined by specific mutations (Figure
