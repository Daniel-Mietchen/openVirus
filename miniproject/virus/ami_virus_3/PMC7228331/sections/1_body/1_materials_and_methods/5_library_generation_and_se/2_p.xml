<p>The 12 DNA fragments from full genome amplification were pooled, and libraries were prepared with the Nextera XT Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA), purified with Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA) and quantified by Victor Nivo Fluorometer (PerkinElmer) using Quant‐it dsDNA HS Assay kit (Invitrogen). The resulting DNA libraries were sequenced on MiSeq (Illumina) using a 300‐cycle reagent kit. About 0.3 GB of data was obtained for each sample.</p>
