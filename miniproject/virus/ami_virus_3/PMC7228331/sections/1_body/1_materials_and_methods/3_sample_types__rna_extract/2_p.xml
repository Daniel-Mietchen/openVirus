<p>Chilean law by the Supreme Decree 7/2019 mandates notification of communicable diseases and their surveillance. All cases showed mild symptoms, and throat swab specimens were collected. A volume of 140 µL of each sample was used for viral RNA extraction with QIAamp Viral Mini Kit (Cat. No. 52926; Qiagen) in a QIACube extractor. All suspicious cases were confirmed by real‐time reverse transcription‐polymerase chain reaction (RT‐PCR), using specific probe and primers, synthesized and purified in our facilities, targeting the RNA‐dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) region of SARS‐CoV‐2, according to the guidelines suggested by the World Health Organization.

 </xref> SuperScript III One‐Step RT‐PCR Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Cat. No. 12574026; Invitrogen) was used for real‐time RT‐PCR. Running method 55°C for 10 minutes, followed by 94°C for 2 minutes, and 45 cycles at 94°C for 15 seconds and 58°C for 30 seconds. Ct's under 35 were considered as positive cases.
