<p>From total RNA extraction we performed the first amplification round using SuperScript III One‐Step RT‐PCR Platinum Taq DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) and six pair of specific primers to obtain six complementary DNA fragments around 5 Kbp each, followed by a second amplification round with 24 specific primers (Table S1) to generate two fragments from each first round products, each subfragment (a total of 12) are around 2.3 to 2.7 Kbp.</p>
