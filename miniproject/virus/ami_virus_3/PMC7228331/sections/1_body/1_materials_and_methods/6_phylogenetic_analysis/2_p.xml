<p>The sequencing quality was analyzed with software Fastqc v0.11.8 and then, the reads were filtered and trimmed using BBDuk software considering a minimum read length of 36 bases and quality more than equal to 10. SARS‐CoV‐2 assembly was performed with IRMA v0.9.3 using as reference NCBI sequence ID NC_045512.2. Sequence alignment was performed with MAFFT. The phylogenetic tree was built with IQ‐TREE v1.6.12 considering a bootstrap of 1000. We consider 218 full complete genome sequences available in the GISAID platform plus the full genome sequences from the first four Chilean cases.</p>
