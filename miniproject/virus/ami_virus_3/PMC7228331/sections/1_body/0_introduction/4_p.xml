<p>The genome organization of SARS‐CoV‐2 was shown to be similar of the related bats and human coronavirus. The open reading frames (ORFs) from 5′ to 3′ is as follows: 5′ UTR; ORF1ab with 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp) 1 to 16 including RNA polymerase RNA‐dependent nsp12, Helicase nsp13 and 3′‐to‐5′ exonuclease nsp14, S surface spike protein, E envelope protein, M membrane protein, and N nucleocapsid protein. There are also at least six predicted ORFs as hypothetical proteins with no associated function.
