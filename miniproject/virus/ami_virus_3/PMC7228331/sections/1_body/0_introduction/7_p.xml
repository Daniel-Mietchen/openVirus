<p>Chile was the fourth country in South America after Brazil, Ecuador, and Argentina to report COVID‐19 in the region. In this report, we present the sequence analysis for the first four complete genomes for SARS‐CoV‐2 isolates on Chilean patients. Also, a phylogenetic study was performed with worldwide SARS‐CoV‐2 sequences and the full genomes from Chilean isolates, to identify their genetic similarity.</p>
