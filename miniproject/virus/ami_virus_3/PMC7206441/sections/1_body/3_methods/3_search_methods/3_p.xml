<p id="para0026">The search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished qualitative studies, with no time limitations, in the English language only. Studies were included if they reported the experiences of nurses working in an acute care hospital during a pandemic or epidemic. A pandemic or epidemic was classified using the WHO definition and declaration and included SARS, MERS, Avian influenza (H5N1) and swine flu (H1N1). Studies that investigated nurses working in community settings during a pandemic were excluded. Studies exploring nursesâ€™ experiences working during Ebola outbreaks were also excluded as Ebola is not a viral respiratory pandemic or epidemic and has a different mode of transmission. Hand-searching of the reference lists of studies assessed for eligibility was also undertaken.</p>
