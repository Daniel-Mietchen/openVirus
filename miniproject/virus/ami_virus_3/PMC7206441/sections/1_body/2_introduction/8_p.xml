<p id="para0023">A preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and the 
 <italic>JBI Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports</italic> was conducted to identify qualitative reviews on nurses’ experiences during a pandemic. The search did not reveal any systematic review addressing the current review question or inclusion criteria. Therefore this review has been conducted to synthesize and present current evidence around nurses’ managing and caring for patients during pandemics. This review will inform the current response to COVID-19 and future pandemic response.
