<p>CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrate the joints in CHIKD, causing inflammation. Specifically, CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells are majorly responsible for joint swelling and inflammation and possibly mediate inflammatory pathways through CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T-cell lineages, T
 <sub>H</sub>1 and T
 <sub>H</sub>2 cells that secrete anti-osteoclastogenic cytokines, IFN-Î³, and IL-4. The infiltration of T
 <sub>H</sub> 17 cells into the inflammatory joint links the abnormal T-cell response to bone damage in arthritis (

 <xref rid="B185" ref-type="bibr">185</xref>). One study found increased expression of CD95/CD95L in CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). In CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells, although cells are nearly constant from healthy to acute to chronic phase, the persistent exposure of antigens to CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells leads to altered expression of biomarkers like CD69A, CD107A, and IL-17A (
 <xref rid="B103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>). As CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells only express CD95L after activation (
 <xref rid="B186" ref-type="bibr">186</xref>), it can be safely assumed that these cells stay activated through the chronic phase, hence having a role in disease resolution and chronicity. Furthermore, effective immune cell activation drives the initial antiviral response leading to T-cell exhaustion, and this may be linked to viral persistence observed in the chronic phase (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Additionally, the absence of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells in synovial tissue may also be a contributing factor toward the persistence of CHIKV (
