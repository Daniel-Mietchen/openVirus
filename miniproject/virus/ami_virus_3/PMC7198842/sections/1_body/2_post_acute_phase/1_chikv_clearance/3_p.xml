<p>Clearance of circulating pathogens from the system, though, generally involves opsonins like pathogen-specific antibodies and complement component 3 (C3) (
 <xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>–
 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>). However, a recent study reports that clearance of CHIKV and RRV remains unaffected in the C3
 <sup>−/−</sup> and B cell-deficient μMT mice, suggesting the role of an uncharacterized innate immune pathway (
 <xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>–
 <xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). The other mechanism of clearance involves scavenger receptors (SRs), which is a non-opsonic mechanism known for the clearance of endogenous and microbial ligands (
 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). It was found that Kupffer cells found in the liver carry several SRs, out of which SR-A6 (MARCO) was identified as the key factor responsible for CHIKV clearance (
