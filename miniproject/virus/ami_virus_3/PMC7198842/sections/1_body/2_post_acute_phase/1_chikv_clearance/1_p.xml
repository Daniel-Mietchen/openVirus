<p>Clearance of CHIKV from blood paves the path to recovery in CHIKD patients and is comprised of various immune pathways constituting the post-acute phase of CHIKD. This phase is marked by complete clearance of active CHIKV from the body by neutralizing antibodies in the blood and destruction of infected cells by infiltrating NK cells, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, and neutrophils. Detection of neutralizing antibodies could begin from day 4 to 7 post-onset of symptoms and could last up to 3 weeks post clinical presentation. IgM antibodies could be detected during the acute phase of infection, whereas IgG antibodies are detected in the post-acute phase and may last for months (

It suggests that CHIKV neutralization and IgG titres were higher in 8-week-old mice during the acute phase, whereas CHIKV clearance was not observed until post-acute phase in 20 weeks old mice (
