<p>Other key players of CHIKD resolution are subsets of T cells, the regulatory T cells (Tregs), and Th17 cells. Differentiation of naïve Th cells into Th17 and Tregs is a common signaling pathway arbitrated by TGF-β; however, the activation of these cells depends on the pro-inflammatory signals which also regulate the fate of these cells in a reciprocal manner (
 <xref rid="B154" ref-type="bibr">154</xref>). In the presence of IL-6 or IL-21, along with TGF-β, naïve Th cells differentiate into Th17 cells, but in the absence of proinflammatory signals, TGF-β drives Treg differentiation (

 <xref rid="B157" ref-type="bibr">157</xref>). Th17 cell produces IL-17, IL-22, and IL-23 that attracts neutrophils and hence promotes inflammation at the site of infection (

In contrast, Treg produces cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of various immune cells and thereby induces anti-inflammatory responses. Expansion of Tregs, governed by enhanced IL-2 levels and antibody-mediated signaling, also inhibits CD4
 <sup>+</sup> effector T cell repertoire, resulting in alleviation of joint pathology (

It has been shown that the imbalance in cytokines, such as the increase in the concentration of IL-6 along with TGF-β which results in naïve Th cells differentiating into Th17 cells (

 <xref rid="B161" ref-type="bibr">161</xref>). Several studies have shown a significant elevation in the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-17 associated with Th17 cells in both CHIKV infected humans and CHIKD mice models (

 <xref rid="B163" ref-type="bibr">163</xref>). Conversely, a study conducted on the patient sera samples from Thailand 2009–2010 outbreak showed no significant variations in IL-17 levels as compared to the healthy controls (

Recent research on flavivirus using mouse model displaying the genetic diversity of the human population has, however, shown that the susceptibility of the host is not only affected by the viral sequence itself but is also controlled by multiple genes of the host (
