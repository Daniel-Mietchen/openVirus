<p>Chikungunya disease resolution is a combination of viral clearance from the host and resolution of inflammation, as all the major symptoms witnessed by the CHIKD patients are due to the robust pro-inflammatory host response. As discussed in the earlier parts of the review, viral clearance in the circulatory system is led by neutralizing antibodies, and virus replicating in the tissues is tackled by infiltrating pro-inflammatory cells like macrophages, CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, neutrophils, and NK cells. The other arm of disease resolution, resolution of inflammation, is a complex network of events that strives to attain homeostasis post-inflammation and is regulated by a wide range of mediators (

In the case of CHIKV, proteomic profiling of CHIKV infected patients revealed a number of factors that mediate chemotaxis of neutrophils and phagocytes to be downregulated. Azurocidin (AZU1), annexin A1 (ANXA1), CTSG, S-100 calcium-binding proteins S100A7, S100A8, S100A9, and transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFB2) are significantly downregulated mediators of inflammation found in CHIKV patients with 1–10 days post-onset of symptoms (

However, a phase-specific analysis of these mediators in CHIKV patients would provide better insight into the mechanism underneath the resolution of inflammation upon CHIKV infection. Also, RNA-seq analysis of feet and lymph nodes of CHIKV infected mice highlighted granzyme A as a major promoter of arthritic inflammation (
