<p>RNA interference (RNAi) controls the spatial and temporal regulation of the complex gene network involved in the immune response (

 <xref rid="B140" ref-type="bibr">140</xref>), the viral infection is an example of the complex interplay between viral RNA, endogenous miRNA, and host immune factors (

 <xref rid="B144" ref-type="bibr">144</xref>). A recent report suggested that CHIKV establishes infections by regulating miRNA expression profile (
 <xref rid="B145" ref-type="bibr">145</xref>). miR15, miR-16, miR-17, let-7e, miR-125, miR-99, and miR-23a are altered during CHIKV infection which indicates that these act as biomarkers in chikungunya infection (
 <xref rid="B146" ref-type="bibr">146</xref>). Target analysis suggests that targets of these miRNAs are involved in the RIG-1 pathway, TGF-beta-signaling pathway, JAK–STAT-signaling pathway, MAPK-signaling pathway, cytokine–cytokine receptor interactions, and Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis (

In addition, CHIKV infection in human synovial fibroblasts triggers the expression of miR-146a which downregulates the expression of TRAF6, IRAK1, and IRAK2 that in turn leads to decreased activation of NF-κB pathway by a negative feedback loop and promotes CHIKV replication (

 <xref rid="B148" ref-type="bibr">148</xref>). Likewise, miRNAs are also known to participate in macrophage polarization. For example, miR-146a directly binds to the IRF transcription factors and (
 <xref rid="B149" ref-type="bibr">149</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B150" ref-type="bibr">150</xref>) leads to suppression of inflammatory responses by promoting M2 switching. Similarly, miR-210 targets the NF-κB factors and elicits the suppression of M1 switching, resulting in suppression of inflammation (
