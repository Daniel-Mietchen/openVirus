<p>An important feature that decides resolution of the disease, mainly through regulation of inflammation of joints and attainment of homeostasis, is macrophage polarization and phenotype switching from M1 (pro-inflammatory) to M2 (anti-inflammatory). M1 macrophages restrict the proliferation of surrounding cells and damage infected tissues by releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, whereas M2 macrophages promote multiplication of contiguous cells and tissue repair (

 <xref rid="B138" ref-type="bibr">138</xref>) and are known to limit the pro-inflammatory immune response. Arginase 1 (Arg1) is an enzyme associated with M2 macrophages; upon genetic deletion of this enzyme tissue pathology was reduced and enhanced clearance of Ross River virus (RRV) was observed in mice model (

These results suggest that M2 macrophages play an essential role in the resolution of inflammation, but at the same time M2 macrophages might support the persistence of CHIKV in the system leading to chronic disease. This hypothesis is supported by a study performed on a non-human primate model that suggests long term CHIKV persistence in the macrophages (
