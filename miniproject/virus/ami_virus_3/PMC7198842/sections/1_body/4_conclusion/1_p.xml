<p>Complexities in CHIKD immunopathology in the host begins from the point of mosquito saliva that may contain both the virus as well as the viral antibodies that may affect the virus pathogenicity when delivered into the host during a bite. Furthermore, the immunomodulatory role of mosquito saliva is strikingly an understudied phenomenon in CHIKV infection. Does the mosquito saliva possess factors that can actively modulate viral pathogenesis? Can these molecules be utilized for developing novel antiviral strategies? How exactly does the presence of viral antibodies from previous bites affect CHIKV pathogenicity during the next bite to a na√Øve individual? Even though some of these aspects have been looked into, in-depth studies are necessary to address these concerns more effectively. Additionally, answering some of these questions may help in arriving on novel transmission blocking strategies.</p>
