<p>Once the infection is established, the innate and adaptive host immunity plays definitive roles in the progression of the disease that we know to be both protective as well as pathogenic in its response. These responses decide the clinical presentation of the disease at the febrile acute phase in terms of peak viremia, small joint and large joint involvement, as well as disease resolution during the post-acute phase. The current understanding of the subject suggests that arthritogenic symptoms in the acute phase of CHIKD are primarily due to pro-inflammatory host responses that could lead to the possible association of severe chronic cases with autoimmunity. Can we derive more knowledge regarding this association by looking into other similar autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis? Will employing animal models specific to autoimmune disorders help in answering some immunological questions pertaining to immune response of CHIKV-induced arthritis? Can these systems recapitulate the actual pathogenesis seen in humans? How well are we using the clinical evidence to understand disease progression in the case of CHIKD? How do we use the information pertaining to inflammation more usefully in understanding CHIKD immunopathology? Can we devise intervention approaches based on this information pertaining to inflammation specifically to alleviate the arthritic phase?</p>
