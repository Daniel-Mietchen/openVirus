<p>In addition to the above mentioned pro-inflammatory mechanisms, the acute phase is also mediated by CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells responses at the early stages of infection while in the later stages it's the CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that predominate the repertoire of the immune cells in humans (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). Murine studies have presented with the evidence that both CD4
 <sup>+</sup> and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells infiltrate CHIKV-infected tissues during the course of infection (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). These infiltrating T cells are understandably involved in mounting site-specific antiviral immune responses, contrary to which CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells have recently been shown to contribute toward the pathogenesis during CHIKV infection in mice without altering much of the viral titers along with IFN-Î³ production (
