<p>NK cells are also a major line of defense against the virus, displaying a marked change in surface receptor repertoire with increased expression of NKp44, CD57, ILT2, CD8Î±, and NKG2C and decreased expression of NKp30, NKp46, NKG2A, and CD16. Specifically, NKG2C cells undergo rapid expansion during the early acute phase of CHIKD and exert strong cytolytic response upon infected cells (

It has been observed that the number of mature NK cells peak in the early acute phase (i.e., day 3 post-onset of symptoms) and their persistence is correlated with the viral load. Additionally, the persistence of these cells is also associated with chronic CHIKD (
