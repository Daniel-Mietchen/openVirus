<p>The pre-acute phase or the incubation period of CHIKD ranges from 2 to 12 days (
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>–
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). As an infected mosquito takes a blood meal, it deposits the virus into the epidermis and dermis layers of the skin (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). At the same time, the mosquito also punctures nearby blood vessels, allowing the virus to enter the bloodstream as evidenced by the presence of virus in the sera as early as within 5 min of a mosquito bite (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). At the site of a mosquito bite, the resident cells of the cutaneous immune system defend the host from the pathogen. The cutaneous immune system acts as the first line of defense against the pathogen and is comprised of a heterogeneous mix of cells, such as the lymphocytes, dendritic cells (DCs), and monocytes (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Gamma delta T lymphocytes (γδ T cells) constitute the most abundant skin-resident T lymphocytes (
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) and have demonstrated to play a critical role in cytotoxicity, cytokine secretion, and DC maturation and enhance their function (
 <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). These cells are present in the skin, the local site of infection for CHIKV, and lack the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restriction; therefore they do not require conventional antigen processing and thus can react to the unprocessed antigens (
 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Infection of CHIKV in mice (footpad) led to a significant increase in the prevalence of this T cell subset in foot and popliteal lymph nodes (
 <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). Further, mice deficient in γδ T cells had an increased disease severity accompanied by histopathologic changes (
 <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Skin resident dendritic cells such as langerhans cells encounter antigens at the site of infection and may disseminate the virus to draining lymph nodes where they interact with the effector T cells, resulting in the initiation of the adaptive immune response (
 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). Various studies (although contradictory in the explanation of mechanism) have documented the role of bite-induced enhancement of arboviral infection (
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>). Studies have indicated that mosquito saliva has immune-modulatory properties that enhance pathogen establishment within the host by limiting the host immune response (
 <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>). One such study of CHIKV infection in mice models observed changes in cutaneous cytokine profiles when inoculating the virus with a needle or mimicking natural infection using mosquitoes. Needle inoculation of the virus into mice resulted in an increased expression of TLR3 and Th1 cytokines (IFN-γ and IL2) whereas infection by mosquito bite elicited a Th2 cytokine response with an increase in IL4 and a reduction observed in TLR3, IFN-γ and IL2 (
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>). In a different study carried out using dengue virus, similar IFN-γ reduction was observed when the virus was inoculated with mosquito saliva as compared to direct needle inoculation of the virus (
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>). Similarly, research on the immune modulatory properties of mosquito saliva showed that mice previously sensitized with a salivary gland extract of mosquitoes have more robust cellular infiltration than non-sensitized mice. This study suggests that mosquito saliva has the ability to differentially regulate cellular microenvironment around the bite site (
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>). Another recent study correlated the initial events of mosquito bite and viral inoculation with subsequent development of systemic disease, highlighting an important role for cutaneous innate immune response. The study observed that stromal cells and macrophages were the main cellular targets for semliki forest virus replication at the initial bite sites, but these cells did not express markers of interferon induction upon infection. Dermal DC's, that are less abundant in the dermis, were major activators of type I IFN response at the initial inoculation site and therefore were major players in limiting viral replication and clinical progression (
