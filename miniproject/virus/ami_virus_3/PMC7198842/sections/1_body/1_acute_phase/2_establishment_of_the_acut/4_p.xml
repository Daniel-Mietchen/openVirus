<p>Despite the robust and rapid immune response against the virus in permissive cells, CHIKV effectively evades the cellular control mechanisms. In fibroblast cells, for example, CHIKV dodges the interferon response by inducing a translational shut off (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Additionally, the cytopathic nature of CHIKV induces apoptosis (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>). Fibroblast and stromal cells, for example, undergo apoptosis within 24 h post-infection (

 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). The virus utilizes this cellular response to increase its rate of infection and since the viral particles are sequestered within the apoptotic blebs, it escapes recognition by the immune system. Engulfment of the apoptotic blebs by neighboring phagocytic cells such as macrophages promotes infection in a non-inflammatory or dormant manner (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). As the virus replicates, it simultaneously invades nearby blood vessels. Evidence has demonstrated the infection of blood monocytes by CHIKV virus (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). The virus continues replication, achieving a peak in viremia during the acute phase.
