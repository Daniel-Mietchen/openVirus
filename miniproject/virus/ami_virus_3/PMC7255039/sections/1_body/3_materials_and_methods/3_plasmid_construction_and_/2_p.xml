<p>The full-length cDNA clone ZIKV-Nluc-FL under the control of the CMV promoter was used to produce infectious viruses. The transfection was performed as previously described 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In brief, Vero cells at 80% confluence in 35 mm culture dishes were transfected with ZIKV-Nluc-FL by lipofectamine 3000 (Life Technologies). The supernatant was harvested at 3 days post transfection (dpt), clarified by centrifugation, and stored at ‒80 °C.
