<p>To generate the infectious clone of ZIKV-Nluc, ZIKV-FL was used as a backbone to insert the Nluc reporter gene. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, fragment 1, covering “CMV promoter-5'UTR-C38”, and fragment 3, covering “C-prM-E187”, were amplified using ZIKV-FL as a template. Fragment 2, covering (Nluc-2A), was amplified using the pNL1.1 [Nluc] vector (Promega, Madison, USA) as a template. Fragments 1-3 were fused together and cloned into ZIKV-FL at the 
 <italic>Kpn</italic> I and 
 <italic>Avr</italic> II sites, yielding ZIKV-Nluc-FL. Before transfection, ZIKV-Nluc-FL was verified by restriction enzyme digestion and complete sequencing.
