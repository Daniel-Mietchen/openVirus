<p>The immunostaining focus assays were performed as previously described 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. In brief, Vero cells in 24-well plates were inoculated with 100 μl of 10-fold serial dilutions of viral samples for 1.5 h. Then, 1 mL of 1.25% methyl cellulose overlay was added to each well and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 4 days. Cells were fixed in methanol-acetone fixation solution. After washing three times, the cells were incubated with ZIKV-specific hyperimmune mouse serum. After washing three more times, the cells were incubated with HRP-conjugated second antibodies. Finally, the viral foci were visualized by addition of the DAB (3, 3-diaminobenzidine) HRP substrate using an Enhanced HRP-DAB kit (Tiangen, China), according to the manufacturer's instructions.
