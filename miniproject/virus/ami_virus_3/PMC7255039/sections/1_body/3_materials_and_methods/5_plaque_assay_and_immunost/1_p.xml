<p>For the double plaque assay, Vero cells at 80% confluence in 6-well plates were inoculated with 500 Î¼l of 10-fold serial dilutions of viral samples in serum-free DMEM. After 1.5 h incubation, 3 mL of 0.6% agarose supplemented with 2% FBS was added into each well. After incubation for 4 days, 3 mL of agarose containing 0.33% neutral red was added to each well. The plaques were photographed or picked after incubation for another 24 h.</p>
