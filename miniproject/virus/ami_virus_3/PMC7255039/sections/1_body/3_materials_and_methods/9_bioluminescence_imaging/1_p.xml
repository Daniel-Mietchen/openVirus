<p>To perform the bioluminescence imaging, the infected mice were shaved in advance and anaesthetised via the subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of Avertin (150 μl/10 g of 2.5% solution). The Nano-Glo substrate (Promega) was diluted 1:20 in PBS, and each mouse was i.p. injected with 100 μl of the mixture. The bioluminescence data were collected using an IVIS CCD camera system (Caliper Life Science), and further processed in Living Image (version 4.5) software (Caliper Life Sciences). To analyse the bioluminescence signals, the ROIs were selected manually in the uniformly scaled images, and the data were defined as total flux in photons/second.</p>
