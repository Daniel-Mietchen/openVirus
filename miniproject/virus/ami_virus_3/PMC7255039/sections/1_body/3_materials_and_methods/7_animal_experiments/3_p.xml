<p>For tissue localization analysis, 3-4-week-old mice that had received footpad injections were anesthetized, imaged, and subjected to tissue collection (heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, brain, testes, ovary/uterus, and intestine). All of the tissues were imaged 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, then stored at ‒80 °C for later use. For the study of vertical transmission, pregnant mice were infected at embryo day 10 (E10) by footpad injection and subjected to imaging 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> at the indicated time points. The newborn mice were also examined by bioluminescence imaging at 1 day after birth.
