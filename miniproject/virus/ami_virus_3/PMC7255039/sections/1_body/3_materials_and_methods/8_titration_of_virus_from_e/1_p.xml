<p>For the measurement of the viral titre, 3-4-week-old AG6 mice that that had received i.c. injections were anesthetized, imaged, and subjected to tissue collection. At 2, 4, and 5 dpi, the brains of the infected mice were removed, weighed, and homogenized with zirconia beads in 1 mL of DMEM. Then, the viral titres in the brains were quantified using immunostaining focus assays.</p>
