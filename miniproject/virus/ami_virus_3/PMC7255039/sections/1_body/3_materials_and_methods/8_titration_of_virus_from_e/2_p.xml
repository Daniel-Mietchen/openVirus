<p>For the measurement of viral loads, 3-4-week-old AG6 mice that had received footpad injections were anesthetized, imaged, and subjected to tissue collection. At 1, 3, and 5 dpi, the spleen, kidney, testis, and ileocecal junction of the infected mice were removed, weighed, and homogenized with zirconia beads in 1 mL of TRIzol reagent. Next, the viral loads in tissues was quantified using qRT-PCR, as described previously 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Briefly, the total RNA was extracted from various tissues using TRIzol reagent before being reverse transcribed into cDNA by using the PrimeScript RT reagent kit. A pair of primers (ZIKV-F: AARTACACATACCARAACAAAGTG and ZIKV-R: TCCRCTCCCYCTYTGGTCTTG) 
 <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> was used to amplify a conserved sequence of the NS5 gene. The cycling programme comprised 95 째C for 3 min, 40 cycles of 95 째C for 10 s, 55 째C for 10 s, and 65 째C for 45 s.
