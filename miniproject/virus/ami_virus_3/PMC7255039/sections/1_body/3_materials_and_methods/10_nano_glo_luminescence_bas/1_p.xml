<p>A Nano-Glo luminescence-based ZIKV neutralization assay was developed for the measurement of the ZIKV-specific neutralizing antibodies, according to a previously described assay that used plaques as a measurement 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. Briefly, the serum samples were two-fold serially diluted, and incubated with 80 IFU of the ZIKV-Nluc virus at 37 °C for 1.5 h. Then, 100 μl of virus-serum mixture was added to Vero cells at 80% confluence in 24-well plates. After incubation at 37 °C for 1.5 h, the cells were washed once with PBS, and were then cultured in freshly prepared medium containing 2% FBS. At 48 hours post infection (hpi), the levels of luciferase activity were measured using the Nano-Glo
 <sup>®</sup> Luciferase Assay System. The 50% neutralization titre (NT
 <sub>50</sub>) was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of each serum sample that resulted in a 50% reduction of the relative light unit relative to the control samples. The traditional neutralization method, PRNT
 <sub>50</sub>, was also performed to ensure the accuracy of the Nano-Glo assay.
