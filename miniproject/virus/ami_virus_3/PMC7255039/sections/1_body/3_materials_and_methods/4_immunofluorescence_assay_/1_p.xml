<p>The cells infected with ZIKVwt or ZIKV-Nluc were washed once with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with cold (‒20 °C) methanol-acetone (1:1) fixation solution for 12 min at RT. The fixed cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated with an anti-ZIKV envelope (E) protein MAb (BioFront Technologies, FL, USA) (diluted 1:200) for 1 h. After washing, the cells were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to FITC (Proteintech, Wuhan, China) (diluted 1:200) at 37 °C for 60 min. After washing again, the cell nuclei were dyed with Hoechst 33258 at 37 °C for 10 min. The images were photographed with a NIKON fluorescence microscope (Tokyo, Japan).</p>
