<p>In the generated ZIKV-Nluc virus, the Nluc reporter was expressed as an additional part of the viral polyprotein, followed by its cleavage from the capsid protein mediated by 2A protease. Notably, C38, which retained the 5' sequence downstream of the AUG region (5'DAR), the hairpin in the C protein-coding region (cHP), the 5'cyclization sequence (5'CS), and the sequence downstream of the 5'CS-pseudoknot (DCS-PK)

 <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>-
 <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. A major hurdle in the practical application of these reporter flaviviruses is the relative instability of viral genomes. It has been proposed that engineered viruses evolve during their lifetime, and that a stable reporter virus could be harvested by picking small plaques 
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>. In our study, a strain of P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus was found to be stable after five rounds of viral infection with no nucleotide substitution in the genome. We postulated that the high stability of P8 ZIKV-Nluc was due to the very small Nluc gene (513bp), the P0 stocks as a population (quasispecies) of general consensus sequence might contain few viral particles with mutant genomes, after purification, the single virus yields exhibited homogeneous entity and high genetic stability. Further studies are still warranted to investigate the reason for the high stability of ZIKV-Nluc. Heterologous gene insertions normally result in the attenuation of the constructed viruses both

 <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>. As expected, the purified ZIKV-Nluc exhibited a lower replication kinetic in the cell culture and a relatively low pathogenicity in mice. Despite this, the ZIKV-Nluc virus showed a similar growth pattern compared to that of its parental counterpart and produced robust luciferase activities with a peak value of &gt; 2 Ã— 10
 <sup>8</sup> light units. The magnitude of the bioluminescence generated by ZIKV-Nluc correlated well with its titre in both the cell culture and mice, which was in agreement with the findings reported by studies on JEV and DENV reporter viruses
