<p>Despite its merits, this study also contains some limitations. One limitation was that ZIKV-Nluc exhibited a lower replication efficiency and a lower pathogenicity than ZIKVwt. Of note, heterologous gene insertions always led to the attenuation of recombinant RNA viruses

Although ZIKV-Nluc was used to determine the replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis of ZIKV, as well as evaluate antivirals and vaccines, further studies will be needed to address the issue of attenuation. The second limitation of this study was the immunocompromised mice that were used. A129 and AG6 mice have been used previously to mimic aspects of ZIKV infection in humans. However, due to the lack of key components of antiviral immunity, these mouse models may not reveal the full range of disease manifestations in humans
