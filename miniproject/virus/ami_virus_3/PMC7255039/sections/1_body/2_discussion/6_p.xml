<p>We used the Nluc-expressing virus to visualize the neutralizing activities and therapeutic potential of the immune serum #22-1 in mice. As expected, significant reductions in bioluminescence signal were observed in mice receiving a pre-incubated virus-immune serum mixture in the early stages of infection. The bioluminescence in mice peaked at 7 dpi, indicating that pre-incubation before inoculation may not guarantee the neutralization of all the infectious particles. Nevertheless, these results provide new evidence for the superior genetic stability of ZIKV-Nluc

The imaging results showed that a significant reduction of bioluminescence was observed in the mice that received a 9-dose treatment of antiviral serum, indicating that #22-1 exhibits therapeutic activity similar to that of other reported antibodies
