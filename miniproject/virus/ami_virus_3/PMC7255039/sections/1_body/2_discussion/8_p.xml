<p>In summary, a novel ZIKV reporter virus was established for the 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging of ZIKV. This study is the first to investigate the spatio-temporal dynamics of ZIKV replication, the invasion of immune-sheltered tissues by ZIKV, and the vertical propagating of ZIKV during pregnancy. In addition to the brain and reproductive tract, including the testis, uterus, and ovary, the intestine was also demonstrated to be a potential target of ZIKV dissemination, wherein the ileocecal junction may likely play a key role in the neuronal dysfunction of ZIKV infection. The non-invasive imaging of ZIKV-Nluc is a powerful tool for use in the characterisation of the replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis of ZIKV, as well as for the evaluation of antivirals and vaccines 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> for the treatment of ZIKV infection in humans.
