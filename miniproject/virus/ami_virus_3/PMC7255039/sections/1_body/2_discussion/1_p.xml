 <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. In this study, we generated a replication-competent Nluc reporter ZIKV, which is genetically stable 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and
 <italic> in vivo</italic>, which represents a powerful tool for the monitoring of the spatio-temporal dynamics of viral infection in living mice. For the first time, we report on the complete process of ZIKV dissemination, as well as the identification of the ileocecal junction as a crucial visceral target of viral infection, the tracking of the vertical propagation of ZIKV, and the congenital infection of fetuses during pregnancy. Our findings confirmed the utility of the reporter virus for use in immunological protection or therapeutic efficacy studies using mouse models.
