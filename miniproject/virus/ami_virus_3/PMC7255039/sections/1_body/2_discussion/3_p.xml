<p>Using the ZIKV-Nluc virus, we visualized the real-time ZIKV infection in A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice. ZIKV is known to directly infect neuronal progenitor cells and causes microcephaly, among other severe pathological complications

 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>. Here, we demonstrated that ZIKV-Nluc primarily spread to the peritoneal cavity in A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice at 1 dpi, and was sustained throughout the remaining infection course. We hypothesized that the high viral loads in the peritoneal cavity may contribute to the quick dissemination of ZIKV to the brain and other organs. Although ZIKV-Nluc was found to be confined to specific parts of the peritoneal cavity in immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, the lack of type I IFN receptors in A129 mice is likely to have contributed to the rapid proliferation of the virus, as well as to its spread to the brain and other organs, which was consistent with a previous biochemical analysis that found that ZIKV did not antagonize type I IFN response by promoting the degradation of STAT2 and did not induce disease in immunocompetent mice 
 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>. By studying genetically deficient animals, previous studies have demonstrated that type I IFNs are crucial for the dissemination of JEV to visceral organs 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Type I IFNs serve as one of the key components in the innate immune system, and many interferon stimulated genes were found to be essential for viral restriction and clearance 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>. After infection with a neurotropic virus, such as West Nile virus, the induction of type I IFN expression in the endothelium has been found to enhance tight junction integrity and limit the permeability of the bloodâ€’brain barrier 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>. We also investigated the function of type II IFNs in the control of ZIKV infection. Compared with the singly-deficient A129 mice, AG6 mice lacking both type I and type II IFN receptors were found to be more susceptible to ZIKV-Nluc, with significantly higher bioluminescent signals being observed at 2 dpi for the dorsal side and at 2 and 3 dpi for the ventral side, indicating that type II IFNs contribute to limiting systemic ZIKV infection in mice in the early stage. Neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have a limited regeneration ability, implying that the noncytolytic clearance of virus from neuronal cells, rather than direct neuronal lysis, is required to maximize the preservation of CNS function 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>. Type II IFNs were previously found to non-cytolytically clear Sindbis virus and measles virus from infected CNS neurons 
 <xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>. However, the protection of the noncytolytic immune response against neurotropic flavivirus has been disputed 
 <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>. Given that type II IFNs interact with type I IFNs through distinct as well as common IFN receptor complexes 
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, we proposed that both type I and type II IFNs are functionally non-redundant for the anti-ZIKV defence, and may modulate virus dissemination by restricting infection in extraneural tissues before irreversible CNS damage in mice. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact mechanism of the non-cytolytic clearance of ZIKV from infected neurons in the CNS.
