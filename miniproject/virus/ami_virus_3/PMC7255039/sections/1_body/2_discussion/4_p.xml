<p>ZIKV is known to preferentially replicate in the reproductive tract, including in the testis, uterus, and ovary 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, and this has been was confirmed by the bioluminescence imaging of specific organs. However, whether the intestine is a potential target organ of ZIKV infection remains to be further clarified. In this study, we found that the Nluc signal was widespread in the whole intestine in all of the immunodeficient mice tested, indicating that the intestine is likely to serve as an important organ of ZIKV infection. Previously, luciferase signals were also detected in the intestine of singly-deficient A129 mice infected with JEV-Rluc or doubly-deficient AG129 mice infected with DENV-Fluc, suggesting that JEV and DENV can replicate in gut-associated lymphoid tissues

 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Nevertheless, it remains unclear which intestine segment is the exact ROI prone to viral infection. In this study, we excised the whole intestine of infected mice, and found that the anatomical location radiating the strongest light emission was the ileocecal junction. The ileocecal junction functions as a mechanical barrier against colonic reflux, and is involved in the “ileal brake”, which slows the transit of chyme through the intestinal tract

 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>. The fact that ZIKV targets the ileocecal junction is consistent with a recent study that found that the infection of enteric neurons with neurotropic flaviviruses causes delayed gastrointestinal transit in mice
