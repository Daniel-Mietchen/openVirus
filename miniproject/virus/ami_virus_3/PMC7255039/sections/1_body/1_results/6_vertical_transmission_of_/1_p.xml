 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, we infected pregnant dams with 6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc at E10 via intra-footpad injection to determine the transmission of ZIKV from mother to offspring in mice. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>A, in infected pregnant AG6 mice, the bioluminescent signals were primarily detected at the local site of inoculation and in the peritoneal cavity at 1 dpi, which then disseminated to other organs before peaking at 5 dpi, decreasing steadily until delivery. By comparison, only a slight bioluminescence signal was detected in the brains of infected pregnant AG6 mice at 3 and 5 dpi, which was markedly different from that of 3-week-old AG6 mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc. The peritoneal cavity of the maternal mice still radiated slight light emissions at 1 day postpartum. In terms of the newborn mice, 25 μl of diluted substrate via a single i.p. injection resulted in an exact and effective bioluminescence (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>B), indicating that ZIKV was capable of crossing the maternal-fetal barrier to infect the fetuses through vertical transmission.
