<p>Although pooled immune sera (neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies) were recommended for protection against ZIKV infection

 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, it is unclear how these sera suppress the progression of viral infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We adopted our established bioluminescence imaging to evaluate the immunological effect of a pooled immune serum, #22-1, which conferred robust neutralizing activities against ZIKVwt (NT
 <sub>50</sub> titre of ~2048). Firstly, 80 IFU of the ZIKV-Nluc virus was pre-incubated with a 1:10 dilution of #22-1 at room temperature (RT) for 1.5 h before injection. The bioluminescent signal was monitored at regular time points post infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>A). Pre-incubation with #22-1 significantly reduced the bioluminescence signal at 3 and 5 dpi (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B and C), and the bioluminescence of the #22-1-treated mice peaked in the peritoneal cavity and brain at 7 dpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>A). By contrast, the bioluminescence of the control mice peaked in the peritoneal cavity and brain at 5 dpi, before decreasing along with the process of viral infection (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>B and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>A).
