<p>Next, we designed a treatment regime of #22-1, as shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>D. The pooled immune sera were administered at the indicated time points before and after infection with ZIKV-Nluc, while the bioluminescent signal was monitored at regular time points post infection. In the mice receiving PBS-immunized sera, a similar kinetic pattern of ZIKV-Nluc expression was observed in different tissues, with bioluminescence peaking at 5 dpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>E and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>B). Treatment with nine doses of #22-1 dramatically reduced the bioluminescent signal in almost all of the infected mice (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>E and F, and 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM0">Figure S4</xref>B). Taken together, the #22-1 treatment greatly restricted the spread of viral infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, which clearly demonstrated that the ZIKV-Nluc virus could be used as a tool for the real-time monitoring of how pooled immune sera (neutralizing anti-ZIKV antibodies or antiviral compounds) suppress the progression of viral infection.
