<p>To determine whether the ZIKV-Nluc virus causes a similar disease progression compared to ZIKVwt, mice were infected with 1.2 Ã— 10
 <sup>5</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc/ZIKVwt via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route and monitored for 20 days for weight loss and mortality. Both A129 mice and AG6 mice infected with ZIKVwt showed weight loss starting at 4 dpi, and all mice died between 7 and 9 dpi (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). By contrast, in the ZIKV-Nluc virus-infected mice, only 33.3% A129 mice and 50% AG6 showed significant weight loss and succumbed to infection by 19 and 18 dpi, respectively (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). The immunocompetent mice, C57BL/6 mice, were not susceptible to infection with neither ZIKVwt nor ZIKV-Nluc (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A and B). The viral titres in sera obtained from A129 mice at 3 and 5 dpi were measured using an immunostaining focus assay (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and D). A129 mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc were found to have significant different viral titres at both 3 dpi (P &lt; 0.05) and 5 dpi (P &lt; 0.01) compared to A129 mice infected with ZIKVwt (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>C and D). These results showed that despite reduced levels of attenuation, the ZIKV-Nluc virus could develop detectable viral titres in sera, suggesting that the virus replicated well in immunodeficiency mouse models. In addition, C57BL/6 mice showed no clinical signs of disease or weight loss when infected with both ZIKV-Nluc and ZIKVwt.
