<p>To accurately identify the potential target organs of ZIKV-Nluc in infected mice, the 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> imaging of organs harvested from AG6, A129, and C57BL/6 mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc at 3 and 5 dpi was performed in a separate experiment. Marked Nluc signals were consistently observed in the abdominal organs of the infected AG6 and A129 mice, including in the spleen, intestine (i.e. ileocecal junction, a key region of the intestine), testis, uterus/ovary, and kidney at both time points (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A and B). Among these organs, the lymphoid rich organs, namely the spleen and the ileocecal junction, radiated two of the strongest light emissions, followed by the uterus/ovary, testis, and kidney. Bioluminescent signals in other organs, such as the brain, heart, and lung, varied individually among mice. For C57BL/6 mice, although only weak luciferase signals were detected in the intestines, no detectable bioluminescence was observed in other organs (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>A and B). In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of ileocecal junction, testis, and brain tissue sections showed a relatively clear distribution of E protein in AG6 mice infected with the ZIKV-Nluc virus (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C and D). By comparison, for C57BL/6 mice, the distribution of E protein was only found in ileocecal junction section at 5 dpi (

Although the possibility that infection in other anatomical tissues may have occurred at earlier time points, or infected cells may have migrated from one location to another at later time points, these results supported previous observations that ZIKV preferentially replicated in both male and female reproductive tracts and led to infertility in mice
