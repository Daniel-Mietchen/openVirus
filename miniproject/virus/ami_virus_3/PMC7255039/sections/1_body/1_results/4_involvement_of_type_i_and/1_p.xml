<p>To determine the mechanisms of ZIKV dissemination and pathogenesis in adults, pregnant mothers, and developing fetuses, the infection of mouse models by mimicking the natural infection route (footpad) is key

 <sup>4</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc, or the parental ZIKV as control, via intra-footpad injections. The resulting bioluminescent signal was monitored longitudinally at regular time points post infection. No real or effective bioluminescence was detected in the mock-infected AG6, A129, and C57BL/6 mice, nor in mice infected with ZIKV-Nluc at 0 dpi (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, in the infected A129 and AG6 mice, following the footpad injection, the bioluminescent signals were primarily observed at the local sites of inoculation and the peritoneal cavity at 1 dpi, further disseminating to the brain and other tissues or organs, peaking in the peritoneal cavity and brain at 5 dpi, and subsequently decreasing throughout the process of viral infection. These results revealed the complete process of ZIKV dissemination and showed that the ZIKV-Nluc virus primarily invaded various abdominal organs and the brain.
