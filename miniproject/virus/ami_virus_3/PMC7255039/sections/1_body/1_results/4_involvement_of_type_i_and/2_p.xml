<p>At 9 dpi, only a slight bioluminescent signal was detected in the peritoneal cavity in the majority of the A129 and AG6 mice. However, at 14 dpi, the real and effective bioluminescence was still detectable in the peritoneal cavity of both AG6 and A129 mice (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>), highlighting the viscerotropism of ZIKV 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>. By contrast, only a weak bioluminescent signal was detected in the peritoneal cavity of some C57BL/6 mice almost throughout the trial period. Next, we calculated the total flux of each ZIKV-Nluc-infected mouse, and found that the signal values of the AG6 mice were significantly higher than those of the A129 mice at 2 dpi for the dorsal side (P &lt; 0.05), and at 2 and 3 dpi for the ventral side (P &lt; 0.05) (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>A and B). These results indicated that although type I IFNs were crucial for the viscera dissemination of ZIKV-Nluc, type II IFN also played a role in the process by delaying disease development in the early stages of virus infection.
