<p>To investigate whether ZIKV-Nluc can be used as a tool for the bioluminescence imaging of ZIKV infection, A129 mice were inoculated with 1.2 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc via the i.p. route, and the bioluminescent signal was monitored at regular times post infection. As shown in Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B, a rapid dissemination of bioluminescence from the injection site was observed in A129 mice as early as at 1 dpi, with the peak bioluminescence occurring at 5 dpi (a robust bioluminescence signal was detected in the whole abdomen, brain, limbs, and tail). For some C57BL/6 mice, a slight detectable luminance signal above background was observed at the indicated time points (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A and B). In a separate experiment, A129 mice were inoculated intracranially (i.c.) with 6 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc, and the bioluminescence in the brain regions were monitored at 2, 4, and 5 dpi. The titres of ZIKV-Nluc were measured using the double plaque assay. A direct correlation (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9617) was found between the viral titres of ZIKV-Nluc and the intensity of luminescence, indicating that the virus replication 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> could be reflected by the changes in luminescence intensity (Figures 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>C and D). To further validate the correlations between the bioluminescent signals and viral loads, AG6 mice were inoculated with 6 × 10
 <sup>4</sup> IFU ZIKV-Nluc via the footpads. Tissues, including spleen, kidney, testis, and ileocecal junction, were isolated at 1, 3, and 5 dpi and subjected to bioluminescence imaging and viral load measurement. Linear regression analysis showed that Nluc signal values correlated well with viral RNA copies in mouse tissues (
