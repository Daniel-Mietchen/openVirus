<p>To generate a bioluminescent ZIKV reporter virus, a Nluc gene was engineered into a full-length infectious cDNA clone of an Asian-lineage Zika virus, SZ-WIV01 
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>A, the monomeric Nluc gene flanked by the N-terminal 38 amino acids of C protein (C38) and a FMDV2A (F2A) sequence was inserted between 5'UTR and the N-terminus of open reading frame (ORF). The C38 sequence was required for maintaining genome cyclization and for viral RNA replication, and the F2A sequence was placed downstream of the Nluc gene to ensure that the Nluc protein was properly processed
