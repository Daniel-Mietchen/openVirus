<p>P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus was rescued through the transfection of Vero cells with the full-length ZIKV-Nluc cDNA clone (ZIKV-Nluc-FL). P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus harbouring the intact genome, without the loss of Nluc, was confirmed by RT-PCR assay by amplifying the fragment from 5'UTR to the C gene (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>B). Compared with ZIKVwt, the P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus produced smaller plaques, which were visualized by immunostaining (P &lt; 0.001) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C) and 0.33% neutral red (P &lt; 0.001) (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>D), demonstrating that the insertion of the Nluc gene attenuated the virus in cell culture. The infection of Vero cells with P0 virus resulted in the robust production of luciferase activity (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>E), despite the P0 virus having lower infectious titres, at 3 and 4 days post infection (dpi) (P &lt; 0.05), and exhibiting a lower replication efficiency than ZIKVwt (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>F).
