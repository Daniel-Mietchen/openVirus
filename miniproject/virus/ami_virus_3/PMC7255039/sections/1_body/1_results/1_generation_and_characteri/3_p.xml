<p>The genetic stability of ZIKV-Nluc is prerequisite for its use. To test the stability of the ZIKV-Nluc virus, the P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus was passaged in Vero cells for five rounds. After each passage (P1 to P5), the viruses were examined for the Nluc gene. The RT-PCR results indicated that the Nluc gene began to be lost in the P1 viral stock (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>G). To improve the stability of ZIKV-Nluc, the P0 ZIKV-Nluc virus was purified for four rounds in Vero cells using a double plaque assay (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>H). The resulting P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus was re-passaged five times in Vero cells, the passages of which did not result in any apparent loss of NLuc gene, indicating that the genome of ZIKV-Nluc was stable for at least five life cycles (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>I). Sequence analysis of the entire genome of P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus revealed no nucleotide substitution (Fasta data-S1 in
