<p>To further validate the ZIKV-Nluc virus (P8), viral protein synthesis was examined in Vero cells. As measured by IFA assays, the amount of E-positive cells infected with ZIKV-Nluc virus increased with the time of infection, although the percentage of positive cells was less than that of ZIKVwt before the peak at 3 dpi (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>A). Next, we determined the kinetics of the luciferase activities in Vero cells infected with different MOIs (0.001, 0.01, 0.1 or 1) of ZIKV-Nluc virus. As shown in Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>B, the growth of the Nluc signal showed a good correlation with the MOI in the ZIKV-Nluc virus (P8)-infected Vero cells. In a parallel experiment of double plaque assay, P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus showed low infectious titres at 2, 3, 4, and 5 dpi (P &lt; 0.05). However, the growth pattern for the bioluminescent virus was similar to that for ZIKVwt (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>C). In addition, the MOI of 0.01 was selected and applied in subsequent correlation analyses of viral titres and Nluc activities. We demonstrated that there was an excellent linear correlation (r
 <sup>2</sup> = 0.9114) between the Nluc signal values and the viral titres of P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus (Figure 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>D). Collectively, the P8 ZIKV-Nluc virus showed a superior genetic stability and produced levels of luciferase activity that accurately reflected the replication of the virus
