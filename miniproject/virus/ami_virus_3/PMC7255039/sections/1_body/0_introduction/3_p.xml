<p>Bioluminescence imaging is a sensitive and non-invasive technology that allows for the visualization of viral dynamics in real time 
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>. This strategy measures the light generated by luciferase-catalysed oxidation reactions, an indicator of the extent of infected tissues, by using a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>. Bioluminescence imaging measures the spatial and temporal progression of both primary infection and reinfection in the same animal model, which is able to not only reduce the inter-animal variability and animal suffering, but also improve the accuracy, stability, and reproducibility of the results 
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>. Bioluminescence imaging has been widely utilised in the study of viruses, including influenza virus, enterovirus 71, herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, dengue virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, monkeypox virus, and hepatitis C virus

 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Recently, bioluminescence imaging assays of flaviviruses infection in mice have been implemented using recombinant viruses harbouring the firefly luciferase (Fluc) or Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>. Compared with Fluc and Rluc, the very small nanoluciferase (Nluc) (19-kDa) produces 150-fold more light 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, and shows a greater potential for bioluminescence imaging 
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>. To date, there have been no successful attempts at the non-invasive detection of ZIKV infection 
 <italic>in vivo</italic>, which is warranted for characterizing the mechanisms of the replication and pathogenesis of the virus, as well as to improve the preclinical evaluation of vaccines, antiviral drugs, or therapeutic antibodies for ZIKV.
