<p>Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne virus that belongs to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family 
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>. ZIKV was first isolated in 1947 from a febrile rhesus macaque in the Zika forest of Uganda 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Only 14 cases of sporadic infection with mild symptoms were reported in the following 60 years

 <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>. After several epidemics in Yap Island in 2007 and in French Polynesia and other Pacific islands in 2013-2014, ZIKV colonised the Americas in February 2015, causing 707,133 cases of autochthonous infection within 48 countries and territories by late 2016

 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. During these large epidemics in the Americas, ZIKV infection resulted in severe pathological complications, notably microcephaly in newborns and Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) in adults 
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>. The virus is mainly transmitted by the bite of 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, but direct, interhuman transmission through sexual or vertical route has also been confirmed, setting ZIKV apart from most other flaviviruses 
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. To date, there is no licensed vaccine or antiviral therapy available for the treatment of ZIKV infection. The efficient transmission of this virus combined with deficient antiviral strategies has exacerbated public panic over ZIKV
