<p>In this study, a recombinant ZIKV harbouring the Nluc gene (ZIKV-Nluc) was designed, recovered, and purified. This recombinant virus showed a high genetic stability and replicated well in cells with similar properties to the wild-type ZIKV (ZIKVwt). The levels of bioluminescence were found to be directly correlated with viral loads

To our knowledge, this is the first real-time non-invasive tracking of the progression of ZIKV invading immune-sheltered tissues, as well as its vertical propagating, during pregnancy. The results presented in this study demonstrate that ZIKV-Nluc is a powerful tool for use in the study of the replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis of ZIKV
