<p>The mechanisms for the dissemination and pathogenesis of ZIKV in developing fetuses, pregnant mothers, and adults remain largely unknown. ZIKV is likely to invade a unique set of immune-sheltered tissues, including the brain, testis, and placenta. Several ZIKV animal infection models have been previously established 
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> to quantify viral genomes and antigens, which have provided useful information about both the viral and host factors that determine replication and pathogenesis 
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>. However, it has not been possible to monitor the real-time patterns of ZIKV infection through these methods 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. The collection of tissues and organs to evaluate ZIKV infection requires the euthanasia of the animals, and important tissues or organs may be missed if samples are not taken adequately
