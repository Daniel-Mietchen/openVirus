   <bold> Spatio-temporal dynamics of ZIKV-Nluc invading pregnant mice and spreading vertically to the fetuses.</bold> Four-week-old AG6 female mice (n = 3) were mated with AG6 males. On E10, pregnant mice were infected with 6 Ã— 10
   <sup>4</sup> IFU of WT or ZIKV-Nluc via the footpad. Viral spreads from the ventral and dorsal views of ZIKV-Nluc-infected pregnant mice were monitored in real time at the indicated times (A). Bioluminescence imaging of fetuses from ZIKV-Nluc-infected dams was performed at day 1 after birth (B).
