   <bold> Pathogenicity of ZIKV-Nluc in A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice.</bold> (A, B) Groups of A129, AG6, and C57BL/6 mice (3-4 weeks old; n = 6) were infected intraperitoneally with 1.2 × 10
   <sup>5</sup> IFU of WT or ZIKV-Nluc. Body weight loss and survival were monitored on a daily basis for 20 days. (C, D) Two groups of A129 mice (3-4 weeks old; n = 3) were infected intraperitoneally with 1 × 10
   <sup>4</sup> IFU of WT or ZIKV-Nluc. Serum viral loads were determined at day 3 and day 5 by an immunostaining plaque assay. Data represent the mean ± SD analysed by Student's t-test (two tailed) (*, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001).
