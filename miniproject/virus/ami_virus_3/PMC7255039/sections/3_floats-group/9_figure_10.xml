   <bold> Application of ZIKV-Nluc for immunological protection evaluation.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of bioluminescence imaging of 3-4 weeks old AG6 mice receiving a mixture of ZIKV-Nluc and pooled immune serum, #22-1. (B) The viral spread from the ventral view of ZIKV-Nluc-infected mice was monitored in real time at the indicated times. (C) The average radiance of ZIKV-Nluc-infected mice was determined by ROI analysis of the ventral side. (D) Bioluminescence imaging of 3-4-week-old AG6 mice that received nine doses of #22-1. (E) The viral spread from the ventral view of ZIKV-Nluc-infected mice was monitored in real time at the indicated times. (F) The average radiance of ZIKV-Nluc-infected mice was determined by ROI analysis of the ventral side. Data represent the mean Â± SD analysed by Student's t-test (two tailed) (*, P &lt; 0.05; **, P &lt; 0.01; ***, P &lt; 0.001).
