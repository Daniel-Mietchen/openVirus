  <p>Genome of SARS CoV-2. The virion contains a single positive-sense RNA genome with a total of ~30,000 nucleotides (nt). The genome includes a 5′-cap, 5′-untranslated region (UTR), a large number of transcripts encoding 10 open reading frames(ORFs), ORFs with fusion, deletion, and/or frameshift and 3′-UTR, the essential genes that make complete viral genome from 5′ to 3′ are as follows 1) ORF1ab that encodes replicase polyprotein 1a and 1b, the ORFs 2–10 encodes viral structural proteins which include spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), nucleocapsid (N) and other accessory proteins. The ORF1ab gene constitutes a total of 16 non-structural proteins (NSPs1–16) within the pp1ab gene.</p>
