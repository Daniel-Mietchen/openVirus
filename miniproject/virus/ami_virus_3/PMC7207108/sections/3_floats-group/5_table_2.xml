    <td>Higher sequence identity between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13</td>
    <td>SARS-CoV-2 from BAL fluid showed 96.2% sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 and as per the evidence, bat could be the closest relative. This study also confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 receptor to enter the cells.</td>

    <td>Pangolin-CoV is identical to SARS-CoV-2 at the whole-genome level</td>
    <td>Zhang et al. has reported that Pangolin-CoV exhibited 91.02% similarity to SARS-CoV-2. The S1 spike subunit of Pangolin-CoV is much more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than RaTG13. This data suggest that the 5 key amino acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are completely consistent between Pangolin-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. Also, this data suggest that some Pangolin-CoV genes showed higher amino acid sequence identity to SARS-CoV-2 genes than to RaTG13 genes, including ORF1b (73.4%/72.8%), ORF7a (96.9%/93.6%), ORF10 (97.3%/94.6%). and the spike protein (97.5%/95.4%).</td>

    <td>SARS-CoV-2 might be a recombinant virus, with its genome evolved from Yunnan bat virus–like SARSr-CoVs and its RBD region acquired from pangolin virus–like SARSr-CoVs.</td>
    <td>This study identified that SARS-CoV-2 genomes showed 96.1% genome identities with SARSr-Ra-BatCoV-RaTG13, 87.8% with SARSr-Rp-BatCoV-ZC45, 87.6% with SARSr-Rp-BatCoV-ZXC21, 85.3% with pangolin-SARSr CoV/P4L/Guangxi/2017.
     <break/>Their findings suggest SARS-CoV-2 showed high amino acid sequence identities with that of SARSr-Ra-BatCoV RaTG13, except the receptor RBD region while RBD is closest to that of pangolin-SARSr-CoV/MP789/Guangdong/2019 suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 might be a recombinant virus.

    <td>SARS-CoV-2 was likely constructed via laboratory recombination</td>
    <td>In this claim, it was reported that SARS-CoV-2 had a unique sequence (1378 bp) located in the middle of its spike glycoprotein gene that had no similarity with other coronaviruses. Furthermore, this report also claimed that this sequence was similar to that of a common expression vector named pShuttle-SN which is commonly used in research.</td>

    <td>SARS-CoV-2 is not a laboratory origin</td>
    <td>Pei et al. opposed the above conclusion and claimed that sequence (1378 bp) from SARS-CoV-2 was also found in other coronavirus and is naturally existing. pShuttle-SN was built in 2005 as an expression plasmid carrying a fragment sequence of spike gene from SARS-CoV, which caused the similarity match between plasmid and the SARS-CoV-2 spike gene sequence.</td>
