<p id="p0180">Monoclonal antibodies are currently used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Various monoclonal antibodies are approved by US-FDA to treat cancer and autoimmune disorders. Additionally, few of monoclonal antibodies are tried to treat SARS-CoV-2 infections such as bevacizumab (

CR3022 epitope was not overlapped with the ACE2 binding site within SARS-CoV-2 RBD ([

Zhongyu Zhu et al. tested the human monoclonal antibody m396 for treating the SARS-CoV, which competes with the SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2 and inhibits the interaction between SARS-CoV and ACE2 [
 <xref rid="bb0665" ref-type="bibr">133</xref>]. Chunyan Wang and coworkers tested human monoclonal antibody 47D11 on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 strains, where it binds with conserved epitope present on the spike RBD and further it cross-neutralized SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, and this mode of action is independent to receptor binding inhibition [
 <xref rid="bb0670" ref-type="bibr">134</xref>]. Anjeanette Roberts and colleagues developed monoclonal antibody MAb 201 and tested on the golden Syrian hamster model of SARS-CoV infection, where it inhibited the viral replication and decreased the interstitial pneumonitis [
 <xref rid="bb0675" ref-type="bibr">135</xref>]. Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible due to interaction of spike protein with human ACE2, thus spike protein is the main target for antibody-mediated neutralization. Various neutralizing monoclonal antibodies are tested against SARS-CoV including 80R, CR3014, CR3022, m396, B1, 201, 68, 1F8, and 5E9, these antibodies might play an important therapeutic role in SARS-CoV-2 infections [
 <xref rid="bb0680" ref-type="bibr">136</xref>]. Collectively, spike proteins, ACE2 and their interactions are the main targets for developing new therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for treating SARS-CoV-2 infections.
