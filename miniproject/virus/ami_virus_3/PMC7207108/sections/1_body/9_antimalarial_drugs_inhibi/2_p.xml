<p id="p0115">Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are the class of quinoline derivatives and widely used to treat malaria caused by 
 <italic>Plasmodium vivax</italic>, 
 <italic>P. malariae</italic>, and 
 <italic>P. ovale</italic> [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. It is the active constituent of the bark of Cinchona (
 <italic>Cinchona officinalis</italic>) plant. Apart from malaria, it can be used to treat amebiasis [
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>] and other autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis [
 <xref rid="bb0380" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>] and lupus erythematosus syndrome [
 <xref rid="bb0385" ref-type="bibr">77</xref>]. Chloroquine and its derivative hydroxychloroquine inhibit the heme polymerase in malarial trophozoites, preventing the conversion of heme to hemozoin. Plasmodium species continue to accumulate toxic heme, killing the parasite and exhibits antimalarial activity [
 <xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. Whereas the antiviral activity of chloroquine is exerted by diffusing into the host cells and accumulating in endosomes, lysosomes and Galgi complexes, where it is converted into protonated form, then this moiety is deposited in organelles and further involve in raising the surrounding pH [
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. The raised pH in endosomes and lysosomes prevent viral fusion and inhibits the viral entry by endocytosis into the cells [
 <xref rid="bb0400" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. ACE2 is the target receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 for viral fusion, however, chloroquine does not affect the ACE2 levels but downregulated the terminal glycosylation of ACE2 [
 <xref rid="bb0395" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0405" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Insufficient glycosylation of ACE2 offers inefficiency to bind with SARS-CoV-2 viral spike proteins and inhibits viral fusion [
 <xref rid="bb0410" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Hu et al. demonstrated that Chloroquine inhibited the endocytosis mediated cell uptake of SARS-CoV-2 by suppressing the phosphatidylinositol binding clathrin assembly protein (PICALM) [
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. In the field of Nanomedicine, Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine has been used extensively to understand the mechanism of Nanoparticles uptake into cells. It was used as inhibitor of Nanoparticles uptake via endocytosis pathway. Similar kind of viral particle entry through endocytosis route is proposed to be inhibited by Chloroquine [
 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. The combination of Chloroquine or its derivative hydroxychloroquine with drugs like Remdesivir or Azithromycin demonstrated to produce beneficial effects against this novel virus. However, its use in SARS-CoV-2 therapy has not been approved by US FDA and there are multiple clinical trials going on to evaluate the efficacy of Chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 (

 <xref rid="bb0420" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. Additionally, few reports indicated that Chloroquine exerts proarrhythmic effects by increasing the QT interval in the ECG patterns and decreasing the heart rate [
 <xref rid="bb0425" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This drug cannot be indicated for the patients who suffer from retinopathy and porphyria [
 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0435" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Based on the promising evidences, Chloroquine may become suitable drug for SARS-CoV-2 disease. Further, to improve the efficacy, Hydroxychloroquine may be used in place of Chloroquine. There were reports suggested the superior antiviral effects of Hydroxychloroquine compared to Chloroquine with better safety profiles [
 <xref rid="bb0440" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>]. Further, the combinational approach along with other antiviral drugs may be designed to evaluate the efficacy. Other antimalarial drugs such as Artesunate and Artemisone found to be effective against human cytomegaloviruses, but effect of these compounds on SARS-CoV-2 needs to be evaluated [
 <xref rid="bb0445" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0450" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. Moreover, the severe inflammatory cytokine storm observed in multiple organs may be curtailed by Chloroquine due to its immunomodulatory effects.
