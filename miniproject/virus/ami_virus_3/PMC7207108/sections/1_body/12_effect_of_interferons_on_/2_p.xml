<p id="p0165">The 166 amino acid sequence of Interferon alfacon-1 is produced by recombinant DNA technology, which is the class of non-naturally occurring type-I interferon [
 <xref rid="bb0610" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>]. Interferon alfacon-1 acts as anticancer and antiviral agent. The therapeutic effect of Interferon alfacon-1 was observed in leukemia, melanoma, HIV/AIDS related Kaposi's sarcoma, and hepatitis C [
 <xref rid="bb0615" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>]. It is also found to be effective in SARS-CoV and also tested in SARS-CoV-2 in combination with corticosteroids [
 <xref rid="bb0620" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0625" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>]. Interferon alfacon-1 shows antiviral activity by binding to interferon receptors type 1 including IFNAR1 and IFNAR2c. Further, it initiates the dimerization and activates the Janus kinase 1 (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase 2 (Tyk2) phosphorylation. The signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 and 2 (STAT1 and STAT2) bind to the phosphorylated IFNAR and initiate the expression of immunomodulators and antiviral protein expression including protein kinase R (PKR) and 2′-5′ oligoadenylate synthase (2′-5′ OAS) [

There are multiple reports on the antiviral activity of IFN-α and IFN-β, and combinations of IFN-α/β, IFN-β 1a and IFN-γ against SARS-CoV and these agents might be also effective against SARS-CoV-2 too, which need to be evaluated in suitable studies [
