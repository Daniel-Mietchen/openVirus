<p id="p0200">The Indian traditional plant Neem (
 <italic>Azadirachta indica</italic>) and its parts such as leaves, seeds, flowers, barks and routes are widely using in various diseases. Ancient people believe that it is a Sarva roga nivarini (the cure for all diseases). Methanolic extract of neem leaves exhibited antiviral activity against Herpes simplex virus type 1 infections by inhibiting HSV-1 glycoprotein mediated viral fusion and polykaryocytes [

TNF-α is a pleiotropic cytokine involved in activation of various signaling cascade and this cytokine might be playing role in respiratory failure associated with COVID-19 mediated pneumonia. Nimbolide is found to be TNF-α inhibitor and also suppresses the nuclear translocation of p65 NF-κB and HDAC-3 and inhibited the cytokine storm observed in ARDS experimental model [

Thus it might show beneficial effects in SARS-CoV-2 infections by direct antiviral activity or indirect supportive therapy by controlling the inflammatory cytokine storm. This natural product may have clinical significance in inflammation associated with viral diseases. The other natural product Withaferin A is isolated from Ashwagandha (
 <italic>Withania somnifera</italic>) and widely used to treat various diseases such as cancer, fibrosis, and inflammatory disorders. It has shown the antiviral activity against Herpes Simplex virus 1 and 2 [
