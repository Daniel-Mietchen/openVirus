<p id="p0195">Our diet contains a lot of vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and lipids and they play an important role in maintaining the homeostasis in our body and play important role in maintaining the immunity. Additionally, our diet contains various biological active natural products and they exert multiple pharmacological properties such as anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic, antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties etc. The battery of pro-inflammatory cytokines are responsible for the cytokine storm, which is involved in manifestation of severe acute lung injury, this is the main cause for SARS-CoV-2 induced morbidity and mortality. The active constituent of turmeric, Curcumin exhibits wider pharmacological activities such as anti-bacterial, antiviral, anticancer, anti-diabetic properties. Curcumin inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α level and suppressed the cytokine storm in Ebola virus infected experimental models [

 <sub>50</sub> value) was found to be around 10 μM and also acted as a protease inhibitor [

Thus it might be effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections, where intravenous (i.v.) route of administration in suitable formulation form may enhance the better bioavailability. Similarly, a thorough search across all the natural products needs to be evaluated for their direct antiviral effects and their potential role in controlling severe inflammatory responses observed in COVID-19 induced pneumonia.
