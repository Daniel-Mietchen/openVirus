 <xref rid="bb0590" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>]. Molecular docking studies of RNA dependent RNA polymerase model suggest that Sofosbuvir in combination with Ribavirin and Remidisvir could exhibit possible therapeutic effects in SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="bb0460" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Basically, Sofosbuvir is a prodrug, which converts into active metabolite GS-461203 (2′-deoxy-2′-α-fluoro-β-
 <italic>C</italic>-methyluridine-5′-triphosphate) and serve as a defective substrate for the non-structural protein 5B (NS5B) of RNA dependent RNA polymerase and further inhibits RNA synthesis [
 <xref rid="bb0595" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>]. Sofosbuvir and other combinations will be tested in the view of adverse effects such as pruritis, upper respiratory tract infections, and lymphopenia [
