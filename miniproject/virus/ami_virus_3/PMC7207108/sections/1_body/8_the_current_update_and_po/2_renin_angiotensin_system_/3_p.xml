<p id="p0110">But the ACE2 activity is not altered correspondingly, while cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression was increased with RAS receptor inhibitor Losartan. Combination of Losartan and Lisinopril did not affect the ACE2 activity compared with Losartan alone, but on other side, ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed with Losartan alone [
 <xref rid="bb0345" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Thus there is a lack of correlation between up and down expression of ACE2 mRNA with ACE2 activity. However, there is a debate on the use of RAS and ACE inhibitors in SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia infections and few clinical trials are going on for the usage of Losartan among patients who have not previously administered with RAS inhibitors and are either hospitalized (

Further, in one promising study, circulating recombinant human soluble ACE2 protein upon intravenous administration produced significant blockade of initial stages of SARS-CoV-2 viral entry and infections by preventing the binding of viral spike protein onto cell host cell surface ACE2 receptors [
