<p id="p0270">Over the past 50â€¯years, in the pre-SARS era, many different CoVs have been identified that caused a wide variety of human and veterinary diseases. In particular, the human CoVs were found to cause mild respiratory diseases. In November 2002, SARS-CoV infection was emerged in Guangdong Province of China, identified to be fatal resulting in ARDS, which became a pandemic in 37 countries with over 8000 reported cases and 800 deaths [

At that time no specific drugs or vaccines were available and only preventive measures were implemented to limit the transmission rate by maintaining social distance, quarantine, travel restrictions, patient isolation. In 2012, another zoonotic CoV were identified from Saudi Arabia postulated to have originated from the dromedary camels which infected 2494 people and 858 deaths were reported [

As of 8 April 2020, approximately 1.43 million cases of COVID-19 has been confirmed worldwide, and this pandemic is rapidly escalating all around the globe and most of the countries implemented the most restrictive mass quarantines that led to severe global socioeconomic disruption which has become the greatest concern of WHO [

As of now, there are no specific approved drugs for treating SARS-CoV-2 and currently, physicians are using the repurposing drugs such as Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, Azithromycine, Dexamethasone, Acetaminophen etc., and they are showing plausible results, however more studies are required for specific use against SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, immune boosters such as Vitamin C, Zinc and other natural products are suggested in preventing the viral infections. Additionally, scientists are developing the new antiviral drugs and vaccines, and few are under the clinical trials. Apart from traditional drug therapy, medical practitioners are transfusing the convalescent plasma to rescue the critically ill patients with successful outcome in viral load reduction; Also, MSCs were effective for treatment with encouraging improvement with fewer side effects. Thus there is a lot of scope to develop antiviral drugs and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2; there is a need for vigorous effort on the vaccine development and exploration of potential antiviral treatment regimens. Simultaneously, the primary and intermediate host and mechanism of its cross-species spread and human interface needs to be investigated. Owing to the fact that new CoV viruses will continue to evolve on the basis of their ability to undergo frequent recombination's of their genomes, mutations, the propensity to infect multiple species and the increasing human-animal interface, the strict legislations should be made to prohibit the consumption and farming of terrestrial wild animals to prevent the future outbreaks.
