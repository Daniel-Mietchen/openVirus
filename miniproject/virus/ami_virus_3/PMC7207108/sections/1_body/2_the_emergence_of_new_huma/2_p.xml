<p id="p0045">Human CoVs were first identified in mid-1960s, where the first CoV (HCoV-229E) was isolated from people suffering from the common cold in 1965. Later, HCoV-OC43 type was identified, which was thought to be responsible for 5 to 30% of human respiratory tract infections in infants, and older adults and immunocompromised individuals [

Almost 40 years later, in November 2002, a newly emerged CoV was identified as the causative reason for the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and named as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It represents the first human-human transmissible pandemic disease in the 21st century. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared this ailment as “a worldwide health threat.” The outbreak of SARS started in the southern People's Republic of China, where 5300 people were infected and killed 349 nationwide [

On the other side, another lethal zoonotic beta CoV was identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and named as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) which is different from SARS-CoV, which was responsible for 858 deaths out of total 2494 confirmed cases in 27 countries according to the WHO [

In late December 2019, the world has witnessed another deadliest outbreak for the first time in Wuhan, China, as cluster of pneumonia cases and various degrees of respiratory illness with unknown etiology and it was identified as a novel betacoronavirus, first called as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCov) and it was renamed as SARS-CoV-2 on the basis of its close resemblance with 2002 SARS-CoV, the disease it caused was termed as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], which had become pandemic and evolved all around the globe and spread to &gt;203 countries and territories, by strong human-human community transmission. For the viral entry into target cells both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use similar mechanism as both of these viruses contain variable receptor-binding domain (RBD) that bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) receptors. The SARS-CoV-2 was suspected to have originated from bats and pangolins [
