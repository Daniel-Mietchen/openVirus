<p id="p0085">During an emerging pandemic outbreak of an infectious disease, it is essential to know the level of transmission and the contagiousness which can be estimated by “R naught” (R0), a mathematical term which is the basic reproduction number that determines the average number secondary cases who are previously free of infection gets infected by one sick host. If the R0 is less than one the existing infection causes less than one infection, in such cases the spread declines and disappears. If R0 value equals 1, each existing infection causes one new infection. If R0 is &gt;1, each existing infection may spread on an average more than one individual which may lead to dramatic increase in transmission and may result in epidemic [

However, there are documented additional fatal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury, and incidence of grand-glass opacities (an area of increased attenuation in the lung on computed tomography (CT) with preserved bronchial and vascular markings in the periphery of the lungs with haziness overlying an area of the lung) [

Recent evidence suggest that 97.5% of infected individuals develop symptoms within 11.5 days and the median incubation period to develop symptoms was estimated to be 5.1 days and 101 out of every 10,000 cases were found to develop symptoms after 14 days of active monitoring or quarantine [
