<p id="p0080">SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious with powerful transmissibility. The current evidence suggest that human-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by coughing or sneezing from the infected individual through respiratory droplets (droplet particles &gt;5–10 μm in diameter) in close contact (within 1 m) or as droplet nuclei (particles &lt;5 μm in diameter) which can remain in the air for long periods and be transmitted to others over distances &gt;1 m. The transmission is also possible with the indirect contact with surfaces in the immediate environment exposes to the mucosa by nose and mouth or conjunctiva (eyes) for the viral entry [
