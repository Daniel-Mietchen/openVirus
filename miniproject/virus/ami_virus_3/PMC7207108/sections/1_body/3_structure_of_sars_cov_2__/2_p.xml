<p id="p0050">The viral strain was isolated from a patient's bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and further identified as SARS-CoV-2 by the metagenomic RNA sequencing. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that the SARS-CoV-2 virion is spherical with 60 to 140 nm diameter in size has club-shaped glycoprotein spikes with 8 to 12 nm length. The virion contains a single positive-sense RNA genome with a total of 29,903 nucleotides (nt) with the G + C content of 38% [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. SARS-CoV-2 genome has 10 open reading frames (ORFs), the essential genes that make complete viral genome from 5′ to 3′ are as follows 1) ORF1ab that encodes replicase polyprotein 1ab, the ORFs 2–10 encodes viral structural proteins which include 2) spike 3) envelope 4) membrane 5) nucleocapsid and 6) other auxiliary proteins (
