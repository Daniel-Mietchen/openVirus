<p id="p0060">The life cycle of SARS-CoV-2 and viral replication begins in ACE-2 receptor over expressed cells, which is critical in the pathogenesis [
 <xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. The spike glycoprotein is located on the surface of CoVs is crucial for viral infection and pathogenesis, which are subdivided into S1 and S2 subunits. S1 has a RBD which constitutes 394 glutamine residues and this is recognized by lysine 31 residues on the human ACE2 receptor that determines the cellular tropism and virus-host range, while S2 subunit mediates virus-cell membrane fusion. After receptor binding, S protein is subjected to enzymatic modification by the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2), which is present at the vicinity of ACE2, induces conformational changes and fuses with the plasma membrane or enter by endocytosis [

For the SARS-CoV-2 entry through endocytosis, Phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase (PIKfyve), Two-pore channel subtype 2 (TPC2), and cathepsin L are considered crucial. The availability of proteases in the host such as furin, TMPRSS2, trypsin, cathepsins and human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) cleave spike proteins that largely determine whether CoVs enter cells through plasma membrane or endocytosis [
