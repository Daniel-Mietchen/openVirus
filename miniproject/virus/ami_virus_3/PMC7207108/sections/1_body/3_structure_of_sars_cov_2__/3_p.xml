<p id="p0055">The spike and membrane proteins create a viral envelope which consists of a double layer of lipids and nucleocapsid holds the RNA genome which gives the virus a crown-like or solar corona appearance [
 <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Phylogenetic analysis by Fan et al. revealed that the complete viral genome has ~29,903 nucleotides that were more closely related to a group of SARS-like Betacoronaviruses, and subgenus Sarbecovirus with 89.1% nucleotide similarity. SARS-CoV-2 has 5′ and 3′ terminal sequences that are typical for beta CoVs with 265 nt at the 5′ end and 229 nt at the 3′ terminal end. The predicted replicase ORF1a and ORF1b genes are 21,291 nt in length and comprise about two thirds of the viral genome that codes 16 predicted non-structural proteins (NSPs1–16). There is A-1 frame shift between ORF1a and ORF1b, leading to production of two polypeptides (pp1a and pp1ab) [
 <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The NSP containing amino acids (aa) and functions are 1) NSP-1(180 aa) mediates RNA replication and processing, 2) NSP2 (638 aa) function is unknown, 3) NSP3 (1945 aa) contains multiple domains, including a segment of SARS unique domain and proteolytic enzyme papain-like protease (PLpro), 4) NSP4 (500 aa) complexes with NSP3 and 6, that in protein-protein interactions, 5) NSP5 (306 aa) is a 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), 6) NSP6 (290 aa) complexes with NSP3 and 4, 7) NSP7 (83 aa) complexes with NSP8: primase, 8) NSP 8 (198 aa) complexes with NSP7: primase, 9) NSP 9 (113 aa) involves in viral genomic RNA reproduction, 10) NSP 10 (139 aa) complexes with NSP14: involves in replication fidelity, 11) NSP 11 (13 aa) is a short peptide at the end of ORF1a, 12) NSP 12 (932 aa) is a RNA dependent RNA polymerase enzyme (RdRp), 13) NSP 13 (601 aa) is a Helicase enzyme, 14) NSP 14 (527 aa), is an Exon: 3′–5′ exonuclease, 15) NSP 15 (346 aa) is an XendoU: poly (U)-specific endoribonuclease, and 16) NSP 16 (298 aa) is an 2′-O-MT: 2′-O-ribose methyltransferase. The predicted nt in structural proteins (spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) are 3822, 228, 669 and 1260 nt in length. The other gene clusters such as ORF3a, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF8 (828, 186, 366, 366 nt) appear only in SARS-CoV-2, bat-SL-CoVZC45 and the SARS-CoV-1 viruses. The ORF10 gene cluster is found to be unique to SARS-CoV-2 [
