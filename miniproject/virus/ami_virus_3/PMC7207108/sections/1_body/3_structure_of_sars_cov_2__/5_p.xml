<p id="p0065">For fusion and the release of viral RNA genome into host cytoplasm, the virion undergoes various modifications by lysosomal cysteine proteases, cathepsin L and cathepsin B in the 
 <italic>endo</italic>-lysosomes and this step is found to be highly pH-dependent. Highly acidic endosomal pH is needed for the fusion and eventually uncoating of the envelope [
 <xref rid="bb0125" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Further, the viral genomic RNA is released into the cytoplasm and translates into two viral replicase polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab that encode non-structural proteins, and form replication-transcription complex (RTC) [
 <xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Continuously the polymerase produces a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs and finally translates into relevant viral proteins. Furthermore, endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi together assemble the newly formed genomic RNA, envelope, nucleocapsid and glycoproteins in vesicles thereby the virion fuses with the plasma membrane to release outside the cell. The envelope protein E has conserved the functional features, such as ion-channels and a PDZ-binding motif (PBM) which is required to induce virulence [
