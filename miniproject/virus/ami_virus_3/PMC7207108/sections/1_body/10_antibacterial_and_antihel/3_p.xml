<p id="p0125">The fluoroquinolone antibacterial drug Ciprofloxacin is used to treat respiratory tract infections. Apart from its antibacterial activity, it can reduce the replication of polyoma BK virus. Ciprofloxacin reduced the viral load with IC
 <sub>50</sub> value (50% virus inhibitory concentration) of 216.67 ± 16.7 μg/ml, whereas, Coumermycin showed the IC
 <sub>50</sub> value of 10.6 ± 3.9 μg/ml [
