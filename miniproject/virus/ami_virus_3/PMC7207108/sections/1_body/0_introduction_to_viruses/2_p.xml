<p id="p0035">Viruses are the non-cellular infectious particles that contain either RNA or DNA as their genetic material which may be single or double-stranded. These viral particles are obligatory in nature, which cannot replicate on their own, hence depends upon the host cellular machinery to reproduce and increase viral particles [

Viruses can infect all life forms, from animals and plants to microorganisms, some viruses have strict host specificity which can infect only single species, while other viruses have broad host ranges and can infect numerous species. The viral particles are submicron in size with size range of 50–200 nm, which cannot be observed under normal microscope [
