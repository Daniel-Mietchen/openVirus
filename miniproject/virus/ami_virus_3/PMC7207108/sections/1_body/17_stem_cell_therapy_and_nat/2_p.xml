<p id="p0255">Stem cells are differentiated into different cells and widely used in treating various diseases such as cancer and organ failure diseases. Apart from traditional drug therapy, researchers are trying to treat patients who suffer from SARS-CoV-2 infections with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). MSCs are the type of multipotent stromal cells that can able to differentiate into various types of cells such as myocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts and chondrocytes [

SARS-CoV-2 enhances the pro-inflammatory cytokine levels such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-7, and TNF-Î± and further causes the terrible cytokine storm in the lungs followed by edema, alveolar dysfunction for the air exchange, ARDS, acute cardiac injury and the systemic infection, which may ultimately lead to death [
