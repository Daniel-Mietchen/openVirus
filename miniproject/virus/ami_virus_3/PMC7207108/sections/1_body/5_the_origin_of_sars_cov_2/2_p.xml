<p id="p0075">The phylogenetic data of SARS-CoV-2 implicate that origin could be zoonotic probably from the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan that has played a role in the early spreading but this observation remains uncertain, as the first documented patient was not linked to this Seafood market [
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Hence, the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 is still ambiguous. Li et al., studied the molecular dating estimate by bayesian time-scaled phylogenetic analysis using the tip-dating method based on the genomic sequences, It was estimated that the time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) and evolutionary rate of SARS-CoV-2, ranged from 22 to 24 November 2019 and 1.19 to 1.31 × 10
 <sup>−3</sup> substitutions per site per year, respectively [

 <xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. A study by Roujian Lu et al., performed next-generation sequencing from BAL or throat swab from nine patient samples and found interesting observations that the SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences exhibited &gt;99·98% sequence similarity among different patient samples tested, which shows that the smaller degree of diversification. They also found an 88% similarity to bat derived SARS like CoVs including bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21. Interestingly, this study also compared the similarity to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, where it was observed a 79 and 50% similarity which indicates that these viruses are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. Surprisingly, in late December Wuhan bat species were in hibernation and were not available for sale in the seafood market. This report also speculates that the initial original reservoir might be the bats transmitted to the intermediate host which were found in the market, where human is the terminal host [

 <xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Another group of researchers found evidence of CoV by genomic sequencing in dead Malayan pangolins and named it as Pangolin-CoV and found that 91.02% similarity to SARS-CoV-2, and 90.55% with Bat CoV RaTG13, have provided evidence based on serological, virological, and histopathology, and also found that there is a close relation with RBD of S1 protein and of SARS-CoV-2 which is important to interact with the ACE2 protein and indicate that pangolins could be the natural reservoirs [
 <xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Besides, the systematic comparison and analysis approach predicted the possibilities that the interaction between the key amino acids of S protein and ACE2 indicates that other than pangolins, snakes, and turtles could also be the potential intermediate hosts in transmitting SARS-CoV-2 to humans [
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Furthermore, Huang et al. have shown that the spike protein in bat CoV RaTGl3 showed 97.43% similarity with SARS-CoV-2 suggesting that this might be the closest strain and pangolin is the most possible intermediate reservoir to humans. Their findings propose the aptitude for evolution with higher chances of homologous recombination between bat and pangolin CoVs and emerged as SARS-CoV-2 recombinant virus with mutations in coding regions of 125 SARS-CoV-2 genomes [

 <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Although differences arise in the observations, these evidences would be helpful to unravel the origin and probable intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2. The origin of virus and various evidences has been described in
