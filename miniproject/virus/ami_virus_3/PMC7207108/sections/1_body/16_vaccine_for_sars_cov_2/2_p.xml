<p id="p0230">The biological preparation of vaccine is useful in attaining the acquired immunity against specific infectious diseases. Vaccines are prepared from dead or inactivated microorganisms or purified products derived from the respective organisms. Vaccines are available as prophylactic as well as therapeutic agents. Apart from the traditional live attenuating method, Novavax is constructing the recombinant vaccine, where the antigens stably expressed from the spike protein in baculovirus system [

In this method, they are isolating the genetic code for the protein spike on the surface of SARS-CoV-2, which is involved to provoke an immune reaction in humans, and this sequence is pasted into the genome of a bacterium or yeast, where it will produce the large quantity of protein of interest. The mRNA-1273 vaccine against SARS-COV-2 was developed by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) scientists and their collaborators at the biotechnology company Moderna, Inc., based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) supported the manufacturing of the vaccine candidate for the clinical trials. Here, the mRNA vaccine is injected to the people through intra muscular route, where the immunogens are produced in human cells instead of recombinant system and exhibit the higher immunocompatibility [

In this mRNA vaccine system, the uridines are modified into pseudouridines in order to prevent the immune-mediated reactions exerted by toll-like receptors such as TLR7 and TLR8, where they recognize the uridines and further activate the interferon response [

This vaccine strategy is currently under phase I clinical trials, where they are working on two objectives, the first objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273, given 28â€¯days apart, across 3 dosages in healthy adults. The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity measured by ELISA to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein following a 2-dose vaccination schedule of mRNA-1273 at Day 57 [

However, it will take some more time to evaluate its full efficacy and safety potential before it is allowed for patient application by regulatory bodies. Similar type mRNA vaccine BNT162 was developed by BioNTech and Pfizer against COVID-19, which is under the clinical trials [
