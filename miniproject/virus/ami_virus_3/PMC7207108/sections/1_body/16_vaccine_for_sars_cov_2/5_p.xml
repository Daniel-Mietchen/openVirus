<p id="p0245">Repurposing of vaccine is a hot topic in SARS-CoV-2 therapy. The tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is primarily used to prevent tuberculosis [

The recent epidemiological study suggests that universal BCG vaccination might play an important role in controlling the morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections. The SARS-CoV-2 affected countries mortality is different in various countries; it may be due to temperature, elder population, humidity, cultural differences, migration, and health systems. New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) scientists proposed that the countries that do not opt the universal BCG vaccination were affected mainly by SARS-CoV-2 infections such as Italy, Netherlands, and USA etc. as compared to the counties who follow the universal BCG vaccination [

BCG vaccination offers broad-spectrum activity against the prevention of respiratory infections and it might reduce the SARS-CoV-2 oriented mortalities. Currently, Australia, Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom (UK) have started the clinical trials first on the front line health workers [
