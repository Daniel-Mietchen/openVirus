<p id="p0235">Shenzhen Geno-Immune Medical Institute has developed synthetic minigene vaccine LV-SMENP-DC and antigen-specific CTLs and artificial antigen-presenting cells (aAPC) for SARS-CoV-2. This vaccine is under the clinical trials, where they are going to test safety and efficacy of innovative SARS-CoV-2 minigenes, engineered based on multiple viral genes, using an efficient lentiviral vector system (LV) to express viral proteins and immune-modulatory genes to modify dendritic cells (DCs) and aAPC to activate cytotoxic T cells [

Additionally, Chinese based company CanSino Biologics has developed the recombinant novel CoVs vaccine (adenovirus type 5 vector) candidate in alliance with Beijing Institute of Biotechnology (BIB), based on the viral vector vaccine technology platform, which was previously used to develop Ebola vaccine. This vaccine strategy has given significant results in preclinical studies, now they have received the approval to initiate clinical trials and Phase 1 clinical trials are ongoing on [
