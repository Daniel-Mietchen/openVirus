<p>As noted previously, ACE2 levels are known to be low in healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], decrease with age, and are lower in men than in women [
 <xref rid="C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>]. Age is an independent risk factor for mortality in patients admitted with COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="C97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. The data also suggests a disproportionate rate of disease occurrence, severity, and worse outcomes in males compared to females during this pandemic [
 <xref rid="C99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>]. These associations might be interpreted to indicate that low ACE2 during times of health are appropriate, but the ability to regulate overactive RAAS or RAAS-SCoV-axis during illness is, at least in part, dependent on ACE2. For instance, one study identified a higher expression of the lung-protective AT
 <sub>2</sub> receptor among women, which could explain the disproportionately lower mortality in female COVID-19 subjects [
 <xref rid="C100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>]. Interestingly, ACE2 is located on the X-chromosome, which has been hypothesised to affect the ability of men to maintain adequate ACE2 production in situations of severe illness (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, ARDS or COVID-19) [
