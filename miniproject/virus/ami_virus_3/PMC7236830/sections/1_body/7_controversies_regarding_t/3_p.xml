<p>Perhaps most importantly, the most common comorbidities of severely ill patients included hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart diseases [
 <xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. These comorbidities are associated with either an overactivation of Ang II/AT
 <sub>1</sub> or a deficiency of ACE2 [
 <xref rid="C42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], and all have shown benefit from RAAS blockade in chronic conditions [
 <xref rid="C101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>], including an attenuation in AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor expression with losartan [
 <xref rid="C102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. Furthermore, smoking tends to increase AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor expression [
 <xref rid="C102" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>] along with ACE2 expression in human and mouse epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="C103" ref-type="bibr">103</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>]. RAAS activation in states of stress with high circulating Ang II levels may be particularly harmful for such patients, and could explain at least some of the observed clinical outcomes. Namely, data from China found the odds of disease progression in those with COVID-19 are 14 times higher in smokers [
 <xref rid="C8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, we acknowledge that misinterpreting association for causation can be dangerous and that the pathology underlying acute and chronic conditions may not be equivalent [
 <xref rid="C105" ref-type="bibr">105</xref>]. Nevertheless, RAAS manipulation remains an attractive therapeutic target not to treat or prevent infection with COVID-19, but rather mitigate its downstream consequences.
