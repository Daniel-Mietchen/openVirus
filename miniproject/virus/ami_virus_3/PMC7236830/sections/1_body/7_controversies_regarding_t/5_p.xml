<p>On the contrary, data summarised in this review actually suggests that discontinuation of ACEi or ARBs could pose a serious risk of harm through the propagation of excessive Ang II mediated acute lung injury and downregulation of protective ACE2. To this point, in a recent preprint, Liu 
 <italic>et al.</italic> retrospectively studied 511 COVID-19 patients (age &gt;65 years old) with hypertension. Patients were categorised based on home anti-hypertensive regimen. Patients on ARBs had significantly decreased odds of developing severe COVID-19 disease on univariate analysis (OR 0.34, p=0.025) and multivariable analysis (OR 0.25, p=0.046), while none of the other medications demonstrated improved outcomes. Two subsequent retrospective studies have demonstrated a protective effect of RAS blockade, including significant reductions in viral load [

 <xref rid="C113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>] identified losartan as a potential candidate treatment based on molecular docking and dynamic simulation. In addition to the effects on angiotensin homeostasis, therefore, losartan may directly inhibit the viral macrodomain and cell cycle [

Even prior to these observational data, based on pre-clinical evidence and non-COVID-19 studies, the International Society of Hypertension, the European Society of Cardiology, and other international committees have strongly recommended that physicians and patients continue treatment with their usual anti-hypertensive therapy as there is no clinical or scientific evidence to suggest that treatment with ACEi or ARBs should be discontinued in the setting of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic at the current time [
