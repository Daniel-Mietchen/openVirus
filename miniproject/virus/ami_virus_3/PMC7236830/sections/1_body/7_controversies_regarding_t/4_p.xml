<p>Side effects of RAAS manipulation are understandably a cause for concern, specifically hypotension and acute kidney injury in the setting of acute illness. The most severe risks of ARBs include teratogenicity in the setting of pregnancy, hypersensitivity including angioedema, symptomatic hypotension, worsening of renal function, and electrolyte abnormalities; however, the most common side effects of include fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, chest pain and anemia. Clinical trial and post-marketing surveillance data of losartan demonstrate an excellent safety profile. In over 4000 patients, there was a low incidence of adverse events (2.1%) comparable to placebo (3.7%) [

These reassuring data cannot be extrapolated to COVID-19 patients; however, when assessing the risk/benefit balance for RAAS modulation, the baseline risk appears low in the healthy population whereas repurposing of other medications may not have the same favorable profile. There are also concerns that the upregulation of ACE2 by ARBs could accelerate SARS-CoV-2 entry in host cells. Such concerns become more relevant when one considers the observation that patients with hypertension tend to have worse outcomes, and many patients with hypertension are on agents that might upregulate ACE2 expression. Consequently, some clinicians have argued for discontinuing ACEi and ARBs and switching their patients to different anti-hypertensive classes. However, to our knowledge, there is no data to suggest such a change is beneficial, nor are there well controlled, risk adjusted analyses demonstrating that these medications are harmful.
