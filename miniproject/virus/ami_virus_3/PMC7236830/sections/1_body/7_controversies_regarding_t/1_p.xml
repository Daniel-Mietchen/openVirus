<p>Limited mechanistic investigations regarding COVID-19 currently exist [
 <xref rid="C95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>]. Early Chinese data illustrate a progressive increase in Ang-II levels among patients hospitalised in the setting of confirmed COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="C96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>], along with concomitant increasing levels of IL-6 levels, with the highest levels in non-survivors [
 <xref rid="C97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>]. Similarly, a 2014 analysis of H7N9 patients showed progressively increasing levels of Ang-II, up to 4â€…weeks following infection, a finding associated with a worse prognosis [
 <xref rid="C89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. In a recent COVID-19 patient study, quantified levels of Ang-II were positively correlated with viral titers and closely associated with PaO2/FiO2 measures, suggesting a relationship between infection, RAAS, and lung injury. Accordingly, the study investigators postulated that angiotensin receptor blockade might represent a promising therapeutic target [
