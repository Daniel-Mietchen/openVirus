<p>Current clinical evidence is insufficient to recommend treating with or withholding RAAS blockade during this pandemic. Despite elevated ACE2 levels being found in chronic disease states, the upregulation of ACE2 seems more likely an adaptive response rather than a culprit [
 <xref rid="C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. Significant preclinical data and retrospective human data suggest RAAS inhibition decreases lung injury and improves survival, while simultaneously decreasing viral load in animal models with viral infections that utilise the ACE2 receptor. Human clinical data regarding the effects of RAAS inhibitors on outcomes remain modest and an area of active investigation. While the association between hypertension and poor outcomes might be mediated through ACE2 upregulation and increasing viral susceptibility, these differential outcomes are at least as likely to be a result of dysregulated Ang II-mediated lung injury. We believe this represents a state of clinical equipoise and hypothesise that RAAS inhibition may improve outcomes in patients infected with COVID-19. Furthermore, the wide spectrum of severity during the pandemic highlights the heterogeneity in the patients with COVID-19. As different phenotypes emerge, certain subgroups (
 <italic>i.e.</italic> those with overactive RAAS) may differ in their response to therapy. Time will also need to be considered. RAAS modulation may have significantly different effects early in the disease process compared to later given the complexity of the RAAS-SCoV-axis. This underscores the exigency for high-quality evidence to investigate any significant association between RAAS modulation and pulmonary pathophysiology, with a focus on ACE2-mediated viral infections, particularly, SARS-CoV-2.
