<p>It is important to note that preclinical animal model treatment with losartan upregulates cardiac ACE2 mRNA expression and increases in ACE2 activity [

 <xref rid="C69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. However, human studies found no significant difference in ACE2 plasma levels in patients treated with ACEi or ARBs have not confirmed such an effect, though local tissue ACE2 levels were not measured [

While beyond the scope of this proposal, we will note that increased Ang II and decreased ACE2 are also associated with impaired cardiac contractility, which can be rescued with losartan [
 <xref rid="C70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. More observational data is needed to assess if other signs of RAAS overdrive (hypokalemia, hypertension) portend poor outcomes and may be associated with arrhythmias that have been noted in the diseases [
 <xref rid="C71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. Nevertheless, this could potentially underscore potential benefits of RAAS modulation that extend beyond the attenuation of lung injury.
