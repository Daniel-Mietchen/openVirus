 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated elevated ACE2 levels to be an independent risk factor of major adverse cardiac events in patients with known coronary artery disease, though this data, as noted by the authors, does not differentiate association 
 <italic>versus</italic> causation [
 <xref rid="C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. To begin to dissect this interplay, we turn to preclinical models, specifically ACE2 knockout mice that are characterised by severe cardiac defects. Critically, these defects are notably absent in double ACE and ACE2 knockout models which highlights the highly balanced interplay between ACE/Ang II/AT
 <sub>1</sub> and ACE2/Ang-(1–7) [
 <xref rid="C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Similar protective effects to prevent cardiovascular events and strokes have been demonstrated in mouse models with overexpressed ACE2 [
 <xref rid="C66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Rachmand 
 <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that patients with elevated ACE2 might “reflect a persistent albeit insufficient counter-regulatory process to shift the balance away from the deleterious effects of sustained Ang II activation.” [
 <xref rid="C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] As such, ACE2 overexpression may be a 
 <italic>compensatory mechanism</italic> to mitigate the effect of unopposed Ang II stimulation though increased degradation into protective Ang-(1–7) [
 <xref rid="C67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>].
