<p>This novel coronavirus is closely related to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused an outbreak of disease (SARS) in 2003. Genetic studies found that SARS-CoV-2 shares almost 80% and 50% sequence identity with SARS-CoV and middle eastern respiratory virus coronavirus (MERS-CoV), respectively [

 <xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Despite these differences, the shared genome translates into common clinical, microbiologic, and biochemical phenotypes. SARS-CoV-2 mimics SARS-CoV's mechanism of infection which utilises the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Following binding, ACE2 activity is downregulated through multiple mechanisms, preventing it from performing its usual function in states of health, further summarised below [

 <xref rid="C16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–
 <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The association between ACE2 and COVID-19 is rooted in two concepts: the mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the regulatory role of ACE2 during RAAS overactivation. Following the SARS outbreak, extensive research advanced our knowledge of highly morbid coronavirus infections [

 <xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The similar renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-SARS-CoV-2-axis (RAAS-SCoV-axis) interactions shared by the two coronaviruses provide an opportunity to further our understanding of this unique interplay in our pursuit of treatment options.
