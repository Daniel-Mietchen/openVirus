<p>COVID-19, the infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has left over 180 countries and territories grappling with a devastating pandemic. In December 2019, Wuhan, China, was identified as the epicenter of this outbreak. At the time of this submission, reported COVID-19 cases exceeded 700 000, with more than 30 000 deaths [
