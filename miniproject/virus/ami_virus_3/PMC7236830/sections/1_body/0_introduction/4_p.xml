<p>RAAS blockade has been proposed as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 [
 <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–
 <xref rid="C36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. This hypothesis was initially published by Sun 
 <italic>et al.</italic> [
 <xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] on February 4, 2020, and reinforced in a Drug Development Research publication on March 4, 2020 [
 <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other reviews have voiced concern regarding the association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease [
 <xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], going too far as to postulate that continued RAAS blockade may cause harm and recommend considering discontinuation [
 <xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. The previous argument is based on the observation that pharmacologic blockers of RAAS can upregulate ACE2 expression, which might increase viral entry into the cell [
 <xref rid="C39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Evidence from human subjects to support such an assertation is scant, and as we will see in this review, preclinical and current observational Covid-19 evidence would support the contrary hypothesis – that discontinuation of RAAS blockade may prove harmful. These contrasting hypotheses underscore the dire need to evaluate potential mechanisms, if any, through which RAAS modulation would impact the pathophysiology of COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="C35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. In this review, we intend to compile the existing evidence in order to discuss how we might bridge knowledge gaps regarding the interplay between SARS-CoV-2, ACE2, and the RAAS.
