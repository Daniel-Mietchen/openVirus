<p>Angiotensin II (Ang II), the primary physiological product of the RAAS system, is a potent vasoconstrictor. As illustrated in 
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">figure 1</xref>, ACE catalyses the transformation of angiotensin I (Ang I) to Ang II. Ang II elicits its effects by activating two receptors: type 1 angiotensin II (AT
 <sub>1</sub>) receptor and type 2 angiotensin II (AT
 <sub>2</sub>) receptor [
 <xref rid="C43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Ang II action through AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor causes a cascade with resultant inflammation, vasoconstriction, and atherogenesis [
 <xref rid="C44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. These effects also promote insulin resistance and thrombosis [
 <xref rid="C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. In contrast, AT
 <sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation causes vasodilation, decreased platelet aggregation, and the promotion of insulin action. However, the expression of AT
 <sub>2</sub> receptor is low in healthy adults [
 <xref rid="C45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. As such, Ang II's effects in adults are modulated and balanced indirectly by angiotensin II converting enzyme (ACE2), which converts Ang II into lung-protective Angiotensin-(1–7) (Ang- [1–7]), similar to effects seen from AT
 <sub>2</sub> receptor stimulation [
 <xref rid="C41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Conceptually grouping pathways into an Ang II/AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor and its opposing pathway ACE2/Ang-(1–7) helps with understanding the countering forces and the sequelae when an imbalance occurs (
