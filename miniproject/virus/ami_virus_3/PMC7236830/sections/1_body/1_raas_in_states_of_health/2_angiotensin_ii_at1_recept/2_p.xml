<p>The consequences of excessive Ang II include pulmonary vasoconstriction, inflammatory, and cytokine-induced organ damage [
 <xref rid="C47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>] secondary to increased membrane permeability [
 <xref rid="C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and increased epithelial cell apoptosis [
 <xref rid="C49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The effects are predominantly mediated through the unopposed AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor activation secondary to decreased ACE2 levels [
 <xref rid="C50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Furthermore, the pro-inflammatory cascade [
 <xref rid="C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and increased vascular permeability [
 <xref rid="C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] caused by over-activation of the AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor in the lungs directly induce acute lung injury (ALI), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and lead to death [
 <xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].
