<p>ACE2 is expressed in many tissue types, including respiratory epithelial cells [
 <xref rid="C52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. ACE2 is predominantly expressed on the apical surface and converts Ang II into lung-protective Ang-(1–7) and Ang-(1–9) by catalysing a pathway that prevents unopposed AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor activation. Therefore, ACE2 functions as a counterbalance to its structurally similar counterpart ACE [
 <xref rid="C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] through the conversion of Ang II into Ang-(1–7), which in contrast to ACE, promotes vasodilation, reduces proliferation, and prevents apoptosis [
 <xref rid="C53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. ACE2 levels are known to be low in healthy individuals [
 <xref rid="C54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>] and ACE2 levels decrease with age [
 <xref rid="C55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Chronically elevated levels of ACE2 are an independent predictor of disease progression; but evidence suggests these changes are compensatory rather than causal [
