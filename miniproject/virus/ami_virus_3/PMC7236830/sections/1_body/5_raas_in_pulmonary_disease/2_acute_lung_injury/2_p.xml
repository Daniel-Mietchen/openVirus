<p>In human patients, genetic cohort studies yield further insights into the relationship between RAAS and acute lung injury. Jerng 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found that polymorphisms in the ACE gene are associated with outcomes in ARDS. These findings were corroborated by Adamzik 
 <italic>et al</italic>., who identified patients with the ACE DD genotype (associated with increased ACE activity) to have the highest risk of ARDS-related death (HR 5.7) [
 <xref rid="C79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref>]. Other human studies evaluating the association between RAAS-inhibition and ARDS remain observational. Kim 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found ARDS patients that were taking ACEi or ARBs had better survival rates when compared to those without RAAS inhibition [
 <xref rid="C80" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. A secondary analysis of a 2010 randomised control trial in patients with acute respiratory failure suggested that treatment with ACEi/ARB at discharge following an episode of acute respiratory failure was associated with a 44% reduction in 1-year mortality [
 <xref rid="C81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref>]. More recently, Hsieh 
 <italic>et al</italic>. observed lower adjusted odds of hospital mortality in patients with sepsis (with and without shock) who were on ARB or ACEi therapy [
 <xref rid="C82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>]. Mortenson 
 <italic>et al</italic>. also found a 58% decrease in the odds of hospital mortality in patients taking ARBs before admission [
 <xref rid="C83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. Based on the above, there have been calls to further elucidate the potential benefits of ACEi and ARB in ARDS [
 <xref rid="C84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>]. However, randomised control trials around this topic were not identified in the peer-reviewed literature or clinicaltrials.gov at the time of this manuscript's preparation.
