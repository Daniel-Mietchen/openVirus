 <xref rid="C48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>–
 <xref rid="C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Importantly, the mere presence of high concentrations of Ang II can further regulate the expression of ACE2, leading to dysregulated Ang II/AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor activity [
 <xref rid="C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. In mice, losartan reduced mortality by blunting Ang II-associated increases in soluble epoxide hydrolase, a promoter of lung injury [
 <xref rid="C75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Animal models of ventilator-associated lung injury have demonstrated benefit from losartan, mitigating Ang II activity and AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor expression [
 <xref rid="C76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>–
 <xref rid="C78" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. While most studies include pre-treated animal models, rescue models also demonstrate efficacy, with the restoration of ACE2 levels, blunting of PaO2 decline, and attenuation of lung injury [
