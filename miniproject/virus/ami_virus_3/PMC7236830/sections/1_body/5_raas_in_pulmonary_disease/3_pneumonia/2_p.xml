<p>Critically, both H7N9 and H5N1 influenza have been shown to cause lung injury through ACE2 downregulation, upregulation of Ang II, and AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor-induced lung injury [
 <xref rid="C88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>]. Mouse models of H5N1 and H7N9 demonstrated decreased IL-6, lung edema, lung injury, and mortality if treated with losartan [
 <xref rid="C89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>]. The mechanism by which losartan prevents lung injury may not reside solely within the RAAS pathway, however [
 <xref rid="C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Liu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. suggest that losartan inhibits the activation of pulmonary dendritic cells [
 <xref rid="C91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>]. In a study of rats with 
 <italic>pseudomonas</italic> pneumonia, AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor blockers suppressed the activation of neutrophils through a mechanism that does not involve the AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor down-regulation [
 <xref rid="C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>, 
 <xref rid="C92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>]. Such studies have raised concern that losartan treatment might decrease microbial clearance. In sharp contrast, study results actually demonstrate reduced viral loads [
 <xref rid="C90" ref-type="bibr">90</xref>] and increased bacterial clearance [
 <xref rid="C51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] in lung injury models treated with losartan. Given the complexity of these interactions, future investigations remain necessary to further elucidate these relationships.
