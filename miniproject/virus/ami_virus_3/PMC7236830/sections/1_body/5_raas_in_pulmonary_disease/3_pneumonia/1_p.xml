<p>While influenza and other types of pneumonia may interact with the RAAS axis, both animal and human studies illustrate clear indirect effects on the RAAS in the setting of certain influenza strains in particular. Previous studies suggest Ang II levels predict mortality in undifferentiated patients with influenza [
 <xref rid="C85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>], and continuation of RAAS inhibitor therapy during admission is associated with decreased hospital mortality and odds of intubation in viral cases of pneumonia [
 <xref rid="C86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. RAAS may have implications for other viral pneumonias, as well, as Gu 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found that children with respiratory syncytial virus tend to have higher Ang II levels compared to healthy children [
 <xref rid="C87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>]. Based on this observation, they demonstrated the benefit of recombinant ACE2 therapy on RSV infection in a preclinical mouse model.
