<p>SARS-CoV infection downregulates the surface expression of the binding protein, ACE2, a pivotal component for host cell entry [
 <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Notably, low ACE2 expression is associated with increased phenotype severity in 
 <italic>in-vitro</italic> human airway epithelial cell studies [
 <xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Imai 
 <italic>et al</italic>. validated these findings in a whole animal model by demonstrating that loss of ACE2 in knockout (KO) mice leads to impairments in oxygenation, increased inflammation, and worsening of edema compared to WT mice after acid-induced lung injury [
 <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Pre-treatment with AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor inhibitors before acid induced ARDS showed significantly lower lung injury, confirming the AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor's role in the physiologic response [
 <xref rid="C23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Subsequently and most critically, Kuba 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated SARS-CoV spike protein augments Ang II increase and ACE2 downregulation, with resultant lung injury [
 <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this model, losartan can attenuate the severity of acute lung injury due to SARS-CoV infection in both a pre-treatment model and a more clinically relevant post-infection (rescue) model [
