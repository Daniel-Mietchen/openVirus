<p>In 2003, ACE2 was identified as the binding protein for SARS-CoV. In the years to follow, studies demonstrating the downstream consequences of downregulation of ACE2 with resultant increases in Ang II concentration illustrate the vicious cycle caused by the disruption of the RAAS, we refer to in this manuscript as RAAS-SARS-CoV-2 (RAAS-SCoV-axis) [
 <xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Of relevance to the current pandemic, Wrapp 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found SARS-CoV-2 to have a 10- to 20-fold higher affinity for ACE2 than SARS-CoV. The authors postulate this may cause increased infectivity, which may help explain the differences in the evolution of the two epidemics.
