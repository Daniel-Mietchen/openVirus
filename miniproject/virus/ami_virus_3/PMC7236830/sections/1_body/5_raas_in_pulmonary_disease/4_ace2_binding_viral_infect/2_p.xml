<p>Both SARS-coronaviruses contain four structural proteins, the nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and spike protein [

 <italic>et al</italic>. identified specific deletions that increase the potential of the SARS-CoV-2 spike to evade immune responses over time. These changes have implications for both initial and subsequent infection severity, immunity, and the likelihood of developing an efficacious vaccine. More relevant to the current review, however, is the potential effect of such changes might have on the RAAS-SCoV-axis, which could serve to explain not only their predilection for causing respiratory failure but possibly other commonalities between these infections.
