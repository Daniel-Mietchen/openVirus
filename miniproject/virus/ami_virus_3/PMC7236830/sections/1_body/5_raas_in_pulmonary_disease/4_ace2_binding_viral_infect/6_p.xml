<p>The ACE2-SARS/COVID-19 interplay has led to controversy with clinical implications. The finding that ACE2 KO mice are protected against SARS-CoV infection [
 <xref rid="C17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] raises a concern that an upregulated ACE2 is harmful in the setting of SARS-CoV and COVID infections, as the virus cannot enter the cell. Conversely, ACE2 downregulation following infection is concerning considering the preclinical data summarised to this point, which instead suggests a putative causative mechanism of Ang II/Ang (1â€“7) in the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 associated acute lung injury. Even if abolishing ACE2 were feasible, Han
