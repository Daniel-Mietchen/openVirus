<p>The mechanism by which SARS-CoV downregulates ACE2 may be relevant to the development of novel therapeutics, as well. Haga 
 <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated that SARS-CoV binding to ACE2 induces ACE2 shedding as a soluble form into the serum [
 <xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], and further studies validated those findings [
 <xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, endocytosis of the ACE2 protein occurs after binding to SARS-CoV, further decreasing ACE2 activity [
 <xref rid="C94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>], with potential implications for Ang II/Ang1â€“7 balance described throughout this review. A final critical mechanism that cannot be overlooked includes the role of AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor in the downregulation of ACE2. Desholtz 
 <italic>et al</italic>. found that ACE2 downregulation induced persistent elevation of Ang II through local interaction with the AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor, which triggers a vicious cycle where Ang II downregulates ACE2 leading to further increases in local tissue levels of Ang II [
 <xref rid="C74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. These mechanisms promote an unopposed Ang II/AT
 <sub>1</sub> receptor axis (
