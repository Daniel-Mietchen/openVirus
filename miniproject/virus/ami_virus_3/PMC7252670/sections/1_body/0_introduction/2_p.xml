<p>Dengue virus (DENV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family. Four serotypes (DENV-1 to -4) can be antigenically distinguished. Infection by one serotype does not confer prolonged immunity against the others [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Like many RNA viruses, dengue viruses exhibit an extensive genetic diversity which makes it possible to identify distinct genotypes within each serotype [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. DENV are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected 
 <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, such as 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> which is the most common vector, or, to a lesser extent, 
 <italic>Aedes albopictus</italic> [
