<p>New Caledonia (NC) is an island territory located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, 1,210 km east of Australia. Its climate is subtropical with two-marked seasons: hot and rainy (December to May) and cold and dry, with temperature ranging from 18°C to 35°C. As many other Pacific Island Countries and Territories (PICTs), NC has regularly experienced DENV epidemics since World War II [

Before 2000, epidemics occurred approximately every five years and outbreaks were due to a single DENV serotype/genotype, which was replaced by another one during the next epidemic. This DENV epidemiological profile, however, has changed over the last fifteen years. Indeed, we observed an unusual persistence of DENV-1, with the co-circulation of other DENV serotypes and/or other arboviruses such as Zika virus or chikungunya virus [
