<p>Regarding dissemination status, the medians of viral titers per head ranged from 3.7x10
 <sup>2</sup> to 1.70x10
 <sup>4</sup> FFU/mL/head (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0008303.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The quantity of infectious viral particles in the heads was significantly higher for DENV-2 compared to DENV-1 genotype I “Asia”, DENV-1 genotype IV “Pacific” and DENV-3 (two-sample Wilcoxon test: 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.04, &lt; 0.001 and = 0.02 respectively). DENV-1 genotype IV “Pacific” infected mosquitoes had a significantly lower viral titer in their heads compared to DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” and DENV-4 (two-sample Wilcoxon test: 
 <italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 0.001 and = 0.002 respectively). The quantity of DENV-4 infectious viral particles per heads was significantly higher than that obtained for DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” (two-sample Wilcoxon test: 
 <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.03).
