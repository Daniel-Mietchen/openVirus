The efficiency of transmission for all the DENV strains at 7 dpi did not exceed 4%, with no viral transmission observed for DENV-2 and DENV-3 infected mosquitoes. At 14 dpi, transmission efficiencies were observed for all four DENV serotypes, ranging from 7% to 21%, with the higher transmission efficiency observed for DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” infected mosquitoes. However, no significant difference was found (Fisher’s exact test:

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008303.s002">S2 Table</xref>) showed that the transmission efficiency was statistically higher at 14 dpi (OR = 6.34, 95%CI: 2.40–16.7). Transmission efficiency was also significantly higher for DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” compared to DENV-3 as reference, considering results of the univariate analysis (OR = 4.33, 95%CI: 1.15–16.2).
