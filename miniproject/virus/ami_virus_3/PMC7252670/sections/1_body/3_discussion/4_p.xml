<p>Vector competence experiments in the laboratory measure the ability of mosquitoes to transmit arboviruses. However, the experimental conditions applied in this type of experiment are only an approximation of what happens in nature. In our experimental conditions, a slightly difference was observed in terms of transmission efficiency between DENV-1 genotype I “Asia” and DENV-3. Several factors, however, need to be considered. Indeed, only a single DENV strain per serotype/genotype was tested, which constitutes a bias of our experimental design considering the diversity of DENV serotype/genotype strains which circulate during an outbreak. Furthermore, the extrinsic incubation temperature may have an impact on the infection of the mosquito [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Moreover, the infectious viral dose initially present in the blood meal may also affect the infection rate of

 <italic>aegypti</italic> which can increase the competence of this species for DENV [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Furthermore, DENV co-infection experiments in 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> can highlight significant competitive virus advantage, while no difference in vector competence is observed when mono-infection experiments are performed [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Some studies have indicated that DENV genotype replacements were associated with differences in viral fitness, such as a higher viremia in humans [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>] or a higher vectorial capacity [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>–
 <xref rid="pntd.0008303.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In our study, no major difference was observed in the capacity of our local vector to transmit the four DENV serotypes. This indicates that factors related to humans would most probably best explain the persistence of DENV-1. All of these parameters should be taken into account in the future in order to better understand the relationship between the virus and the vector in a particular epidemiological context.
