<p>The same population of mosquitoes was experimentally infected twice to evaluate the reproducibility of the results. Five- to seven day-old nulliparous 
 <italic>Ae</italic>. 
 <italic>aegypti</italic> F1 females were challenged with infectious blood-meals containing each of the different DENV serotype/genotype. Briefly, mosquitoes were allowed to feed for 20 min through a pig intestine membrane covering the base of a Hemotek system feeder containing the blood-virus mixture maintained at 37°C. The infectious blood meal consisted of a mix (2:1) of washed rabbit erythrocytes and viral suspension at 3x10
 <sup>7</sup> FFU/mL (final concentration at 10
 <sup>7</sup> FFU/mL). An adenosine triphosphate phagostimulant (Sigma-Aldrich), was added at a final concentration of 5mM. Fully engorged females were transferred into cardboard containers and maintained with 10% sucrose solution at 28 ± 1°C, 80% relative humidity and 12:12h light:dark cycle.
