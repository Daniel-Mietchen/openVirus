<p>For all pairs of 
 <italic>θ</italic> and 
 <italic>η</italic> in 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, the estimated IARs are similar with IAR varying approximately from 22% to 28% and the 95% CIs largely overlap. Thus, for 
 <italic>θ</italic> = 0.5, we can be at least 95% sure the IAR of the ZIKV epidemic is below 33%, and is likely to be well below.
