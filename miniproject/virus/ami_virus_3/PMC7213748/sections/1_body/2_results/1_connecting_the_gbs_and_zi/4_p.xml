<p>Let us first assume that the GBS/ZIKV (reported) ratio did not change in time in any major way over the two years 2015 and 2016. Our analysis of data from the time series in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g002">Fig 2</xref> shows that as GBS cases dropped from 233 cases in 2015, to 168 cases in 2016, i.e. by a factor of 0.72 (168/233), the number of reported ZIKV cases rose by a factor of 70, 916รท38, 641 = 1.8. The only explanation for this is that there must have been a major under-reporting of ZIKV cases in the first year of 2015 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, 
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref069" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. This also seems reasonable since in 2015 the official WHO ZIKV reporting program had not yet been launched [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Suppose now the GBS/ZIKV(reported) ratio was 0.24% in both 2015 and 2016 even though we know that this could not be the case. A simple calculations shows that there should have been some 98,353 (= 233 ร 70916รท168) ZIKV reported cases in 2015 rather than only the 38,641 cases that were reported in reality. Thus for the 2015 year, it would appear that ZIKV was under-reported by a factor of 2.5 when compared to the ZIKV reporting rate in 2016.
