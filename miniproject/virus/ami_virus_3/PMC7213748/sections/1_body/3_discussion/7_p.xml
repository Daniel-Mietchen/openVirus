<p>The model analysis estimated the IAR of ZIKV cases in NE Brazil to lie between 22% to 28% for the two waves. This is based on the assumption that the proportion of symptomatics 
 <italic>Î¸</italic> = 0.5, which appears to be reliable according to the serological results of Aubry 
 <italic>et al</italic>. [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. It is also in line with a number of models and empirical estimates for other areas of Brazil and South America. For example, Zhang 
 <italic>et al</italic>. (2017) estimated some 18% IAR for the areas in Brazil [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In pointing this out, we must also note that most IAR estimates in the literature need to be treated with caution. Due to poor surveillance, limited knowledge about the ZIKV reporting ratio and population seropositivity, the estimates may have been based on samples that were not representative of the general population as a whole. Previous estimates of IAR relied on poor ZIKV data in Brazilian regions: some estimates appear to be less than 20%, and others yield more than 50% (see 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007502.s001">S1 Text</xref>). However, as mentioned, all these estimates must be treated with caution. This study is the first to use the more reliable GBS data as a proxy to estimate the IAR of ZIKV epidemics. We found that the IAR is likely to be below 33% in the whole NE Brazil.
