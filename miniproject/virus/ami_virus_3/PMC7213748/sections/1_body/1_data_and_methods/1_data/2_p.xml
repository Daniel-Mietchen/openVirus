<p>The reported weekly excess (or surplus) GBS cases time series of NE Brazil, from Jan 2015 to Nov 2016, were kindly provided by Professor Oliveira from the Ministry of Health in Brazil, as used in their important recent study [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The time series are plotted in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g002">Fig 2</xref> with datasets of ZIKV and CHIKV for the period. The GBS data used in this work follow the case definitions given in 
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0007502.s001">S1 Text</xref>. In 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g002">Fig 2</xref> we observe that the GBS-to-ZIKV ratio of 2016 was significantly lower than in 2015, which was likely due to the under-reporting of ZIKV epidemic before 2016 [
