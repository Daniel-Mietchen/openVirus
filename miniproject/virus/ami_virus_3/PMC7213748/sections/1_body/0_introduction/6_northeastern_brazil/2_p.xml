<p>A substantial CHIKV wave was also observed during the second ZIKV wave in 2016 as indicated in

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. CHIKV can induce GBS with a smaller risk ratio (1 to 2.35) than ZIKV as discussed above and according to results in [

 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Note that in the latter studies, no cases of GBS induced by dengue epidemics were reported. One recent cohort study was conducted on 345 pregnant women with ZIKV rash observed (presenting at the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation) in Rio de Janeiro (the largest city in Eastern Brazil) between September 2015 and May 2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The IAR of CHIKV was found to be approximately 17%; and in contrast, the IAR of ZIKV was 53%, as based on PCR tests. In addition, a strong cross-protection between ZIKV and CHIKV was also observed, but no cross-protection was observed between ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV). The IAR of CHIKV was 21.1%, and 41.7% for ZIKV-negative women while only 2.8% of ZIKV-positive women were infected with CHIKV. Thus, among pregnant women with rash observed in this period, the ratio of ZIKV and CHIKV is (roughly) 5 to 2. Evident cross-protection between CHIKV and ZIKV (but not between DENV and ZIKV) can be deduced from the same study with the same women [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Therefore, we suspect that the two waves of excess GBS cases in NE Brazil were largely due to ZIKV disease rather than CHIKV, for two reasons: (i) ZIKV is 2.35-fold likely to induce GBS than CHIKV; and (ii) ZIKV IAR could be three times higher than that of CHIKV based on the Rio de Janeiro study [
