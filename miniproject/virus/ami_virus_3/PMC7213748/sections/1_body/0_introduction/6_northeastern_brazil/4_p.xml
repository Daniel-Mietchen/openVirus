<p>The under-reporting of ZIKV cases in 2015 also appears to be reflected in what was felt to be a high number of microcephaly cases (after a 26-week delay [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]). This is because microcephaly cases are easier to identify and are thus better reported [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Nevertheless, the reporting criteria of microcephaly cases also changed significantly over the two years [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] leading to overall unreliable estimates. Given this known and documented unreliability [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we felt it might not be wise to estimate IAR of ZIKV directly based on the reported number of microcephaly cases. Also, we would need to consider the effect of time-varying birth rates if using microcephaly cases to infer ZIKV cases.
