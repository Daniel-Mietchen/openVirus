<p>While considered relatively benign for decades since 1947, ZIKV disease suddenly became a major global disease threat. A Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) was announced by the WHO on February 01, 2016 [
 <xref rid="pntd.0007502.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], in the lead-up to the Rio Olympic Games in Brazil. But until then, because of the relatively low interest in the ZIKV, surveillance in most areas was of low quality with poor coverage and consequently a large under-reporting of cases. There was little knowledge of key parameters: for example the true attack rate, the proportion of asymptomatic cases amongst infected ZIKV cases, the reproductive number. This has led to stepped up activity in surveillance and modelling efforts in recent years. But given the poor case-data available and the lack of knowledge of a reporting rate (which changed significantly in time and location) for those infected with ZIKV, results from modelling efforts have often proved to be inconsistent. Here, we take a new approach that attempts to overcome some of the problems associated with the large uncertainties associated with the reporting of ZIKV cases. Instead, we work with time series of GBS cases which should be far more reliable. We argue that a high proportion of people infected with GBS will in fact report to the doctor. 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pntd.0007502.g001">Fig 1</xref> makes clear the strong association between ZIKV cases and GBS by plotting reported cases of both diseases on the same axes. It is clear that the dynamics of the two diseases are closely in step. The unique feature of our work is that we draw on this property and fit our model to GBS data collected during and following the period of a ZIKV outbreak. We use this to infer the true numbers, and dynamics in time, of ZIKV cases.
