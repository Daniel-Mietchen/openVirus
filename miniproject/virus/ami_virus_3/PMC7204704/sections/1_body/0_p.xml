Since January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has generated much fear and countermeasures to stem the spread of this respiratory virus. This has largely been fueled by the tremendously extensive reporting of Covid-19-associated deaths. As of 31 March 2020, 770,520 people have been found infected worldwide, of whom 36,942 (4.8%) died. Five countries (Italy, Spain, China, USA and France) have been affected by 77% of these deaths (

This surveillance allows weekly analysis of the numbers of each type of clinical sample received and any pathogen diagnosed at the laboratory, including respiratory samples and viruses, and performing retrospective analyses that include the most recently available data. It also includes the count of the deaths associated with any diagnosed infection. This study compared the mortality associated with diagnoses of respiratory viruses during the colder months overlapping 2018–2019 and 2019–2020.
