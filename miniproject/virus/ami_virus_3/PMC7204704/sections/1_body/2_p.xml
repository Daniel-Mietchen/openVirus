<p id="par0040">Thus, a total of 105 patients died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus during the colder months of 2019–2020 until week 14 of 2020 compared with 73 the year before during the same timeframe (+44%). However, the proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients did not significantly differ in 2019–2020 and 2018–2019 (214 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.08, Yates-corrected Chi-square test). In contrast, it was significantly lower in 2019–2020 than in 2018–2019 for common respiratory viruses (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), which were associated with 33% fewer deaths in 2019–2020. This drop was essentially due to a significant decrease in influenza A virus-associated deaths (–84%; 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt;0.001) and a decrease in RSV-associated deaths (-46%; 
 <italic>p</italic> = 0.18)among patients diagnosed with these viruses. The drop in influenza-associated deaths could be partly explained by the predominance of A/H3N2 strains in 2018–2019 compared with the predominance of A/H1N1 and B strains in 2019–2020, as A/H3N2 strains were reported to be associated with a greater mortality in elderly people (

 <italic>p</italic> = 0.11) was also observed in 2019–2020 compared with 2018–2019.
