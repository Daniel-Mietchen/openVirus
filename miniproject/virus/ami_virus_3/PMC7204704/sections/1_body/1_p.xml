<p id="par0035">Testing of respiratory samples was performed using FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 (Fast Track Diagnosis, Luxembourg) or Biofire FilmArray Respiratory panel 2 plus (Biomérieux, France) assays. Between week 47 of 2018 and week 14 of 2019, 73 patients died after being diagnosed with respiratory viruses (

Deaths occurred in 40 of the patients diagnosed with influenza A virus (1.7%), which was the respiratory virus associated with the highest number of deaths. In addition, deaths occurred in 19 of the patients diagnosed with rhinoviruses (1.5%), and in 13 of those diagnosed with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (1.1%). Respiratory samples had not been tested for coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses in routine clinical practice, but all those retrospectively tested from patients who died in Marseille public hospitals were negative. In comparison, during the same period of winter 2019–2020 (between week 47 of 2019 and week 14 of 2020), 50 patients died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus. They represented 0.10% of the 49,043 patients hospitalized during this period and 4.5% of the 1,115 who died. They included seven of the patients diagnosed with influenza A virus (0.5%), three of those diagnosed with influenza B virus (0.2%), seven of those diagnosed with RSV (0.7%), and six, two and one of those diagnosed with human coronavirus-HKU1 (2.4%), NL63 (1.2%) and OC43 (0.8%), respectively (
