<p id="par0045">Overall, these findings put into perspective the death burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections in this geographical area. Thus, the number of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths was similar to that of deaths associated with other viral respiratory infections between December 2019 and March 2020, and lower than that of deaths associated with viral respiratory infections between December 2018 and March 2019. In addition, no significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections was observed on the overall number of deaths (of any cause) among hospitalized people in Marseille public hospitals (1,115 deaths in 2019–2020 during the study period versus 1,137 in 2018–2019;

Further analyses might determine if this is related to containment or other changes related to the SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. The number of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths will grow after the timeframe of the present study as a consequence of recent or new infections, but the peak of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections was reached at the end of March 2020 in Marseille public hospitals (
