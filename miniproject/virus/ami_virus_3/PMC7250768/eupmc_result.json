    "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a devastating global pandemic and continues to overwhelm the health-care facilities and shatter the economies of countries worldwide. Although it primarily affects the lungs, it shares a strong interplay with the cardiovascular system. The presence of underlying cardiovascular diseaseÂ and its risk factors (diabetes, hypertension) predispose the patients to increased severity and mortality associated with COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 itself leads to various cardiovascular complications, which increase its associated morbidity and mortality in affected patients. It is, therefore, prudent to review the rapidly evolving data in this field and understand the mechanisms behind the cardiovascular involvement of this lethal disease."
