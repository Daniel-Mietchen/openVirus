  <title>Sequential events during influenza virus infection.</title>
  <p>Viral entry and infection of the respiratory epithelium is blocked by specific mucosal antibody, mucus and antimicrobial proteins. Once access is gained to mucosal cells, inflammatory mediators produced. This initial phase is influenced by genetic factors, environmental stimuli, the resident respiratory microbiome, and infection history. Innate responses by resident airway cells, macrophages, and NK cells impede viral replication and spread to other parts of the respiratory tract. T-cell responses are important for viral clearance and disease resolution but may be associated with inappropriately polarized responses and immunopathology.</p>
