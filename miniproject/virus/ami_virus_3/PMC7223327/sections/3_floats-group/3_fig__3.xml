  <p>
   <bold>a</bold> Structure of influenza virus. HA: viral hemagglutinin, NA: viral neuraminidase; 
   <bold>b</bold> Inactivated vaccines. Virus produced by culturing in chicken eggs or by cell culture in animal cells. HA/NA from selected influenza A strains reassorted with high growth egg-adapted virus. These vaccines are widely used in those &gt;6 months of age, in pregnant women and those with chronic health problems that increase the risk of severe influenza. Higher dose of antigens and/or addition of adjuvant may be used to improve immunogenicity, particularly in those &gt;65 y. Parenteral route of administration inducing relatively poor levels of mucosal immunity. Propagation of vaccine strains in eggs may introduce genetic changes that decrease vaccine effectiveness in man. 
   <bold>c</bold> Live attenuated influenza vaccines (LAIV). These are cold adapted, therefore replicating poorly at 37 °C. Internal virus genes carry multiple attenuating temperature sensitive and cold adapting mutations virus with regularly updated HA/NA genes inserted by re-assortment or recombinant techniques. Approved for healthy people aged 2–49. Not suitable for those with immunodeficiency, in very young children or asthmatics due to possible risk of inducing wheeze. More closely mimics natural infection and may induce broader protection. Marketed as Flumist or Fluenz Tetra; 
   <bold>d</bold> Recombinant vaccine production. HA gene from a wild-type flu virus in vector virus that grows in insect cells. HA protein is extracted and purified from cell culture. Manufacturing does not require propagation of influenza virus in chicken eggs, allowing potentially faster start-up for production. May be used for a novel pandemic vaccine manufacture, but may have shorter shelf-live. Used in the USA for those aged over 18 y (Flublok Quadrivalent).
