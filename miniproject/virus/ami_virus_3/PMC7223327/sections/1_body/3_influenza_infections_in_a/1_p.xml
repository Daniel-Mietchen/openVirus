<p id="Par14">We recently completed a reanalysis of the MOSAIC cases to determine the differential pathogenesis of influenza H1N1pdm09 in adults with or without asthma, the most prevalent pre-existing medical condition (present in 30% of cases). In this subgroup, there was an excess of females (70% of asthmatics vs. 39% of non-asthmatics). The disease was less severe, with shorter length of stay (8.3 vs. 15.3 days) and lower mortality (3% vs. 11%). In the first 24â€‰h, patients with asthma had reduced systemic markers of inflammation with lower serum IL-6, TNF, CXCL-8, 9, IL-10, IL-17 and CCL-2. There was no difference in terms of virus titres. Notably, those with asthma did not demonstrate a heightened type 2 immune signature and (although peripheral blood eosinophils and atopic status were not recorded) there was no difference in serum total IgE, periostin, blood eosinophil gene expression, or nasal IL-13, IL-4 or IL-5.

 </sup> Thus, those with asthma were more likely to present because of their airway symptoms as opposed to the seriousness of the systemic influenza infection. For those without asthma, a greater systemic immune response is associated with worse outcomes.
