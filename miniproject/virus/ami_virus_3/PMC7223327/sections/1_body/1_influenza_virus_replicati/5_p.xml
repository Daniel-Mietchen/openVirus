 </sup> However, while humoral immunity may provide long-lasting, antibody-mediated protection against future infections or severe disease caused by the same influenza strain, antibody directed against HA viral surface glycoprotein will often fail to neutralise influenza A viruses that have drifted, or influenza viruses of other types and subtypes.

 </sup> By contrast, antibodies against NA are not neutralising and limit infection and severity of illness by inhibiting NA and the release of new virions.
