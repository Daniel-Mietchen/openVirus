<p id="Par6">We will not discuss the virology of influenza replication (which is well described elsewhere, for example

  <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>
 </sup>) but in outline, after seeding in the respiratory mucosa, most influenza virus replication occurs in airway and alveolar epithelial cells. On entering the respiratory tract, the haemagglutinin (HA) proteins expressed on the surface of the influenza A or influenza B virus attach to sialic acid cell-surface receptors on the respiratory epithelium, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion. This is followed by fusion of the virus membrane and the endosomal membrane, facilitated by HA and an acidic environment in the endosome. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP; containing the viral genome, across 8 viral RNA gene segments and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) is released and transported into the nucleus of the infected cell, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediates transcription and replication of viral RNA. The influenza virion consists of the RNP, is lined by the matrix protein 1 (M1) and is coated with the surface proteins HA, neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein 2 (M2) that have been manufactured by the infected cell and then expressed on the cell surface.

 </sup> Once this packaging and budding process is complete, new virions are cleaved from the sialic acid residues on the cell surface by NA on progeny virions; the infected cell dies and the released virions can proceed to infect other cells.
