<p id="Par7">The sequence of events in the host is summarised in Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As soon as influenza virus encounters host cells, an innate immune response is triggered. This is facilitated by pattern recognition receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein and toll-like receptors.

 </sup> The production and release of soluble immune mediators that ensues is typically comprised of antiviral responses that involve pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons, and the transcription of many interferon-stimulated genes, the products of which target and interrupt multiple, different steps in the influenza virus replication cycle.

 </sup> At this stage infection may be prevented by such innate immune responses, or become established, leading to viral replication. Infection may also be prevented by pre-existing antibodies, particularly those at the respiratory site of viral entry such as IgA.
