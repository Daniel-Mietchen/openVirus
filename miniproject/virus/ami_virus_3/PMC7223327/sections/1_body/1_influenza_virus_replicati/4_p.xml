 </sup> In addition, CD4+ T cells differentiate into Th1, Th2, Th17, follicular helper T cells and regulatory T cells; together, these differentiated cells have specific roles in antiviral soluble immune mediator response, activation of innate effector cells, promotion of B cell responses and regulation of cellular immune responses during influenza virus infection.
