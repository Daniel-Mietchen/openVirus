 </sup> The exact chain of events that leads to severe disease has not been defined, but in one study negative influenza serology 4 days after the onset of influenza symptoms predicted death from fulminant influenza. The authors speculate that this might reflect trapping of anti-H1N1 antibodies in immune complexes in the lungs, associated with poor specific helper T-cell responses and high levels of IL-6 and IL-10 levels in both plasma and lung fluid.
