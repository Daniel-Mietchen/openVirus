<p id="Par18">Despite advances in science and medicine, the prodigious potential of influenza to mutate and spread remains a threat to human and animal health. The wide range of hosts provides influenza A viruses with greater chances of genetic re-assortment, leading to the emergence of zoonotic strains with the potential to spread to human populations. This has occurred on several occasions, but usually with limited ability to transmit person to person. Of greatest current concern is the continued excursions of avian H7N9 virus

 </sup> into those in contact with poultry. So far, this particularly dangerous virus has not shown sustained human transmission, but might mutate and acquire this ability in the future.
