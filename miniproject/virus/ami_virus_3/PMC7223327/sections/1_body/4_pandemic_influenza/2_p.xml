<p id="Par16">In addition to meeting the epidemiological criteria for a pandemic, novel pandemic influenza A viruses differ from season influenza A viruses in terms of the composition of their major surface antigens. Pandemic influenza A viruses arise as a result of antigenic shift; that is, the expression of novel HA and/or NA proteins.

 </sup> Such a dramatic change results in viruses that are distinct from existing, circulating seasonal influenza A viruses, against which pre-existing antibodies might offer little protection. As antigenic shift is difficult to predict, so too is the ability to prepare pandemic vaccines in advance of an emerging pandemic virus. By contrast, established seasonal influenza A viruses undergo a process of regular antigenic drift, whereby the major antigens do not change abruptly and there is no change in the influenza A subtype, but cumulative viral genetic changes result in antigenic differences that are sufficient to facilitate escape from existing immune responses (particularly antibody based immunity) acquired from previous infections or immunisation.

 </sup> This antigenic drift is the reason that the composition of seasonal influenza vaccines needs to be reviewed, and typically updated, on an annual basis.
