<p id="Par2">In 1918, the Austrian artist Egon Schiele (Fig.Â 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was finally achieving fame. He was beginning to take on the mantle of his better-known friend and mentor Gustav Klimt, who had died in February of that year. After years of struggling for recognition Schiele was at last able to afford a larger studio and an apartment in which to accommodate his wife and budding family. He was 28 years old.
