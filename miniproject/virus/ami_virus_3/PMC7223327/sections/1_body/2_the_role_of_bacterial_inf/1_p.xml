<p id="Par11">In 1918, influenza was assumed to be a bacterial disease. Indeed, 
 <italic>Haemophillus Influenzae</italic> was described as the cause of influenza before influenza viruses were first isolated and characterized. The interaction between influenza and bacterial co-pathogens is of more than academic interest: most patients presenting with severe influenza are given antibiotics. It would be a brave clinical decision to withhold antibiotics, faced with a febrile patient with declining respiratory function and pulmonary consolidation. Less virulent seasonal influenza viruses also predispose to secondary infection, but the 1918 virus resulted in a remarkable pandemic of lethal bacterial pneumonia.
