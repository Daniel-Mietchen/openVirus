<p id="Par12">The question of the role of secondary bacterial pneumonia in the 1918-19 pandemic has been repeatedly examined. For example, Morens et al.

 </sup> reviewed 1,539 publications with pathology and/or microbiology results from autopsy investigations of 8398 individuals across 15 countries and examined histological slides re-cut from lung tissue blocks obtained 90 years earlier during autopsies of 58 individuals, concluding that bacterial pneumonia was indeed present in most or all of those who died. The types of bacteria causing pneumonia were diverse, reflecting the typical bacteria present in the upper respiratory tract, and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> was one of the more commonly identified bacterial species. Morens et al

 </sup> concluded that susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia resulted from defective antibacterial defences caused by viral infection, and that prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (including stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines) should be included in pandemic plans. In addition to 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> are commonly isolated secondary bacterial infections in influenza and associated with increased risk of mortality.
