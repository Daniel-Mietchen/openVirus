 </sup> indicating that commensal microbes normally enhance anti-influenza immunity, but can initiate bacterial pneumonia if the inflammatory response to influenza is exaggerated. To address this issue, the MOSAIC consortium investigated which aspects of the host response and pathogen might together explain the severity of disease. This study linked extensive clinical and investigational data to viral isolates, bacterial profiles, whole blood mRNA signatures, local and systemic immune mediator concentrations in 131 adults hospitalised with influenza. mRNA ‘signatures’ (groups of activated genes) reflecting IFN-related antiviral pathways predominated up to day 4 of illness in cases not requiring mechanical ventilatory support; in those needing mechanical ventilation an inflammatory, neutrophil and cell stress/death (‘bacterial’) pattern was seen, even early in disease. Identifiable bacterial co-infection was not necessary for this ‘bacterial’ signature but could enhance its development, while attenuating the early ‘viral’ signature.
