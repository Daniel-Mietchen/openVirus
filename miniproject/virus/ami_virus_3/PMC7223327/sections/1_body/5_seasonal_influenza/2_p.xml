<p id="Par21">To give an example of the hidden impact of influenza, national surveillance data from Scotland were used to identify adults suffering myocardial infarction or stroke from 2004 to 2014 and these events linked to records of laboratory-confirmed respiratory infections. This study showed greatly increased rates of myocardial infarction in the week after 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> and influenza virus infection with adjusted incidence ratios (IRs) 5.98 and 9.80, respectively. Rates of stroke were also elevated, with IRs 12.3 and 7.82, respectively.

 </sup> A recently reported, self-controlled case series study examined hospitalisations for acute myocardial infarction that occurred within 12 months before and 12 months after a positive diagnostic test result for influenza virus infection. This study showed an increased rate of acute myocardial infarction in the seven days following diagnosis of influenza, which was six times greater than the rate during the control intervals.

 </sup> Proposed mechanisms for the observed increases in acute cardiovascular events include the systemic inflammatory response, increased physiological demands and pro-thrombotic states that can be expected in acute infections, including influenza.
