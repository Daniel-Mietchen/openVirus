<p id="Par22">Sophisticated modelling techniques have been used to calculate influenza-associated excess mortality rates (EMR) covering for 57% of the global population. The estimated mean annual influenza-associated respiratory EMR ranges from 0·1 to 6·4 per 100 000 individuals for people younger than 65 years, 2·9 to 44·0 per 100,000 individuals for people aged between 65 and 74 years, and 17·9 to 223·5 per 100,000 for people older than 75 years. It is estimated that between 291,000 and 646,000 seasonal influenza-associated respiratory deaths occur annually around the globe, the highest mortality rates being in sub-Saharan Africa (2·8–16·5 per 100,000 individuals), southeast Asia (3·5–9·2 per 100,000 individuals), and among people aged 75 years or older (51·3–99·4 per 100,000 individuals).

 </sup> It seems certain that influenza is associated with a burden of disease and mortality beyond those cases where influenza is identified as a primary cause.
