<p id="Par30">An additional level of complexity is the emerging understanding of ‘original antigenic sin’ in the antibody response to influenza vaccines and viruses. The principle underlying this idea is that antibody response to a first influenza infection biases recall responses to subsequent influenza infections (even of different antigenic types). The concept first gained traction in the 1950s

 </sup> but had gained recent momentum with reports demonstrating broadly convergent antibody responses to H1N1 and H3N2 infections.

 </sup> Similarly, infections in childhood with H3 subtype viruses offers some protection against severe H7 subtype infections (since both are HA group 2 viruses), indicating that cross-protection does occur but is dependent on an individual’s first exposure.

 </sup> This concept offers insights to our immunity to influenza and might also be harnessed for the design of next-generation vaccines.
