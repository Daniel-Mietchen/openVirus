<p id="Par34">Next-generation vaccines may primarily aim to induce sterilizing immunity. However, they may also aim to reduce the severity of disease, lessen complications, accelerate recovery and reduce shedding of seasonal (or pandemic) influenza viruses of diverse types, which may not require sterilizing immunity. Novel approaches to design of novel viral vector systems may be complemented by ‘tuned’ adjuvants, or designer chimeric proteins optimised for the induction of specific humoral or cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, monoclonal antibodies or cocktails of antibodies might be developed for passive prophylaxis and treatment.
