<p id="Par23">Statistical modelling techniques are used to analyze global cycles of influenza activity in order to decide the best approach to vaccination in different countries. Current strain selection and vaccine distribution approaches are designed for countries with typical Northern and Southern Hemisphere single-peak influenza seasons. However, in countries closer to the equator influenza vaccination may need to be year-round, even at times when vaccines are not in production for the more temperate zones.
