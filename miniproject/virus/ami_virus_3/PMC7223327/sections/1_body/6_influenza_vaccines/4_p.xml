<p id="Par26">The most commonly used current influenza vaccines fall into two broad groups: trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated vaccines (injected purified influenza surface protein preparations), and the live attenuated (quadrivalent) inhaled influenza vaccines (LAIV) that have been used in the USA in the past, but more recently introduced for childhood vaccination in the UK and other countries.

 </sup> Within the inactivated vaccines further differences exist, including the method used to propagate the vaccine strain (for example egg-based versus cell-based culture), the addition of immunological adjuvants, the amounts of antigens and adjuvants, and the routes of administration (intramuscular versus intradermal) (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Although the most commonly used LAIVs are quadrivalent, trivalent LAIVs also exist

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In the USA, authorities resumed the recommendation to use quadrivalent LAIV during the 2018-2019 influenza season, along with other vaccines, following earlier concerns about LAIV effectiveness in children and adolescents.

 </sup> In addition, recombinant vaccines have been developed, which combine HA genes from circulating influenza viruses with genes from viruses that grow well in insect cells, which avoids the need for egg-based propagation

 </sup> (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Currently, only one recombinant seasonal vaccine is approved for use in the USA.
