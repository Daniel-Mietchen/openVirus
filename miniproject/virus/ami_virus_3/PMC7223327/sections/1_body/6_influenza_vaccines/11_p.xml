 </sup> might lead to design of vaccines of enhanced immunogenicity. For example, quantitative high-throughput genomics has recently been applied to discovering regions of the influenza A genome that affect replication fitness and IFN sensitivity. By building viruses incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, novel vaccine candidates were produced that are highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses with robust humoral and cellular immunity that provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges.
