<p id="Par29">The UK has mainly used injectable subunit vaccines in adults, but recently introduced LAIV for children. The injectable vaccines induce antibody to the chosen strains of flu but give little or no protection against other strains of influenza.

 </sup> The protection they induce relies on the accuracy of strain selection and varies from year to year. In addition, the injectable form can contain three virus strains or four; the latter (quadrivalent) targets two influenza A viruses and two influenza B varieties, which again change over time.

 </sup> LAIV has a greater potential to induce mucosal immunity and to protect against poorly matched strains of flu,

 </sup> but the problem with all existing influenza vaccines is that they have to be changed each year to match the expected circulating strains and do not provide protection against novel or zoonotic strains (which includes some very dangerous viruses which may be lethal for a high proportion of those infected).
