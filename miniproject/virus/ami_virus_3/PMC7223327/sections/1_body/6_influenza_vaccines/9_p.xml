<p id="Par31">There are intensive efforts to develop vaccines that provide broad, long-lasting protection against known and (yet) unknown strains of influenza. The commercial argument for an improved vaccine has limited traction, most of the drive coming from public health, government laboratories (especially in the USA), academia and from charitably funded laboratories. The goal is to develop an effective “broadly-reactive” or “universal” influenza vaccine capable of conferring protection against both seasonal and newly emerging pre-pandemic strains.
