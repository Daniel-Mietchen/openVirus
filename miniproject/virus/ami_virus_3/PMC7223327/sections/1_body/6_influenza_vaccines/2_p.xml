<p id="Par24">Twice a year, the process of identifying the next vaccine strains to be recommended by the World Health Organization starts with identifying which viral HA and NA variants are emerging that may have novel antigenic qualities and thus evade immunity generated in the human population by last yearâ€™s strains and vaccines. This estimation of the strains and HA and NA variants that are considered likely to circulate is an imperfect art, resulting in poor strain matches between vaccines and circulating viruses and lower vaccine effectiveness in some years. The virulent 1918 virus was an H1N1 subtype and apparently highly pathogenic; by contrast, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused a great deal of mild and often unapparent disease.
