<p id="Par25">In the winter of 2017â€“18, H3N2 (a descendent of the 1968 pandemic) caused a great deal of severe disease in some areas, as it has done in some previous years. Unlike vaccination, natural influenza induces a high proportion of NA-reactive B cells. Such antibodies are thought to decrease disease severity by inhibiting NA and the release of new virions.

 </sup> Human antibodies binding NA epitopes bind to many influenza virus strains and show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mice, but may not offer sterilizing immunity.
