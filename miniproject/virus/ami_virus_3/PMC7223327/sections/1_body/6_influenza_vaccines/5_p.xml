<p id="Par27">The main focus of vaccination is to induce specific immunity in the form of antibody against the influenza surface proteins antigens HA and NA. Currently available vaccines utilize HA, however. This immunity is conveniently measured as haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) for those viruses that exhibit haemagglutination. In addition, LAIV induces immune responses to NA as well as HA, local IgA and influenza specific resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells

 </sup> that may contribute to local mucosal defences. These forms of immunity may be more important than the induction of systemic antibody, a current regulatory requirement for conventional parenteral influenza vaccines. Methods of vaccine production are discussed in more detail elsewhere.
