<p id="Par28">Variants of influenza surface proteins arise because of changes of the amino acid sequences driven by immunity to prior circulating strains and by adaptation to the host. Growing influenza virus in eggs in order to make the seasonal vaccine can change the HA protein that mediates receptor binding because of adaptation to avian cells. Small modifications in HA sequence can cause significant antigenic changes and decrease vaccine effectiveness, particularly with influenza A (H3N2) viruses, even when the vaccine strain closely matches that of the circulating virus. For example, a recent study by Zost et al.

 </sup> highlighted a particular egg-adaptive mutation (T160K) that seems to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness during the 2016â€“2017 influenza season. T160K deletes a glycosylation site that is critical for both ferret and human antibody induction. Alternatives to egg-based propagation of vaccine strains, such as recombinant techniques, have the potential to overcome this problem.
