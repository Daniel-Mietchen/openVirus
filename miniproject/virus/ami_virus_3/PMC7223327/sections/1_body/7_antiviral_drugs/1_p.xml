<p id="Par35">With antiviral drugs, a key issue is the timing of the intervention. There is little doubt that early treatment greatly reduces the frequency and severity of disease, but patients with influenza rarely present within the first 2 days of disease onset. More usually, cases are seen on day 4 or beyond, at which time antivirals may have a relatively small effect.
