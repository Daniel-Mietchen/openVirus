 </sup> By contrast, a comprehensive meta-analysis of the effects of oseltamivir in seasonal influenza concluded that treatment led to a 28% reduction in lower respiratory tract complications requiring antibiotic treatment and an even greater effect in those with laboratory-confirmed influenza.

 </sup> A meta-analysis of antiviral treatment in 29,234 adult hospitalised cases (78 studies, 2009–2011, predominantly pandemic H1N1 virus) found that NAI treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality, especially in those treated within two days of symptom onset. However, even delayed NAI treatment appears to be better than no treatment (especially in critically ill patients). Evidence of benefit is weaker in children,
