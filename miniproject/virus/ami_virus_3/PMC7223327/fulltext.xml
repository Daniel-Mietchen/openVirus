The severity of the disease they cause is highly variable, from the mild and inapparent through to the devastating and fatal. The unpredictability of epidemic and pandemic outbreaks is accompanied but the predictability of seasonal disease in wide areas of the Globe, providing an inexorable toll on human health and survival. Although there have been great improvements in understanding influenza viruses and the disease that they cause, our knowledge of the effects they have on the host and the ways that the host immune system responds continues to develop. This review highlights the importance of the mucosa in defence against infection and in understanding the pathogenesis of disease. Although vaccines have been available for many decades, they remain suboptimal in needing constant redesign and in only providing short-term protection. There are real prospects for improvement in treatment and prevention of influenza soon, based on deeper knowledge of how the virus transmits, replicates and triggers immune defences at the mucosal surface.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">In 1918, the Austrian artist Egon Schiele (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) was finally achieving fame.

On entering the respiratory tract, the haemagglutinin (HA) proteins expressed on the surface of the influenza A or influenza B virus attach to sialic acid cell-surface receptors on the respiratory epithelium, triggering receptor-mediated endocytosis of the virion. This is followed by fusion of the virus membrane and the endosomal membrane, facilitated by HA and an acidic environment in the endosome. Ribonucleoprotein (RNP; containing the viral genome, across 8 viral RNA gene segments and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) is released and transported into the nucleus of the infected cell, where the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase mediates transcription and replication of viral RNA. The influenza virion consists of the RNP, is lined by the matrix protein 1 (M1) and is coated with the surface proteins HA, neuraminidase (NA) and matrix protein 2 (M2) that have been manufactured by the infected cell and then expressed on the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Once this packaging and budding process is complete, new virions are cleaved from the sialic acid residues on the cell surface by NA on progeny virions; the infected cell dies and the released virions can proceed to infect other cells.</p><p id="Par7">The sequence of events in the host is summarised in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. As soon as influenza virus encounters host cells, an innate immune response is triggered. This is facilitated by pattern recognition receptors such as retinoic acid-inducible gene-I protein and toll-like receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup> The production and release of soluble immune mediators that ensues is typically comprised of antiviral responses that involve pro-inflammatory cytokines and interferons, and the transcription of many interferon-stimulated genes, the products of which target and interrupt multiple, different steps in the influenza virus replication cycle.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> At this stage infection may be prevented by such innate immune responses, or become established, leading to viral replication. Infection may also be prevented by pre-existing antibodies, particularly those at the respiratory site of viral entry such as IgA.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Sequential events during influenza virus infection.</title><p>Viral entry and infection of the respiratory epithelium is blocked by specific mucosal antibody, mucus and antimicrobial proteins. Once access is gained to mucosal cells, inflammatory mediators produced. This initial phase is influenced by genetic factors, environmental stimuli, the resident respiratory microbiome, and infection history. Innate responses by resident airway cells, macrophages, and NK cells impede viral replication and spread to other parts of the respiratory tract. T-cell responses are important for viral clearance and disease resolution but may be associated with inappropriately polarized responses and immunopathology.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41385_2020_287_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e412"/></fig></p><p id="Par8">Infected respiratory epithelial cells activate the recruitment of NK cells, neutrophils and monocytes, which interact directly with infected cells to limit virus replication and sometimes act indirectly by priming adaptive immune cells and initiating the migration of other innate immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> Collectively, these innate immune responses help to control and eliminate the influenza virus infection, but can also contribute to the development of symptoms and immunopathology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup></p><p id="Par9">As viral replication comes under control, the adaptive immune response takes a more prominent role.

Indeed, <italic>Haemophillus Influenzae</italic> was described as the cause of influenza before influenza viruses were first isolated and characterized. The interaction between influenza and bacterial co-pathogens is of more than academic interest: most patients presenting with severe influenza are given antibiotics. It would be a brave clinical decision to withhold antibiotics, faced with a febrile patient with declining respiratory function and pulmonary consolidation. Less virulent seasonal influenza viruses also predispose to secondary infection, but the 1918 virus resulted in a remarkable pandemic of lethal bacterial pneumonia.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup></p><p id="Par12">The question of the role of secondary bacterial pneumonia in the 1918-19 pandemic has been repeatedly examined. For example, Morens et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> reviewed 1,539 publications with pathology and/or microbiology results from autopsy investigations of 8398 individuals across 15 countries and examined histological slides re-cut from lung tissue blocks obtained 90 years earlier during autopsies of 58 individuals, concluding that bacterial pneumonia was indeed present in most or all of those who died. The types of bacteria causing pneumonia were diverse, reflecting the typical bacteria present in the upper respiratory tract, and <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> was one of the more commonly identified bacterial species. Morens et al<italic>.</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> concluded that susceptibility to secondary bacterial pneumonia resulted from defective antibacterial defences caused by viral infection, and that prevention and treatment of secondary bacterial pneumonia (including stockpiling of antibiotics and bacterial vaccines) should be included in pandemic plans. In addition to <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> are commonly isolated secondary bacterial infections in influenza and associated with increased risk of mortality.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup></p><p id="Par13">Determining the mechanism by which influenza predisposes to secondary infection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup> and deciding who should be treated for bacterial superinfections has been the focus of considerable effort. Interestingly, influenza infection (with a live attenuated vaccine) has been reported to permit elevated colonization by <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> By comparison, antibiotic induced microbiome dysbiosis has been reported to impede the antibody response to influenza vaccination,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup> indicating that commensal microbes normally enhance anti-influenza immunity, but can initiate bacterial pneumonia if the inflammatory response to influenza is exaggerated. To address this issue, the MOSAIC consortium investigated which aspects of the host response and pathogen might together explain the severity of disease. This study linked extensive clinical and investigational data to viral isolates, bacterial profiles, whole blood mRNA signatures, local and systemic immune mediator concentrations in 131 adults hospitalised with influenza. mRNA &#x02018;signatures&#x02019; (groups of activated genes) reflecting IFN-related antiviral pathways predominated up to day 4 of illness in cases not requiring mechanical ventilatory support; in those needing mechanical ventilation an inflammatory, neutrophil and cell stress/death (&#x02018;bacterial&#x02019;) pattern was seen, even early in disease. Identifiable bacterial co-infection was not necessary for this &#x02018;bacterial&#x02019; signature but could enhance its development, while attenuating the early &#x02018;viral&#x02019; signature.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> These findings show the importance of timing and severity in the interpretation of host responses to severe influenza.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Influenza infections in asthmatics</title><p id="Par14">We recently completed a reanalysis of the MOSAIC cases to determine the differential pathogenesis of influenza H1N1pdm09 in adults with or without asthma, the most prevalent pre-existing medical condition (present in 30% of cases). In this subgroup, there was an excess of females (70% of asthmatics vs. 39% of non-asthmatics). The disease was less severe, with shorter length of stay (8.3 vs. 15.3 days) and lower mortality (3% vs. 11%). In the first 24&#x02009;h, patients with asthma had reduced systemic markers of inflammation with lower serum IL-6, TNF, CXCL-8, 9, IL-10, IL-17 and CCL-2. There was no difference in terms of virus titres. Notably, those with asthma did not demonstrate a heightened type 2 immune signature and (although peripheral blood eosinophils and atopic status were not recorded) there was no difference in serum total IgE, periostin, blood eosinophil gene expression, or nasal IL-13, IL-4 or IL-5.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup> Thus, those with asthma were more likely to present because of their airway symptoms as opposed to the seriousness of the systemic influenza infection.

The pattern of threat varies around the globe, influenza A viruses circulating not only in human populations but also in pigs and in many species of domestic birds, shore birds and waterfowl.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup> Indeed, the principal reservoirs of influenza A viruses are aquatic birds, rather than humans and other animals. The ability of influenza A to mutate and jump within and between species and the potential of avian, porcine and human strains to recombine give influenza A an extraordinary ability to exploit novel ecological niches.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup></p><p id="Par16">In addition to meeting the epidemiological criteria for a pandemic, novel pandemic influenza A viruses differ from season influenza A viruses in terms of the composition of their major surface antigens. Pandemic influenza A viruses arise as a result of antigenic shift; that is, the expression of novel HA and/or NA proteins.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup> Such a dramatic change results in viruses that are distinct from existing, circulating seasonal influenza A viruses, against which pre-existing antibodies might offer little protection. As antigenic shift is difficult to predict, so too is the ability to prepare pandemic vaccines in advance of an emerging pandemic virus. By contrast, established seasonal influenza A viruses undergo a process of regular antigenic drift, whereby the major antigens do not change abruptly and there is no change in the influenza A subtype, but cumulative viral genetic changes result in antigenic differences that are sufficient to facilitate escape from existing immune responses (particularly antibody based immunity) acquired from previous infections or immunisation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> This antigenic drift is the reason that the composition of seasonal influenza vaccines needs to be reviewed, and typically updated, on an annual basis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup></p><p id="Par17">Epidemics of influenza-like illness were described by Hippocrates in ancient Greece, but the first convincing flu pandemic was described in 1510.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> The 2009 influenza (pH1N1) pandemic resulted in generally mild disease but still caused an estimated 250,000&#x02013;500,000 additional deaths during the first 12 months of global circulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> Whereas seasonal influenza commonly causes severe disease in the old and infirm, pH1N1 disease mostly affected infants and younger adults, sometimes presenting as viral pneumonia occasionally complicated by multi-organ failure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup> The explanation for the age-associated pattern is most likely to be an absence of influenza subtype-specific immunity in H1N1-na&#x000ef;ve populations.

This has occurred on several occasions, but usually with limited ability to transmit person to person.

This estimation of the strains and HA and NA variants that are considered likely to circulate is an imperfect art, resulting in poor strain matches between vaccines and circulating viruses and lower vaccine effectiveness in some years. The virulent 1918 virus was an H1N1 subtype and apparently highly pathogenic; by contrast, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic caused a great deal of mild and often unapparent disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup></p><p id="Par25">In the winter of 2017&#x02013;18, H3N2 (a descendent of the 1968 pandemic) caused a great deal of severe disease in some areas, as it has done in some previous years. Unlike vaccination, natural influenza induces a high proportion of NA-reactive B cells. Such antibodies are thought to decrease disease severity by inhibiting NA and the release of new virions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> Human antibodies binding NA epitopes bind to many influenza virus strains and show prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy in mice, but may not offer sterilizing immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup></p><p id="Par26">The most commonly used current influenza vaccines fall into two broad groups: trivalent or quadrivalent inactivated vaccines (injected purified influenza surface protein preparations), and the live attenuated (quadrivalent) inhaled influenza vaccines (LAIV) that have been used in the USA in the past, but more recently introduced for childhood vaccination in the UK and other countries.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> Within the inactivated vaccines further differences exist, including the method used to propagate the vaccine strain (for example egg-based versus cell-based culture), the addition of immunological adjuvants, the amounts of antigens and adjuvants, and the routes of administration (intramuscular versus intradermal) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Although the most commonly used LAIVs are quadrivalent, trivalent LAIVs also exist<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3c</xref>). In the USA, authorities resumed the recommendation to use quadrivalent LAIV during the 2018-2019 influenza season, along with other vaccines, following earlier concerns about LAIV effectiveness in children and adolescents.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> In addition, recombinant vaccines have been developed, which combine HA genes from circulating influenza viruses with genes from viruses that grow well in insect cells, which avoids the need for egg-based propagation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). Currently, only one recombinant seasonal vaccine is approved for use in the USA.</p><p id="Par27">The main focus of vaccination is to induce specific immunity in the form of antibody against the influenza surface proteins antigens HA and NA. Currently available vaccines utilize HA, however. This immunity is conveniently measured as haemagglutination inhibition (HAI) for those viruses that exhibit haemagglutination. In addition, LAIV induces immune responses to NA as well as HA, local IgA and influenza specific resident memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> that may contribute to local mucosal defences. These forms of immunity may be more important than the induction of systemic antibody, a current regulatory requirement for conventional parenteral influenza vaccines. Methods of vaccine production are discussed in more detail elsewhere.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup></p><p id="Par28">Variants of influenza surface proteins arise because of changes of the amino acid sequences driven by immunity to prior circulating strains and by adaptation to the host. Growing influenza virus in eggs in order to make the seasonal vaccine can change the HA protein that mediates receptor binding because of adaptation to avian cells. Small modifications in HA sequence can cause significant antigenic changes and decrease vaccine effectiveness, particularly with influenza A (H3N2) viruses, even when the vaccine strain closely matches that of the circulating virus. For example, a recent study by Zost et al.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> highlighted a particular egg-adaptive mutation (T160K) that seems to have contributed to low vaccine effectiveness during the 2016&#x02013;2017 influenza season. T160K deletes a glycosylation site that is critical for both ferret and human antibody induction. Alternatives to egg-based propagation of vaccine strains, such as recombinant techniques, have the potential to overcome this problem.</p><p id="Par29">The UK has mainly used injectable subunit vaccines in adults, but recently introduced LAIV for children. The injectable vaccines induce antibody to the chosen strains of flu but give little or no protection against other strains of influenza.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup> The protection they induce relies on the accuracy of strain selection and varies from year to year. In addition, the injectable form can contain three virus strains or four; the latter (quadrivalent) targets two influenza A viruses and two influenza B varieties, which again change over time.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> LAIV has a greater potential to induce mucosal immunity and to protect against poorly matched strains of flu,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup> but the problem with all existing influenza vaccines is that they have to be changed each year to match the expected circulating strains and do not provide protection against novel or zoonotic strains (which includes some very dangerous viruses which may be lethal for a high proportion of those infected).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup></p><p id="Par30">An additional level of complexity is the emerging understanding of &#x02018;original antigenic sin&#x02019; in the antibody response to influenza vaccines and viruses. The principle underlying this idea is that antibody response to a first influenza infection biases recall responses to subsequent influenza infections (even of different antigenic types). The concept first gained traction in the 1950s<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref></sup> but had gained recent momentum with reports demonstrating broadly convergent antibody responses to H1N1 and H3N2 infections.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref></sup> Similarly, infections in childhood with H3 subtype viruses offers some protection against severe H7 subtype infections (since both are HA group 2 viruses), indicating that cross-protection does occur but is dependent on an individual&#x02019;s first exposure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref></sup> This concept offers insights to our immunity to influenza and might also be harnessed for the design of next-generation vaccines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref></sup></p><p id="Par31">There are intensive efforts to develop vaccines that provide broad, long-lasting protection against known and (yet) unknown strains of influenza. The commercial argument for an improved vaccine has limited traction, most of the drive coming from public health, government laboratories (especially in the USA), academia and from charitably funded laboratories. The goal is to develop an effective &#x0201c;broadly-reactive&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;universal&#x0201d; influenza vaccine capable of conferring protection against both seasonal and newly emerging pre-pandemic strains.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref></sup></p><p id="Par32">A number of approaches are being taken to develop universal influenza vaccines, including the induction of cross-reactive (CD8+) T cells and those that induce antibodies to the head domain of HA.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref></sup> Novel antigen delivery systems and vaccination strategies include the use of CpG-adjuvanted peptide vaccines to provide heterosubtypic protection by inhibiting regulatory T cell (Treg) development, thus enhancing T-cell immunity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref></sup></p><p id="Par33">It is also possible that greater understanding of the way that viruses manipulate host Type I interferon systems<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref></sup> might lead to design of vaccines of enhanced immunogenicity. For example, quantitative high-throughput genomics has recently been applied to discovering regions of the influenza A genome that affect replication fitness and IFN sensitivity. By building viruses incorporating eight IFN-sensitive mutations, novel vaccine candidates were produced that are highly attenuated in IFN-competent hosts but able to induce transient IFN responses with robust humoral and cellular immunity that provides protection against homologous and heterologous viral challenges.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref></sup></p><p id="Par34">Next-generation vaccines may primarily aim to induce sterilizing immunity. However, they may also aim to reduce the severity of disease, lessen complications, accelerate recovery and reduce shedding of seasonal (or pandemic) influenza viruses of diverse types, which may not require sterilizing immunity. Novel approaches to design of novel viral vector systems may be complemented by &#x02018;tuned&#x02019; adjuvants, or designer chimeric proteins optimised for the induction of specific humoral or cell-mediated immune responses. In addition, monoclonal antibodies or cocktails of antibodies might be developed for passive prophylaxis and treatment.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Antiviral drugs</title><p id="Par35">With antiviral drugs, a key issue is the timing of the intervention. There is little doubt that early treatment greatly reduces the frequency and severity of disease, but patients with influenza rarely present within the first 2 days of disease onset. More usually, cases are seen on day 4 or beyond, at which time antivirals may have a relatively small effect.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref></sup></p><p id="Par36">WHO guidelines recommend antiviral treatment in uncomplicated influenza in those with risk factors for complicated illness, as well as treatment of patients with severe or progressive clinical presentations of suspected or confirmed influenza.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref></sup> Neuraminidase inhibitors (NAIs) are most often used; although adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) and ribavirin have activity against some influenza viruses, their use is limited by side-effects and antiviral resistance. Influenza B viruses are generally resistant to adamantanes,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref></sup> as are currently circulating seasonal influenza A viruses.</p><p id="Par37">Oseltamivir and zanamivir are the two major NAIs currently in clinical use in most countries. Both target the NA surface protein, inhibiting cleavage of viral HA from sialic acid residues expressed on the cell surface.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref></sup> Oseltamivir is active orally (or via a nasogastric tube) and zanamivir is normally administered via inhalation as a dry powder (or as an intravenous infusion in certain circumstances). Alternatives are available in some countries including intravenous peramivir and the long-acting inhaled NAI, laninamivir,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref></sup> and Baloxavir marboxil, the most recent antiviral to be approved. Baloxavir is an oral, single-dose, cap-dependent endonuclease that inhibits influenza polymerase, thus interrupting the synthesis of new virions. The addition of an antiviral that acts in a different way to NAIs is useful, but there is already evidence of decreased susceptibility to baloxavir emerging in clinical trials.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref></sup> Since early treatment may prevent progression to severe illness,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref></sup> guidelines generally recommend empirical antiviral treatment (oseltamivir or zanamivir) when influenza is suspected and while awaiting laboratory confirmation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref></sup> Molecular tests for influenza viruses, typically PCR detection methods, are commonly used in hospital and tend to perform better than non-molecular rapid diagnostic tests. Point of care molecular platforms mean that diagnostics are now available for use in clinical areas, in addition to laboratory-based diagnostic testing. Regardless of the methods used, high quality sampling is required. This includes obtaining lower respiratory tract samples when there is evidence of lower respiratory tract disease, since lower respiratory tract samples may be positive when upper respiratory tract samples are negative.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref></sup></p><p id="Par38">However, there is controversy surrounding the use of antiviral drugs.
