    "Recently observed similarities in COVID-19 susceptibility among genetically related individuals hints at a selectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that hinges on the affinity for select genetic profiles prevalent in the human species. The selectivity determines susceptibility of clinical disease and extent of pathogenesis, including fatal lung and myocardial injury, and may be more cogent than the recently reported risk factors. The selectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for human genetic profiles as a factor of the virulence appears to be a novel feature and was not previously noted in the epidemics of widespread viral respiratory illnesses in humans."
