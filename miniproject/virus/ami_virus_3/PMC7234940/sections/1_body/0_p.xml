 <xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Large variability in the clinical presentations of COVID-19 disease amongst close contacts and members of the same household have been observed in clinical practice. During my conversations with next of kin of several critically ill patients with COVID-19 at Ochsner Medical Center, New Orleans, LA, USA, similar narratives were brought to my attentionâ€”members of a genetically related family suffered similar severity of disease while non-genetically related individuals in direct contact were mildly affected or asymptomatic (for example: spouses). Following my observations of this occurrence in greater than half of the critically ill COVID-19 patients I encountered, a systematic study to investigate this phenomenon in the local population is in process.
