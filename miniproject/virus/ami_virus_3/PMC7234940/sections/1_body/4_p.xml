As a corollary, the selectivity of the virus for human genetic profiles as a prognosticating factor for the severity of clinical disease portends a disconcerting challenge ahead. In this race to save humanity, we can get ahead of the game by putting our scientific clout in the pursuit of understanding the virulence behaviors and stratagem of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and by uncovering the genetic differences that render natural virulence in humans.
