<p id="p0015">A recent case of an 83-year-old male who died at home after 1 week of fever, cough, and delirium from COVID-19 further illustrates this phenomenon. At home close contacts included his daughter and her 3 adult children who tested positive for COVID-19 and suffered from self-limiting moderately severe symptoms around the same time; and his son-in-law who remained asymptomatic and later demonstrated IgG antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These observations hint at a selectivity of the virus within the human species that is predictive of the induction of clinical disease and the extent of pathogenesis among individuals. Conceivably, such selectivity may be more cogent than the recently reported risk factors of older age (â‰¥65 years old) and comorbidities (diabetes, underlying heart diseases, hypertension) associated with the development of severe illness [

Relevant to this hypothesis, the genetic underpinnings of the susceptibility to infection may be explained by the polymorphisms of functional receptors needed for the virus to enter host target cells. For instance, human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has shown to be involved in the viral genome replication process [
