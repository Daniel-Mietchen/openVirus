<p id="p0025">The selectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for human genetic profiles as a factor of the virulence appears to be a novel feature. There are no descriptions of a similar phenomenon associated with the 1918 influenza pandemic or the epidemics of widespread respiratory illnesses caused by other coronaviruses. Conceivably, this may have been underreported and not investigated systematically in the early to middle 20th century [
