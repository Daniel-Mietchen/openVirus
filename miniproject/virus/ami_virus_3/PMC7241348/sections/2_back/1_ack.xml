 <p>The authors wish to express our gratitude to our medical illustrator, Mr. Jason Ooi, for his evidence-based and hypothetical renditions of the putative pathobiological underpinnings of the SARS-CoV-2 induced ‘Prolific Activation of a Network Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Crisis’ [PANIC] Attack as the basis for severe COVID-19. Further we further express our gratitude for his exceptional illustrations underscoring the pleiotropic mechanisms of action afiliated with high dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue; as a hypothetical intervention for purposes of preventing or abolishing the SARS-CoV-2 mediated ‘Prolific Activation of a Network Immune-Mediated Inflammatory Crisis’ [PANIC] Attack.</p>
