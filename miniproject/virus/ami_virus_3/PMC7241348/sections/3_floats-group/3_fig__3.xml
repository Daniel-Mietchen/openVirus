  <p>Here we present the principal target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the most distal extent of the bronchopulmonary tree; the alveoli and its complex architecture and tight juxtaposition with respect to the capillary terminals of the most distal pulmonary arteries and pulmonary veins. A) We present the component parts of the SARS-CoV-2 agent. Note that the virion has a nucleocapsid composed of a positive single strand RNA and phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, which is then enclosed within a sphere delimited by membrane bilayers of phospholipid. Projecting out of the virion is the spike protein; the most important component part, given that the SARS-CoV-2 tropism is contingent upon the binding of spike to its counter-receptor, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE-2r). B) Demonstrates a pull-out in order to reveal the normal grape-like cluster arrangement of lung alveoli (on the left), in contrast to C) the irregular ‘deflated’ appearance of this terminal anatomic specialization that serves to uniquely package the sheer enormity of required surface area (~70 m
   <sup>2</sup>) in order to provide a gas-exchange apparatus sufficient to meet the body's demand for a continuous and uninterrupted supply of oxygen, while also serving as a portal for the expulsion of ‘bioenergetic exhaust’, in the form of carbon dioxide. D) represents the indivisible functional unit for gas-exchange, comprised of a single cell thick lining of which is comprised of a single cell thickness of epithelium. However, an added level of complexity relates to the differentiation of the cellular subtypes of the alveolar epithelial cells with the type I pneumocyte representing the principal cell responsible for gas exchange; the type II pneumocyte secretes surfactant, crucial for reducing alveolar surface tension which prevents alveolar collapse; and the type III pneumocyte or alveolar macrophage (aka ‘dust cells’) which are mobile and serve as a kind of ‘vacuum cleaner’ capable of removing a wide diversity of contaminants and microbial elements in order to minimize interference ‘clean’ gas-exchange. Inside the alveolus we illustrate the aerosolized entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and some of the immune elements which have trafficked to this site, secondary to immune network activation by the virus. This includes the accumulation of macrophages, mast cells, polymophonuclear neutrophils (PMNs), along with the cellular release of each cell's effector elements, such as cytokines, chemokines, free radicals, and reactive oxygen species. On the outer circular perimeter of the figure, we have magnified the circumferential organization of the alveolar epithelium in order to illustrate the distinctive mechanisms which collectively represent the SARS-CoV-2 triggered ‘prolific activation of a network immune-mediated, inflammatory crisis (‘PANIC’). E) We illustrate the sentinel step in viral tropism, vis a vis binding of the spike protein on the virion surface to the angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 receptor (ACE-2r) on the surface of the alveolar epithelium. Subsequent to this binding interaction is the entry of the virus into the epithelium via the endosomal pathway, culminating in the release of viral RNA in preparation for replication and eventual release of new virions, thereby perpetuating an amplification of the viral lifecycle and the corresponding acceleration in the destruction of lung alveoli, until a threshold burden of disease is established, beyond which the body's continuous demand for oxygen can no longer be achieved, at which point bioenergetic collapse occurs and heralds in the rapid demise and ultimately death of the patient. F) A distinctive facet of the PANIC Attack is illustrated where an activated immune cell has entered a terminal phase, programmed cell death or apoptosis. An inflammatory form of this cell-death sequence involves the massive release of cytokines and chemokines at the termination of the cell's viability, and is referred to as pyroptosis. G) We illustrate adaptive immune mechanisms triggered by the virus, and which sets into motion the development of both humoral (antibody generation), as well as cellular (with phenotypes determined by the preferential synthesis and release of cytokine and chemokine elements, which we can dichotomize into a categorical scheme of pro-inflammatory vs anti-inflammatory or immunoregulatory profiles) immune activities. Such processes commence with the organization of the immunologic ‘synapse’, which includes processed antigen (e.g. viral epitope; such as the SARS-CoV-2 peptide) coupled to major histocompatibility complex II proteins in an antigen presenting cell (such as a macrophage, dendritic cell, or B cell), then shuttled to the cell surface where this complex interacts with a T cell receptor; and the subsequent activation of response priming mechanisms. Priming can result in T cell mediated activities, principally via cytokine and chemokine networks, whereas humoral or B cell networks involve a complex array of activities which commence with somatic hypermutations within the immunoglobulin gene complex, which promotes the development of affinity (a means by which an antibody can bind to its cognate antigen) and avidity (a measure of the binding strength between an antibody and the antigen) maturation, followed by class switching from the acute IgM subtype to the convalescent and memory IgG phenotype. H) We illustrate alveolar epithelial membrane, albeit with a segment of the SARS-CoV-2 membrane integrated at the cell surface in what is referred to as syncytia (a kind of chimeric fusion of membranes). In this case, we can observe that the integrated or syncytial membrane expresses spike protein. However, rather than interacting with the ACE-2r, the PANIC Attack process has generated antibodies which bind to spike protein giving rise to either macrophage Fc receptor binding to the Fc portion of the anti-spike antibody and clearance via the reticuloendothelial system (RES), or activation of the complement fixation site on the anti-spike antibody which sets into motion a series of immune activities, which can foment further damage to the alveolar gas exchange apparatus. Activation of the lectin complement pathway, the alternative pathway (via contact with surfaces, including dead cellular debris), and the classical complement pathway all converge to activate a series of serine esterases, leading to the liberation of C3a and C5a, which serve as anaphylatoxins and chemotaxins promoting innate immune activities such as the migration of cellular elements (e.g. neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils) into the alveoli, whereupon their arrival, their effector species (super oxides, free radicals, histamine, etc) can be released and damage the delicate architecture of the gas exchange apparatus. I) We illustrate how the complement system activities also involve the coordination between C5b-C8 in the assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC), which contains a central channel, whereby C9 traverses the MAC and perforates the epithelial cell membrane culminating in death and ultimately exfoliation; a cataclysmic step in the destruction of the integrity of the alveoli, and failure of localized gas exchange.
