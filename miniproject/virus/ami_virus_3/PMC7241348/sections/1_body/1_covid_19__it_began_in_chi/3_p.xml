<p id="p0045">SARS-CoV-2 transmission is easily disseminated via aerosolization and droplets, with recent evidence suggesting that even non-amplified speech can effectively project orpharyngeal derived material containing virus to become airborne and capable of traveling distances typical for standard conversation [

Unlike the antecedent epidemics of SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) originated in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China and subsequently and rapidly disseminated globally confirming its designation as a

This ultimately led the world to ‘shelter in place’, because without an effective therapy, the best chance to quell the perpetual dissemination of infectivity, is to avoid transmissible contacts. Given the striking transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, in conjunction with the large proportion of both mildly affected and asymptomatic individuals harboring infection, both ‘shelter in place’, together with widespread availability of testing to confirm infection, as well as active immunity, represents our best strategy to prevent further dissemination and also to identify newly infected cases as early as possible.
