<p id="p0125">The convergent inflammatory cascades focused upon this highly delicate and vulnerable bronchopulmonary gas-exchange scaffolding is what makes this particular member of the Coronavirus family so ominously dangerous [

 <italic>limited window of opportunity</italic> to therapeutically intervene before the obliteration of a corpus of alveoli, from which survival is no longer feasible. Many who have succumbed to COVID-19, have done so while being carefully managed on pressure ventilation, with adequate respiratory rate (whether patient or ventilator triggered), and continuous delivery of oxygen, commensurate with optimization and persistency of 0
 <sub>2</sub> saturation kinetics. The addition of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) ensures that the bronchopulmonary terminus remains patent to facilitate effective gas diffusion. Another dividend of pressure ventilation is that it contributes to the process of effective pulmonary toilet, now referred to as Pulmonary Hygiene, and involves the use of medications, devices, and/or maneuvers, which are principally aimed at optimizing mucus clearance mechanisms [
