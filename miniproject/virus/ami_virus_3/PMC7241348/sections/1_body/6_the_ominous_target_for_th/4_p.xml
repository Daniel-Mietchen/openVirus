<p id="p0130">Without effective mucus clearance, there is a greater chance of organization of inspisated mucus combined with protein-rich fluid, produced secondary to localized inflammatory activities, material from the immune-mediated debris-field (including that from the exfoliation of destroyed alveoli epithelial cells), and trapped microbial material, which normally enters the lung with ambient airflow. Despite the capabilities of state of the art pressure ventilation devices, many COVID-19 patients who fail to wean off ventilator support exhibit a precipitous deterioration, heralded by the abrupt onset of oxygen desaturation, despite full mechanical support and control over the delivery of high oxygen concentration in conjunction with maximized PEEP.</p>
