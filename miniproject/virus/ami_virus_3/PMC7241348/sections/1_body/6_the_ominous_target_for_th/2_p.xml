<p id="p0120">The terminus of the broncho-pulmonary tree is the most important target of SARS-CoV-2, and is comprised of a duct system consisting of about 100 alveolar sacs, each composed of 20â€“30 alveoli. All totaled, there are some 600 million alveoli in the lungs [
 <xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Each individual alveolar membrane is 1-cell-thick and necessitates an intimate and tight juxtaposition of the alveolar epithelium with that of the pulmonary capillary endothelium, also with the thickness of a single cell. The single-cell arrangement, and ultra-tight juxtaposition of the capillary anatomy with that of the alveolar epithelium, constitutes an ideal architecture for the principal goal of pulmonary physiology, the loading of oxygen onto red cell hemoglobin and the expulsion of CO
 <sub>2</sub> from the lungs into the ambient air [
