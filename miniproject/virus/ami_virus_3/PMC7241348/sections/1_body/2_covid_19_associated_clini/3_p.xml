<p id="p0055">In the initial Wuwan cohort, characteristic chest CT findings were identified in 98% of 41 patients, with involvement of both lungs, and features consistent with the ‘so-called’ ground glass opacifications. Of those patients that deteriorated, most required intensive care unit (ICU) management, while paradoxically exhibiting a resolution of lung consolidations in comparison to those not requiring admission to the ICU [

The median duration (in days) between the onset of symptoms and the passing of clinically relevant and prognostic milestones of the severely affected was also documented in the Wuhan patients. Specifically, admission to hospital (7 days), onset of dyspnea (8 days), diagnosis of ARDS (9 days), admission to ICU (10.5 days), and mechanical ventilation (10.5 days). The timing from hospital admission to diagnosis of ARDS was also reported to be as short as two days, at which point such patients had a mortality rate of 15% [
