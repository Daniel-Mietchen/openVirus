<p id="p0095">Patients most likely to present with neurologic symptoms tended to be significantly older, and also afflicted with severe infection, with the majority of neurologic features occurring in the CNS (e.g. stroke, potentially influenced by features of a thrombotic microangiopathy, with or without cardiac disease, impaired consciousness, headache, dizziness, anosmia, dysgeusia, etc.), versus the PNS. These same individuals were also significantly more likely to present with elevated D-dimer levels (reminiscent of a consumptive coagulopathy, such as DIC), along with multiorgan derangements, like hepatic transaminitis, renal insufficiency signified by rising blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels, and serum elevation of muscle creatinine kinase levels. It has been established that inflammatory disease tips the coagulation cascade to a ‘pro-coagulant state’. This has been observed in neuroinflammatory disorders, including MS and its animal counterpart, experimental autoimmune enchephalomyelitis (EAE) [
