<p id="p0065">In the severely ill COVID-19 patients, front-line healthcare workers have been largely preoccupied with providing adequate life-support, prioritizing the integrity of the circulatory system, and keeping blood oxygen saturation above the threshold where end organ damage ensues. In those with a rapid transition from minor symptoms to urgent admission to an ICU, the majority will require ventilator support, along with continuous observation and repeated assessments of each of the major body systems. Given the potential for any given COVID-19 patient to abruptly deteriorate, clinical management mandates a systematic sequence of intensive care measures and protocols principally aimed at avoiding a period of hypoxic ischemia. It is for this reason, at least in part, that our understanding of the neurologic manifestations of COVID-19 lags behind our understanding of the more omnipresent and existential concerns that are associated with patients so severely affected by this infection.</p>
