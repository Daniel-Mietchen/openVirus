<p id="p0180">Perhaps the laboratory finding of greatest conspicuity in those with confirmed COVID-19 is lymphopenia, posited to potentially represent the consequence of the broadening of SARS-CoV-2 distribution and apoptosis, the terminal phenomenon of viral infection [

The sequestration of lymphocytes into the lungs may also be a feasible hypothesis for the circulating lymphopenia (let's recall that only 3â€“5% of the body's mononuclear cells are in circulation at any given time). Despite the lymphopenia, widespread lymphocyte activation is a stereotypic observation in those with the disorder, particularly associated with the severe variant [
