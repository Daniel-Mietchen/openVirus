<p id="p0205">Methotrexate with leucovorin rescue is an FDA approved and generic treatment regimen, that is inexpensive, widely available, and one with an extensive experiential track record of well-identified adverse events and toxicities, while also being associated with a corresponding and longstanding effective spectrum of risk mitigtation strategies. Most importantly, high-dose intravenous methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (HDMTX-LR) represents a treatment strategy which is endowed with an impressively broad heterogeneity of anti-inflammatory properties spanning the human immune network, and which strikingly align with each of the currently identified components of the newly defined PANIC injury construct, fomented by the SARS-CoV-2 agent.</p>
