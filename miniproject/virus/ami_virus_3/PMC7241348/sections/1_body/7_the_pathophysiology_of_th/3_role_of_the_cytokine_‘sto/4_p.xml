 <sup>+</sup>T cells, a response considered to be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 clearance. However, the concomitant presence of elevated levels of IL-6, and IL-8, impair the ability of T cells to prime dendritic cells against the virus, and also limit macrophage clearance of the pathogen. Similar to MERS, also characterized by augmented circulating levels of IL-6, there is a reduced production and elaboration of anti-viral cytokines, such as the type I interferons (IFN alpha and beta) [
