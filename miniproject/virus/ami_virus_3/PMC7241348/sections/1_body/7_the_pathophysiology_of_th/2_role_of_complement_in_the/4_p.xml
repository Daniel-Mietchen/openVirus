<p id="p0165">We hypothesize that the early presence of both IgM and IgG directed to spike is germane to the activation of complement within the lung by the classical pathway, which is principally triggered by the recognition of antigen-antibody complexes. The latter of which must be of appropriate isotype in order to ‘fix’, and thereby activate, the classic complement cascade [
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>]. The alternate and lectin activated complement cascades are also likely ignited in the lung of severely affected COVID-19 patients. The former can be activated by either C3b or via contact with surface epitopes, such as those liberated by damaged cells, while the latter pathway is antibody-independent and becomes activated when mannose binding lectin (MBL) binds to glycosylated moieties upon the surface of pathogens.
