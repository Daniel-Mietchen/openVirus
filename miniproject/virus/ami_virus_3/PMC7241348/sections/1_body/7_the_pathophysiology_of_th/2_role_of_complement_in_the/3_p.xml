<p id="p0160">Eculizumab has been FDA approved for a number of conditions where pathogenic antibody is complement fixating, and upon engagement with its antigen, there occurs the initiation of the assembly sequence involving C5b—C8, that ultimately culminates in the formation of the MAC, through which C9 can then traverse and breach the integrity of the cell membrane sufficient to promote cell death. The conditions that have been shown to be effectively treated by eclulizumab include hemolytic anemia syndrome (HUS), paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myasthenia gravis, and most recently AQP4
 <sup>+</sup> neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) patients [

Administration of eculizumab early in the disease course may ultimately shed light on the role of complement-dependent injury pathways on the disease burden in the distal bronchopulmonary circuit. The diverse spectrum of innate and adaptive immune activation, ignited by the SARS-CoV-2 agent, is compositionally part of our ‘PANIC’ Attack hypothesis.
