<p id="p0170">Upon convergence with the serine esterase sequence activation of the complement cascade, all three paths ultimately lead to cleavage products, such as the anaphylatoxins and chemotoxins, C3a, C4a, and C5a, which can increase vascular permeability in concert with promoting the redistribution of circulating neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and macrophages into the site of the tissue localization where the complement cascades were activated [

Upon their arrival, these leukocytes can elaborate a number of highly potent and injurious immune effector elements (i.e. free radicals, superoxides, etc), which together further contribute to both the process of attempted neutralization of the immune challenge, which is SARS-CoV-2, as well as potentially fomenting a considerable amount of damage to the surrounding host tissue structure (i.e. bystander damage) [

The anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a further intensify and perpetuate organ tissue damage in COVID-19, where it is principally focalized to the peripheral bronchopulmonary anatomy via escalation of IL-1, IL-6, TNFÎ±, as well as mast cell histamine degranulation [
