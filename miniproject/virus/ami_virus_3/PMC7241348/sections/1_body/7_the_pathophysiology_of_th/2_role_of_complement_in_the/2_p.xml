Destruction of alveolar cells expressing ACE-2r by SARS-CoV-2 could theoretically be orchestrated by post-viral replication cell bursting, or by antigen-antibody complex triggering antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) via activation of the complement pathway [

 <xref rid="bb0245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Activation of the complement pathway would result in the C3a and C5a fragments acting as anaphylatoxins and chemotaxins, serving to recruit neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, and eosinophils into the target tissue. Upon arrival, these cells would release their immune effector mediators, including free radicals and reactive oxygen species (such as superoxide). Alternatively, distal activation of the complement pathways involving C5 convertase leads to the assembly of the C5b-C8 coordinated membrane attack complex (MAC) and the subsequent traversal of C9 into the MAC channel and across the cell membrane (i.e. the alveolar epithelium), leading to osmotic derangements culminating in cell death [

In order to ascertain the role played by the complement system in the pathobiology of COVID-19, a recently reported case series characterized the recovery of four ICU patients with severe COVID-19 associated pneumonia or ARDS, in response to eculizumab, an antibody against C5 convertase, which ultimately prevents the assembly of MAC, and thereby ADCC [
