<p id="p0030">A principal goal herein is to confirm both face and construct validity for the principle of this new definition for a poorly coordinated and dysregulated sequence of coincidentally activated limbs of the immune network (i.e. PANIC), and the consequences of such upon the primary target tissue for an infection as virulent and strategically ominous as the SARS-CoV-2 agent. Further, given the prolific immune activation associated with microbial-induced ‘PANIC’, in Part II of this publication, we advance the hypothesis that effective therapy should thereby provide a pleiotropic strategy commensurate with the range of the immune system's diversity of activation by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>
