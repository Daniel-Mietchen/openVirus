<p id="p0035">The SARS-CoV-2 agent triggers PANIC which the authors find reminiscent of phenomenonlogy which we have previously identified (and published in 
 <italic>the Journal of the Neuological Sciences</italic>) as ‘monumentally severe central nervous system (CNS) inflammatory syndromes’ that were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), neuromyelitis optica (NMO), and Sjogren's syndrome myelitis; all of which were refractory to conventional, even intensive, immunotherapy. The successful rescue intervention reported utilized the application of high-dose methotrexate with leucovorin rescue (HDMTX-LR), an intensive and highly pleiotropic anti-inflammatory strategy [

 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> ]. Though classically defined as nuances of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), they were, however, recalcitrant to conventional immunotherapy, but were stereotypically abolished utilizing our HDMTX-LR treatment strategy.
