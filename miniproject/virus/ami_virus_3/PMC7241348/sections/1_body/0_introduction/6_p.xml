<p id="p0025">Overwhelming the limiting threshold for damage to our 600 million alveoli has been associated with the abrupt collapse of circulatory oxygen saturation and delivery, which becomes refractory to any intervention, thereby presaging multiorgan hypoxic-ischemia and death. The designation of severe COVID-19 can be characterized by a number of risk factors and clinical manifestations that implicate the nervous system as either a target tissue of the disorder's pathophysiologic underpinnings, or as playing a fundamental role in the compromise in the fidelity of centrally integrated regulatory mechanisms which both ‘sense’ and respond to alterations in respiratory metrics. To illustrate one such pathway, trace the partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide as codified by the sensing apparatus in the carotid bodies, and transmitted via the nerves of Hering (small branch of the glossopharyngeal nerve), to the solitary tract and nucleus localized to the caudal medullary tegementum. The integrity of the complex connectivity of this circuitry must be maintained in order to achieve its goal of regulating all functions of the respiratory system to maintain oxygen saturation and delivery to ensure continuous organ tissue viability.</p>
