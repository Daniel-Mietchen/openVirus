<p>Evidence from clinical and experimental studies strongly suggests that estrogens can modulate lung inflammation and allergic reactions, because activation of estrogen receptors modulates immune cells and both innate and adaptive immune responses (

Estradiol plays a critical role in improving outcomes in the settings of trauma, shock, sepsis, myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, and acute lung injury (ALI). Experimental data with an intestinal I/R model show that estradiol treatment in ovariectomized females reduces lung inflammation and exerts these effects by modulating eNOS protein expression in the lungs (

In this model, the inflammatory status of the lungs in ovariectomized females remains for a long period after the mesenteric reperfusion has been reestablished and is characterized by the release of proinflammatory mediators and danger signals. The treatment with estradiol is able to downregulate the lung inflammation and its capacity for releasing cytokines (

 <xref rid="B84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref>). Thus, the effects of estradiol are important in the modulation of an already established lung inflammatory response. It is noteworthy to point out that the proposed treatment was acute and could be considered a clinical alternative.
