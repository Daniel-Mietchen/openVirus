<p>Estrogen attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to various stimuli and induces vasodilation in the pulmonary vasculature during stress situations like hypoxia (
 <xref rid="B91" ref-type="bibr">91</xref>). This is mediated by increased levels of prostacyclin and NO as well as decreased levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1). It is well-established that estradiol exerts important vasoactive effects by activation of eNOS, as well as modulation of vasoactive substances released from endothelial cells or the direct vasodilation effect via relaxation of smooth muscle cells (
 <xref rid="B92" ref-type="bibr">92</xref>). The vasoactive effects of ET-1 can be influenced by estradiol and are organ-dependent (
 <xref rid="B93" ref-type="bibr">93</xref>), and estradiol and its metabolites inhibit ET-1 synthesis (
 <xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). Ovariectomized female rats present higher ET-1, and estradiol replacement reduces ET-1 peptide expression (
 <xref rid="B95" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>). Thus, estradiol acts as a protective vasoactive agent against deleterious microcirculatory conditions, such as brain death and ischemia/reperfusion injury (
 <xref rid="B82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref>,
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Brain-dead rats treated with 17Î²-estradiol exhibit reduced lung injury, mainly because of its actions on endothelial and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) (
 <xref rid="B96" ref-type="bibr">96</xref>). Regarding injury, estrogen can inhibit vascular responses and thus prevent proatherosclerotic events (
 <xref rid="B97" ref-type="bibr">97</xref>). The maintenance of organ homeostasis depends on a complex network of systems, and reduction of blood flow may have profound consequences on organ status. Microcirculatory function following trauma can be affected by sex hormones (
 <xref rid="B98" ref-type="bibr">98</xref>), altering tissue perfusion and influencing inflammatory processes. Estrogen exerts a variety of rapid actions, initiated after coupling with membrane receptors, which may positively modulate vascular responses in pulmonary disease and help to maintain microvascular flow.
