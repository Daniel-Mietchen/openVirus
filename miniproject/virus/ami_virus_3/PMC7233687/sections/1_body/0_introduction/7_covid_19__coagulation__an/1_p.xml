<p>Although one of the consequences of severe COVID-19 is the development of ARDS, some studies indicated that respiratory phenotypes induced by COVID-19 are slightly different from those classical phenotypes observed in ARDS patients (
 <xref rid="B99" ref-type="bibr">99</xref>). COVID-19 patients developed a severe hypoxemia early in the course of the disease, which is silent most of the time (
 <xref rid="B100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref>). Most recently, small fibrinous thrombi in small pulmonary arterioles and a tumefaction of endothelial were observed in autopsies in cases of fatal COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="B101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref>). This could indicate the activation of the coagulation cascade in these patients. In addition, they also reported diffuse alveolar damage with intense epithelial viral cytopathic effects both in the alveolar and small airways. More interestingly, the presence of thrombus occurred in both damaged and preserved lung parenchyma areas. All together, these features suggested that anticoagulant drugs could have beneficial effects in COVID-19 patients.
