<p>Estrogen reduces platelet aggregation, the opposite effect of testosterone (

 <xref rid="B104" ref-type="bibr">104</xref>) studied the short-term effects of estrogens on the coagulation-fibrinolysis process in surgically treated women, and the results did not show abnormal or thrombogenic changes in coagulation parameters. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic>, 17Î²-estradiol is able to inhibit platelet aggregation by promoting Ca
 <sup>2+</sup> extrusion or reuptake activity, and its action is dependent on the increase of NO synthesis (

 <italic>in vitro</italic> data suggest that although women have a higher magnitude of platelet reactivity, their response to aspirin is similar or even larger compared to that of men (

 <xref rid="B110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>) evidenced a connection between age and decreases in platelet tracks, platelet translocation, and unstable platelet interactions. The altered platelet function associated with aging was more profound in females compared with that of males and could be a result of a reduction in estrogen levels in women.
