<p>According to the evidence that female sex hormones exert antiviral activity in many organs, the use of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) has been extensively explored in experimental systems to reduce virus infections (reviewed by Montoya &amp; Krysan, (
 <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>)). In general, SERMs have been used for several therapeutic purposes, such as in the treatment for infertility and osteoporosis, but are mainly related to cancer as adjuvants in chemotherapy, such as tamoxifen. In viral infection, this compound was suggested to be considered as an antiviral therapy, because of its properties of disrupting viral replication during HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection in monocytes and CD4+ T-lymphocyte cell lines (

 <xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>) showed that various SERMs reduce the production of HCV RNA, preferentially related to the extracellular but also intracellular virus proteins, suggesting that SERMs may be a multi-targeted drug that interferes with several processes, comprising virus entry and replication.
