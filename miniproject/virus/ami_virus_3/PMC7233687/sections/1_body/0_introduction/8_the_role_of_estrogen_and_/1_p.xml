<p>Considering virus-induced lung inflammation, the excessive inflammation leads to tissue damage. In this regard, T cells seems to be reduced in COVID-19 patients, and the present T cells seemed to be functionally exhausted (

Severe COVID-19 can induce ARDS in more than 50% of patients, and neutrophils are considered to be the central cells involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS. Infected female mice that were administered estradiol showed pulmonary recruitment of neutrophils and virus-specific CD8 T cells, releasing more INF-γ and TNF-α (
