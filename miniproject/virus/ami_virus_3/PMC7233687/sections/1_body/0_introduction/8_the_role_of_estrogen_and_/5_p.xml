<p>Of note, the most approximate model of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection is found in MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. Both have been demonstrated to be affected by toremifene citrate (a classical SERM), which delayed virus infection due to the inhibition of the late endosome virus trafficking (

 <xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>). Importantly, it was also demonstrated that SERMs can elevate the survival rate of infected animals by 90% and 50% when using clomifene and toremifene, respectively. Mechanistically, it has been proposed that toremifen could target envelope proteins GP1 and GP2, which permit the viral attachment and access to host cells, decreasing its stability and resulting in reduced endolysosomal membrane fusion (
