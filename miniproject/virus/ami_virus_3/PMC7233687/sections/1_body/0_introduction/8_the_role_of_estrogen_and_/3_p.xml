<p>Nevertheless, the most likely antiviral effects of estrogen are mediated by inflammation modulation. Regarding the cells that participate in the immune response, dendritic cells play a crucial role. Escribese et al. (
 <xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>) infected dendritic cells with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and treated the cells with 17Î²-estradiol. The authors observed a diminished type I IFN synthesis, also reducing the CD4 T cell response, suggesting that estrogen has an antiviral activity on RNA viruses.
