<p>Many viruses are affected by estrogen at the molecular level, specifically in the replication machinery and maturation of the virion, but to date, no evidence has been presented for SARS-CoV-2. Despite the well-known role of estrogen in inflammation to combat pathogens and infections, it has been shown that estrogen receptors participate in repressing transcription virus genes. One example is the hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection, where ER-α interferes with virus gene expression through (HNF)-4α (hepatocyte nuclear factor 4α) binding to HBV enhancer I in hepatocytes (
