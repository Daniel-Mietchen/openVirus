<p>Suba (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>) revealed that epidemiological data from SARS and MERS CoV epidemics indicated that the outcome of human coronavirus infections is strongly sex-dependent, suggesting the role of a strong protective estrogen signal in adult female patients compared to age-matched males. In this context, considering that female sexual hormones may modulate the inflammatory response and also exhibit direct effects on the cells of the immune system, here we intend to discuss the sex differences and the role of estradiol in modulating the lung and the systemic inflammatory response and its possible application as a treatment for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
