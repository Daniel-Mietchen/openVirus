<p>According to Mason (
 <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>), the pathogenesis of COVID-19 can be divided into three stages. The first asymptomatic phase occurs when the inhaled virus SARS-CoV-2 starts to replicate in the epithelial cells in the nasal cavity. The second phase occurs when the virus migrates through the lung and a more vigorous innate immune response is triggered. The last phase is manifested by hypoxia, ground glass infiltrate, and progression to respiratory failure. A range of 20% to 30% of infected patients will progress to stage 3 of the disease and will develop pulmonary infiltrates that can also evolve into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). ARDS is an acute inflammatory lung injury, characterized by increased pulmonary vascular permeability, enlarged lung weight, and loss of aerated lung tissue (
