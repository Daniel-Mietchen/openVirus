<p>The inflammatory response is a natural defense mechanism of the body to remove harmful stimuli such as pathogens and initiate the recovery process. SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that induces COVID-19, enters the body through the interaction between the S protein on the virus surface and angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) molecules expressed in epithelial cells in the lungs (

 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), it can induce an immune response that causes several alterations in the lung including inflammation and respiratory failure. The binding of the COVID-19 protein to ACE-2 has been shown to downregulate its enzymatic activity and decrease angiotensin production (
