<p>Similar to the disease caused by SARS-CoV identified in 2002, pulmonary involvement is the dominant clinical feature observed in COVID-19. Zhang et al. (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>) observed the presence of Rp3 NP SARS-CoV-2 protein in alveolar epithelium cells, including those that were peeled and injured in the alveolar space in lung biopsies. These authors also observed diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cells peeling with type II reactive hyperplasia of pneumocytes, and fibrinous exudate associated with interstitial fibrosis and chronic inflammatory infiltrate.
