<p>The severe form of COVD-19 is well-characterized by dyspnea, hypoxemia, and pulmonary tissue damage. In addition, 67-85% of critically ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with COVID-19 will develop ARDS, and this will be the cause of death (

 <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Huang et al. (
 <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) reported that dyspnea and lymphopenia was present in more than 50% of infected patients, and all of them showed abnormal findings on a chest CT scan. Considering the inflammatory responses, Lagunas-Rangel et al. (
 <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) suggested that patients with severe COVID-19 show a cytokine storm with acute increased levels of IL-2, IL-7, G-CSF, CXCL10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, TNF-α, and IL-6, similar to patients diagnosed with SARS and MERS. Thus, this suggests that mortality could be due to viral hyperinflammation that exacerbates lung damage.
