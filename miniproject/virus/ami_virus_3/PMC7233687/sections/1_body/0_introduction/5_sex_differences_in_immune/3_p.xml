<p>Considering lung inflammation, mortality in ARDS is higher in males compared to females (

 <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>). In the respiratory system, sex steroids have been demonstrated to play important roles in the development and maturation of lungs and maintenance of normal lung function (
 <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>), and sexual dimorphism impacts the prevalence and incidence of several lung diseases (
 <xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>). Sex differences were identified in lung physiology and disease and have been studied in animal models. Sex also influences lung development and disease conditions (
 <xref rid="B74" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>). Sex hormones may contribute to the disease pathophysiology or serve as protective factors, depending on the disease involved. Women may be protected from certain age-related biological processes by producing lower levels of reactive oxidant species, important drivers of pathology in age-related pulmonary disease (
 <xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>). Pulmonary diseases in women are influenced by age because of the variation of their level of estrogen. Increasing age is associated with higher levels of circulating inflammatory mediators and acute phase proteins. The reduction of estrogen, the increased fat tissue, and the presence of subclinical infections contribute to the proinflammatory status of postmenopausal women. The development and progression of age-related diseases is dependent on mechanisms associated with cellular senescence that may be triggered by telomere shortening, which in women occurs at a slower rate than in men (
