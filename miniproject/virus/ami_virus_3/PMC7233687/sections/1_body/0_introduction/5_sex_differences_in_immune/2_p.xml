<p>In women, the CD4+ T cell numbers are higher (
 <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>), and the ovarian cycle also influences the T reg cell populations with an increased number when estradiol levels are higher (
 <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>). These differences are connected to estradiol influence and affect immune responses to infection. In addition, estradiol exerts anti-inflammatory effects on innate immune responses by reducing monocyte and macrophage inflammatory cytokine release (
 <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), delaying neutrophil apoptosis and enhancing neutrophil annexin-1 expression without increasing their activation (

Experimental data confirm that the leukocyte function in females is more efficient than that in males, detecting and eliminating pathogens more rapidly, and that females have higher numbers of tissue macrophages with a greater density of toll-like receptors; female macrophage phagocytosis is more efficient with NADPH oxidase killing, in parallel with an increased population of resident anti-inflammatory T-lymphocytes (
 <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>). The dendritic cell population is also influenced by female sex hormones, with estradiol signaling via estrogen receptor α ER-α to increase the number of new DCs during inflammation (
 <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>). In plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are mostly involved in antiviral responses, estrogen increases the release of type 1 cytokines that are important for an efficient type 1 immune response (
 <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>). The action of estradiol via ER-α also promotes activation of type 1 INF-inducible innate pathways, and the IFN pathway genes are highly expressed in females, regulating innate immunity (
