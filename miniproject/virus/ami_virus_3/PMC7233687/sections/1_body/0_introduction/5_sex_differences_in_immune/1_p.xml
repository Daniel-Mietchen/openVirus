<p>Steroid sex hormones may affect the strength of immune responses in opposite directions and result in a general difference between males and females, with stronger immune responses in females than in males (for review see Roved et al. (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>)). The dominant profile of the immune response may be dependent on hormonal variation during the female sexual cycle. Data indicate that female sex hormones enhance Th2 immune responses and reduce Th1, and this influence has been comprehensively covered in many reviews (
 <xref rid="B09" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>,
 <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>). Females seems to develop stronger cell-dependent and humoral responses to infection and vaccination. The result of these differences can be observed when comparing the incidence of autoimmune diseases between sexes (
 <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>), which is higher in females, and also by the observation of higher incidence of sepsis in males in parallel with higher plasma levels of Th1 cytokines (
 <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>-
 <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>). Also, the incidence of sepsis in postmenopausal women increases to levels almost equal to those seen in age-matched men (
 <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>). In addition to hormonal influences, there is an apparent genetic disparity, since females carry two inherently polymorphic X chromosomes, while males have only one polymorphic X chromosome passed from the mother. The random process of X-chromosome inactivation provides females with a broader panel of proteins and enlarges the potential diversity of cell populations (
