They pointed out that wearing medical masks and respirators are critical in the personal protection for the healthcare workers, especially in virus breakouts such as COVID-19. They also expressed their concerns about the worldwide mask supplies running out. As their study compared different features of medical masks and respirators, the essential role of wearing masks for both inward and outward protection (protecting the wearer from the environment and the opposite) was emphasized. Apart from the inward and outward protection that wearing the mask provides, the indirect effect of wearing masks during epidemics can also be of great importance.
