 </xref> These symptoms are common among other types of influenza and bacterial common cold. Wearing masks will also prevent those types of infections caused by other types of pathogens which are communicable with aerosols and droplets. If all the individuals in a community wear masks, the number of cases referred to the hospitals presenting COVID-19 like symptoms decreases. In other words, the work load of the medical system decreases. So, the real cases of COVID-19 can be screened out of all other types of influenza and common cold comparatively easily. By referring fewer people to the clinics and hospitals, the chance of the contamination of new patients while visiting the hospitals and clinics also deceases. This strategy might help countries to fight against the outbreak of COVID-19.
