<p id="p0100">It is important to consider host species differences in coronavirus pathogenesis. Animal models do not recapitulate the full spectrum of human disease caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. This is due to multiple differences in hosts, including host restriction factors and the expression of the receptors for viral entry (ACE2 for SARS-CoV, DPP4 for MERS-CoV) (

While expression of human ACE2 renders mice more permissive to SARS-CoV infection, human SARS disease is not accurately reproduced by any of the mouse models. Non-human primate species are susceptible to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections to varying degrees, but do not consistently reproduce the disease severity and mortality seen in patients (

In mice and non-human primates, IFN response appears to be generally dysregulated or delayed during SARS-CoV infection, whereas clinical studies have more often than not reported a lack of IFN response (

 <xref rid="bib76" ref-type="bibr">Ziegler et al., 2020</xref>). These differences highlight the significance of host-specific factors in determining IFN response and disease outcomes. Strong research focus should be on investigating the role and kinetics of IFNs in COVID-19 patients throughout disease progression.
