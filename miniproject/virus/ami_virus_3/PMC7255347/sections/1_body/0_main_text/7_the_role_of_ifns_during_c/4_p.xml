 <sup>−/−</sup> mice have worse clinical and histopathological outcomes compared to wild-type mice after MERS-CoV challenge (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Blocking IFNAR1 also increases viral load and mortality (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Channappanavar et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, during MERS-CoV infection, there is no delay in induction of IFN-I response relative to viral replication, which may account for the different impact of IFNs in SARS and MERS. Findings from exogenous IFN-I administration further support the protective role of early IFN-I in MERS. Prophylactic administration of IFN-β in mice accelerated viral clearance without causing weight loss or inflammation (
 <xref rid="bib73" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Early IFN-β treatment before viral peak was also protective, whereas late treatment resulted in increased inflammation and lethal pneumonia (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Channappanavar et al., 2019</xref>). These studies all together underscore the importance of timing of IFN-I induction relative to viral replication as a key determinant of the response outcome, with early IFN-I induction or administration conferring protection (
 <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2</xref> ). In contrast, delayed IFN-I response not only fails to control virus but can also cause inflammation and tissue damage. Therefore, the host may benefit from IFN-I supplementation early in the disease course, particularly when IFN-I expression is delayed or reduced due to viral suppression of IFN response or older age of the host.
