<p id="p0085">Paradoxically, elevated IFNs correlate with worse disease. In a cohort of clinically well-described SARS patients, high levels of IFN-α and ISGs correlated with disease severity (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Cameron et al., 2007</xref>). In patients who developed severe hypoxemia, high levels of IFN-induced chemokines and IFNAR1 persisted even after the resolution of acute illness. Similarly, IFN-α levels were more frequently elevated in the severe MERS patient group than in the mild group, and correlated with viral RNA copies (
