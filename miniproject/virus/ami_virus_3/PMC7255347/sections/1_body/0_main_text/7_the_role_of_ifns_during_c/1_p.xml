<p id="p0080">Clinical studies have reported lack of IFN response in SARS patients in spite of robust cytokine and chemokine productions, consistent with

 <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Reghunathan et al., 2005</xref>). Serum analysis of COVID-19 patients showed a similar dynamic; pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were strongly elevated without detectable levels of type I and III IFNs (
 <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">Blanco-Melo et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies suggest that rather than its complete absence, the IFN response may be delayed. Comparison of transcriptome of SARS-CoV-infected cells across multiple time points revealed that expression of IFNs lags that of pro-inflammatory cytokines (
