<p id="p0090">The role of IFN signaling in SARS mouse models depends on the genetic background. In C57BL/6 or 129 mice that develop mild SARS, IFN signaling contributes to protection by enhancing viral clearance (

 <sup>−/−</sup> 129 mice succumb to SARS-CoV infection owing to impaired viral control and severe pathology (

 <sup>−/−</sup> 129 mice have disease severity comparable to the wild-type, their viral control is impaired. Similar results were obtained in the C57BL/6 background;

 <sup>−/−</sup> BALB/c mice show mild symptoms and 100% survival rate. In this severe SARS model (BALB/c), IFN-I induction is delayed relative to viral replication (
 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Channappanavar et al., 2016</xref>). IFN-I delivery prior to the peak viral load in these mice enhanced viral control and conferred complete protection from the disease. In contrast, administration after the viral peak failed to achieve the same effects (
