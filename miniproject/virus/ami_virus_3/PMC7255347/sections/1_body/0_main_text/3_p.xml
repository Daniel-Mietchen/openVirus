<p id="p0020">Type I and type III IFNs establish the cellular state of viral resistance, as well as activate the adaptive immune responses to viruses (

Successful viral pathogens therefore have evolved mechanisms to escape both immune recognition and suppress the functions of IFNs and ISGs. Many viral proteins are dedicated to modulating the host IFN response. These mechanisms have been extensively investigated for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (
