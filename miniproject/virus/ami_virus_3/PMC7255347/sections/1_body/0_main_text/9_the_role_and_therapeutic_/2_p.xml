<p id="p0125">Several animal studies have investigated the role of type III IFNs in SARS and MERS. During MERS-CoV infection, IFN-λs are produced in a TLR7-dependent manner and correlate with viral replication kinetics (

 <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Scheuplein et al., 2015</xref>). Transcriptome analyses of SARS-CoV-infected mice revealed STAT1-dependent but IFNAR-independent ISG induction, raising the possibility that ISGs may be induced by signaling through IFNLR (
