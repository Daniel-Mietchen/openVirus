<p id="p0120">Type III IFNs, like type I, are induced upon PRR recognition of PAMPs and signal through the shared JAK-STAT pathway to induce a similar antiviral transcriptional program. Type I and III IFN responses achieve context-specific non-redundant functions through several features. First, IFN-λs bind to IFNLR (IFNLR1/IL10Rβ) expressed preferentially on epithelial cells of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts as well as on certain myeloid cell types (

Second, while type I and III ISG repertoires generally overlap, IFN-III signaling leads to a more sustained expression of ISGs (
