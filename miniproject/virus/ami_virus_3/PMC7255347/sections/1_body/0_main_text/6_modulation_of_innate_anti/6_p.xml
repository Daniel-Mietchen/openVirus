<p id="p0075">Exogenous IFN may be sufficient to overcome HCoV suppression of the IFN response. Whereas most proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share greater than 90% amino acid identity, nsp3, ORF3b, ORF6—all of which antagonize IFN—have relatively low sequence homology (
 <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Lokugamage et al., 2020</xref>). ORF3b of SARS-CoV-2 contains a premature stop codon that results in a truncated protein. ORF6b, in addition to having only 69% homology with the SARS-CoV protein, is missing two amino acids at the C-terminal critical for the protein function (
