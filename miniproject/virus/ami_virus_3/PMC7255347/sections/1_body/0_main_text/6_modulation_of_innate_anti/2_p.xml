<p id="p0055">First, HCoVs encode viral proteins dedicated to evading innate recognition by PRRs. SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses replicate in the interior of double membrane vesicles to prevent RLR activation by dsRNA replication intermediates (
 <xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Stertz et al., 2007</xref>). RLRs use the 5′ cap to distinguish viral RNA from host mRNA. SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) has guanine-N7-methyltransferase activity that can mimic this cap structure on the viral RNA (
 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2009</xref>). Nsp16 of SARS-CoV further modifies this cap with its 2’-O-methyl-transferase activity, allowing the virus to efficiently evade recognition by MDA5 (
 <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Daffis et al., 2010</xref>). SARS-CoV with a mutated nsp16 displays reduced virulence that is dependent on MDA5 sensing (
 <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Menachery et al., 2014b</xref>). Mutating nsp16 also attenuates virulence in MERS-CoV and reduces disease severity in infected mice (
 <xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Menachery et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, nsp16 is critical to alter the innate antiviral response in SARS and MERS. Nsp16 of SARS-CoV-2 and of SARS-CoV share 92% amino acid sequence homology, suggesting this evasion strategy is likely retained in the novel virus (
