<p id="p0050">Type I and type III IFNs induce hundreds of antiviral effectors, or ISGs, to achieve a cell-intrinsic state of viral resistance. Despite this powerful host antiviral strategy, coronaviruses remain highly pathogenic, at least in part due to the various viral mechanisms to evade and suppress the IFN response. Indeed, a more robust IFN-I response is induced in mild HCoV-229E infection compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections (
