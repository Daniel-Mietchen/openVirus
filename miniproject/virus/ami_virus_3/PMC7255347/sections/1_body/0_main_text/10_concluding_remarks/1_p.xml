<p id="p0140">In order to harness the IFN-mediated innate immune response as an antiviral therapy in COVID-19, we highlight a few research questions that have implications for therapy design and implementation. How can we make current IFN-I therapy more effective without adverse effects? The natural course of IFN-I signaling during SARS-CoV-2 infection needs to be defined. If we can understand the different kinetics of IFN-I secretion in mildly symptomatic and severe COVID-19 patients relative to the kinetics of viral replication, we may be able to identify the window of therapeutic opportunity. Based on the large existing body of work available, some of which we review here, early administration prior to viral peak or prophylactic treatment may offer maximal protection without appreciable pathology. We suggest several efforts that will help establish the feasibility as well as increase the versatility of IFN-I therapy. First, the prophylactic effects of IFNs that have been reported should be validated by randomized clinical trials. The intervention should be tested on healthcare workers and other individuals at risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Second, in order to administer IFN in the early stage of infection, robust public health measures including testing and contact tracing need to be established to rapidly identify those who have been exposed before symptom onset. Furthermore, investigating cellular targets that can limit or reverse IFN-I-associated inflammation will be valuable for potential therapeutic application with IFN-Is. Possible mechanisms include inhibiting inflammatory genes downstream of IFN-I signaling and promoting negative feedback of the IFN response. Finally, identifying host factors that lead to delayed or reduced IFN-I induction may instruct us on patient groups that may particularly benefit or should be refrained from IFN-I treatment. In addition to host age, genetic polymorphisms may affect IFN outcomes. For example, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) near the
