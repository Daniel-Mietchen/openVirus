<p id="p0145">How can we expand the treatment strategies that work by augmenting our natural antiviral response? One possibility is the use of synthetic PRR agonists to increase the induction of IFN response. Notably, poly(I:C), a double-strand RNA that can activate RLRs and TLR3, provides protection in two different mouse models of SARS-CoV infection (

 <xref rid="bib72" ref-type="bibr">Zhao et al., 2012</xref>). We have discussed in this review another promising target, the type III IFNs, as both a preventive and a therapeutic measure in COVID-19. Delineating spatiotemporally distinct roles of type I and III IFN response in SARS-CoV-2 infection will teach us when to preferentially use one or synergize the two responses. The IFN response is a complex host defense strategy that, with accurate understanding of its biology, can be translated into safe and effective antiviral therapies.
