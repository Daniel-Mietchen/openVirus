<p id="p0015">The interferon (IFN) response constitutes the major first line of defense against viruses. Recognition of viral infections by innate immune sensors activates type I and type III IFN response. Type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β, IFN-ε, IFN-κ, IFN-ω in humans) bind to the ubiquitously expressed type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) in an autocrine and paracrine manner. This activates a powerful antiviral defense program of hundreds of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), which have the capacity to interfere with every step of viral replication (
