<p id="p0035">The role of various PRRs in coronavirus infection has largely been elucidated by genetic studies that revealed increased susceptibility to the infection in the absence of specific PRRs and their signaling pathways. Since coronaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm, their replication intermediates and replicated viral genomes can be recognized by cytosolic RNA sensors, RIG-I and MDA5. Both RIG-I and MDA5 are involved in sensing of murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection; in their absence, IFN induction by MHV is abrogated (

RNA sensing TLRs, TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8, are located in the endosomal membrane and detect double-stranded RNA (dsRNA; TLR3) and single-stranded RNA (ssRNA; TLR7 and TLR8). TLR7 in particular plays a critical role in sensing of coronaviruses including SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MHV and is required for IFN-α production by plasmacytoid dendritic cells in these infections (
