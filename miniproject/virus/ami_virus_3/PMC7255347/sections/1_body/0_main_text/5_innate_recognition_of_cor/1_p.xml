<p id="p0030">The innate immune system recognizes invading pathogens by sensing their pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with various pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Viral PAMPs are often distinct molecular signatures not found in host cells, such as unique nucleic acid structures of the viral genome or viral replication intermediates (
 <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Iwasaki, 2012</xref>). RNA viral recognition occurs mainly in the endosomal or cytosolic compartment by two different classes of PRRs, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), respectively (

Additionally, certain ISGs, like OAS and IFIT family proteins, can also directly recognize and execute their function on viral RNA (
