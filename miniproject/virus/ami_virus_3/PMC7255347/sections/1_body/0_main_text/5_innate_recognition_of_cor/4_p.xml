<p id="p0045">Innate viral recognition triggers a signaling cascade leading to both NF-κΒ-mediated induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-α) and IRF3 and IRF7-mediated induction of type I and type III IFNs (IFN-I and IFN-III) (
 <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). Transcriptome profiling of various cell types revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection elicits very low IFN-I or IFN-III and limited ISG response, while inducing chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine genes (

In a macaque model of SARS-CoV infection, aged macaques had more lung pathology and higher expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines but lower expression of IFN-Is compared to younger macaques (

 <xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr">Molony et al., 2017</xref>). The defect in IFN induction in older monocytes was due to proteolytic degradation of TRAF3, a key signaling molecule downstream of many PRRs required for IFN transcription. These collectively suggest that the imbalance between pro-inflammatory versus IFN response in aging may have important disease implications for COVID-19 pathogenesis.
