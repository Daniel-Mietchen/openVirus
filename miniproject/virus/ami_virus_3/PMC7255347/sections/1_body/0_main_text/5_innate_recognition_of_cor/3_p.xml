<p id="p0040">Downstream adaptor protein molecules for TLRs, MyD88 (for TLR4, TLR7, TLR8) and TRIF (for TLR3, TLR4), are required for protection against coronavirus infections, indicating the essential role of innate sensing in host immunity. Mice deficient in MyD88 challenged with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV are unable to control viral replication and succumb to infection (
