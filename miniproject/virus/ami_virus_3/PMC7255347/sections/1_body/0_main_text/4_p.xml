 <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Lazear et al., 2019</xref>). Recombinant IFN-λs, although not yet approved for any indication, are in clinical trials for viral hepatitis. There is a worldwide interest in repurposing existing antivirals for COVID-19. In this regard, the biology of IFNs in coronavirus infection needs to be thoroughly examined in order to implement rational treatment strategies and safely evaluate their clinical efficacy in COVID-19. In this review, we first describe the IFN-mediated antiviral response in coronavirus infection, focusing on the innate recognition of and immune evasion by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we examine the role of type I and type III IFN response in SARS and MERS and speculate on the promise and challenges of using IFNs as a therapeutic agent in COVID-19.
