<p id="p0110">In contrast, clinical studies of SARS and MERS patients have been less conclusive. In a study of a small number of SARS patients, addition of IFN-α to corticosteroid was associated with better oxygen saturation and quicker resolution of radiographic lung abnormalities (

The inconsistent results in human studies may be explained to some degree by the limited number of patients in retrospective studies, drugs used in combinations, and importantly, timing of administration as we have discussed. Moreover, it has been suggested that comorbidities like diabetes affect the response to IFN (
