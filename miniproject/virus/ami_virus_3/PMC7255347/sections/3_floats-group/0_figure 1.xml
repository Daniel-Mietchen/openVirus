  <p>Innate Recognition, Interferon Signaling, and Immune Evasion by Coronaviruses</p>
  <p>Upon sensing of coronaviruses by various pathogen recognition receptors, TLRs (TLR3, TLR4, TLR7, TLR8; blue) and RLRs (RIG-I, MDA5; purple), transcription factors nuclear factor-κΒ (NF-κB) and interferon regulatory factor 3 and 7 (IRF3, IRF7) stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I and III interferons (IFNs), respectively. IFNs are secreted in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) via the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. While type I and III IFNs induce a similar set of ISGs, type I IFN signaling activates a stronger and faster ISG response, in addition to expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Many viral proteins encoded by coronaviruses (red: SARS-CoV, green: MERS-CoV, black: multiple human coronaviruses) antagonize various steps of this antiviral response.</p>
