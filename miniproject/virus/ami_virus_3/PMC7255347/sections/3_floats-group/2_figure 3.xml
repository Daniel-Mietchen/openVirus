  <p>Therapeutic Aims with Type I and Type III IFNs during the Progression of COVID-19</p>
  <p>(Α) Prophylactic intranasal administration or inhalation of recombinant IFNs, particularly type III IFNs (IFN-λ), can act to restrict viral replication in the upper airway, reducing viral spread to the lungs and transmission.</p>
  <p>(Β) When initial control fails and virus reaches the lung, the host may benefit from additional IFNs, including the more potent type I IFNs (IFN-α, IFN-β). Given that our natural IFN response may be lacking at this early stage, exogenous IFNs might help control infection and prevent viral dissemination.</p>
  <p>(C) In the late stage of the disease, IFNs must be used with caution to not exacerbate inflammation and tissue damage. IFN-λ could continue to activate localized antiviral protection without triggering a systemic response.</p>
