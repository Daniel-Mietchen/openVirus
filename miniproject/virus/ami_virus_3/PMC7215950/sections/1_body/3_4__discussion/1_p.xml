<p>Potential for human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV is considered low [
 <xref rid="B18-ijerph-17-02936" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Despite this, there have been sustained hospital outbreaks of MERS-CoV due to factors that favor viral transmission within hospital units. Several outbreak case reports have deduced the main reasons for the sustained hospital transmissions with contributing factors of patient comorbidity, patient age, crowded emergency rooms, lack of triage, unawareness of possible MERS-CoV infected patients, and varying levels of adherence to infectious control measures. Thus, the transmission factors of MERS-CoV resulting in healthcare outbreaks is certainly multifactorial. Crowded emergency departments are not uncommon in hospital systems; in these situations, effective acute respiratory infection (ARI) screening is vital to determine patient priority and treatment. The lack of efficient system for bed management resulted in crowding due to boarding within the ED. Other studies conducted in Seoul, Korea and in Saudi Arabia (Jeddah and Riyadh) cite the inadequacy of triage conducted prior to the outbreaks [
