<p>In contrast to conventional, deterministic modeling approaches, the model described herein is both multi-type and spatial. It incorporates environmental and human behavior variables through time and space that impact disease transmission within multiple hospital wards. The model outputs were validated by comparing actual data to modeled proportions. The underlying SEIR-ward model for KAMC confirms the importance of including additional spatial-specific characteristics to replicate transmission and super spreading events of infectious disease transmission occurring in different hospital wards. That would assist in identifying the most infectious ward. It also quantifies the role of the different individuals in the disease spread. The small number of people in each ward and state might be a problem when using a deterministic model and a stochastic model is warranted; however, the strength of the disease without the control measures was a main factor in our selection.</p>
