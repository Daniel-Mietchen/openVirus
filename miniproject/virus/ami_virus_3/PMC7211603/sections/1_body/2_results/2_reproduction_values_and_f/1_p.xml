 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref> A. Using the SI value mentioned above, we estimated the maximum likelihood (ML) of reproduction value was 1.852 (0.6–2.3) with 95% of CI on virus outbreak in early phases (

 <xref rid="fig0025" ref-type="fig">Figure 5</xref>C. Besides, we also computed the reproduction values of individual provinces based on case incidences by maintaining similar SI. The ML of R median value for Pesaro and Urbano, Ancona, Fermo, Ascoli Piceno, and Macerata was achieved 2.492 (1.1–4.5), 2.162 (1.0–4.0), 1.512 (0.75–2.75), 1.141 (1.0–1.6), and 1.792 (1.0–3.5) with 95% of CI respectively (
