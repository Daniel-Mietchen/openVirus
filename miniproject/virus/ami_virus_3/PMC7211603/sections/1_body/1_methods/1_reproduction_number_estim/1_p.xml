<p id="par0060">Marche region is a part of the central Italy, and is enclosed with five individual provinces of Ancona, Ascoli Piceno, Fermo, Macerata, and Pesaro, and Urbino. We computed R
 <sub>t</sub> values of each province based confirmed cases, and the data retrieved with daily basis that published from Italian health ministry (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Ministero della Salute, 17 April 2020</xref>). To estimate the early virus transmission and forecasting among the Marche, we employed the ‘incidence’ and ‘projections’ package of R statistics. This particular package implements a simple, probability-based prediction of R
 <sub>t</sub> with the help of branching process couples with Poisson likelihood. The adopted model requires knowledge of serial interval distribution over symptom onset dates. Transmissibility is defined by weighting R
 <sub>0</sub> with the likelihood of SI mass function of a corresponding day (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Cori et al., 2013</xref>). Usually when R
 <sub>0</sub> &gt; 1, the infection might spread over the population to a large extent, and more efforts are needed to control the pandemic. R
 <sub>t</sub> is the average of secondary cases infected from the single infected individual if conditions remain the same as at time t (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Fraser, 2007</xref>). For R
 <sub>t</sub> estimation, assumption of mean and serial interval (i.e., the delay between primary and secondary symptom onset dates) parameters was done. Since in the absence of sufficient information on cluster outbreak for SI estimation, we assumed SI of Marche region was equal to that of the COVID-19 Lombardy region with a mean of 6.6 days and a standard deviation of 3.1 days (
 <xref rid="bib0090" ref-type="bibr">Riccio, 2020</xref>). We evaluated individual R
 <sub>t</sub> values for over five individual provinces with maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation. The function get_R was used to estimate the most likelihood of R
 <sub>t</sub> values. To derive the other statistics, we used sample_R with a bootstrap strategy of 1000 times re-sampling to get a large sample of likely R
 <sub>t</sub> values.
