<p id="par0080">To evaluate the case projections, we applied both incidence and projection R packages to find out daily incidence outbreaks, and case forecasting. We simulated future incidences using a branching process model that respects the renewal equation of (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Fraser, 2007</xref>), assumes that Poisson offspring distribution was used for inference. For its simplicity, we implemented a simple linear regression method that can be used to fit the exponential growth of infected incidences over time and applied linear regression over the incidence data. Between the developing and diminishing periods of a pandemic, the date represents the epidemic peak can be assessed. We implemented function estimate peak () with multinomial bootstrapping to caluculate the total number of known cases, and bootstrap never samples zero-frequency days. This function restores the estimated peak of confidence interval (CI) along with the bootstrap forecasts. We built the incidence objects by loading the incidence function, on the date of onset variable with the argument of the default interval because we considered the daily incidence. We the applied the R projection package for epidemic trajectories simulation and to predict daily and cumulative incidence. The prediction model was done by considering existing of daily incidence data, estimated reproductive number, and serial interval distribution using a discrete package. We performed the prediction of daily as well as cumulative incidence for the next 30 days (from April 20 to May 20, 2020) by using bootstrap resampling (1000 times). Besides, we presented both daily, and cumulative incidences range by graph for the next 30 days. Finally, we employed the R statistics software version 3.6.2 for model development as well as statistical analysis.
