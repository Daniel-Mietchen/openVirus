<p id="par0050">The daily virus reproduction number (R
 <sub>t</sub>) is in a purpose to understand the transmission rates of a new virus epidemics and often encountered in public health literature. Serial interval (SI) is the duration between the onset symptom of initial case and onset symptom of the second case in the transmission chain. In the early virus epidemic at Wuhan center, the mean SI of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3–19), and R
 <sub>t</sub> was estimated to 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4–3.9) in
