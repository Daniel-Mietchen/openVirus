<p id="par0055">In this study, we focused on calculating the daily reproduction number R
 <sub>t</sub> in Marche (Italy) region and established a predictive model for the next thirty days. The Marche region is the 8th in terms of number of people infected in Italy and the first in terms of diffusion of the infection among the 4 regions of the center of Italy. Understanding the dynamics of early transmission and assessment ineffectiveness of mitigation measures is important to evaluate the potential of sustained transmission occurred among other cities of the Marche region. Individual R
 <sub>t</sub> values of all five provinces in Marche were computed and compared. This study highlights the knowledge discovery of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in disease transmission, and the necessity of mitigation measures to control.
