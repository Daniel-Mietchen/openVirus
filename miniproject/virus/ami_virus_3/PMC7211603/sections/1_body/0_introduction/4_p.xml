<p id="par0040">However, R
 <sub>0</sub> is the one of the important characteristics of epidemic that may interest to public health bodies and governance to formulate possible preventive measures. For instance, after imposition of the mitigation measures like social distancing, home quarantine in China has largely controls the COVID-19 disease spread and growth rates become negative in most locations (

 <sub>0</sub> (=2.5) in China, many experts believed that from 20 to 60% of global population could infected (

 <sub>0</sub>, eventually reduce the COVID-19 epidemic. In addition, government measures including immediate quarantine of potentially infected patients, household isolation, and eventual lockdown among high hitting cities (as did in Italy) could mitigate this epidemic. In this study, we estimate virus reproduction numbers by fitting exponential infection growth rates across both daily and weekly basis, also forecasting done by using day to day assessment though single observations.
