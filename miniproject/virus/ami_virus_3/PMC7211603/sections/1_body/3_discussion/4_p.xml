<p id="par0115">The overall transmission rate in Marche was calculated as 1.852 during exponential growth of the epidemic and indicates that each infected individual can cause virus distribution to two members. The COVID-19 outbrerak in Wuhan, China estimated median R
 <sub>t</sub> value is between 2.2 and 2.7 (

 <sub>t</sub> estimated as 1.5 which is the lowest possible value that appeared in north Asian countries (

Similar to this, the Rt was slightly started to decayed since the last weeks of March. To estimate the maximum likelihood of R
 <sub>t</sub> of Marche, we adopted a bootstrapping method over 1000 resamples that evaluated from 0.6 to 2.3 (95% CI).
