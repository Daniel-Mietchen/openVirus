<p id="par0120">Besides, we computed the R
 <sub>t</sub> values of individual provinces of Marche with the exponential growth (EG) method. In EG, R
 <sub>t</sub> can be calculated as the transformation of exponential growth, which estimated by the Poisson regression model over the exponential growth of an outbreak, below the assumption of gamma distribution of time generation (

 <sub>t</sub> was 2.492 (1.1–4.5) for Pesaro and Urbano, 2.162 (1.0–4.0) for Ancona, 1.792 (1.0–3.5) for Macerata, 1.512 (0.75–2.75) for Fermo, and 1.141 (1.0–1.6) for Ascoli Piceno. This kind of analysis was also observed by calculating transmissibility monitoring among European countries and achieved R
 <sub>t</sub> of 3.27 [3.17–3.38] for Italy, 5.08 [4.51–5.74] for Spain, 6.07 [5.51–6.69] for Germany, and 6.32 [5.72–6.99] for France with EG methods (
