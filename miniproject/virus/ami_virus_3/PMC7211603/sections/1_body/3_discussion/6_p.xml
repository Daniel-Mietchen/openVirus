<p id="par0125">We also conducted forecasting daily incidences and cumulative incidences of Marche outbreak for the next thirty days. It is evident from the study, the outbreak size and daily incidence largely depend on the daily reproductive number. However, we perform projections with R
 <sub>t</sub> remains unchanged, the daily incidences can be varied with the distinct percentile of inhabitants. The projections concluded that at the end of the 30th day the cumulative incidences 323 (95% CI), and daily incidences 45 (95% CI) might be reached. These values might be gradually reduced if local governance stops transmissibility of the virus by putting continuous efforts on contact tracing, and identifying symptomatic and asymptomatic cases. This analysis highlights the importance of controlling transmissibility among Marche inhabitants. Our study has some limitations. Primarily, because of the non-availability of information on the cluster outbreak, we adopted the values of SI, and the standard deviation in R
 <sub>t</sub> estimation from the study on Lombardy, which might hamper the importance of this analysis. Second, general patients are forcing in confined to home, could affects the natural process of disease transmission. Finally, the present analysis was conducted based on the extracted data of Italian national Health Ministry, a hindrance in case reporting or case confirmation the computed R
 <sub>t</sub> could be underestimated.
