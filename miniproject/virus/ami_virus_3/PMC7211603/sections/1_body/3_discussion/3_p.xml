<p id="par0110">We calculated virus transmission rates (R
 <sub>t</sub>) of different provinces in Marche. R
 <sub>t</sub> does not only measure the inherent infectiousness of disease and also depends on different factors including contact rates among the city population and longevity of contagious period, and it can be varied with the city to city. Though R
 <sub>t</sub> can valuable concept in the hands of experts, but the procedure of defining, interpreting, and applying is away from straightforward. Because of its simple nature towards infectious disease dynamics covers the difficulty of this metric. Since due to the availability of insufficient information about cluster cases to identify serial distribution, estimating R in this study had become complex. As of this, we made assumptions with a mean serial interval of 6.6 days and a standard deviation of 3.1 days what had been observed in Lombardy, Italy which was the worst COVID-19 outbreak region.
