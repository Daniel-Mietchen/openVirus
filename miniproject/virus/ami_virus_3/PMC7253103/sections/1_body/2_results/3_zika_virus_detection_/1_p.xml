<p>ZIKV RT-qPCR data, for experiments performed on RNA directly extracted and extracted after loading on RDT for ZIKV dilutions 10
 <sup>−2</sup>–10
 <sup>−8</sup>, are presented in 
 <xref rid="t4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The LOD for RNA extraction from RDT was 10
 <sup>−6</sup>, as compared with 10
 <sup>−7</sup> for direct virus extraction. For all dilutions (except for the one at the LOD), standard deviation (SD) of Cq from triplicate RDTs was ≤ 0.37; a similar result was observed for direct extraction with SD from 0.13 to 0.27 (excluding dilution at the LOD). This is indicative of good reproducibility of ZIKV RT-qPCR from RDTs.
