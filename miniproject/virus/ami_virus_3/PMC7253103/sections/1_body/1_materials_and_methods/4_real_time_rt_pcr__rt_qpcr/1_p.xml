 <sup>™</sup> III Platinum
 <sup>®</sup> One-Step qRT-PCR kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used, following the manufacturer’s instruction, using 400 nM of each primer, 160 nM of probe, and 5 µL of extract in 25 µL reaction volume. Thermal cycling used was as follows: 15 minutes at 50°C, 2 minutes at 95°C, and 45 cycles (15 seconds at 95°C and 45 seconds at 60°C). For each tested virus, all samples were tested on the same plate.
