<p>Zika virus (H/PF/2013, EVA 001v-EVA1545)– and CHIKV (H20235/STMARTIN/2013, EVA 001v-EVA1540)–inactivated strains provided by the European Virus Archive collection (

Following RDT manufacturer instructions for NS1 testing, 100 µL of each virus dilution was loaded on the NS1 cassette of RDTs in triplicate and left for 2 hours for the specimen to dry. Each RDT was then opened, and a 15-mm strip piece was cut out from the sample pad, as described.
