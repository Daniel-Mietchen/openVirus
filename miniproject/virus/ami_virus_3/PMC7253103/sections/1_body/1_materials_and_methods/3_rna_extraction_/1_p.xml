 </sup> each RDT strip fragment was incubated in 200 µL of ATL lysis buffer (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 15 minutes at 56°C; 140 µL was then extracted using QIAamp Virus RNA Mini kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer’s instruction (elution in 60 µL). As reference, 140 µL of each virus dilution, in triplicate, was also directly extracted contemporaneously, to be tested alongside the RDT extract.
