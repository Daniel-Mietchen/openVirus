<p id="Par10">Neurointensivists are forewarned and may be the first ones encountering patients seriously affected by pandemics causes by respiratory viruses. Editors of journals may be forewarned too [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. With any new pandemic, new neurologic observations appear rapidly, and there is a rush to publish, but cases clouded by ambivalent evidence may not show the necessary reservation in claiming causality [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Some associations are entirely expected [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. With the recent SARS-COVID-19, we can expect reports of a number of associated neurologic illnesses, some that have been seen previously—but more incidentally—in unusual respiratory viral outbreaks with unusual viruses and not necessarily pandemics. Undoubtedly, respiratory viruses damage the central and peripheral nervous system, but other (patient or iatrogenic) factors may play a role. New inactivated live vaccines are not innocuous and may cause serious side effects if poorly manufactured or inadequately tested.
