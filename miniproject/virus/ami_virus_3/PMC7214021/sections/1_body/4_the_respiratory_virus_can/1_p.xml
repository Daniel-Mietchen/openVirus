The A/VN/1203/04 H5N1 influenza strain preferentially targets the basal ganglia but also affects the brainstem and midbrain, which have the locus ceruleus and substantia nigra, structures that degenerate in Parkinson’s disease [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The syndrome was seen as early as 1916, well before the Spanish flu pandemic emerged. One thing it taught us was that stupor could be caused through thalamomesencephalic lesions (necrosis and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate) and, in some patients, hypothalamic involvement. In its acute presentation, patients experienced a gradual onset of nondescript flu-like symptoms, malaise, low-grade fever, pharyngitis, shivering, headache, vertigo, and vomiting. Respiratory symptoms occurred but were more likely central rhythm abnormalities and not from upper respiratory catarrh. Severity varied, but the “somnolent-ophthalmoplegic” form or oculomotor cranial nerve palsies alone were most common as well as involuntary forced eye movements (oculogyric crises, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Post-encephalitic parkinsonism presented with catatonia. The proportion of patients who developed this post-encephalitic catatonic stupor was comparatively small, although hundreds of descriptions exist (certainly not the millions claimed by Oliver Sacks in his book 
 <italic>Awakenings</italic>.) The manifestations occurred after an interval, even years after the infection, and, in over 75% of the survivors, in 5–10 years. The quasi-temporal relationship with the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic suggested an association, but without a clear etiological argument for or against, the relationship remains questionable [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Vilensky who had access to patient material concluded, “although the findings in the majority of studies refute the influenza hypothesis, this etiology would provide a convenient explanation for the disappearance of encephalitis lethargica because the influenza strains that caused the 1918 influenza epidemic left human circulation sometime before 1933” [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some still attributed the cause of this disorder to a flu variant (
 <italic>Kopfgripp</italic>e), but the cause remains a mystery. Foley, who studied the disorder in great historical detail, stoutly denied any connection [
