<p id="p0040">The other vaccine that was evaluated in humans was a SARS recombinant plasmid DNA vaccine encoding the SARS spike glycoprotein (
 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Martin et al., 2008</xref>) designed, produced, and evaluated at the Vaccine Research Center, National Institutes of Health. An open-label study of the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity was conducted in 10 subjects, aged 21–49 years, who received three doses 28 days apart. The vaccine was administered by injection into the deltoid muscle using a Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System. The vaccine was previously shown to be highly effective in preclinical studies (
 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). Mild injection site and systemic symptoms were reported, but no moderate or severe adverse events were reported. SARS-spike-protein-specific ELISA antibody responses were detected in 8 of the 10 subjects, and neutralizing antibody responses were detected with a pseudotyped lentiviral vector reporter neutralization assay in 8 of the 10 subjects, at one or more time points. Titers peaked between weeks 8 and 12, with detectable antibody in 6 subjects at week 32. However, neutralizing antibodies were not detected in an infectious virus assay. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses to the spike protein were detected in all 10 subjects and CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cell responses were detected in 2 of 10 subjects; these responses followed the same kinetics as the pseudovirus neutralization assay.
