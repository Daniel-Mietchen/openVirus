<p id="p0045">Neither of these vaccines nor any of the numerous SARS vaccines that showed promise in preclinical studies were tested further because SARS did not re-emerge. However, the experience is relevant to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Vaccine development efforts for SARS progressed rapidly but the pace for COVID-19 is much faster. The first clinical trials of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines began within 4Â months of the first report of the new virus. Notably, phase 1 clinical trials have been undertaken without prior demonstration of vaccine efficacy in a preclinical model. The absence of an animal model for COVID-19 disease juxtaposed against the urgency of the rapid spread of the pandemic has altered the conventional sequence of vaccine evaluation.</p>
