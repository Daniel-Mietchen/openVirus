<p id="p0055">We used a creative approach to demonstrate that hamsters were affected by SARS-CoV infection; a Nalgene activity wheel (Nalge Nunc International, Rochester, NY) equipped with a magnetic switch and an LCD counter that records revolutions was placed in the hamster cages overnight. The average number of revolutions/h that the hamsters ran on the wheel was recorded. Baseline activity level for hamsters was between 700 and 1,000 revolutions/h and decreased by 10-fold or more, to 61 ± 23 revolutions/h following infection with SARS-CoV, returning to normal at 9 to 10 days post-infection (

In the absence of a disease model, the ability of a candidate vaccine to elicit a neutralizing antibody response against infectious virus associated with restricted replication of challenge virus in the respiratory tract should be demonstrated. Concerns about the safety of coronavirus vaccines were raised with SARS and are now being discussed with SARS-CoV-2. Efforts are underway to design studies in animal models and to develop clinical case definitions to identify vaccine-associated adverse events if they occur.
