<p id="p0050">First, the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can and should be demonstrated in laboratory animals such as mice, hamsters, ferrets, or non-human primates. Second, protective efficacy should be assessed in animal models that support replication of SARS-CoV-2, ideally with associated clinical signs of disease. Early reports suggest that human ACE-2 expressing mice, hamsters (
