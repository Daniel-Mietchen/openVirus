<p id="p0010">When mice were infected intranasally with SARS-CoV, virus replication was detected in their upper and lower respiratory tract (

The mice that recovered from primary infection were protected from reinfection, and, importantly, passive transfer of serum from the mice that recovered from primary infection to naive mice conferred protection from challenge (
