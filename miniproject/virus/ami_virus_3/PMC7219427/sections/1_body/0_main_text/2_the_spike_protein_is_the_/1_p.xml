<p id="p0020">In an elegant experiment, Buchholz et al. demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV is the sole structural protein of SARS-CoV that is necessary and sufficient to induce a neutralizing antibody response and protection from challenge (

They engineered each structural protein of SARS-CoV-2 alone and in combination, into a bovine-human parainfluenza virus type 3 (BHPIV3) vaccine vector, immunized golden Syrian hamsters, and challenged them with SARS-CoV. The hamsters that were immunized with the spike protein alone or combinations of proteins that included the spike protein developed a neutralizing antibody response and were protected from infection on subsequent challenge (
