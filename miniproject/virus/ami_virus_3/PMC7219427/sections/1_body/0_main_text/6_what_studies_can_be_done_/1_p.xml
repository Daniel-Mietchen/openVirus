<p id="p0060">First, the neutralizing antibody response in recovered patients should be characterized, including the average titers after asymptomatic, mild, and severe disease as well as titers in different age groups, kinetics, and longevity of neutralizing antibody. The presence of cross-reactive antibodies against human coronaviruses may differ in different age groups. This information will help us place vaccine studies in context and in comparison to the inactivated SARS vaccine from China, which was immunogenic but achieved post-vaccination titers that were half those seen in convalescent patients (

Human sera from recovered patients with a range of neutralizing antibody titers can be pre-administered to a SARS-CoV-2 animal model, followed by challenge infection. The ability of human serum of a specific titer to prevent productive infection in the animal can identify a target titer for vaccines.
