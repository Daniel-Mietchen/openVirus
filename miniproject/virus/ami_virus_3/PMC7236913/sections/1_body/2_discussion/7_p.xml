<p id="P11">To date, this case report may be the first documented case of COVID-19 associated ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Due to the novel nature of this virus, we feel that surveillance for STEMI associated with the virus is warranted. As of this point, there is not a clear pathophysiological mechanism to account for STEMI, only theorized mechanisms derived from past coronavirus and influenza epidemics. We hope that further case reports, cohort studies and autopsy data can further our understanding of this disease.</p>
