<p id="P6">The emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic since its discovery in Wuhan, China in late 2019. It is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is a single stranded enveloped RNA virus. [
 <xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Infection occurs by the binding of the virus spike protein to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor. [
 <xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] ACE 2 is found in the type II pneumocyte in the lung, which is theorized to be the main point of entry of the virus. The ACE2 Receptor is also found in the heart, where it antagonizes the effects of angiotensin 2 in diseases where neurohormonal dysregulation is present. [
