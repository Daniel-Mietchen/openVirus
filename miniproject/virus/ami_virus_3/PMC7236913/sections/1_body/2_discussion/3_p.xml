<p id="P7">In a cohort study of 416 patients who tested positive for COVID, Shi et al. [
 <xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] described evidence of myocardial injury in 82 patients (19.7%), as evidenced by elevated high sensitivity troponin I (TnI) levels. These patients had a significantly elevated in-hospital mortality rate (42 of 82 [51.2%]) compared to those who did not have biochemical evidence of myocardial injury (15 of 335 [4.5%]). In the group with myocardial injury, greater degrees of troponin elevation were associated with increased mortality.
