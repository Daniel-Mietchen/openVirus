<p id="P9">Studies from previous influenza and coronavirus epidemics have shown an association with viral infections and adverse cardiac outcomes, including acute coronary syndromes [

 <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and exacerbation of heart failure [
 <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The mechanism of myocardial injury during COVID-19 infection has been theorized to be multifactorial. Direct toxicity of the virus to cardiac myocytes, systemic inflammatory responses, destabilization of pre-existing coronary plaque and aggravated hypoxia are some of the predominating ideas behind mechanism of injury. [
