<p id="P8">A study by Guo et al. [
 <xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] reported that 27.8% of patients in a cohort of 187 patients. A significant difference within in-hospital mortality for patients with elevated troponin T levels (59.6%) as compared with patients with normal TnT (8.9%). The highest mortality rate was observed in the cohort with pre-existing cardiac disease and elevated troponin (25 of 36 [69.4%]). It was also found that elevated C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and N-terminal-pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were linked with elevated troponin t levels, suggesting a close interaction between inflammation and myocardial stress.
