<p>The King LT(S)-D laryngeal tube (King Systems, Noblesville, IN), abbreviated hereafter as the King LT, is a new-generation extraglottic device (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-wjem-21-542">Figure 1</xref>) used as a primary or backup airway device by many emergency medical systems systems. This device has been demonstrated to have advantageous attributes as compared to other extraglottic airway devices, with favorable safety outcomes and high rates of successful insertion.

 <xref rid="b7-wjem-21-542" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the King LT is not a definitive airway device and is not intended for long-term use. Additionally, the King LT has been associated with post-insertion airway edema, which, in addition to risk factors inherent to the patient, may further impede subsequent laryngoscopy attempts.

An endoscopic Seldinger-style technique for tracheal tube placement using an Arndt airway exchange catheter (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN) has been described.

Additionally, many emergency physicians may be unfamiliar with this approach or lack the necessary endoscopic equipment. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, emergency physicians need to have a straightforward, safe approach for definitive airway management in patients with a King-LT using airway equipment commonly found in the emergency department (ED).
