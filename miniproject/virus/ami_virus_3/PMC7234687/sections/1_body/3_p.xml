<p>In 2016, Dodd and colleagues introduced a novel, nonsurgical approach to facilitate definitive airway management in ED patients with a King LT in place.
 <xref rid="b10-wjem-21-542" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The authors described use of a standard-geometry video laryngoscope and bougie to intubate the trachea with the King LT device remaining in situ. A bougie is used, instead of initial intubation with a tracheal tube, given its smaller diameter and the inherent space limitation that the King LT imposes within the pharynx where the devices are manipulated. Furthermore, the on-screen visualized supraglottic region might be obscured as the larger endotracheal tube passage is attempted, while use of a bougie results in less obstruction of the visualized field. The authors reported a 99.8% success rate with this nonsurgical and non-endoscopic technique, and noted that in rare cases of failed intubation, the King LT remains in a functional position allowing for balloon reinflation and resumption of ventilation. A subsequent, proof-of-concept cadaveric study demonstrated similar (100%) first-pass success, although the authors acknowledged the potential for overestimation given the small sample size.
 <xref rid="b11-wjem-21-542" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This concept was demonstrated in real-world clinical practice in an observational study of 647 patients arriving to the ED with a prehospital-placed King LT.
 <xref rid="b12-wjem-21-542" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In this study 112 of 647 patients underwent intubation with the King LT left in place, with the balloons deflated, with first-attempt success in 102 (91%). Of the 10 patients with first-attempt failure, eight patients were intubated with the same technique on the second attempt; the remaining two were intubated with bougie facilitation after removing the King LT.
