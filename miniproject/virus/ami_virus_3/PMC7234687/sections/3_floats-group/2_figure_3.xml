  <p>Steps for tracheal intubation with the King LT in situ.</p>
  <p>A. After suspending ventilator at end-expiration, the clinician advances the video laryngoscope into the oropharynx, along the superior surface of the tongue (top) and anterior to the King LT (bottom). The oropharyngeal balloon can be visualized filling the screen.</p>
  <p>B. The King LT balloons are deflated, and blade is advanced into the vallecula, with arytenoid cartilages and vocal cords visualized on the screen.</p>
  <p>C. The clinician passes a bougie into the trachea, with visual confirmation and confirmation from feel of tracheal rings</p>
  <p>D. The tracheal tube is advanced over the bougie, utilizing a 90-degree counterclockwise rotation to avoid encountering the arytenoid cartilages.</p>
  <p>*After confirmation of tracheal intubation, the King LT is removed. If the procedure fails at any point, the King LT can be reinflated and used for oxygenation and ventilation.</p>
