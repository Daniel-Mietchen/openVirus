<p id="Par15">Although the LPMs closures were highly effective in preventing H7N9 viral infections in humans by substantially reducing human exposure to poultry, which has been proved by many previous studies [

Hence, there is an urgent need for dissemination of the optimal available scientific evidence on the effectiveness of LPMs closure to help policymakers reassess intervention strategy in future human outbreaks of influenza A (H7N9). The paper aims to quantify the effect of LPMs closure on H7N9 infection after adjustment of climate variables in various cities and the role of LPMs closure of different scale and duration, to provide more empirical evidences for policy-makers for the efficient control of H7N9.
