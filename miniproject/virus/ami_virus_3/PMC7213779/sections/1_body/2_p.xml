<p>It is well established the importance of psychosocial factors in development and maintenance of Temporomandibular Disorders (TMD) and the high prevalence of psychological disturbances in TMD patients, mainly in those who suffer from masticatory muscle disorders.

 </sup> Moreover, there is a significant relationship between painful TMD, depression, and anxiety.

 </sup> All psychological issues involved in emergency and threatening situations like the ones faced with COVID-19 pandemic are able to trigger a chain of events that culminate with higher levels of sympathetic activity and further release of adrenocortical steroids which lead to muscle vasoconstriction and increased peripheral vascular resistance. Feelings of warmth and cold, palpitations, tachycardia, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation can all be the consequences of autonomic stress responses.

 </sup> All these events are supposed to create/perpetuate a situation of system overloading, a common finding in TMD patients. The autonomic impairment may also lead to increased sympathetic drive and sensation of hyperarousal which create and perpetuate any sleep disturbance.

 </sup> If maintained, this cycle may play an important role in pain maintenance, especially in psychological vulnerable individuals. Hence, the occurrence of post-pandemic signs and symptoms of chronic orofacial pains, including TMD, is expected in a very similar pattern to well described posttraumatic stress syndrome.
