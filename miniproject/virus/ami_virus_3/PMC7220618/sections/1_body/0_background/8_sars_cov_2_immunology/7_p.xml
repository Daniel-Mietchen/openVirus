<p id="Par43">What we call “inflammation” is an orchestrated process and an accumulation of cellular and humoral immune competence at the site of the invaders´ presence to eliminate the pathogen. Hereby, we consciously accept the risk of damaging the “inflamed” organ by hyperinflammation. This process of “hyperinflammation” might be triggered by the so-called damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which result from the invaders´ cellular decomposition (pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPS) and trigger the inflammatory response of macrophages [
