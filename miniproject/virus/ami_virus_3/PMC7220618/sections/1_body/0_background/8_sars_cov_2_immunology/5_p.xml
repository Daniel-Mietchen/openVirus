<p id="Par41">There are four main subgroups of coronavirus, known as alpha, beta, gamma and delta. The virus is named for the crown-like spikes on its surface. It should be remembered that these spikes and all other viral structures represent different glycoproteins as epitopes for antigen-presenting cells (APC) (HLA class II), which are the important cells to initiate a classic immune response. If there are no correctly presented HLA class II peptide complexes presented by APC, there will be no initiation of an immune cascade by converting na√Øve immune cells into cognate ones.</p>
