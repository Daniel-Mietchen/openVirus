<p id="Par44">The different clinical outcomes of the SARS-CoV-2 infection with respect to morbidity and mortality may be explained by the different epitopes exposed by APC and the ethnic HLA signatures. As suggested by S.F. Bosten (personal communication) the severity of the infection in the USA may be due to the fact that some members of the SARS-CoV-2 subgroup are able to down-regulate HLA expression, and, therefore the affected patients are not protected anymore by building a sufficient immune competence against a virus-induced disease because of a pathogenic overload of the virus.</p>
