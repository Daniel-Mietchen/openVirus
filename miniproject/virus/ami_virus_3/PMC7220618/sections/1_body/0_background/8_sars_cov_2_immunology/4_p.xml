<p id="Par40">It seems very likely that the mild, moderate or severe clinical course depends on the balanced interplay of the adaptive immunity by activation followed by a regular and timely shutdown of the key players. This is to ensure that no cytokine storm syndrome can develop that causes hyperinflammation [

Therefore, most anesthesiologists vote to screen COVID-19 patients for hyperinflammation to determine which patients may benefit from immunosuppression to prevent them from reaching a severe or fatal clinical status. Very recently, this hyperinflammation—likely caused by a chaotic, overwhelming cytokine profile—was confirmed by Vaninov. For patients experiencing a COVID-19 cytokine storm, the outcome is likely to be fatal [
