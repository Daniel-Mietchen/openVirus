<p id="Par38">Recently, a case report was published reporting on the immune response of a COVID-19 patient with mild symptoms prior to recovery [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. This study measured an increase of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), follicular helper T cells (T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells), activated CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and immunoglobulins IgM and IgG antibodies that bound to coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 before the symptoms diminished. This diversity of immune responses peaked in the peripheral blood around day 7 to day 9—concomitantly with the clearance of the virus and the ASCs and the T
 <sub>FH</sub> cells were prominently present during convalescence (day 20). The authors also analyzed the co-expression of CD38 and HLA-DR, because these molecules are key elements for the activation of CD8-positive T-cells to fight against virus-infected cells. This part of the innate immune system increased also between days 7 and day 9 and declined again by day &lt; 20 after infection [
