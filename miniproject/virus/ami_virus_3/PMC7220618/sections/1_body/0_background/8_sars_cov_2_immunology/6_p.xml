<p id="Par42">The HLA signature is unique for each individual and therefore the presentation of epitopes from any invader is individual tooâ€”together with an individual danger signal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the way the immune system is activated is unique and depends on the signature and the invader [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is more than likely that the different HLA-expression signatures within different ethnic groups in the world are the pillars how aggressively and sufficiently an individual organism attacks or even ignores an invader, like SARS-CoV-2.
