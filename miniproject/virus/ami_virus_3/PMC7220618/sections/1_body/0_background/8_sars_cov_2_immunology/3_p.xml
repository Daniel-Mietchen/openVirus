<p id="Par39">This case report shows very nicely that the immune system responds classically in a T cell-dependent manner prior to convalescence, because virus epitopes must have been presented within the HLA-DR of antigen-presenting cells (APC) (HLA class II) together with an appropriate pro-inflammatory cytokine profile that is regulated and segregated by helper T-cells. Furthermore, due to the appearance of activated CD8-positive cells, these cells must have been transformed into a cognate status by the HLA I presented virus-derived epitopes, which are expressed on infected soma cells (e.g., epithelial and alveolar cells of the respiratory tract); when cognate, these CD8-positive cells destroy and clear the virus-infected cells and thereby mitigate the virus load. Zhe Xu et al. published a case report describing the pathological findings in a COVID-19 patient with severe symptoms [

They also described—this is interesting to compare their report with that of a patient with mild symptoms—a hyperactive status of CD8-positive cells, which is evidenced by the proportions of HLA-DR and CD38 double-positive staining fractions. Moreover, there was an increased concentration of highly pro-inflammatory CCR6-positive and Th17-subpopulation in the CD4 T-helper cell fraction. The authors conclude that overactivation of adaptive T-cells, manifested by an increase of Th17-cells and highly cytotoxic CD8-positive T-cells accounts, at least in part, for the severe immune injury in this patient. It is noteworthy that both case reports did not describe that natural killer cells are partner within this cellular defense game. However, both patients did show exhausting T-cells, which was confirmed by Moon C [
