However, it is necessary to recapitulate how the immune system works, considering the complexity of the interactions between the innate and adaptive immune system. In addition, the immune system needs some time to build up and specifically shape an armada of immunocompetent cells and humoral defense molecules—e.g., antibodies, pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, complement system—to protect us individually from diseases. The innate immunity is the first line of defense from an evolutionary point of view. However, in contrast to an adaptive immune response, the receptors are strictly focused for limited reactions.
