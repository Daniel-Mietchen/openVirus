<p id="Par29">SARS-CoV-2 is a new pathogen to which humans of all ages have no immunity and are generally susceptible to infection. The virus is a new coronavirus that poses a global threat and imposes unprecedented burdens on healthcare providers and the healthcare system. Up to now, there is no specific vaccine or effective antiviral therapy against COVID-19 disease. From an immunological point of view, collected IgM and IgG antibodies from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, increase the chance to obtain neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) as therapeutic against the virus. Passive immunization is an alternative treatment strategy and could here experience a clinical renaissance until vaccines or antiviral medications become available. Especially for high-risk groups like very old people or cancer patients it could be a therapeutic option. New technologies and test systems enable us now to understand better the mechanisms in comparison to 1901, which finally can cure our patients.</p>
