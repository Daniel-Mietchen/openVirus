<p id="Par50">Meanwhile there are indications that the outcomes of COVID-19 infection in patients with cancer are more severe [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. In a retrospective cohort study from Wuhan, Zhang et al. reported in the 
 <italic>Annals of Oncology</italic> the clinical characteristics and outcomes of COVID-19 patients. His team analyzed the infection in 28 patients with cancer from three hospitals in Wuhan, China. They found that these patients were at high risk for severe events with a higher mortality rate [

They recommend that cancer patients receiving anti-cancer treatments should have dynamic screening for COVID-19 infection and should avoid treatments causing immunosuppression or have their dosages reduced in case of COVID-19 co-infection. Accordingly, investigations have been initiated in Germany to analyze the incidence and prevalence of SARS-Cov-2 infections in cancer patients. One idea could be to conduct randomized trials and test if passive immunization is a valid treatment option for cancer patients before they undergo radio-chemotherapy or immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Especially leukemia patients have a high risk for poor clinical outcome upon CoV-2 infection [

Organ-transplanted individuals require lifelong immunosuppression and are at risk to develop fatal COVID-19. Nevertheless, first observations have been published where organ-transplanted patients (liver and kidney) survived COVID-19 infection, though some problems such as rejection occurred. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] There are currently no data available about a clinical benefit of passive immunization, though translation of current knowledge for organ transplant patients seems to favor for this treatment. This strategy seems to be even more important knowing that 72% of US centers have suspended live donor kidney transplantation and 68% live donor liver transplantation [
