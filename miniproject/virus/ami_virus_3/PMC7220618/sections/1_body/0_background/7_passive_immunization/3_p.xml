<p id="Par32">Shen C. and co-workers from China were the first who reported that convalescent plasma could be a treatment option for COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure. They reported their success with this approach in JAMA earlier this year [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. One problem of this report is that all patients received antiviral medications and steroids before receiving their convalescent plasma. The latter treatment was performed as compassionate use as no other treatment therapy worked. Therefore, their results are very difficult to interpret. A few days later after this initial report, a case report from Korea showed that 2 elderly patients improved after the application of convalescent plasma. They published their results in a Korean journal [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One of the two patients was a 71-year-old man with no underlying medical conditions who was initially treated with malaria drugs and needed respiratory support for severe pneumonia. His condition improved when he was treated with convalescent plasma of a patient in his 20 s, along with steroids. The second patient, a 67-year-old female, did not respond to initial treatments including chloroquine, remdesivir, and oxygen therapy. She began to recover after receiving plasma therapy and steroids at the same time.
