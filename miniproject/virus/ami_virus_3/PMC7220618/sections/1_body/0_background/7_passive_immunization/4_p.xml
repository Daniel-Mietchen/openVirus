<p id="Par33">The largest report on patients treated with convalescent plasma is also from China [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Duan et al. reported their results in the 
 <italic>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</italic>. They enrolled prospectively 10 seriously ill patients with confirmed Sars-CoV-2 infection by real-time PCR in a clinical trial. A dose of 200 mL non-cryopreserved convalescent plasma derived from recently recovered patients with specific neutralizing antibody titers above 1:640 was transfused in addition to maximal supportive care and antiviral agents. The primary endpoint was the safety of convalescent plasma transfusion. Their second clinical endpoints were the improvement of clinical symptoms and normalization of laboratory parameters within 3 days after convalescent plasma transfusion. Their prospective trial showed that convalescent plasma therapy was well tolerated and could potentially improve the clinical outcomes through neutralizing viremia in severe COVID-19 cases.
