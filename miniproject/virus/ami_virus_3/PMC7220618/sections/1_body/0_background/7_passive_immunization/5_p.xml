<p id="Par34">A very recent report from Wuhan enrolled 6 COVID-19 patients in their case study, receiving 1–3 convalescent plasma infusions at d32 to d59 after onset of symptoms. In this case study, the convalescent plasma infusions were well tolerated also. Five patients with radiological lung finding (4 oxygenized) recovered and were PCR negative or discharged after 4–10 days after plasma infusion [
