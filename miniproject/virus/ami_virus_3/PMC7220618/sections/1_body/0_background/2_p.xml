<p id="Par25">Passive immunotherapy is a very old procedure. The immunologist Emil von Behring introduced passive immunization in 1890 by developing a cure for diphtheria and tetanus using antibodies isolated from horse blood. Von Behring received the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1901 for his work. This approach was successfully used in other major epidemics, such as the Spanish flu in 1918, the measles epidemic in 1934 in the United States, more recently during the Middle East MERS epidemic in 2012, and against Ebola in 2015. This review describes the recent data concerning passive immunization against SARS-CoV-2 and whether this method could serve as a promising therapy option for patients until effective drugs or a vaccine are available.</p>
