<p id="P7">To assess the impact of mosquito refeeding on vector competency for other arboviruses, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were orally-exposed to dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2) and CHIKV and then given a second bloodmeal. As with ZIKV, the proportion of mosquitoes with disseminated infections for both DENV-2 (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1e</xref>) and CHIKV (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1f</xref>) were significantly increased compared to single-feed controls. The increased dissemination rates associated with double-feeding resulted in a higher proportion of mosquitoes transmitting CHIKV to mice (
 <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1h</xref>). This demonstrates that the serial feeding behavior of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> enhances transmission of taxonomically diverse arboviruses and suggests that the mechanisms mediating this observation may be applicable to other virus-mosquito pairings. To evaluate whether our findings were unique to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, we tested ZIKV rates of dissemination in a low-generation (F
 <sub>5</sub>) colony of 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> which also refeeds within a single gonotrophic cycle

 </sup>. Similar to 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>, administration of a second non-infectious bloodmeal increased dissemination rates in 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> (
 <xref rid="F7" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 3</xref>). These findings suggest that under field conditions of frequent feeding, 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> are more competent and could have contributed more to transmission during the ZIKV epidemic than previously thought.
