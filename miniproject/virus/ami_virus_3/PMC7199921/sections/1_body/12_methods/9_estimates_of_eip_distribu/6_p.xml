<p id="P33">We observed a large variability among studies in the literature on SGI rates over time (
 <xref rid="F13" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 9</xref>) that did not appear to be attributable to the following study characteristics: mosquito strain, viral strain, viral titer, temperature or humidity during mosquito rearing, or fresh versus frozen viral stock. Notably, we observed a close similarity in posterior estimates of the mean EIP based on the dissemination and salivary gland data for both our experimental data and the meta-analysis (
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S2</xref>). Based on these observations, as well as the fact that published studies exhibited more consistency in estimating dissemination rates (
 <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3a</xref>), and we had considerably more experimental data points to fit to the model for dissemination to legs/wings than to the salivary glands, we chose to focus our subsequent analysis exclusively on the dissemination data.
