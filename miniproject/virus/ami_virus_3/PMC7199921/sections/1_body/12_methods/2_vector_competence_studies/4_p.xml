<p id="P20">Infection rates were determined and reported as follows. Midgut infection (MGI) rate represents the total number of virus-positive bodies divided by the total number of mosquitoes tested. Similarly, disseminated infection (DI) rates were determined by dividing the total number of virus-positive legs by the total number of virus-positive bodies. Transmission rates were calculated by dividing the total number of virus-positive salivary secretions or virus-positive recipient mice by the total number of virus-positive bodies.</p>
