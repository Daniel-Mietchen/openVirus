 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> and 
 <italic>Ae. albopictus</italic> mosquitoes, 7–10 days post emergence, were offered an infectious bloodmeal containing a 1:1 mixture of defibrinated sheep’s blood and virus. After feeding, mosquitoes were cold-anesthetized and engorged females were transferred into two 32 oz. ice cream cartons containing a small cup with an egg-laying paper and housed in a 27°C environmental chamber. Mosquitoes had access to 10% sucrose sugar meals during the incubation period. Ingestion of sucrose was shown to be diverted to the mosquito crop rather than the midgut and therefore, will have no expected impact on midgut expansion and basal lamina permeability
