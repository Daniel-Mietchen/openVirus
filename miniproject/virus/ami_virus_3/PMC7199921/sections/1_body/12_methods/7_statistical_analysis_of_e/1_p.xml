<p id="P26">The data were pooled from two to four independent replicates for each experiment involving mosquitoes. Statistical methods were not used to predetermine sample size. Differences in the proportion of mosquitoes with midgut, disseminated, or salivary gland infection were analyzed using Fisherâ€™s exact test. Standard error bars were determined by calculating the standard error of sample proportions. ZIKV transmission rate data was analyzed by linear regression and evaluated for differences in slope and y-intercept by analysis of covariance. Descriptive statistics are provided in the figure legends. All analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Statistical software.</p>
