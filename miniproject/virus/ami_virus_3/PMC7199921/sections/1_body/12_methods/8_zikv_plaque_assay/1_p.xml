<p id="P27">In addition to RT-qPCR, salivary secretions from ZIKV-infected 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> were assayed by plaque assay to confirm the presence of infectious virus particles. Briefly, saliva from individual mosquitoes were diluted in cell culture medium and plated on sub-confluent monolayers of Vero cells. Cells were incubated for 1 hr. at 37°C after which a semi-solid medium overlay (
 <italic>Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium</italic> with 4% EquaFETAL, 2X Pen-Strep and 4 μg/mL Amphotericin B, mixed with an equal volume of 1.2% Tragacanth gum) (EquaFETAL, Atlas Biologicals, Fort Collins, USA) (Tragacanth, MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, USA) was added. Cells were incubated for 4–5 days at 37
 <sup>o</sup>C in 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>, stained with crystal violet, and plaques enumerated.
