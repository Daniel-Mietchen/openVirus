<p id="P39">To estimate how 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> changes with feeding behavior, we used our posterior distributions for the EIP as input into the above equations, since we assert that the EIP is better represented by a gamma distribution than a single static value. For each of a thinned subset (10%) of MCMC posterior samples of the shape and rate parameters, and for each model (single- and double-feed), we generated 20,000 gamma random variables as input to calculate 20,000 respective 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimates. We then found the mean 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for that particular parameter set, and repeated this process for each MCMC sample in the subset. We then compared the distributions of the single- and double-feed 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> defined by the respective EIP distributions.
