<p id="P44">We also plotted the relationship between 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> and 
 <italic>p</italic> (i.e. the probability of daily survival of mosquitoes), as this parameter plays an important role in the variability of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> across different climates (
 <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 8</xref>). For each value of 
 <italic>p</italic> specified in 
 <xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Table S3</xref>, we generated 10,000 gamma-distributed estimates of the EIP as input to calculate 10,000 respective 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> estimates, as previously described. At high values of 
 <italic>p</italic>, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is slightly larger for the single-feed model, although the overall magnitude of 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> for either model is large and unlikely to be observed in a natural setting. At lower values of 
 <italic>p</italic>, within the range where ZIKV epidemics have been observed, 
 <italic>R</italic>
 <sub>0</sub> is slightly higher under the double-feed model (
 <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 8a</xref>) and is more likely to be greater than 1 (
 <xref rid="F12" ref-type="fig">Extended Data 8b</xref>). Our results therefore suggest that multiple bloodmeals in a natural setting may lead to greater persistence of ZIKV on the edges of observed transmission zones.
