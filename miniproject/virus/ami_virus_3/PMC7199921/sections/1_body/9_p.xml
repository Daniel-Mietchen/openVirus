<p id="P13">One limitation of the current study concerns the use of artificial blood meals to feed mosquitoes. This method is commonly used for colony maintenance and for vector competence studies, and has advantages over the use of laboratory animals for convenience and for arboviruses such as ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV that do not produce infectious-level viremias in easy to maintain animal hosts. Despite these advantages, artificial feeding technique differs from natural blood feeding in ways that could potentially impact the results of this study. The technique requires the use of anticoagulated (defibrinated) blood that results in significantly lower arbovirus infections rates in mosquitoes than after feeding on viremic hosts

 </sup>. To overcome this impediment, ZIKV and DENV were grown in mosquito cell culture rather than mammalian cells to generate virus titers that were greater than observed during human viremias. Viruses grown in insect cells express different N-linked glycan residues on the surface of envelope protein that could also affect virus infection of the mosquito midgut

 </sup>. Nevertheless, our study shows the impact of sequential blood meals on arbovirus dissemination from the gut after initial infection. This occurs long after the initial infectious bloodmeal is ingested and therefore the source of virus, virus titer, or method of blood feeding is unlikely to alter our findings.
