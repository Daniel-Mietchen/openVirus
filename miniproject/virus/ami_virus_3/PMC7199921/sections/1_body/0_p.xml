<p id="P4">Arthropod-borne (arbo)viruses represent an ongoing threat to human health as shown by the emergence and global spread of dengue virus (DENV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>), chikungunya virus (CHIKV; 
 <italic>Togaviridae</italic>), and Zika virus (ZIKV; 
 <italic>Flaviviridae</italic>)

 </sup>. These three arboviruses are transmitted by mosquitoes of the genus 
 <italic>Aedes</italic>, subgenus 
 <italic>Stegomyia,</italic> which serve as epidemic vectors, and are known to cause disease outbreaks with high attack rates, necessitating research into the factors regulating virus transmission

 </sup>. The urban-dwelling mosquito 
 <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> serves as a particularly efficient vector because it feeds predominately and frequently on human hosts (every 2–3 days) thereby increasing the frequency of host contact

 </sup>. Nevertheless, in laboratory trials, 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> populations from endemic regions often exhibit unexpectedly low vector competence values for their arboviruses as measured by the proportion of mosquitoes that become infected and transmit a pathogen after ingesting virus

 </sup>. This could be explained, in part, by the techniques used to assess vector competence. In these studies, mosquitoes were offered an initial infectious bloodmeal and not allowed to refeed on blood again prior to assaying them for virus transmission, as is standard practice for assessing vector competence. Therefore, these studies do not recapitulate the natural biology of mosquitoes that refeed frequently. It is possible that differences in feeding history could help explain the seemingly paradoxical nature of 
 <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic>-transmitted arboviruses.
