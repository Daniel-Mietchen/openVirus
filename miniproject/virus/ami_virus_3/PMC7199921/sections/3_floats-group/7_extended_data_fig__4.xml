   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> mosquitoes were offered a ZIKV-infectious bloodmeal and 4 dpi individuals in the double feed groups were fed a second, non-infectious bloodmeal. At 7 dpi, mosquito midguts and legs were dissected and viral genomic equivalents were determined. (a) Midgut genome equivalents based on feeding status regardless if the infection was restricted to the midgut or disseminated (n=10/ group). (b) Midgut genome equivalents based on infection status (disseminated (n=14) vs. not disseminated (n=6) (i.e. midgut restricted)) regardless of feeding status. (
