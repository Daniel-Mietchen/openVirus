  <p id="P57">(a) Schematic of experimental design. Paired bodies (MGI; midgut infection; % of mosquitoes with viral RNA in their bodies), legs (DI; disseminated infection; % of body positive mosquitoes with viral RNA in their legs) and salivary glands (SGI; salivary gland infection; % of leg positive mosquitoes with viral RNA in their salivary glands) were collected and assayed for the presence of viral RNA (b) 7 dpi and (c) 10 dpi. (d) SGI data from (b) and (c) analyzed as the % of ZIKV-exposed mosquitoes with a salivary gland infection. The data presented represents at least three experimental replicates. (
   <styled-content style="color:#0276FD">●</styled-content>) single-feed; (
   <styled-content style="color:#FF0000">●</styled-content>) double-feed. Data were analyzed by Two-sided Fisher’s exact test. (*) p&lt;0.05, (**) p&lt;0.01, (***) p&lt;0.001. Sample sizes (represented as a fraction of positive samples/ total samples) for each treatment/ timepoint are embedded in the figures above each experimental group. Center values represent the proportion and error bars represent the binomial SE of sample proportions.
