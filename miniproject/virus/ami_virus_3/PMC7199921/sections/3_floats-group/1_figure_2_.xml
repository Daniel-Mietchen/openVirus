  <title>Bloodmeal acquisition induces microperforations in the midgut basal lamina.</title>
  <p id="P52">
   <bold>(a)</bold> Representative SEM images of naïve and engorged 
   <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> midguts 24 hpbm and 72 hpbm at 300x (scale bars, 300 μm) and 4000x (scale bar, 20 μm) magnification. Two experimental replicates with 5 midguts/ replicate. Black dashed lines outline the visceral musculature and the yellow arrow denotes microperforations in the underlying basal lamina. (b) Pools of 5 unfed 
   <italic>Ae. aegypti</italic> midguts per replicate were assayed for fluorescein labeled collagen hybridizing peptide (CHP) binding (
   <italic>n</italic>=5). Samples were analyzed by two-tailed t-test (p=0.0008). (c) Temporal binding profile of CHP binding to pools of 5 midguts/ replicate following a single bloodmeal. Differences in CHP binding were determined using a One-way ANOVA with a Dunnett’s multiple comparisons post-test. Precise p-values and samples sizes can be found in the linked source data. (d) Viral genome equivalents/ midgut of individuals intrathoracically inoculated with ZIKV (n=14) or inoculated and provided a bloodmeal 3 dpi (n=16). Midguts were assayed 12 dpi by RT-qPCR and statistically analyzed with a two-tailed t-test. (e) Midguts from ZIKV inoculated individuals with or without a bloodmeal assayed for ZIKV antigen 12 dpi. Representative images of two experimental replicates of 10 individual midguts/ per group. Images were acquired at 200X magnification (scale bar, 100 μm). For b-e, center values represent the means and error bars represent the SD.
