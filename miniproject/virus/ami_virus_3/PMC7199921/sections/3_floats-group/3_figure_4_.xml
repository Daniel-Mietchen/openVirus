  <title>Proposed model for double-feed enhanced early dissemination and transmission.</title>
  <p id="P54">As 
   <italic>Aedes spp.</italic> mosquitoes acquire an infectious bloodmeal, the basal lamina underlying the midgut becomes compromised due to mechanical distention. Initially, only a few midguts cells become infected, but with time, viruses spread cell-to-cell forming increasingly larger foci. Simultaneously, the basal lamina begins to repair, but not fully. Eventually the growing foci overlap with basal lamina microperforations allowing virus to bypass the basal lamina and enter the hemolymph. Acquisition of an additional bloodmeal would result in additional disruptions in the basal lamina thereby increasing the likelihood that the growing virus foci will chance upon a break resulting in earlier dissemination and transmission.
