<p id="Par11">Based on the above, and considering the transmission risk that asymptomatic HCWs represent for their colleagues and patients, and the urgent need to keep HCWs as safe as possible to preserve sustainable healthcare system functionality throughout the pandemic, we strongly recommend that HCWs wear a medical mask during all their interactions within healthcare facilities. The demonstration of the benefits of plain mask usage regarding the efferent aerosol spreading of non-SARS-COV-2 coronaviruses further supports this notion [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], since this feature could theoretically hinder viral transmission from HCWs with mild or no symptoms to colleagues and patients. Nevertheless, theoretical benefits and surrogates of efficacy aside, every suchlike preventive strategy ought to eventually be evaluated through its clinical effectiveness [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In this context, it is noteworthy that a similar approach implemented early in the course of the epidemic in Hong-Kong including constant plain mask use by HCWs in in-hospital facilities with no contact with patients resulted in null transmission rates among health personnel over a period of 42Â days [

These include but are not limited to the promotion of hand hygiene and environmental decontamination, assignment of dedicated healthcare staff, hospitals or wards within hospitals for Covid-19 patients, shiftwork of HCWs with minimization of physical interaction of different shift members, shutdown of all hospital facilities (cafeterias, dining rooms, gyms, etc.) that might affect unnecessary interaction between HCWs, and decrease of the frequency of high-risk interventions of unknown or limited efficacy in suspected or known Covid-19 patients.
