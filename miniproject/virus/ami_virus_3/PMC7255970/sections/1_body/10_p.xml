<p id="Par12">In conclusion, it is likely that in the setting of the acute course of a pandemic much like the current, a certain degree of shortage will emerge for medical masks but even more so for N95. To force practices of debatable safety in the face of equipment scarcity, such as reuse of respirators, the usage of each mask type should be scaled for each medical task, as appropriate, based on the best available evidence. Therefore, we advocate that compliant use of a medical mask from all HCWs during their presence in healthcare facilities combined with other known measures of personal hygiene are expected to impact the control of the SARS-CoV-2 spread within healthcare personnel in the most meaningful and sizeable manner.</p>
