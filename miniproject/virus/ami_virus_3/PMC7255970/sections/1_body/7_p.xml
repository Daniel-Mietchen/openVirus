<p id="Par9">Overall, there is enough available evidence derived from reports earlier than the Covid-19 era to support the universal usage of medical masks as an inseparable component of personal protective equipment (PPE) among HCWs. On the other hand, there is limited data to advocate in favor of the generalized use in clinical routine of N95 respirators compared to plain masks, as they are more expensive and uncomfortable in long-term use [

Extrapolating this evidence to form recommendations for the current pandemic warrants extreme caution. Unavoidably, based on theoretical plausibility assumptions rather than hard evidence, World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the usage of N95 solely for HCWs during AGMPs and that of simple masks for other close contacts with suspected or confirmed SARS-COV-2 patients [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Notably, however, WHO does not recommend systematic use of a medical mask by HCWs during other activities within healthcare facilities, outside the treatment of Covid-19 diagnosed or suspected patients. This is a recommendation that we strenuously advocate against.
