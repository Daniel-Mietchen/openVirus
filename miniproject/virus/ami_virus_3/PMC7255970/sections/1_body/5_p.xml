<p id="Par7">As regards barrier measure application, compliance constitutes a key aspect that should be taken into account. Data from more than a decade ago show that adherence to mask wearing is associated with the prevention of respiratory viral illness among contacts in households [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. More recently, this year, an early report from a hospital in Wuhan retrospectively examining risk factors associated with SARS-Cov-2 infection among HCWs revealed a protective role of contact history with confirmed or suspected SARS-Cov-2 patients, thus implying the considerable role of meticulous conformity to protective measures [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Due to the inherent features of their application, compliance issues would be expected to be more relevant in the case of N95 respirators. Sustained usage of N95 is associated with a gradual increase of blood CO
 <sub>2</sub> content and perceived exertion, shortness of breath, headache and lightheadedness. Furthermore, frequent respirator adjustments and touching on or under the respirator have also been noted, probably hampering the functional integrity of the respirator as a barrier [

It is likely that under stringent working conditions over time the overall greater discomfort associated with sustained N95 usage in comparison with simple medical masks would add to HCWs’ fatigue, hindering both their working capacity and adherence to mask usage and thus endangering patients and HCWs [
