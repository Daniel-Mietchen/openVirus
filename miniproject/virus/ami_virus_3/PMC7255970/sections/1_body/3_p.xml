<p id="Par5">To date, it is assumed that plain surgical masks suffice for prevention of viral transmission from respiratory droplets, while N95 respirators provide additional protection from airborne transmission via aerosols [

Evidence from studies addressing protection from other respiratory viral pathogens, which are transmitted with a similar way to SARS-CoV-2, justifies either the use of medical masks or N95 respirators as substantially more effective than wearing neither in preventing viral transmission. A meta-analysis of observational studies performed during the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak concluded that there is consistent evidence to support the use of both simple medical masks (OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.26–0.39 from seven studies, four among HCWs) and N95 respirators (OR 0.17, 95% CI 0.07–0.43 from three studies among HCWs) [
