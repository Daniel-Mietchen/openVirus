<p id="Par3">As with other respiratory pathogens, including other human Coronaviruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and Influenzae viruses, SARS-CoV-2 transmission primarily occurs through respiratory droplets emitted in various distances during coughing or sneezing of symptomatic infected individuals [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. An open debate still exists regarding the potential of airborne viral shedding (implicating viral presence in droplet nuclei &lt; 5 μm in diameter that might remain, pending environmental conditions, aloft for several hours [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]). In a recent study, van Doremalen et al. [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] have shown that SARS-Cov-2 remains viable in an aerosol artificially generated by a collision nebulizer, with a half-life of approximately 1 h. Nevertheless, it should be noted that this result was obtained under extremely idealized and unrealistic experimental conditions, not likely to be encountered by HCWs in real-world circumstances, and thus cannot be taken as definitive proof of airborne capacity of the SARS-COV-2 viral particle [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In clinical settings, contamination of the environmental air around patients has been disputed among reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Overall, airborne transmission has been deemed as an unlikely major contributor to SARS-Cov-2 transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], although it could play an important role during procedures that generate small droplets (aerosol-generating medical procedures, AGMPs) by HCWs [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Besides, the virus may be also detected in fomites, in blood and stool of patients, but related transmission modes have not yet been identified [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In any case, close contact between individuals seems to be paramount to viral transmission [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Accumulating data indicate that HCWs represent a significant proportion of total SARS-CoV-2 cases, ranging between 9 and 29% in different series [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>–
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Voices for the urgent need to protect HCWs to keep healthcare systems up and running throughout the pandemic are increasingly raised [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Use of barrier methods represent an essential step in this process.
