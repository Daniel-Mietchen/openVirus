<p id="Par10">There is little data suggesting that contact with infected patients itself may not be the most significant contributor for in-hospital viral acquisition by HCW. Accordingly, unprotected or suboptimally protected close contacts (AGMPs inclusive) of HCWs with unidentified hospitalized cases of SARS-COV-2 did not result in illness or viral acquisition in two published reports from Hong-Kong (11 and 7 incidents [

Considerable aerosol emission occurs during the vocalization process and a wide interindividual variability characterizes the magnitude of this phenomenon, so that some individuals (or “super emitters”) emit an unusually large number of droplets for a given vocalization compared to their peers [

Additionally, recent observations have underlined that the size-based, ad hoc distinction between droplets and aerosols (based on a droplet diameter greater or lesser than 5 μm) becomes less relevant when considering highly turbulent expiratory flows such as those that occur during coughing or sneezing. In the warm and humid local environment of a highly turbulent cloud exhaled during a cough or sneeze, droplets with a continuum of diameters may evade evaporation and hence remain airborne for a longer time period and in larger distances from the emitter. That is in stark contrast to the classical conception of isolated droplet behavior that occurs during normal exhalation, upon which the dichotomous distinction between droplets and aerosols is based and which primarily drives the rationale for the circumstances in which mask usage is considered necessary or not [
