<p id="Par8">The lack of demonstrated benefit regarding the use of fitted N95 respirators appears at first glance counterintuitive, mainly due to the substantial inevitable leakage around the edge of loose-fitting plain surgical masks. However, this non-superiority of the N95 respirators represents an intriguing finding that may indicate gaps in the perceived model of viral transmission or may be a consequence of reduced compliance among N95 users, that leads to poorer net barrier function over time. Undoubtedly, it also highlights the capital importance of contact transmission (hands on face, mouth or nose) for viral respiratory pathogens, since both mask types apparently deter face touching among wearers in a similar way [
