<p id="par0075">Most biomarker-related studies with respect to COVID-19 that are currently available were done in patients, not in probands undergoing screening, and these studies were done based on sophisticated blood analyses not usually available in the screening situation during a pandemic; we describe some examples because these studies, directly or indirectly, reflect the outcomes we are interested in. Differences in immune responses in patients with severe versus those with mild COVID-19 were investigated by (
 <xref rid="bib0160" ref-type="bibr">Liao et al., 2020</xref>), characterizing the lung immune microenvironment using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from 3 severe and 3 mild COVID-19 patients and 8 healthy controls. Through single-cell RNA sequencing combined with TCR-sequencing, monocyte-derived FCN1+ macrophages were identified as the dominant cell population in the lungs of patients with severe disease and ARDS whereas FABP4+ alveolar macrophages and clonal CD8 + T cells predominated in the lungs of patients with mild disease. The predominance of highly inflammatory cells points towards high cytokine activation. Moreover, (
 <xref rid="bib0265" ref-type="bibr">Qin et al., 2020</xref>) analyzed peripheral lymphocyte subsets from 452 severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Severe cases had significantly lower lymphocyte counts, higher leukocyte counts and neutrophil-lymphocyte-ratios, as well as lower percentages of monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils. Most of the severe cases demonstrated elevated levels of infection-related biomarkers and inflammatory cytokines. Finally, for patients with severe COVID-19, monitoring the inflammation and immunity status may suggest treatment options such as immunosuppression by steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, selective cytokine blockade or JAK inhibition, and specific biomarkers may be increasing ferritin, decreasing platelet counts, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the HScore (
