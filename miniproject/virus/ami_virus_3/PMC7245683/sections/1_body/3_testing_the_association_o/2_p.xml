<p id="par0070">While the majority of current efforts focus on implementing diagnostic testing capacity, little attention is paid to prognostic testing, e.g. by estimating immune or inflammation status. However, while diagnostic testing is of critical importance to identify and quarantine infected patients, prognostic testing is equally important to allow decisions on the level of care for those that are asymptomatic or show mild symptoms but may deteriorate. As described above, we suggest that the association of COVID-19 with old age may specifically be due to inflammaging- and senescence-associated failures of the immune system, and that it is important to test this hypothesis in more detail, based in particular on molecular biomarker measurements. The human host response to coronaviruses in general was reviewed by (
