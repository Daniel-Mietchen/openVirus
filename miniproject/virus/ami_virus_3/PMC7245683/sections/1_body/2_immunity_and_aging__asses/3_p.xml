<p id="par0065">In general, inflammaging, immunosenescence and cellular senescence, all closely related to each other (
 <xref rid="bib0110" ref-type="bibr">Fulop et al., 2017</xref>), are involved in a deterioration of the performance of the immune system with age, starting with an involution of the thymus (
 <xref rid="bib0075" ref-type="bibr">Fagnoni et al., 2000</xref>), despite homeostatic mechanisms. Infection with, e.g., cytomegalovirus then leads to repeated reactivation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> cells, which increases the fraction of specialized T cells and decreases the amount of naive T cells (
 <xref rid="bib0350" ref-type="bibr">Vescovini et al., 2010</xref>), and to downregulation of CD28, which is an important co-stimulatory signal (
 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Pangrazzi and Weinberger, 2020</xref>). Although no cell type of the immune system has been identified that shows all hallmarks of cellular senescence, some immune cells secrete several senescence-related components (cytokines, chemokines, extracellular matrix remodeling proteases) (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Callender et al., 2018</xref>), indicating that the removal of cells with a senescent like phenotype may prepare elderly people for future infections, despite a protective role also described (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Baz-Martinez et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the interference of oncoviruses with senescence pathways suggests that senescence may also be part of the host cell response to fight viruses and that the SASP could stimulate the recruitment of immune cells; some experiments with vesicular stomatitis virus point to this possibility (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Baz-Martinez et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, there are indications that senescent (lung) cells are a host target for SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, possibly due to better conditions for replication such as enhanced protein synthesis, which is also required to produce SASP inflammatory mediators (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Sargiacomo et al., 2020</xref>). There are clearly many more possible interrelationships between SARS-CoV-2 infection and senescence mechanisms regarding genomic instability, telomere attrition, impaired autophagy, mitochondrial dysfunction, fibrosis, immunosenescence and inflammation, which may help to explain the increased pathophysiological responses to SARS-CoV-2 among older individuals (
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Salimi and Hamlyn, 2020</xref>). For example, two suggested host receptors for SARS-CoV-2, CD26 and ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2), are upregulated in senescent cells (
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Sargiacomo et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a major cause of immune exhaustion is telomere shortening in viral-specific memory CD8 + T cells (
 <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">Mueller et al., 2020</xref>), which induces cellular senescence and p38 MAPK-dependent SASP (
 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">Callender et al., 2018</xref>). This is of interest insofar as certain subtelomeric genes are upregulated in aged cells with short telomeres by a mechanism called telomere position effects over long distances (TPE-OLD). One of these TPE-OLD genes, interferon stimulated gene (ISG-15, (
 <xref rid="bib0275" ref-type="bibr">Robin et al., 2014</xref>)) is the most significantly activated ISG in response to viral infection (
 <xref rid="bib0295" ref-type="bibr">Salimi and Hamlyn, 2020</xref>). Notably, ISG-15 plays a key role in the innate immune response to viral infection and inhibits viral release by blocking viral assembly (
 <xref rid="bib0290" ref-type="bibr">Sadler and Williams, 2008</xref>). Therapeutic considerations so far focus at blocking the SASP and viral replication (using substances as rapamycin and doxycycline) or at the removal of infected senescent cells by senolytics (
 <xref rid="bib0185" ref-type="bibr">Malavolta et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0305" ref-type="bibr">Sargiacomo et al., 2020</xref>). In any case, cellular senescence overlaps with immunosenescence and inflammaging, and cytokine assays are a method of choice for discovering biomarkers related to inflammation, immunity, fibrosis, cellular senescence and aging. Whole-genome transcriptomics could enable the further unbiased hypothesis-free exploration of biomarkers.
