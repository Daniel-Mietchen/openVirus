<p id="par0025">For long-term gain, we suggest that the most useful biomarkers are the ones that allow us to understand the age-related mechanisms underlying a respiratory infectious disease pandemic such as COVID-19. Here, we can build upon conceptual frameworks developed over the last decade, describing how immune status is influenced by aging processes (see also Section 
 <xref rid="sec0035" ref-type="sec">3</xref>). In brief, aging processes such as chronic inflammation and cellular senescence affect the innate as well as the adaptive immune system (
 <xref rid="bib0240" ref-type="bibr">Oh et al., 2019</xref>). Specifically, older and multi-morbid people are suffering from “inflammaging” (
 <xref rid="bib0080" ref-type="bibr">Franceschi et al., 2000</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib0095" ref-type="bibr">2018a</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr">Franceschi et al., 2018b</xref>), a chronic, low-level inflammation caused by exposure of the immune system to misplaced and/or misfolded self-antigens originating from dying cells, fragments of mitochondria, extracellular vesicles and senescent cells (
 <xref rid="bib0085" ref-type="bibr">Franceschi et al., 2017a</xref>). The higher mortality from COVID-19 in older people, in subjects with comorbidities and in males can then be explained in part by their higher inflammatory status, including an activation of the innate immune system and the triggering of an inflammatory “storm” that includes IL-6 and other cytokines (
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Bonafè et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0120" ref-type="bibr">Herold et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0200" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0210" ref-type="bibr">Moore and June, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0300" ref-type="bibr">Santesmasses et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Storci et al., 2020</xref>), as well as inflammatory molecules such as mitochondrial DNA fragments (
 <xref rid="bib0260" ref-type="bibr">Pinti et al., 2014</xref>), all assumed to be associated with dramatic changes of the peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets (
 <xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr">Cossarizza et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, a difference in the amount of inflammaging between men and women (
 <xref rid="bib0025" ref-type="bibr">Bonafe et al., 2001</xref>) could explain, in part, the higher vulnerability of males to COVID-19 (
 <xref rid="bib0190" ref-type="bibr">Marquez et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, 
 <xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr">Bonafè et al. (2020)</xref> suggest that men feature higher levels of subclinical systemic inflammation, connected with a blunted acquired immune system, a blunted type I interferon response, and with accelerated biological aging, as well as downregulation of the ACE2 SARS-CoV-2-receptor, which (paradoxically) triggers inflammation in the aged and comorbid. Thus, there is a strong specific rationale for implicating aging-related processes in COVID-19 mortality, suggesting that interventions into these processes can contribute significantly to better outcomes in this pandemic and the next. Here, we do not just call for action, but we provide a detailed outline of what can be done, and must be done, for maximum health gain for the elderly, in addition to the standard diagnostic tests.
