<p id="par0020">In late 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown etiology were reported in Wuhan, China. The causative agent was identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2; the disease was named COVID-19. As of March 2020, it has caused many hundreds of thousands of confirmed cases and tens of thousands of deaths worldwide (John Hopkins University CoronavirusMap,

Sepsis is the most frequently observed complication, followed by respiratory failure, acute respiratory deficiency syndrome (ARDS), heart failure and septic shock (

In order to react effectively to the ongoing and future pandemics, we must improve diagnostics as well as biomarker discovery and validation, for prognosis and for intervention. Moreover, minimum standards are necessary for all sampling procedures. It is not enough to just diagnose; good prognostic and predictive biomarkers are needed.
