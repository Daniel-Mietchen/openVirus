<p id="par0085">Tradeoffs are an issue in any biomarker discovery or validation effort; they arise between maximizing the quantity 
 <italic>versus</italic> the quality of the data, in real-world 
 <italic>versus</italic> standardized situations, enabling cost-efficient yet safe measurements. As described in Section 
 <xref rid="sec0010" ref-type="sec">2</xref>, in any respiratory disease epidemic, and specifically in case of COVID-19, we suggest that with highest priority, swabs and dried blood shall be done based on a simple set of rules, observing minimum standards, to limit the influence of systematic confounders as well as random influences, while still reflecting the real-world situation. Then, if there is sufficient signal for learning biomarkers, these can be expected to generalize well. A specific tradeoff are biosafety issues, see supplement 1.
