<p id="par0080">We suggest that all COVID-19 test probands that are able to give informed consent shall participate in systematic surveys as motivated here. It is important to record confounders, and, as in any analysis, potential bias must be considered. Some confounders (time-of-day) can be recorded immediately, while others may need to be established post-hoc (i.e. after sampling) by questionnaires (asking for (co-)morbidity, for anthropomorphic data, etc.). Data analyses shall follow standard procedures for biomarker discovery; since in many cases the data are in a time-to-event format, survival analyses are usually done, as exemplified in some recent reviews, see (

 <xref rid="bib0360" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). In these analyses, gender must be considered as a confounder, and the immunobiographies of the study participants shall be considered as well. Of note, biological knowledge about the SARS-CoV-2 virus is assembled at a rapid pace, see
