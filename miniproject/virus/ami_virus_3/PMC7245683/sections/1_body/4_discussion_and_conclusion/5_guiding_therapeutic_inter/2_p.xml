 <xref rid="bib0340" ref-type="bibr">UNITY, 2019</xref>)) patients, and given that inflammaging can be due in part to senescent cells, we suggest that modulating the immune status of the elderly by reducing inflammation or removing senescent cells (immune cells or lung cells) may improve their health and resilience also in the case of respiratory infections such as COVID-19. The first step towards investigating this hypothesis is the confirmation of biomarkers related to inflammaging or senescence as being predictive for the outcomes considered here, such as hospitalization and long-term deterioration of lung function. The latter is of particular interest in “escapers” that survived serious complications of the disease; if biomarkers could be identified to predict their course of recovery, inferior outcomes may be prevented. More generally, it would be possible to design biomarker-guided intervention trials, where not only the choice of the anti-inflammatory and/or seno-therapeutic intervention(s) shall be guided by the biomarkers found to be most predictive, but patient-specific (“personalized”) biomarker-based treatment is a conceivable option. Moreover, as aging-related processes are at the core of susceptibility to infectious (respiratory) diseases in general, and of the chances to cope with these, any remaining sample material should be used to measure generic aging-related markers. For example, if there are leftovers of human DNA, methylation-based estimates of biological age are possible, and these can help to understand how host age and viral challenge are responsible for the outcomes observed, and specific mechanisms of molecular aging that are related to these outcomes can be confirmed, or discovered anew. In fact, based on DNA from buccal swabs, an epigenetic clock was already established (

 <xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr">Kaeberlein, 2020</xref>). Since mTOR modulates cellular senescence, biomarkers for predicting the reaction of the immune system to mTOR inhibition may be valuable for vaccination research, also for COVID-19.
