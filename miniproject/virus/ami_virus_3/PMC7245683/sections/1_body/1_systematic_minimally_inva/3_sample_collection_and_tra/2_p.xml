<p id="par0035">All sampling we suggest is amending the standard diagnostics. We consider two guiding criteria for selecting the right type of samples: 1) maximum expected usefulness of the samples to identify biomarkers accurately predicting outcomes of interest; 2) minimum effort (time, cost, reliability of supplies, safety) in taking and processing the samples needed. Overall, we suggest that even in the current COVID-19 situation, simple non-invasive or minimally-invasive sampling procedures can easily be implemented. These would be based on using (i) the remainders from the “standard” diagnostic (swab-based) sample, (ii) a double-headed swab (using one head for diagnostics), (iii) in addition to the diagnostic swab, one or more further swabs, (iv) dried capillary blood spot samples, and, with some caveats, (v) venous blood. Overall, sampling methods have to be in agreement with downstream laboratory uses, and of course they have to comply with the corresponding WHO and/or local standards.</p>
