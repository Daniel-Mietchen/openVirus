<p id="par0040">The sampling modalities for biomarker identification to be considered at time of pandemic screening are depicted in supplement 1. Nasopharyngeal and throat swabs are the standard for the diagnosis of respiratory infections such as COVID-19. As diagnostic testing will always be performed, we strongly suggest to use remainder material from the diagnostic swab for additional analyses. Of interest, 
 <xref rid="bib0180" ref-type="bibr">Lopez et al. (2019)</xref> elegantly developed a minimally invasive sample collection protocol that allows for multiple diagnostic and research investigations including bacterial culture, viral detection (PCR), cytokine expression (PCR), and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing from a single nasopharyngeal swab. Cutting the tip of the swab also allowed for RNA sequencing. Further, there are a number of additional swab collection options ranging from an additional swab to a double-headed swab. Flocked swabs are most often used and transferred into universal transport medium (UTM) (
 <xref rid="bib0355" ref-type="bibr">von Allmen et al., 2019</xref>). Dried capillary blood sampling is another “easy” option, routinely applied for neonate screening and drug monitoring. An optimized protocol for the extraction of RNA from dried blood spots yielded similar transcriptome gene counts compared to RNA isolated from venous blood in Tempus tubes (
 <xref rid="bib0270" ref-type="bibr">Reust et al., 2018</xref>); thus, dried blood spots for transcriptome studies could be a viable option facilitating RNA studies. Blood collection, application onto filter paper, drying, transport and storage can all affect the accuracy of the analysis and comparability with blood serum/plasma; however, handling and transport of the samples is far less problematic (
 <xref rid="bib0165" ref-type="bibr">Lim, 2018</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0285" ref-type="bibr">Rutstein et al., 2015</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bib0380" ref-type="bibr">Zakaria et al., 2016</xref>). We acknowledge that sampling of whole blood may not be practical in times of a health emergency. Nevertheless, specific measurements that require whole (venous) blood (e.g. of circulating antibodies) may still be clinically useful, and then the remaining blood should be used for biomarker analyses, such as transcriptomics based on circulating immune cells. For all samples, for investigating immunity and inflammation, cytokine (or related) protein assays are an obvious first choice; a second choice are modalities allowing unbiased gene expression measurements (transcriptomics). While important, not discussed in this review is the identification of (bacterial) co-infections.
