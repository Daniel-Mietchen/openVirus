<p id="par0055">Moreover, dried capillary blood spots (DBS) provide a minimally-invasive, low-cost option since results often correspond to those derived from gold-standard venous blood samples (

 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">Muzembo et al., 2017</xref>), for studies of gene expression (

 <xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr">Chambers et al., 2015</xref>), and global metabolite profiles can be generated, assuming stability at ambient temperature (

 <xref rid="bib0020" ref-type="bibr">Bjorkesten et al., 2017</xref>), and be used to characterize inflammatory responses. For example, multiplex immuno-mass spectrometry can measure acute phase response (inflammatory) proteins from DBS with high precision (
 <xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>), also allowing longitudinal analyses of inflammation markers, and generating biomarker trajectories of inflammation dynamics. Overall, swabs and dried blood have proven their value, specifically for the identification of infection- and immunity-related biomarkers.
