<p id="par0050">Measuring the host response to infectious pathogens provides a rapid but rather unspecific means of aiding in diagnosis, compared to direct pathogen detection. However, monitoring the host response over time enables evaluation of patient response to therapy. White blood cell counts and single protein or metabolomic biomarkers (such as CRP, procalcitonin and lactate) have historically been used in case of infectious and immunological diseases (

Postulating that a broad assessment of host response in terms of gene expression (transcriptomics) will yield superior diagnostic and prognostic accuracy, global changes in gene expression in response to acute infections, trauma, and sepsis were studied intensively (

 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">Zaas et al., 2013</xref>), but more recently, samples from the respiratory tract have been used more often (
 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Landry and Foxman, 2018</xref>). For example, host gene expression profiles in nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and whole blood samples were investigated during respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (hRV) infection (
 <xref rid="bib0060" ref-type="bibr">Do et al., 2017</xref>). RSV infection induced strong and persistent innate immune responses and the observed RSV-induced gene expression patterns did not differ much in NP swabs compared to blood. In contrast, hRV infection did not induce expression of innate immunity pathways as strongly, and significant differences were observed between NP swab and blood specimens. With respect to biomarkers for outcome risk stratification, whole blood transcriptomics alongside with clinical data in sepsis patients leads to a significant improvement in the prediction of 30-day mortality (
