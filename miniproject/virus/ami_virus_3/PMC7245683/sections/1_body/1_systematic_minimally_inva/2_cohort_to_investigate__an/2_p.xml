<p id="par0030">We propose proactive biomarker research as part of ongoing disease screening during a pandemic such as COVID-19 (see 
 <xref rid="fig0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> ). The suspected cases being screened are called the “cohort” of probands (or patients). For probands screened during a serious respiratory disease epidemic and found to be positive for the infectious agent, we suggest that the relevant outcomes to predict are disease manifestation, subsequent disease deterioration including hospitalization (and need for intensive care), long-term morbidity after hospital discharge, and mortality. Disease deterioration can be measured in detail by clinical outcomes, see, e.g., (

Long-term morbidity, for example in patients that need to undergo intensive care but escape the deadly consequences of the infection, can be measured as newly diagnosed diseases of interest (e.g., related to lung function) and, ultimately, by estimates of biological age, see (
