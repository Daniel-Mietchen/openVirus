   <bold>Screening Strategy.</bold> We suggest screening, particularly of elderly and frail people, combining routine with minimally-invasive and longitudinal sampling for biomarker research, to test the hypothesis that resilience of the elderly during a pandemic can be improved by countering chronic inflammation (inflammaging) and cellular senescence. Important outcomes are prognosis, occurrence of complications such as lung fibrosis, hints for therapeutic approaches and preventive measures.
