<p>Although our genetic analysis estimates date of the introduction of the DENV2-III BR-4 lineage at least four years before its detection in 2019 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>), and it is in agreement with the low prevalence of DENV2 cases in São Paulo State in 2014 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>A), more genetic end epidemiological data from 2014 to 2018 are necessary to precise the date of introduction and study how this lineage is stablishing in the State. Low viral lineage prevalence could explain the undetected circulation of DENV2-III BR-4 in São Paulo during a period when Brazil was hit by explosive epidemics of Zika, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses.

 </xref> This highlights the need of improved longitudinal genomic surveillance using, for instance, sequence-independent approaches for arbovirus detection. Such approaches will be particularly critical in geographic regions with year-round DENV transmission in
