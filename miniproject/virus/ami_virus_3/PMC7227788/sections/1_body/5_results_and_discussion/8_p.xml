<p>Our data reveals that two distinct virus lineages (DENV2-III BR-3 and DENV2-III BR-4) are co-circulating in a single location (São José do Rio Preto) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2</xref>). Although we are limited by the small sample size of the data analysed here, it is remarkable that the frequency of DENV2-III 2019 strains belonging to BR-3 is 5.3% (n = 1/19) and for BR-4 is 94.7% (n = 18/19). The upsurge in the number of dengue and dengue severe cases observed in São Paulo State, combined with the simultaneous detection of these two lineages and the increased frequency of BR-4 suggests that we are retrospectively reporting a lineage replacement event in São Paulo State. Additional data from other Brazil locations and from the Caribbean will allow us to reduce uncertainty in the dating estimates and to quantify the extent of the geographic spread of the DENV2-III BR-4 lineage reported here.
