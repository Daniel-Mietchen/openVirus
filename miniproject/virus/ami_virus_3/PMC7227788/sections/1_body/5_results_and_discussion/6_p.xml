<p>Our phylogenetic analysis further shows that virus genomes recovered from the 2019 cases all belong to genotype III (also known as American/Asian genotype). Notably, our analysis strongly supports (approximate likelihood ratio test = 1.00) the clustering of the2019 DENV2 cases from Brazil (18 of the 19 sequences collected in 2019) into a single monophyletic group (named here as DENV2-III BR-4), which is the result of a new and recent introduction of DENV2-III from outside of Brazil [
