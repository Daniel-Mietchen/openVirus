<p>RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed to cDNA using Superscript IV First-Strand Synthesis System (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) and random hexamer priming. Then, multiplex PCR was performed to generate overlapping amplicons of the whole genome of the targeted DENV2 strain. DENV2 genome amplification consisted of 35 cycles of PCR according to the reaction mix and thermocycling described by Quick et al.

 </xref> AmpureXP purification beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) were used to clean up PCR products, which were then quantified by Qubit dsDNA High Sensitivity assay on a Qubit 3.0 instrument (Life Technologies). Sequencing libraries were generated using the Genomic DNA Sequencing Kit SQK-LSK108 (Oxford Nanopore Technologies), by pooling, in equimolar proportions, a total of 250 ng of PCR products previously barcoded using the Native Barcoding Kit (NBD103, Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK). The libraries were loaded onto an Oxford Nanopore flow cell R9.4 (FLO-MIN106) and sequencing data were collected for 30 h. The median number of mapped reads was 45,013 reads per sample, and the generated consensus genomes had a mean coverage of 81% of the genome at 20x minimum sequencing depth. Sequencing statistics for each sample are shown in
