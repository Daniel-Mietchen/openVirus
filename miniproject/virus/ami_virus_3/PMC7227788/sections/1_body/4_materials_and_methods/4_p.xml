<p>The 20 qRT-PCR-positive DENV2 samples were subjected to viral genomic amplification at the Institute of Tropical Medicine, University of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. Genome sequencing was conducted using the portable nanopore MinION sequencing platform, which has been used previously in Brazil during outbreaks of Zika virus and yellow fever virus.
