All three have been identified as betacoronaviruses. One Health is the concept that human, animal and environmental health are linked. It provides a useful framework for examining and dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases such as coronaviruses. In 2005, Lau

 </xref> concluded that the presence of a large reservoir of SARS-CoV-like viruses in horseshoe bats, together with the culture of eating exotic mammals in southern China, is a time bomb. Surveillance of wild animals such as bats provides important information about potential zoonotic disease threats. Integrating scientific findings into effective public policies to prevent zoonotic spillover events remains aspirational, as the current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates.
