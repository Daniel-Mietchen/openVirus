<p>In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 appeared in Wuhan, Hubei province, China. Pangolins had been suspected as the intermediate hosts; however, genetic analyses suggest that SARS-CoV-2 did not come directly from these endangered animals.

 </xref> In contrast to SARS, the SARS-CoV-2 virus was identified relatively quickly. Cases of atypical pneumonia appeared in Wuhan City, Hubei province, at the end of December 2019. In 1 week the novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV, was determined by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as the causative agent. Five days after that, the virus’s genome sequence was released online on 12 January 2020 to assist public health response preparations.

 </xref> The speed of China’s viral identification and development of diagnostic criteria should have helped other countries prepare for a potential pandemic if their political leaders had taken the threat seriously. Readily available rapid testing is essential for understanding the extent of the disease spread and to estimate the mortality rate. SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 can be diagnosed with a variety of clinical specimens such as serum and respiratory fluids, using tests including RT-PCR analysis, serum antibody analysis and cell cultures.
