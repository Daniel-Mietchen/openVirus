<p>In 2019 China is a manufacturing giant and well connected globally. Wuhan is a large city serving as a hub with the rest of the country and with the world. These conditions helped set the stage for the highly communicable virus to spread worldwide. On 11 March 2020, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO, declared COVID-19 to be a global pandemic.

Implementing a One Health approach, conducting surveillance of animals for potential zoonotic disease threats and paying attention to the scientific findings might help prevent future coronavirus pandemics.</p>
