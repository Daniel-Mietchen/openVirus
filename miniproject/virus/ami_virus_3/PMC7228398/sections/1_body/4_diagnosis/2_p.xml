<p>The diagnosis of COVID‐19 is based on comprehensive contact and travel history and precise laboratory tests. Current diagnostic tools were the nucleic acid or virus gene tests. Samples included nasopharyngeal swab, sputum, secretion of the lower respiratory tract, blood, and feces. The nasopharyngeal swab is the most common specimens, however, its detection positive rate is less than 50%. Repeated detection is necessary for improving the positive rate. The positive rate of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was high, but it is not suitable for most of the patients due to increased risk of cross‐infection.
