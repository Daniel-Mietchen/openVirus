 </xref> SARS‐CoV‐2 particles contain spike and envelope, virions are spherical, oval, or pleomorphic with diameters of approximately 60 to 140 nm. Culture times were 4 days on human airway epithelial cell lines and 6 days on Vero E6/Huh‐7 cell lines. The single‐stranded RNA was 29 903 bp in length. The organization of the SARS‐CoV‐2 genome is 5′‐leader‐UTR‐replicase‐S (Spike)‐E (Envelope)‐M (Membrane)‐N (Nucleocapsid)‐3′‐UTR‐poly (A) tail with unknown open reading frames.

 </xref> however, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MER) coronavirus is lower related to SARS‐CoV‐2 which is a group 2c β‐coronavirus. SARS‐CoV‐2 exhibits very high sequence similarity to the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses in the receptor‐binding domain which indicates pangolins may be an intermediate host of the virus before dissemination to humans.

 </xref> SARS‐CoV‐2 has weak resistance, 56°C for 30 minutes, 75% ethanol, chlorine‐containing disinfectant, and peracetic acid can inactivate SARS‐CoV‐2.

 </xref> SARS‐CoV‐2‐S uses the SARS‐coronavirus receptor, angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE‐2) for entry host cells. ACE‐2 is a surface molecule highly expressed in AT2 cells of lung, along with esophageal upper epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes from ileum and colon which indicated digestive system along with respiratory systems is a potential route for SARS‐CoV‐2.

 </xref> The expression level of ACE‐2 in Asian populations is significantly higher than that in European and American populations, and ACE‐2 on male cells are higher than on female cells, which can partially explain the incidence rate of novel coronavirus pneumonia are higher in male and Asia.
