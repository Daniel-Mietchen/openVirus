<p id="par0200">Implications of our study may be to reduce the identified risk factors (trait health anxiety, cyberchondria), to promote favorable factors (being informed, adaptive emotion regulation) and to consider interactions (combination of unfavorable/favorable factors) to reduce anxiety in times of virus outbreaks (cf. also e.g.,

In terms of risk factors, it should be easier to reduce them with regard to cyberchondria, such as by educating and recommending behavior for the population (e.g., that excessive use of the Internet can increase anxiety; recommending reputable sources; basic help to reduce cyberchondria) and that recommendations should also be followed in media reporting (e.g., concrete/accurate, reputable information, avoiding fear-inducing language). This is also linked to the finding that feeling informed can have a buffering effect on anxiety and shows the importance of accurate and confident information and effective communication (

In the age of digitalization and online intervention, it is also conceivable that interventions to reduce health anxiety and/or promote adaptive emotion regulation strategies in the form of evaluated online tools could be a promising way to reduce anxiety during virus pandemics.
