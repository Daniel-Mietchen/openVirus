<p id="par0190">Concerning the links among trait health anxiety, cyberchondria
 <sub>Pandemic</sub>, and virus anxiety, we found consistently significant positive correlations. The positive correlation between health anxiety and cyberchondria is consistent with cognitive-behavioral models of health anxiety and previous findings (

In addition, this study showed that excessive Internet use in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in particular, the resulting stress are also positively related to health anxiety. Furthermore, we found for the first time that the stronger the cyberchondria, the higher the current virus anxiety. This could also confirm the widely heldassumption that excessive media consumption during the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with increased anxiety (

Even though we have examined state anxiety ("today"), and cyberchondria refers to a longer period of time, we cannot draw any causal conclusions with our study design. The relationship with the subscale “seeking reassurance” was very weak (

 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001) in contrast to the other subscales of cyberchondria
 <sub>Pandemic</sub> (
 <italic>r</italic> = .19–48, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001). The items of this subscale refer to the fact that the Internet search leads to a doctor's visit or that the results of the Internet search are discussed with the doctor, which is likely to be less relevant in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., a tendency to avoid visits to the doctor by recommending to visit a doctor only in urgent cases or with clear symptoms, or fears of being infected related to the visit to the doctor). The perception of being informed about the pandemic was consistently negatively correlated (albeit rather weakly correlated) with current virus anxiety, health anxiety, and cyberchondria. Feeling well informed thus seems to have a buffering and beneficial effect on the emotional state; on the other hand, people who feel well-informed seem to conduct less excessive and burdensome Internet research. This finding is also in line with current models of cyberchondria (

 <xref rid="bib0325" ref-type="bibr">Starcevic &amp; Berle, 2013</xref>). Excessive Internet searches may have started in the hope of gaining information and relief (e.g., positive meta-beliefs such as “I need the Internet research during the pandemic to be better prepared"), but more often, on the contrary, result in a wealth of (often ambiguous) information and increased anxiety.
