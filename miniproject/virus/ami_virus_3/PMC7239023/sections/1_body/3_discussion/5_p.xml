<p id="par0170">In the current study, about half of the respondents reported moderate to severe anxiety associated with SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with previous studies on anxiety in epidemics/pandemics (

 <xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr">Jalloh et al., 2018</xref>). However, direct comparability is difficult because of differences in the samples studied (e.g., general population, students, health-care workers), as well as in the measuring instruments and questions for assessing anxiety, which range from standardized self-report measures with no concrete reference to the epidemic/pandemic to concrete questions of concern about infecting oneself or a family member (

 <xref rid="bib0365" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al. (2020)</xref> found in a survey of the Chinese general population, conducted at a similar time of the virus spread in the country (survey from 31 January to 2 February 2020, about 15,000 confirmed cases), that about 30 % reported anxiety symptoms in a standardized self-report measure without any concrete reference to the pandemic and 75 % were concerned that family members might get infected with SARS-CoV-2. Our result fits well into these findings, as we asked a more general question about anxiety associated with SARS-CoV-2.
