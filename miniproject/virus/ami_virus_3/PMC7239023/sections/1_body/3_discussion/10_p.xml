<p id="par0195">Anxiety about SARS-CoV-2 increased significantly between December 2019 and March 2020, with a particularly strong effect (
 <italic>d</italic> = 1.16) between the end of January and mid-March. As expected, this increase was significantly stronger for individuals with increased health anxiety. This also corresponds to cognitive-behavioral models (

 <xref rid="bib0385" ref-type="bibr">Witthöft &amp; Hiller, 2010</xref>) that trait characteristics (such as trait anxiety) represent a vulnerability to health concerns. Specifically for the context of pandemics, it seems to confirm assumptions that pre-existing health anxiety can be a risk factor for increased anxiety during pandemics (

We also found that when health anxiety and high cyberchondria are combined, virus anxiety is strongest (health anxiety as a moderator)—i.e., when these two factors come together, people suffer from severe anxiety about SARS-CoV-2. In accordance with our hypotheses, the higher the maladaptive emotional regulation, the higher the virus anxiety, and the higher the adaptive emotional regulation, the lower the virus anxiety (although the last correlation was very weak). Additionally, it was found that a combination of a low level of adaptive emotion regulation and a low level of pandemic information is associated with particularly high virus anxiety (adaptive emotion regulation as moderator, 
 <xref rid="fig0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Conversely, a higher level of adaptive emotion regulation and especially a high level of information seem to have a positive effect (i.e. less virus anxiety). In particular, acceptance (to accept what has been experienced and what has happened) and putting into perspective (to put into perspective and compare with worse events, e.g. that there are worse things in life) proved to be significant moderators. This is consistent with previous studies, which also found negative correlations between acceptance and putting into perspective, and anxiety (
