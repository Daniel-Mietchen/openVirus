 <xref rid="bib0395" ref-type="bibr">Xiao et al., 2020a</xref>), this study found that people who work in the health care sector report less virus anxiety. However, to date, hardly any studies have directly compared health care workers with employees in other sectors, and in contrast to other studies, this study has broadly defined the health care sector (e.g., including psychology, nutrition, physiotherapy) and specifically asked about the fear of the virus rather than more general anxiety symptoms. The result of this study could be explained by the fact that healthcare workers are more accurately informed about the virus and the pandemic and are confronted with this issue in their daily work, which could possibly lead to a habituation-like effect.
