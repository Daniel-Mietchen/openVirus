It was hypothesized that trait health anxiety moderates the level of virus anxiety (i.e., a stronger increase in virus anxiety when there is a stronger pre-existing health anxiety) and the relationship between cyberchondria and the current virus anxiety. Regarding emotion regulation, we assumed that dysfunctional emotion regulation has a positive relationship and adaptive emotion regulation a negative relationship with the current virus anxiety. In terms of favorable coping with the pandemic, we expected that the combination of favorable factors (feeling well informed and adaptive emotion regulation) should be associated with low virus anxiety (i.e., adaptive emotion regulation as a moderator in the relationship between being informed and current virus anxiety).</p>
