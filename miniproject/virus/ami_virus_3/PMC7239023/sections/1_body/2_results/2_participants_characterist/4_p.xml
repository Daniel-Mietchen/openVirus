<p id="par0125">The current level of anxiety about the virus (March 2020) showed no significant correlations with age or education (
 <italic>r</italic> ≤ .03, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ .32). However, when considering age categories (16–29, 30–59, and over 60 years of age) we found a significant effect of the age category (
 <italic>F</italic>(2, 1612) = 5.82, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .003, η
 <sub>p</sub>
 <sup>2</sup> = .01) with 30–59 year-olds differing significantly from the younger and older age groups (
 <italic>t</italic>(172.67) ≥ 2.10, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≤ .037, 
 <italic>d</italic> ≥ 0.22), the latter showing no significant difference (
 <italic>t</italic>(152.28) = 0.67, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .51, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.07). Women (
 <italic>M</italic> = 49.47, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 27.00) reported a significantly higher virus anxiety than men (
 <italic>M</italic> = 43.04, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 27.08; 
 <italic>t</italic>(1606) = 3.81, 
 <italic>p</italic> &lt; .001, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.24). College students and participants employed in a health profession (e.g., psychology, medicine, physiotherapy, nursing; 
 <italic>M</italic> = 45.40, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 24.99) reported a significantly lower virus anxiety compared to the other participants (
 <italic>M</italic> = 49.59, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 28.06; 
 <italic>t</italic>(1246.09) = 2.95, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .003, 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.16). With the exception of a very small significant correlation between the current virus anxiety and a SARS-CoV-2 infection in the wider social environment (
 <italic>r</italic> = .07, 
 <italic>p</italic> = .007), no significant correlations between the current virus anxiety and a SARS-Cov-2 infection or the quarantine situation (self, others) were observed (
 <italic>r</italic> ≤ .05, 
 <italic>p</italic> ≥ .06).
