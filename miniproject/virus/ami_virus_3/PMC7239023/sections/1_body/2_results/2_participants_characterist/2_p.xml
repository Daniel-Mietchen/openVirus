 <xref rid="tbl0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> shows the participant characteristics with regard to questions specific to the COVID-19 pandemic and the self-report measures SHAI, CSS
 <sub>Pandemic</sub>, and CERQ-short. First, the characteristics of trait health anxiety (SHAI) and cyberchondria (CSS
 <sub>Pandemic</sub>) were examined to describe the sample. Compared with a meta-analysis on the SHAI (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Alberts et al., 2013</xref>), the average score of the total SHAI in this study (
 <italic>M</italic> = 14.68, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 6.58) was slightly higher with a small effect than the average score found in non-clinical samples according to the meta-analysis (
 <italic>M</italic> = 12.41, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 6.81; 
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.34), but considerably lower compared to individuals with hypochondriasis (
 <italic>M</italic> = 32.58, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 9.57; 
 <italic>d</italic> = 2.18). Compared to an earlier study in the German general population (
 <xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr">Barke et al., 2016</xref>; see average scores in the method), in this study women and men reported higher scores in the subscale "compulsion" (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>women</sub> = 1.85, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 0.96; 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>men</sub> = 1.82, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 0.91) with low to medium effect sizes (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.38 – 0.67) and lower scores in the subscales "excessiveness" (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>women</sub> = 2.15, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 0.91; 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>men</sub> = 1.95, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 0.82) and "reassurance" (
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>women</sub> = 1.62, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 0.76; 
 <italic>M</italic>
 <sub>men</sub> = 1.66, 
 <italic>SD</italic> = 0.83) with low to medium effect sizes (
 <italic>d</italic> = 0.40 – 0.74).
