 <xref rid="bib0225" ref-type="bibr">McElroy &amp; Shevlin, 2014</xref>) uses 15 items to assess five dimensions of cyberchondria: “compulsion” (interruption of everyday activities due to health-related Internet research), “distress” due to Internet research, “excessiveness”, “seeking reassurance”, and “mistrust of medical professionals”. In previous studies, the subscale “mistrust” tended to be a separate construct, so that this subscale was excluded in the present study as well as in previous studies (

 <xref rid="bib0250" ref-type="bibr">Norr, Allan, Boffa, Raines, &amp; Schmidt, 2015</xref>). This version with four subscales is also equivalent to the English short version with 12 items (CSS-12; 
 <xref rid="bib0230" ref-type="bibr">McElroy et al., 2019</xref>). For the current study, the items have been slightly modified so that the Internet research refers to the COVID-19 pandemic (e.g., "I panic when I read online that a symptom I have might be related to the coronavirus pandemic"). The statements are answered using a five-point Likert scale from 1 = never to 5 = always. The CSS proved to be reliable and showed a positive correlation with the mSHAI (
