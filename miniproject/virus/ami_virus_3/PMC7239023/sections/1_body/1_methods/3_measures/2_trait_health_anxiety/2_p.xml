<p id="par0090">The Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI; 
 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">Salkovskis, Rimes, Warwick, &amp; Clark, 2002</xref>) is an 18-item self-report instrument based on the cognitive model of health anxiety and hypochondriasis (
 <xref rid="bib0375" ref-type="bibr">Warwick &amp; Salkovskis, 1990</xref>), which assesses health anxiety over the past 6 months using a multiple choice format (each with four possible statements and coding 0–3). Two subscales are distinguished: (a) health anxiety and the feared likelihood of becoming ill (14 Items) and (b) the feared negative consequences if the illness occurs (4 Items). This study used a validated German version of the SHAI (

 <xref rid="bib0310" ref-type="bibr">Salkovskis et al., 2002</xref>). In a meta-analysis of the SHAI (
 <xref rid="bib0015" ref-type="bibr">Alberts et al., 2013</xref>), an average total score (18 items, item coding: 0–3) of 
 <italic>M</italic> = 12.41 (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 6.81) was found in non-clinical samples (
 <italic>n</italic> = 10 studies) and an average total score of 
 <italic>M</italic> = 32.58 (
 <italic>SD</italic> = 9.57) in samples with patients with hypochondriasis (
 <italic>n</italic> = 5 studies). In the current study, the internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was α = .87 for the total scale, α = .87 for the subscale of health anxiety and feared likelihood of illness, and α = .69 for the subscale of negative consequences of illness.
