For this study, the internal consistencies were α = .76 (self-blame), α = .84 (catastrophization), α = .75 (acceptance), α = .57 (rumination), α = .74 (positive refocusing), α = .67 (refocus on planning), α = .75 (positive reappraisal), α = .72 (putting into perspective), α = .70 (other blame), α = .83 (summarized adaptive strategies), and α = .76 (summarized maladaptive strategies).
