<p id="par0110">Spearman's correlation coefficients were calculated, because most of the variables were not normally distributed. Repeated measures analyses of variance (rANOVA) were calculated for the course of the virus anxiety (the Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment was used to correct for violations of sphericity). The role of trait health anxiety for the virus anxiety course was investigated using a repeated measures analyses of covariance (rANCOVA) with the centered covariate trait health anxiety. For checking the hypotheses on moderation, we used the PROCESS macro in SPSS (

In the moderation analyses, the total scores of the self-report measures were used (for health anxiety, the main subscale with 14 items). For all tests, the alpha level was set at .05 (5 %). Partial eta-squared (η
