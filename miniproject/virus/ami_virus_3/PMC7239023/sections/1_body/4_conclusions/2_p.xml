<p id="par0210">The study was the first to find, during the current COVID-19 pandemic, that health anxiety, cyberchondria, and especially the combination of the two was associated with increased virus anxiety. Regarding potential buffering effects on anxiety, the study found negative correlations between the perception of being informed and the virus anxiety. Current virus anxiety was lowest when individuals use adaptive emotion regulation strategies (acceptance and putting into perspective) and especially when they feel well informed. . These findings may indicate starting points for interventions in times of a virus outbreak, such as the reduction of cyberchondria, providing and disseminating accurate information about the pandemic and effective communication through the media, as well as the promotion of adaptive emotion regulation strategies.</p>
