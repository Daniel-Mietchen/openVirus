<p id="para40">Without adequate surveillance, it is not possible to capture the burden of domestic violence during this pandemic. Because of selection biases, administrative datasets have consistently shown underestimates in the expected rates of domestic violence.

 </xref> Potential approaches to improve the surveillance of domestic violence could include the routine inquiry (feasibly integrated into remote primary care consultations or active syndromic surveillance from local health protection teams) and the urgent implementation of linked datasets between police and health records datasets to identify individuals at risk. Enhancing surveillance would also provide the opportunity to offer targeted support and interventions. Though formal evaluations of current interventions have not yet taken place during the pandemic, national charities (such as, but not limited to, Women's Aid, Safelives, and the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty against Children) have produced guidance for how survivors can both report violence, abuse, and neglect and keep themselves safe, including information on remote reporting and support mechanisms.
