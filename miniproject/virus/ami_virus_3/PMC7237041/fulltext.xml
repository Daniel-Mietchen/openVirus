The epidemics of Zika and chikungunya in Latin America have also highlighted the risks of international spread of arboviruses. The spread of YF to Asia, where the virus has not yet been detected despite the presence of competent vectors, could have a major negative public health impact [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In response, in 2016, the World Health Organisation (WHO) adopted a strategy to Eliminate Yellow fever Epidemics (EYE) by 2026. This strategy aims to prevent sporadic cases sparking urban outbreaks, thus minimizing the risk of international spread [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The EYE strategy largely relies on, but is not limited to, scale-up of vaccination.</p><p>Vaccination activities considered in the EYE strategy consist of routine immunization of infants, preventive mass vaccination campaigns (PMVCs) that target all or most age groups, preventive catch-up campaigns targeting specific cohorts or unvaccinated sub-populations, and reactive campaigns in outbreak situations. Local assessment of YF transmission intensity is key for the prioritization of each of these vaccination activities; particularly since the supply of vaccine is limited as seen during the 2016 Angola outbreak [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Vaccine demand forecasts are critical to shape vaccine production and ensure optimal vaccine allocation.</p><p>Previous mathematical models have assessed geographical heterogeneity in YF risk [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, modelling YF is challenging because of the co-existence of different transmission cycles [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In the sylvatic cycle, tree-dwelling mosquitoes transmit the virus within the wildlife reservoir (non-human primates) and spill-over infection may occur for humans living or working in jungle habitats. In the urban cycle, the domestic mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> transmits the virus between humans. Population (&#x02018;herd&#x02019;) immunity (whether via natural infection or vaccination) will be expected to modify transmission intensity within the urban cycle, but not in the sylvatic cycle where transmission intensity is driven by non-human primates and their interactions with human populations. Recently, two models quantifying the incidence of the disease in Africa or worldwide have been used to derive estimates for vaccination impact [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Both assumed a constant force of infection over time. A static force of infection, unaffected by susceptible fraction in the population reflects the sylvatic rather than the urban transmission cycle of the disease. As a corollary, these models disregarded possible herd effects that may arise in urban context due to changing population-level immunity.</p><p>Recent evidence suggested the sylvatic YF transmission cycle to be predominant in the Brazilian epidemiological context [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is a consensus that both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles play significant roles in the global burden of YF in Africa, though the relative contribution of each is unknown [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the absence of estimates of the relative contribution of zoonotic versus human-to-human transmission, one approach could consist in exploring both extreme scenarios of 100% of sylvatic versus urban transmission. Such an approach would allow to compare burden estimates and vaccine impact while disregarding or maximizing, respectively, the effect of herd immunity.</p><p>Accelerated urbanization and increasing human population mobility might increase the contribution of the urban transmission cycle to the global YF burden. Urban cases have the potential to trigger explosive outbreaks that can place a substantial burden on health systems, as well as causing significant social and economic impacts. Both the large number of cases arising in urban outbreaks, and the higher connectivity of affected populations compared to the, typically, much more remote settings in which sylvatic transmission occurs, make international spread more likely. Thus, accounting for specific features of urban transmission will be useful to assess the risk of urban outbreaks and refine the estimates of vaccine impact.</p><p>In this paper, we have extended a previously developed model [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] to account for specific features of inter-human transmission. We then compare this model to the previous version (which focussed on sylvatic transmission) and update previous estimates of YF burden and vaccine impact, accounting for indirect effects. Lastly, based on local estimates of the potential for inter-human urban transmission, we propose different scenarios of PMVCs that could be considered for the EYE strategy, evaluating vaccine demand and impact in terms of infections and mortality averted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec005"><title>Methods</title><p>The Yellow Fever burden model [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] was developed to estimate YF disease burden and vaccine impact across 34 African countries at high or moderate risk for YF [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The original model was developed assuming that the locally-fitted force of infection (the annual probability of infection for a susceptible individual), <italic>&#x003bb;</italic>, was constant in time. Here, we updated the previous constant version of the model by integrating novel serological data updating demographic data as well as recent vaccination activities and records of the disease. Moreover, we present a new, alternative, variant of the model parametrised by the locally-fitted basic reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub>, which allows the resulting force of infection to vary dynamically as population-level immunity changes over time.</p><sec id="sec006"><title>Model overview</title><p>A complete description of the model is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s002">S1 Appendix</xref>. Briefly, both model variants include a generalized linear model (GLM) fitted to the presence or absence of any reported YF event between 1984 and 2013 at the first sub-national administrative level (province) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s001">S1 Table</xref>), using various environmental and demographic covariates together with a country-based proxy for surveillance quality. We defined a reported YF event as either outbreak reports published by WHO or laboratory-confirmed cases reported in a YF surveillance database managed by WHO-AFRO, to which 21 countries contribute.</p><p>The GLM provides estimates of the probability of any YF report across the endemic zone over the 30-year period considered. In a second step, we describe this probability of a report as dependent on the number of infections and on the unknown rate of under-reporting (which was assumed to vary between but not within countries). This latter parameter was calibrated to independent estimates of transmission intensity, obtained by fitting 12 serological surveys performed in 11 African countries.</p><p>The two model versions differ in the way they fit serological data. In the static version of the model (FOI model) a constant, age-independent force of infection (FOI) <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> is fitted to each serological survey. Alternatively, in the dynamical version of the model (<italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model), a basic reproduction number <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> is fitted, based on the classical SIR model framework under the assumption of endemic equilibrium transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>The GLM quantifies geographic variation of the relative risk of YF report across the continent while each serological survey yields an estimate of the absolute transmission intensity in its specific location. For each of the 31 survey locations we can therefore estimate the local level of under-ascertainment by tying GLM predictions to estimated values of <italic>&#x003bb;</italic> or <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> whilst accounting for time-dependent vaccination coverage [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This level of under-ascertainment was then extrapolated across the endemic zone and the absolute transmission intensity was then inferred by combining it with the probability of YF report.</p><p>By extrapolating this estimated level of under-ascertainment, we may infer the absolute transmission intensity across the continent from the GLM predictions.</p><p>The main difference in the dynamics of the FOI and <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> models lies in the way they respond to vaccination. In the FOI model, the susceptible population is reduced by vaccination but the per-capita risk of infection of remaining susceptible individuals remains unchanged, always resulting in a non-zero number of new infections with imperfect vaccination coverage. In contrast, the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model responds non-linearly to vaccination coverage: if, for a specific year, vaccination activities happen to increase the immunized proportion of the population above the herd immunity threshold, <italic>1 &#x02212; 1/ R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> (the formula defining the critical vaccination coverage), then we assumed that no new infection will be expected in that year. In that case, the unvaccinated proportion of the population is indirectly but fully protected by herd immunity. Note that when there is no history of vaccination, the <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> model reproduces the FOI model.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Model fitting and burden estimates</title><p>The model is fitted in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.

We defined the lifetime impact of vaccination as the cumulative burden difference over the 2000&#x02013;2100 time period between the baseline scenario, ie the burden calculated using the best estimates of vaccination coverage, and a counterfactual scenario of no vaccination. For each scenario, we summed the burden across each year between 2000&#x02013;2100 and across all ages, before calculating the difference between the no-vaccination and the baseline scenario. Considering such a time horizon ensures we capture vaccine impact over most of the lifetime of people vaccinated and those benefitting from the resulting herd immunity.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Model validation</title><p>We conducted an out-of-sample validation process using the data of three recent serological surveys from the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan and Chad in 2015.

Such a strategy would prevent 9,900,000 (7,000,000&#x02013;13,400,000) infections and 480,000 (180,000&#x02013;1,140,000) deaths over the lifetime of the vaccinees, corresponding to 1.7 (0.7&#x02013;4.1) deaths averted per 1,000 vaccine doses (assuming no doses wasting) (<xref rid="pntd.0008304.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).

We also estimated that PMVCs conducted since 2005 will prevent a total of 3 to 6 million deaths over the lifetime of vaccinees, depending on whether we disregard or maximize herd effects, respectively. As both sylvatic and urban transmission cycles (with none or maximal herd effects, respectively) do contribute to the disease burden, the real impact of vaccination likely lies between these two extreme cases. Finally, we derived estimates of vaccine demand and impact of future PMVCs under a variety of targeted vaccination scenarios. We estimated that allocating a 37.7 million doses per year between 2018 and 2026 for PMVCs would prevent 9.89 (6.96&#x02013;13.3) million YF infections and thus considerably reduce the risk of international spread.</p><p>The model we developed combines a risk-map derived from occurrence data with transmission intensity estimates in order to infer burden. Such an approach also provides valuable results for other diseases, such as dengue [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. We estimated approximately 200,000 annual YF severe cases occurred before 2005 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s008">S5 Fig</xref>), that is before the implementation of PMVCs in West Africa. These results are consistent with previous estimates suggested over the recent decades [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], while providing better insight about spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the burden of the disease, especially for the post-PMVCs period. Uncertainty in our results is substantial, covering more than one order of magnitude for some estimates. As our model integrates all existing data on YF that are currently available for Africa, such uncertainty reflects the current lack of accurate knowledge regarding YF incidence and epidemiology.</p><p>The two model variants we developed exhibited substantial differences in resulting estimates of YF burden and vaccine impact, especially for the recent period. By integrating herd effects as an important component of urban transmission, the impact of vaccination estimated in the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model was roughly twice that estimated in the FOI model, which represents sylvatic transmission. Cases&#x02019; characteristics and environmental assessment suggested a sylvatic origin of the 2016 Uganda outbreak [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Similarly, the lack of a large number of urban cases indicates a primarily sylvatic source for the 2017&#x02013;2018 Nigeria outbreak [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. On the contrary, the 2016 YF outbreak in Angola provided evidence of a large contribution of the urban transmission cycle [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. None of these model variants we developed was correct, as both were considering a unique YF transmission cycle, and neither model performed systematically better than the other in predicting transmission intensity, suggesting that the transmission cycle to preferably consider may depend on the setting. The estimates from both models should therefor by seen as two extreme scenarios of sylvatic or human-to-human, transmission only, with no or maximized herd effects, respectively. The reality of yellow fever transmission probably lies within these bounds. Better understanding the relative contribution of the different transmission routes may affect control strategies. While vaccination prevents both sylvatic and urban transmission, vector population control interventions appear relevant in urban settings but may not be feasible to protect populations exposed to sylvatic mosquitoes. A recent study tried to disentangle the contribution of each transmission cycle in Brazil [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, this analysis relied on detailed spatiotemporal and genomic data not currently available for Africa.</p><p>Assumptions on the global contribution of both transmission cycles have important effects on vaccine impact estimates, which in turn may impact prioritization across diseases by vaccine funders. By disregarding herd immunity, the FOI model version likely produces underestimates of vaccine impact. This model variant may thus be preferred for a conservative estimates of vaccine impact and demand. However, the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model version remains of interest to produce &#x0201c;best-case&#x0201d; scenario of vaccine impact maximizing herd effects. Moreover, the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model can be used to derive important epidemiological parameters, such as the CVC, for specific contexts where zoonotic transmission is unlikely (mostly, urban contexts). Combining estimates of model variants that rely on different assumptions and structures in a way that can reliably inform decision making remains a challenge. Bayesian model averaging methods have been suggested to better combine such estimates [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>The models used to estimate the burden and subsequently the impact of vaccination are fitted to data of reported YF events over a 30-years period in order to smooth over the long and irregular cycles of epidemic activity sweeping across the continent, such as the re-emergence during 1985&#x02013;95 [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These data show a pattern of near-ubiquitous presence in large swathes of West Africa, with more patchy presence in Central and East Africa, which in turn determine the gradient in transmission intensity seen in the model. Due to the very widespread YF presence in West Africa, the model lacks resolution for estimating the exact level of transmission intensity in this area. Under-reporting of cases and transmission intensity are estimated by fitting serological surveys data from Central and Eastern Africa. Unfortunately, high quality surveys from West Africa are lacking. Of note, our validation assessment revealed that the model produces reasonable predictions across settings exhibiting varying levels of seroprevalence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s003">S2 Appendix</xref>). This may be seen as a case for the validity of our model across a range of transmission intensity levels.</p><p>Our estimates of under-reporting of the disease (ranging between 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) may appear low at first glance. However, there are several considerations to keep in mind when interpreting these estimates. Firstly, these are estimates of per-infection detection probability, while only about 10% of all infections are estimated to lead to severe disease [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Secondly, the symptoms associated with mild or even severe yellow fever infections are wide and non-specific. This leads to cases being frequently confused with severe malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis or infections with other flaviviruses. Thirdly, our under-reporting estimates constitute an average over a 30-year time period (1984&#x02013;2013). Regional capacities for laboratory confirmation of diagnostic was quite limited over a large part of this time period [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. During this time period, official case detection reported the virtual absence of reported cases in some years [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], while the annual burden was estimated around 200,000 cases at the same time [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>While the FOI model variant assumes a constant local infection risk for those unvaccinated, the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model variant relies on the assumption of endemic equilibrium, which allows long periods without transmission if population-level vaccination coverage exceeds the CVC and therefore suppresses transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. While for an epidemic disease this might appear an unrealistic assumption, one can consider that over the course of many years the higher incidence during epidemics balances the low incidence in inter-epidemic periods to achieve the equilibrium level on average. The endemic equilibrium assumption might also appear unrealistic for low transmission settings, especially in Eastern Africa. However, both model variants were designed in order to converge in the absence of vaccination. Thus, in large regions of Eastern Africa with no history of vaccination, both model variants resulted in similar burden estimates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pntd.0008304.s009">S6D Fig</xref>). We can thus consider that the endemic equilibrium assumption did not yield to massive overestimation in the disease burden for low-transmission settings. Neither model variant completely captures the epidemic character of the disease driven by rapid depletion of susceptible hosts during explosive outbreaks, slow host renewal in inter-epidemic periods and sporadic disease reintroductions. By design, these models are also unable to account for short-term changes in disease transmission that could have resulted from recent changes in land use or other ecosystems degradation. Instead, these models were designed to capture spatial heterogeneity in the burden and estimate long-term average vaccine impact.</p><p>Both model fitting and projections are based on vaccine-coverage estimates derived from a demographic model combining different sources of data regarding vaccination activities [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A majority of the data related to past vaccination activities are available under the form of the coverage achieved in specific areas. Transforming achieved coverage back into a number of doses would require numerous assumptions in term of doses wasting or multiple doses for the same individual. Estimating the number of vaccine doses for past activities could thus lead to overestimation of past vaccination effectiveness that would be difficult to quantify. Concurrent estimates for vaccine coverage have been recently developed [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although overall consistent with ours, these estimates appeared to disregard several recent large-scale campaigns in West and Central Africa [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Uncertainty in vaccination coverage is not directly accounted for in our model, but may be propagated in the vaccine efficacy parameter. Indeed, the posterior distribution of vaccine efficacy is much wider than the range documented in a recent meta-analysis [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], especially for the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> variant which is expected to be more sensitive to vaccine coverage. Lastly, in the absence of more detailed data, vaccination activities were often assumed to be implemented homogeneously across space in particular for routine immunization, glossing over existing heterogeneities in coverage. Recent efforts to document such heterogeneity, such as the YF EPI warning system developed by the WHO, are thus welcome [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>Our model has several limitations but also some strengths compared with past work. We captured spatial heterogeneity in the disease using a statistical rather than a mechanistic approach. Our model does not explicitly represent the spatial distribution of vectors nor disease reservoirs unlike Shearer et al&#x02019;s model [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. However, the set of spatial predictors we used has been demonstrated to have good predictive power for both presence and seasonality of YF [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Moreover, the environmental covariate we used as spatial predictor for case reports are frequently used to predict the spatial distribution of vectors or reservoirs [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. To our knowledge, our model is the only one calibrated against serological data that captures the whole spectrum of disease severity. Other YF burden estimates stem from models calibrated on reported cases [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], that may lead to underestimation due to under-reporting and misdiagnosis. For instance, the Global Burden of Disease estimates for 2016 around 5,000 YF-deaths in Africa, which is near to the lower bound of our <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> model estimates. Lastly, the development of the <italic>R</italic><sub><italic>0</italic></sub> variant of our model constitutes a novel approach to account for herd effects in the impact of YF vaccination. Our results highlight that heterogeneity in transmission intensity imply different vaccination threshold to be reached in order to prevent YF outbreaks. This can be used to locally adapt the empirical threshold of 80% vaccination coverage that is often considered sufficient for YF outbreak prevention [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Using local estimates of the potential for urban outbreaks for PMVCs prioritization, we explored several vaccination scenarios ranking from a parsimonious strategy focussed on high-risk areas to an ambitious large-scale approach targeting the vast majority of provinces within the at-risk region. The individual assessment for each strategy was conducted under optimistic assumptions, thus resulting expected vaccine impact is overestimated; however this choice may not have massively affected the comparison across strategies. Recent years have shown that efforts to control YF outbreaks were highly constrained by the stock of vaccine doses available for emergency situation [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Optimal vaccine allocation is also crucial in the context of preventive vaccination activities. By contrasting the impact of several scenarios with the corresponding vaccine demand, and also by suggesting a sequence of implementation within each scenario, this study helps in the search for optimal vaccine allocation. We do acknowledge however that a realistic strategy will need to take into account further factors such as operational or political concerns.</p><p>Patterns of YF transmission seem to have changed in the recent years toward shorter transition from the sylvatic cycle to urban inter-human transmission [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Renewed disease control strategies thus need to account for this change in implementation of control measures. This study addressed this challenge by developing a vaccine impact modelling framework accounting for urban YF transmission. This work has contributed to a risk assessment conducted as part of the EYE strategy in order to prioritize countries for PMVCs [<xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec012"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008304.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Presence or absence of any reported yellow fever event between 1984 and 2013 at the first sub-national administrative level in 34 African countries.</title><p>(CSV)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008304.s001.csv"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008304.s002"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Model description.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008304.s002.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008304.s003"><label>S2 Appendix</label><caption><title>Model validation.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0008304.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0008304.s004"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Observed versus predicted presence/absence of any yellow fever reported event between 1984 and 2013.</title><p>A: Presence (red) or absence (white) of YF report between 1984 and 2013, B: GLM prediction for probability of report for the FOI model; C: GLM prediction for probability of report for the R0 model.
