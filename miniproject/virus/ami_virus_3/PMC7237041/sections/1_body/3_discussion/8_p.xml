<p>Both model fitting and projections are based on vaccine-coverage estimates derived from a demographic model combining different sources of data regarding vaccination activities [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. A majority of the data related to past vaccination activities are available under the form of the coverage achieved in specific areas. Transforming achieved coverage back into a number of doses would require numerous assumptions in term of doses wasting or multiple doses for the same individual. Estimating the number of vaccine doses for past activities could thus lead to overestimation of past vaccination effectiveness that would be difficult to quantify. Concurrent estimates for vaccine coverage have been recently developed [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Although overall consistent with ours, these estimates appeared to disregard several recent large-scale campaigns in West and Central Africa [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Uncertainty in vaccination coverage is not directly accounted for in our model, but may be propagated in the vaccine efficacy parameter. Indeed, the posterior distribution of vaccine efficacy is much wider than the range documented in a recent meta-analysis [

 </sub> variant which is expected to be more sensitive to vaccine coverage. Lastly, in the absence of more detailed data, vaccination activities were often assumed to be implemented homogeneously across space in particular for routine immunization, glossing over existing heterogeneities in coverage. Recent efforts to document such heterogeneity, such as the YF EPI warning system developed by the WHO, are thus welcome [
