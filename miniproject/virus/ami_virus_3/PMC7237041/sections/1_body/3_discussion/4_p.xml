<p>Assumptions on the global contribution of both transmission cycles have important effects on vaccine impact estimates, which in turn may impact prioritization across diseases by vaccine funders. By disregarding herd immunity, the FOI model version likely produces underestimates of vaccine impact. This model variant may thus be preferred for a conservative estimates of vaccine impact and demand. However, the

 </sub> model can be used to derive important epidemiological parameters, such as the CVC, for specific contexts where zoonotic transmission is unlikely (mostly, urban contexts). Combining estimates of model variants that rely on different assumptions and structures in a way that can reliably inform decision making remains a challenge. Bayesian model averaging methods have been suggested to better combine such estimates [
