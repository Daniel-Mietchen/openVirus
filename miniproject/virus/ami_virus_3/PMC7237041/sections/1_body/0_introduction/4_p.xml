<p>Recent evidence suggested the sylvatic YF transmission cycle to be predominant in the Brazilian epidemiological context [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, there is a consensus that both urban and sylvatic transmission cycles play significant roles in the global burden of YF in Africa, though the relative contribution of each is unknown [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,
 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In the absence of estimates of the relative contribution of zoonotic versus human-to-human transmission, one approach could consist in exploring both extreme scenarios of 100% of sylvatic versus urban transmission. Such an approach would allow to compare burden estimates and vaccine impact while disregarding or maximizing, respectively, the effect of herd immunity.
