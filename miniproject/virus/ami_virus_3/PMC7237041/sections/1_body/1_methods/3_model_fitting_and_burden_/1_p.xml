<p>The model is fitted in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. We assumed a prior distribution for vaccine efficacy centred at 97.5% (95% confidence intervals: 82.9% to 99.7%) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008304.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The models were fitted based on the best yearly estimates of vaccination coverage [
