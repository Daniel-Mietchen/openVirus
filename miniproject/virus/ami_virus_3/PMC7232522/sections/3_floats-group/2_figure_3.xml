  <p>Routes of NiV transmission. Different locations have different routes of transmission. (
   <bold>A</bold>) In Malaysia, bat bitten fruits contaminated with NiV-M were consumed by pigs and workers handling the pigs were infected with NiV-M. (
   <bold>B</bold>) In Bangladesh, bat saliva- and excreta-contaminated palm sap consumption lead to NiV-B infection in humans and was spread further via nosocomial mode. Infected bats shed the virus in their urine, excreta and saliva. (
   <bold>C</bold>) In India, the possibility of direct bat-to-human transmission has been reported in Kerala state, but this was not supported by adequate evidence. Nosocomial spread of NiV-B have been reported in two different statesâ€”Kerala and West Bengal.
