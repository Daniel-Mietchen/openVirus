 <caption>
  <p>Representation of Nipah virus (NiV) structure. The RNA genome attached to the N, P, and L proteins form the ribonucleoprotein complex which is surrounded by a lipid bilayer envelope studded with two envelope glycoproteins G and F. The RNA encodes six structural proteins: N, P, M, F, G and L. The matrix protein M associates with the inner part of the envelope. The structural proteins, RNA and lipid bilayer are indicated in different colors.</p>
