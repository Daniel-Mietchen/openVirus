<p>Outbreaks of various zoonotic viruses occur as a result of the influence of several factors including human-to-human contact and animal interaction with severe environmental changes [

 <xref rid="B13-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Anthropogenic factors have led to an emergence of viral diseases by creating a drastic imbalance in the ecosystem and the environment. Climate change, depleting resources, deforestation and changes in natural terrains, farming and industrialization are also significant factors which result in the outbreaks of viral diseases. In this context, we describe the epidemiological background of the earlier NiV outbreak, the mode of transmission, preventive and control measures and the factors that may have contributed to the outbreak.
