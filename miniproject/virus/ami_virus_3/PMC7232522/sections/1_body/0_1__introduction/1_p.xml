 <xref rid="B2-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="B3-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is one among the emerging deadly zoonotic viruses and is included in the order Mononegavirales among other dreaded viruses such as Hendra, Ebola and Marburg [

 <xref rid="B8-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Recurring NiV outbreaks have been reported annually in different parts of Bangladesh from 2001, where the infection occurred due to the consumption of raw date palm sap contaminated with saliva and excreta of the bats. In India, the first outbreak occurred in Siliguri, West Bengal in 2001 with mostly nosocomial or person-to-person close contact, and in 2007, a repeated outbreak was reported in Nadia in West Bengal [

Recently, in 2018, a NiV outbreak was recorded in the Kozhikode district of Kerala, a South Indian state where the index patient was reported to have contracted NiV from fruit-eating bats. However, no clinical or statistical evidence was available to prove the incidence, though the spread was mostly through nosocomial infection. All the outbreaks have recorded high rates of fatality including the 91% mortality rate during the recent Kerala outbreak [
