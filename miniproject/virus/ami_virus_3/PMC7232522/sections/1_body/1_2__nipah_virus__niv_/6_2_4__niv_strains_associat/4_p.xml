<p>NiV-M and NiV-B studies with African green monkeys demonstrated a 50% mortality on NiV-M infection while all experimental subjects infected with NiV-B succumbed to death [

 <xref rid="B56-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. In spite of these experimental data, more research is required to elucidate the role of NiV genes and proteins in disease pathogenesis. The similarities in symptoms of NiV infection in 
 <italic>in vivo</italic> African green monkeys and clinical presentation of NiV in humans may be attributed to the close relation of monkeys to humans in comparison to ferrets and hamsters.
