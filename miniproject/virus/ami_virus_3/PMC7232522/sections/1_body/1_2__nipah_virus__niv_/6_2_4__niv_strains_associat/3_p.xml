<p>Although NiV-B has been reported to cause repeated outbreaks, surprisingly, all in vitro and in vivo therapeutic research have utilized the NiV-M strain rather than the more prevalent NiV-B strain. Animal models of hamsters, ferrets and African green monkeys have been used to study the infection dynamics and disease patterns caused by both strains [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Comparing NiV-M and NiV-B infections in hamsters, NiV-M showed rapid disease pathogenesis and cytopathic effects whereas disease progression, immune response and viral replication was delayed in NiV-B infected animals. NiV-M was also found to be more pathogenic during in vivo infections of hamsters [

 <xref rid="B55-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. Notably, these results showed an increased disease progression and fatality rates in NiV-M-infected models, contrasting to the NiV-B infections in human outbreaks. The ferret model revealed a similar pathological presentation and disease upon NiV-M and NiV-B infections. However, the NiV-M-infected ferretsâ€™ blood measured a higher viral load while a higher rate of virus shredding was observed in the oral secretions of NiV-B-infected ferrets suggesting a valid reason for the high person-to-person transmission rates in NiV-B outbreaks [
