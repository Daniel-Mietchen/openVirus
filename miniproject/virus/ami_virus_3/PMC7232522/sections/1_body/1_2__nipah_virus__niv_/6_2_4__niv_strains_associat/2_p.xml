<p>The two NiV strains are responsible for the outbreaks in various geographical areas. Bangladesh and Indian outbreaks have reported the source of the virus to be NiV-B while the Malaysian outbreaks were reported to be from NiV-M [
 <xref rid="B49-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Clinical reports have uncovered several differences between NiV-M and NiV-B outbreaks. NiV-B has a shorter incubation period compared to NiV-M [

 <xref rid="B51-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, NiV-B infection resulted in a higher mortality rate compared to NiV-M. This difference could be attributed to inadequate regional medical care [
