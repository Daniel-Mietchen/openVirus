<p>In 2019, a recurring incidence of NiV was reported where one patient tested positive for NiV at the Ernakulam district of Kerala. A farsighted approach by the Kerala state government helped to tackle the 2019 outbreak. Approximately 300 contact persons, who had contact with the infected patient, were closely monitored for any possible Nipah-like symptoms. The index patient was moved to a strict isolation facility and keenly monitored, while the contact cases were advised to stay indoors and there was immediate reporting in case of any possible symptoms. As a precaution, monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of NiV were arranged from Australia in order to restrain any possible sporadic outbreak. Moreover, a fast and accurate diagnosis was facilitated by setting up test facilities within regional medical institutions. The recovery of the index case and containing the viral spread brought in huge accolades to the health sector and to government interventions in containing NiV during 2019.</p>
