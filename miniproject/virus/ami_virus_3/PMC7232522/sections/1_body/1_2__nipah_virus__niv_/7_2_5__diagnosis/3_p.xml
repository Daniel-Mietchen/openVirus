<p>Next generation sequencing is an alternative method aiding in effective identification of viral strain, however the method is not frequently used in diagnosis and when considering expenses. Another safe method for detecting NiV is immunohistochemistry since it uses formalin-fixed tissue samples [

ELISA is often followed by a serum neutralisation test or PCR. Virus isolation and neutralisation methods are also used for diagnosis but are constrained to BSL-4 facilities [
