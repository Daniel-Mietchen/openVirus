<p>The most preferred and extremely sensitive diagnostic method is PCR. The conserved segments of viral genome, N, M and P are often targeted for the reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and nested PCR analysis. Though expensive, real-time RT-PCR, because of its extreme sensitivity, is employed extensively for NiV detection/diagnosis. Sensitivity of these techniques can be compromised if the viral genome undergoes rapid mutations [
