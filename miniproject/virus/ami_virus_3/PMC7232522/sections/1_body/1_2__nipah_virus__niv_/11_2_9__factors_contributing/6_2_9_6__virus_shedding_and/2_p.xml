<p>Transient epidemic waves are short pulses of pathogens re-establishing in roosts or new pathogens colonizing due to resident pathogen clear off among metapopulations of bats. Viruses of low virulence could infect and spread in and out of populations suppressed by the bats immunity and could re-emerge on immunity reduction along with other stressing factors leading to a short pulse or waves of infection [
