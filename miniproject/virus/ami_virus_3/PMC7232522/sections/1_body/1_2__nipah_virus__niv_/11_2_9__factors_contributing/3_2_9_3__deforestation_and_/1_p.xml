<p>Deforestation in the SEA region is considered to be happening at an alarming rate due to gracing and farmland development, industrialization and urbanization. Deforestation has been linked to human interactions with Ebola-infected bats and the outbreak of Ebola in Africa [

Similar droughts resulting from El Nino have been reported from Kerala in 2016, though changes in the fruiting and pattern of bat foraging needs to be studied. Drought in the regions could reflect in a reduced availability of natural fruit forcing the bats to resort to fruiting trees in gardens and orchards existing in dense human habitats. Crop raising and fruit trees in close proximities to traditionally designed pig sties have contributed to the spillover of NiV to pigs via bat-bitten fruits [
