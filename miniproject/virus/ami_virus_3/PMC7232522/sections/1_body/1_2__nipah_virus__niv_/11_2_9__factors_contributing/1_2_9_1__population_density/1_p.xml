<p>Human population is on the rise and is always dependent on factors such as availability of resources, climate, trade and development. The presence of NiV has been reported in some of the most densely populous regions of the world, the South East Asia region (SEAR) [

Population density also accounts for the high rate of interaction among individuals and between environments. Co-existence of farm animals in dense human inhabitation has a high risk of virus spillover. Populations of reservoir hosts, intermediate hosts and dead-end hosts may overlap in denser populations leading to a sporadic spillover and species barrier breach.
