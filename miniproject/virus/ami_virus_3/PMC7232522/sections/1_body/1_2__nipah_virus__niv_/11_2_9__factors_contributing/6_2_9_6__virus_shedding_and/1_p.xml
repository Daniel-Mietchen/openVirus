<p>Factors leading to virus shedding include physiological and environmental bat stress, weakened immunity, reduced maternal immunity, infection in new born and roost population and interaction, ultimately reducing food availability [
 <xref rid="B75-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Hypotheses with broader and differing concepts have been employed for a better understanding of the phenomena. Spillover and different episodes of pathogen shedding has been conceptualized from the persistent infections existing within bat populations during weakened immunity. High antibody titer and persistent pathogens from healthy bats form the base to the concept.
