<p>Deforestation accounts for the major loss in bat habitats. Pteropus bats are frugivorous and nectarivorous and are known to reside in tropical forests across continents. They help disperse seeds of native and agro-economically important plants and crops. They are the sole pollinators in many oceanic islands apart from restoring the genetic diversity in intervened forest lands. Fruit collection, deforestation and tourism have contributed heavily to habitat loss. Human intervention in various modes reduce bat foraging, propensity and feeding habits and could impact on their physiology and immunology. Potentiating the hypothetical ideas on viral dynamics among the bat populations and their offspring, horizontal in contrast to vertical transmission has been identified as a major mode of NiV spread among the bat reservoir population [
