<p>Outbreaks similar to Kerala could be prevented by minimizing the patient-to-caretaker/attendant exposure via bodily fluids and close contact. Food materials, mats and sheets, dresses and patient aid materials of all sorts should only be handled when wearing masks and gloves. Proper incineration of the patient aids, the gloves and masks worn by the caretaker/attendant should be ensured. To reduce contracting the disease and its nosocomial spread, medical practitioners should wear proper personal protective equipment (PPE) while consulting encephalitic patients demonstrating NiV symptoms and should be moved to isolation from public on confirmation. Incineration of the corpse are the best practice, although burial of the corpse of the infected are not warranted, deep burial to a depth of 10ft along with proper PPE and disinfection of the handlers and burial land was followed in Kerala for particular cases on religious grounds. Contact with tissues or body fluids of the corpse may transmit NiV to healthy people [

However, it is unclear how long the infectious virus can survive in carcasses because no such data are available yet. Developing nations unable to afford the excessive demand for PPEâ€™s should ensure that attendants and caretakers are cleaning their hands and body extremities with disinfectants like 70% alcohol or washing with soap and water.
