<p>Regional administration and the state government with the support of the national government announced the scenario to be a national emergency situation. Proper awareness and strict protocols formed by the national health authorities to be observed towards handling the condition were publicized widely through printed media, public broadcasts and social media. High alerts were made in affected areas and public meetings, gatherings and the conduct of mass events were revoked to contain further spread through close aids. Strict measures against misleading messages were ensured. Records of the ill residents from the affected area were mandated towards proper surveillance of the outbreak. Rigorous sampling and testing for any new NiV infection incidences along with individuals having visited the affected area were monitored. All control measures were withdrawn upon proper assertion of zero incidence cases with double the incubation period. Towards reducing the disease burden, governments approached international agencies for the urgent supply of antivirals and vaccines under trials. A very similar approach towards controlling and containing an annual successive outbreak succeeded with a single infection and no casualties. Proper observation of the preventive measures with proper awareness among the public lead to the successful containment.</p>
