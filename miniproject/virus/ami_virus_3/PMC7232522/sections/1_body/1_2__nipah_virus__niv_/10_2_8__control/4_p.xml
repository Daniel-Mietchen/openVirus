<p>Though outbreaks have been reported in India coinciding with the first Bangladesh outbreak, in Siliguri and Nadia of West Bengal state, specific pathogens leading to the outbreak could not be identified. Misconception due to the prevalence of Japanese encephalitis in the region led to identification as an NiV outbreak. Kerala being na√Øve to NiV infections had no previous records of an acute encephalitic, severe respiratory distress syndrome. Similar to earlier outbreaks, the index cases were assumed to be infected with Japanese encephalitis and had been rationally diagnosed to be an NiV infection. Proper health measures with well-instructed protocols and high vigilant government support helped in systematically containing a highly lethal and sporadic nosocomial outbreak with very few victims. </p>
