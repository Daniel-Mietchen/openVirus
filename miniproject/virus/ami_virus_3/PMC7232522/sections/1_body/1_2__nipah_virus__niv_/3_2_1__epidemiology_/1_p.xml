<p>Fruit bats of the genus Pteropus (flying foxes) are the natural reservoirs for NiV [

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. They feed on fruits and nectar and are found predominantly in areas around farms and orchards, limiting the barrier of spillover of the viruses [
 <xref rid="B5-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The bats are endemic to tropical and subtropical regions of Asia, East Africa, Australian continents and some oceanic islands and are proved to be associated with the NiV outbreaks reported in different parts of the world (

 <xref rid="B6-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Being the natural hosts for NiV, bats are symptomless carriers but they shed the viruses in their saliva, urine, semen and excreta [

 <xref rid="B23-viruses-12-00465" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] have been found positive for NiV-neutralizing antibodies during the serological surveillance studies. The route of transmission occurs via contact with excretions or secretions of infected animals, ingestion of fruit contaminated with NiV or close contact with infected human bodily fluids [
