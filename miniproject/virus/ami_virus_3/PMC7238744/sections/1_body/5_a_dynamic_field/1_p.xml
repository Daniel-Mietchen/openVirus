<p>Given the infancy of the field and the large volume of COVID-19 related research, the rapid reviews need regular updates to remain relevant. Until now, we have updated one rapid review, which serves as an example of the evolving evidence base: We published the first rapid review on the relationship between age, comorbidity and disease severity on 26 March [
 <xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. At that time, we only identified three studies with the multivariate analyses needed to distinguish between the effect of age and of comorbidities. Three weeks later, in our updated review [
 <xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], we were able to include 12 studies with multivariate analyses. Our comment in the discussion section expresses the frustration that many may feel when assessing large amounts of COVID-19 research articles, often of questionable quality: “
 <italic>There seems to be an abundance of publications reporting on small samples of patients, with simple univariate analyses of risk factors for severe COVID-19. In our view, such studies contribute little to improving our understanding of the importance of various risk factors. We encourage medical journals to refuse publication of additional research papers with small sample sizes, and to require multivariate analysis.</italic>”
