<p>Evidence-informed decision-making should rely on the best available evidence, typically in the form of systematic reviews [

 <xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], at its onset there were very few systematic reviews to base decisions on. In addition, systematic reviews on COVID-19-related topics were likely to become rapidly outdated, given the large number of new study reports published daily.
