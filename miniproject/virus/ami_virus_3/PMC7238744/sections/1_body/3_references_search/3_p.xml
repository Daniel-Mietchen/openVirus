<p>The team members individually screened potentially relevant titles, i.e. not in duplicate or with double-checking, as would be the normal practice for systematic reviews. Similarly, each team member assessed the relevance and validity of each study, and checklists or other formal approaches were not used. Meta-analyses were not conducted, and findings from the included studies were summarised narratively. This process entailed some degree of judgement, especially concerning which findings to emphasise, or not. All results and conclusions were discussed by two team members. We also had a rapid peer review process, which meant that at least two content experts – often the commissionaires – reviewed the manuscript.</p>
