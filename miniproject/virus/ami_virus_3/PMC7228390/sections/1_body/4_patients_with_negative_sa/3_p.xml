<p>This case involves the diagnosis of COVID‐19. In specific cases, the diagnostic criteria of infectious diseases should be extended to prevent epidemics. In the middle of January, when the NHC visited Wuhan, patients with COVID‐19 had been defined by historical criteria: (a) a history of exposure to the Southern China seafood market; (b) symptoms of fever; and (c) the full genome of the virus from respiratory or serum specimens were identical to SARS‐CoV‐2 sequences.

 </xref> The diagnostic criteria were strict as only a few people are able to sequence the entire viral genome, which resulted in many patients having diseases unable to receive a diagnosis.

 </xref> Therefore, although primary hospitals noticed human‐to‐human virus transmissions, evidence was still unclear because only 41 cases were confirmed in Wuhan between January 5 and January 15,

 </xref> which directly led to the delay of epidemic control. Until January 17, experts analyzed the epidemiological data of infected pneumonia cases and found that some cases had no history of exposure to the seafood market. They adopted an optimized SARS‐CoV‐2 nucleic acid detection kit (RT‐PCR) to test specimens of patients with unexplained pneumonia and confirmed 17 COVID‐19 cases after reconsidering the diagnostic criteria.

 </xref> Therefore, the number of confirmed cases began to increase dramatically each day, and the Chinese Government began to fight against SARS‐CoV‐2.
