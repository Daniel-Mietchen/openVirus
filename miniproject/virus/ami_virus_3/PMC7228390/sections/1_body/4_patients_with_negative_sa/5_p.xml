<p>Nonetheless, the PCR results for SARS‐CoV‐2 are related to the quality of the examined kit as well as to the novel coronavirus's characteristics, sampling location, sampling volume, transportation, and storage, as well as laboratory test conditions and personnel operation. SARS‐CoV‐2 interacts with the ACE2 receptor, a cell‐surface protein mainly found on lung alveolar epithelial cells.

 </xref> The alveolar lavage test is the best way to confirm SARS‐CoV‐2, however, the detection of alveolar lavage fluid is mostly used in severe patients using an invasive ventilator. Sputum is considered the second choice, though the coughs of many patients with COVID‐19 are unproductive.

 </xref> Therefore, pharyngeal swabs are the most common sampling method, however, they may occasionally cause missed diagnoses for smaller levels of SARS‐CoV‐2 residing in the pharynx. In addition, PCR detection takes up a lot of time, hampering the control of infectious diseases. Therefore,
