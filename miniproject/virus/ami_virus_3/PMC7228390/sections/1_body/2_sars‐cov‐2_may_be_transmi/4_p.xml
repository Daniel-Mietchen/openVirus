<p>Asymptomatic infections may occur due to weakened immune responses and subclinical manifestations, or because the virus is waiting for opportunities to reproduce and invade. To understand its mechanism requires additional investigation of asymptomatic patients as well as blood tests pointing to signs of an immune response, which can help detect asymptomatic or presymptomatic cases.
