<p>SARS‐CoV‐2 can be transmitted by droplets and contact. A study in South Korea showed that many environmental surfaces of patients with MERS were contaminated by MERS‐CoV, and virus RNA was detected from environmental surfaces within 5 days after the last positive PCR of patients' respiratory samples.

 </xref> Given the evidence of fecal contamination of SARS‐CoV and MERS‐CoV as well as their ability to survive in feces, it is possible that SARS‐CoV‐2 may also be transmitted through the fecal‐oral route.
