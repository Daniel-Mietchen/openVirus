 </xref> Encountering a confirmed patient and being close for 15 or 50 seconds is not the only route of infection, though it is the most likely route in the above two cases. Moreover, being infected within a very short exposure time is possible in the absence of masks.

 </xref> The powerful infectivity of SARS‐CoV‐2 may be explained by the latest findings reported by Wrapp D et al,

 </xref> which showed that the SARS‐CoV‐2 S binds to angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors with a higher affinity than SARS‐CoV S. Another underlying reason was reported by Zou L et al

 </xref> in that the shedding pattern of viral nucleic acid in patients infected with SARS‐CoV‐2 is similar to that in patients with influenza and appears to be different from that in patients infected with SARS‐CoV.
