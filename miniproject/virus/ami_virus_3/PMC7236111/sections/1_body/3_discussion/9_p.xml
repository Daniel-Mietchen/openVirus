<p id="Par43">Our study has some limitations. For instance, the low CD4-count in uninfected women was surpoirsing. This could simply be due to the consecutive sampling strategy that might lead to a certain degree of selection bias. Of note, the number of HIV-uninfected women was low; the presence of other comorbidities or infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis, could also affect the immune status. Unfortunately, diagnosis of these clinical conditions was not covered within the frame of the study. Further studies could therefore considered these aspects. Also, we have enrolled our patients only in the city of Yaounde and the reference molecular technique used for HPV detection made it possible to identify only genotypes 16 and 18. Given the high rate of other genotypes, it becomes essential to characterize this group. This therefore calls for sequencing for a better molecular characterization toward a rational selection of HPV vaccine candidate for the country.</p>
