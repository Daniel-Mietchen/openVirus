<p id="Par39">The HR-HPV positivity rate was 38.48%, with very low rate of genotypes 16 and 18. 3% for mono-infection with HPV genotype 16 and 4% for mono-infection with HPV genotype 18. This suggests that other genotypes are drivers of HPV-infection in the Cameroonian context and need to be depict among cervical cancer cases, especially in the frame of HIV-infection [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], which suggest a predominance of non-vaccine HR-HPV different from those found in Western Europe and North America [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, in a systematic review conducted by Doh et al.
 <italic>,</italic> the prevalence of pure HPV 16 and 18 was 6.25 and 3.28% respectively, a finding very similar to our report showing evidence of 3% HPV 16 and 4% HPV 18 within the same country [

Co-infection with HIV infection is a factor facilitating carcinogenesis associated with HR-HPV infections. Prospective studies have reported a higher incidence of HPV among HIV-positive women compared to HIV-negative women [

 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, 
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Co-infections of several HR-HPV genotypes was also been recorded, similar to previous reports [
 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Multi-infections are often associated with viral persistence, especially if co-present with HPV 16.
