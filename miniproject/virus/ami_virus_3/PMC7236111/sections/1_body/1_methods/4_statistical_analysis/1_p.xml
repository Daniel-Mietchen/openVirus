<p id="Par24">Data were collected using Excel 2016, and analyses were performed using Epi-info version 7 and Graph pad prism version 6. Odd ratio (OR) was calculated to determine whether the variable was a risk or protective factor. The confidence interval (CI) for the statistical tests was set at 95%, and the null hypothesis rejected at a 5% threshold. Chi square or Fisher-Exact tests were used whenever appropriate. 
 <italic>P</italic>-values â‰¤0.2, obtained in uni- or bi-variate analysis, were considered in the multivariate analysis.
