<p id="Par27">Women with a normal immunity (CD4 ≥ 500) were fewer (35.71%) as compared to those immunocompromised (CD4 &lt; 500) representing 62.88% of the general population. The overall median [IQR] CD4 count was 399 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>. According to HIV-serostatus, median CD4 was lower (354 [231–530 cells] cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>) among HIV-seropositive women as compared to their sero-negative peers (414 [IQ 262–918 cells/mm
 <sup>3</sup>]). The non-significant difference in CD4 distribution according to HIV status reflects the systematic HIV diagnosis performed to all women consenting for participation, most of whom were still asymptomatic.
