<p id="Par29">Several HPV genotypes were identified in the study population. Interestingly, 74% of women were infected by non-discriminated high-risk genotypes (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 56, 58 and 11 others) as per the genotyping assay. Surprisingly, only 3 and 4% of the study population were infected solely with HPV 16 and HPV 18 respectively (Fig.Â
