<p id="p0040">Which brings us to the current situation and the role of each of us, as cellular and molecular endocrinologists and researchers. We know that patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), obesity, and cardiovascular morbidities, (but interestingly not lung diseases, as frequently) are at higher risk for COVID-19-related complications (

In addition, there is a biased sex ratio among COVID-19 patients (more males being affected than females); it is important to study the possible effects of lifestyle and/or potential link to sex hormones or genetic sex, with regards to this significant observation (
