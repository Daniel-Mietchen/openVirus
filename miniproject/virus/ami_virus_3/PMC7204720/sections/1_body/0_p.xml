<p id="p0010">It was almost 3000 thousand years ago and the Greeks were at war (
 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Rees, 1991</xref>). Agamemnon and Achilles were fighting for supremacy, and the former refused to return the daughter of Chryses, Apollo's priest. Apollo, the God, got mad and what did he punish the Geeks with? an epidemic, which killed many men. A savant told the Greeks that the only way the epidemic would end, would be if Agamemon gave up the girl, which he did only after he took away Achilles's girl, the beautiful Trojan Brise√Øs. Of course, the story went on but not before the Greeks and other allied nations were affected by the epidemic. Both Agamemnon and Achilles, the two competing leaders had to sacrifice, to end the epidemic.
