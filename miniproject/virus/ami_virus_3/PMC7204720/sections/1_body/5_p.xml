<p id="p0035">What are the lessons for us in 2020? Like any other adversity, an epidemic can teach us some important things. First, epidemics are a fact of life: all we can do is learn the lessons from this one and be better prepared for the next one; because the next one will be here, in our lifetime, almost certainly. Second, we are so interconnected that what millennia ago took decades and/or centuries to spread, now takes mere weeks, or even days. It is unacceptable to demonize a “foreigner's virus”; it is essential to accept that pathogens do not recognize borders, social classes, or other human-made distinctions and it is critical to study other determinants of pathogenicity (biological factors such as age and sex, or environmental factors, such as climate and location). The connectivity of our times has an inescapable consequence for our societies: the health of anyone is concerning all of us and we can't afford to allow certain regions or populations to be affected by an infectious disease that may spread. Third, health systems are necessary to fight epidemics, safeguard the population, and prevent the next widespread disease. A centralized care system is needed regardless of whether there is single or multiple payers and private or public funding for its function. In fact, flexibility in any centralized system is a must, as recent experience with the best performing systems in response to COVID-19 demonstrates, too. Last, but not least, a research infrastructure needs to be built to exploit the amazing new tools of modern biology, computational A.I., and other disciplines that will be able to respond to new challenges quicker and more effectively than what happened with COVID-19.</p>
