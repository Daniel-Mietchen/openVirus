<p>Age-group and gender were not predictors for specific viral detections. However, Pearson’s chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests demonstrated statistically significant differences in influenza A and B virus by year of study enrollment and between hospitals (military vs. civilian). Further risk factor analyses demonstrated an increased risk of influenza A virus detection among military hospital patients (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.2–3.2;
