<p>Study data were imported into STATA version 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA) for statistical analyses. Pearson’s chi-squared or Fisher’s exact tests were used to examine for differences in viral detections by gender, age group, year of study enrollment, and hospital (military vs. civilian). Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for risk factors associated with prevalent viral detections. To further examine these risk factors, stepwise, unconditional logistic regression using a saturated model and backward elimination (exclusion p &gt; 0.05) was used.</p>
