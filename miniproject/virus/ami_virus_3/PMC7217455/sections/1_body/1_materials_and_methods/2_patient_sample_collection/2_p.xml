<p>Upon collection, clinical specimens were transported on ice to either the Military Institute of Preventive Medicine (MIPM) or the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology (NIHE), both in Hanoi, Vietnam, and preserved at -80°C until screened for a panel of human respiratory viruses (see molecular methods below). Residual original specimens were again preserved at -80°C and shipped on dry ice to the Duke-NUS Laboratory of One Health Research in Singapore. Laboratory staff at Duke-NUS were blind to the results of the assays at NIHE and MIPM. Results from the two efforts were then compared, and the etiologic agent was confirmed. The few discordant were retested and the results agreed upon.</p>
