<p>Enterovirus is a widespread pathogen among children and is often overlooked in adults[

In our study, 6 of the 7 enterovirus infections were among young adults, which could have been attributable to their probable contact with young children. Additionally, 2 pairs of the enterovirus infections occurred within 1â€“2 weeks, suggesting that these could have been clusters. Lastly, 5 of the enterovirus infections were detected from late March to June 2017, which reflects seasonal patterns of epidemics of enterovirus 71 in some Asian countries[

It is also possible that the enterovirus assays used in our study could have detected rhinoviruses, as cross-reactivity between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses has previously been demonstrated[
