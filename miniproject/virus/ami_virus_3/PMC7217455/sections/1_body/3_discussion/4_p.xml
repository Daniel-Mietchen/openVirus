<p>In contrast to the enterovirus- and adenovirus-positive samples in our study, we subtyped the coronavirus-positive samples. Coronavirus HKU1 and 229E were identified, which are both common causes of mild respiratory illness. However, both study patients with coronavirus were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with symptoms of respiratory failure requiring oxygen therapy. The study patient with coronavirus 229E had a confirmed co-infection with enterovirus. We suspect that the severity of respiratory illness among the 2 young adult patients infected with coronavirus could be due to co-infection, although the effect of viral co-infections on disease severity are unclear for some common respiratory viruses[

However, we screened patients only for the respiratory viruses mentioned in our study, and therefore we could not rule out co-infections with other viral or non-viral pathogens.
