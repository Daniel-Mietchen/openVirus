<p>Viruses identified in our study are known to sometimes cause severe respiratory disease in humans. Similar to pneumonia etiology studies in Vietnam and central China[

 <xref rid="pone.0233117.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], influenza A virus was the most common virus detected among patients in our study. Notably, influenza B virus was not detected during the final 10 months of the study (March 2018 through January 2019), which reflects the near absence of influenza B virus cases reported in Vietnam during that time[

However, our study enrollments paused from March 2018 to July 2018 due to administrative requirements and therefore the number of influenza cases at our hospital study sites during that time is unknown. The increased risk of influenza A virus infection among military hospital patients in our study was expected, as military trainees often seek care at these hospitals and rates of respiratory illness among military trainees tends to exceed those found in civilian populations[
