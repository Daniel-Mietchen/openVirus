 <xref rid="pone.0233117.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], therefore it is interesting that no adenovirus cases were confirmed among the civilian hospital patients enrolled in our study. This observation suggests that adenovirus might be largely restricted to the military population and military hospitals in northern Vietnam. However, it is important to note that adenovirus infections are often found among pediatric populations, and patients &lt; 15 years of age were not enrolled in our study. Although only 2 cases of adenovirus infection were confirmed in our study, our approach was limited in that we did not subtype the adenovirus-positive samples, which has been demonstrated as a useful tool in identifying emerging and virulent adenoviruses among populations[
