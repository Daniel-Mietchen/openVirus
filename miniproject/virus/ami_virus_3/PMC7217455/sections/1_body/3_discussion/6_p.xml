<p>With an overall goal to reduce SARI in Vietnam, this study aimed to examine evidence for select viral infections among SARI patients in northern Vietnam. We chose to focus on high-impact respiratory viruses[
 <xref rid="pone.0233117.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] that are often associated with human epidemics[
 <xref rid="pone.0233117.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As influenza viruses were commonly associated with SARI and are treatable, the hospitals in this study could benefit from onsite molecular diagnostic capability. Additionally, our results display enterovirus, adenovirus and coronavirus infections among the SARI cases, suggesting that cities in northern Vietnam could benefit also from local surveillance of non-influenza respiratory viruses.
