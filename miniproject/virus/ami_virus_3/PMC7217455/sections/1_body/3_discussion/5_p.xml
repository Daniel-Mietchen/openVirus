<p>Microbiological testing for bacterial infections among SARI and pneumonia patients is not routine procedure at the study hospitals and therefore only 53 of the SARI study patients received blood culture tests, and only one of those patients tested positive for

 <italic>aeruginosa</italic> bacteremia. This patient was a 30-year-old female from the civilian hospital who also tested positive for influenza A virus. Our study was limited in that we also did not have the capacity to test patient samples for human parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, or RSV. However, these diseases are primarily found in patients outside of this study’s recruited age range, such as infants, young children, and older adults. Nevertheless, human parainfluenza viruses are members of high-impact viral groups with pandemic potential[
