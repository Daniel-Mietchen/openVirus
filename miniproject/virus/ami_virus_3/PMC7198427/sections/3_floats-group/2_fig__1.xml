  <p>Schematic representation of convalescent plasma components and its mechanisms of action. 
   <bold>A.</bold> Main convalescent plasma components. 
   <bold>B.</bold> Antiviral effects of NAbs. IgG and IgM are the main isotypes, although IgA may be also important, particularly in mucosal viral infections. Other non-NAbs may exert a protective effect. The humoral immune response is mainly directed towards spike (S) protein. 
   <bold>C.</bold> Anti-inflammatory effects of CP include network of autoantibodies and control of an overactive immune system (
   <italic>i.e.</italic>, cytokine storm, Th1/Th17 ratio, complement activation and regulation of a hypercoagulable state) (see text for details). N: Nucleoprotein; M: Membrane; E: Envelope.
