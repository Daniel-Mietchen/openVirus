<p id="p0065">From the Spanish influenza to the current pandemic caused by SARS-Cov-2, it has been observed that the use of CP significantly reduces the case fatality rates. That is the case of Influenza A (H1N1) pdm09, Spanish Influenza A (H1N1), and SARS-CoV infections in which the use of CP was associated to reduction in fatality rates, mortality (
