<p id="p0140">Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is a mechanism in which the intensity of infection increases in the presence of preexisting poorly NAbs, favoring the replication of virus into macrophages and other cells through interaction with Fc and/or complement receptors [
 <xref rid="bb0355" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. This phenomenon is used by feline coronaviruses, HIV and dengue viruses to take advantage of prior anti-viral humoral immune response to effectively infect host target cells [

 <italic>In vitro</italic> assays with human promonocyte cell lines demonstrated that SARS-CoV ADE was primarily mediated by antibodies against spike proteins, significantly increasing the rate of apoptosis in these cells [
 <xref rid="bb0365" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>]. This is of major interest in regions in which coronaviruses are endemic. Vaccines development should consider this phenomenon in patients with COVID-19, and administration of CP-COVID-19 in these areas should be conducted with caution since ADE may emerge as a harmful reaction in patients with active infection [
 <xref rid="bb0370" ref-type="bibr">74</xref>]. If one suspects of this phenomenon following CP-COVID-19 administration, clinicians must promptly notify the health authorities and evaluate the safety according to endemic coronaviruses in the region.
