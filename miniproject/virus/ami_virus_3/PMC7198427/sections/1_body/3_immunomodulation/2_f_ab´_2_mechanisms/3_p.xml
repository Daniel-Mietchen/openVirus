Complement-deficient mice with induced SARS-CoV infection showed high viral titers, secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and immune cell infiltration within the lung. These results suggest that complement activation largely contribute to systemic inflammation and migration of neutrophils to the lungs, perpetuating tissue damage [
