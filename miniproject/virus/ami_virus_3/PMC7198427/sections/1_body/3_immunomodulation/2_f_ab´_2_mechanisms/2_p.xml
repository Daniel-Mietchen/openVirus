<p id="p0130">Historically, administration of IVIg has been one of the critical interventions in patients with autoimmune diseases as well as in autoinflammatory diseases, transplantation (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, chronic graft 
 <italic>vs.</italic> host disease after marrow transplantation), primary and secondary immunodeficiency, hematologic malignancies among other conditions. Preparation of IVIg includes anti-idiotypic antibodies that blockade autoreactive recipient antibodies [

 <xref rid="bb0325" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. This reaction is critical to control autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune diseases. In this sense, a recent report in patients with COVID-19, showed that critically ill patients exhibited positivity for anti-cardiolipin IgA antibodies as well as for anti–β2-glycoprotein I IgA and IgG antibodies [

 <italic>i.e.</italic>, antiphospholipid syndrome-like disease), especially in critically ill patients. In the same line, a recent report of a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and COVID-19 successfully treated with CP may suggest that this strategy is safe and effective in autoimmune conditions [
