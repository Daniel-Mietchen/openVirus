<p id="p0155">Dendritic cells (DCs) are key regulators of innate immunity and work as specialized antigen presenting cells. 
 <italic>In vitro</italic> studies have shown that administration of IVIg may abrogate maturation of DCs, as well as a reduction in the production of IL-12. Interestingly, the production of IL-10 was enhanced [

 <xref rid="bb0430" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>], authors found that IVIg induced the production of IL-33 that subsequently expands IL-4-producing basophils. In this line, other study found that IVIg could promote the production of IL-4 and IL-13 which correlated with levels of IL-33 [

Recently, it was found that IVIg activates β-catenin in an IgG-sialylation independent manner, which is critical for reducing inflammation [
