<p id="p0150">Fcγ receptors are found in about all immune cells. These receptors are critical factors in modulating or inhibiting activity of immune cells, including lymphocytes [
 <xref rid="bb0375" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>]. Fcγ receptor activation by IgG induces the upregulation of FCγRIIB which has been associated with inhibitory effects. This was demonstrated in B cells, where the upregulation of FCγRIIB was associated with treatment efficacy for acute rejection after kidney transplantation [

 <xref rid="bb0415" ref-type="bibr">83</xref>]. However, the study of Th17 cells in autoimmune encephalomyelitis model revealed that this process is dispensable for the immunomodulatory effect of IVIg treatment [
