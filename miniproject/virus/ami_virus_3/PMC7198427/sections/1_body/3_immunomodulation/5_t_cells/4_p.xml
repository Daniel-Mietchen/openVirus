<p id="p0175">Cytotoxicity is also regulated by administration of IVIg. In the study of Klehmet et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0475" ref-type="bibr">95</xref>], authors found that patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy treated with IVIg, showed reduction in CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells with high levels of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T effector memory and T central memory cells. In another study, IVIg proved to reduce the activation of CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells associated with a T-cell receptor blockade, thus reducing the interaction between effector and target cells [

 <sup>+</sup> was associated with resistance to IVIg, thus suggesting that these cells could be considered a predictive factor for IVIg response [
