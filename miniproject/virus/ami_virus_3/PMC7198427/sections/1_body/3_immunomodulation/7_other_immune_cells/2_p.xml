<p id="p0205">The major immunological factor suspected to be associated with inflammation and lung damage in COVID-19 is the activation of macrophages. It has been suggested that patients with COVID-19 may suffer from a macrophage activation syndrome-like disease associated to innate immune migration to lung tissues [

 <xref rid="bb0540" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>] who described an up regulation of chemokines for innate immune cells in ferrets as well as in patients with COVID-19. Interestingly, results suggest that this scenario mainly occurred in the first 7Â days post infection, whereas at day 14th, other cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 persisted activated [
