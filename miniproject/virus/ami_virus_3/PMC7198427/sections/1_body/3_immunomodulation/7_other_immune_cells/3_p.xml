 <xref rid="bb0545" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], authors found that macrophages treated with IVIg showed an increased production of IL-10, with a reduction in IL-12/23p40, thus suggesting the promotion of an anti-inflammatory macrophage profile. Although there is no evidence of macrophage pulmonary migration inhibition by IVIg, a study on induced peripheral neurotoxicity showed that this treatment reduced nerve macrophage infiltration in rats [
