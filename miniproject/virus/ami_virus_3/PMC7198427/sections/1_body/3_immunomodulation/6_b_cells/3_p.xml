<p id="p0190">Proliferation and survival of B cells is mediated by the B cellâ€“activating factor (BAFF). In the study conducted by Le Pottier et al. [

This could explain the reduction in proliferation, as well as the increased rates of apoptosis of B cells. Regarding the latter process, it was found that anti-Fas (anti-CD95) antibodies, present in IVIg preparations, induced apoptosis in B cells [
