<p id="p0195">In DCs, downregulation of costimulatory molecules following administration of IVIg has been observed. This is similar to B cells which exhibited a reduction in antigen-presentation activity secondary to IgG internalization, in concordance with a reduced IL-2 production by T cells [

 <xref rid="bb0535" ref-type="bibr">107</xref>], authors found that interaction between BCR and CD22 resulted in a down-regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Lyn and the B-cell linker proteins which resulted in a sustained activation of Erk 1/2 and arrest of the cell cycle at the G/1 phase.
