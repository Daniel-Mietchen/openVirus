 <xref rid="bb0510" ref-type="bibr">102</xref>]. IVIg abrogated TLR-9-dependent B cell responses. This was associated with IVIg inhibitions of NF-κB signaling pathway, reduction of CD25 and CD40 expression, and reduction of IL-6 and IL-10 production by B cells. This process seems to be regulated by SH2 domain–containing phosphatase 1 [
