<p id="p0030">Viruses of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family have a positive-sense, single strand, RNA structure with 26 to 32 kilobases length [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Coronaviruses have been recognized in numerous avian hosts and in several mammals, such bats, camels, mice, cats, dogs and more recently in scaly anteaters [

 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>]. Most of Coronaviruses are pathogenic to humans but they produce mild symptoms or asymptomatic infections. However, in the last two decades two lethal viruses have emerged within this family: the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These are characterized by severe fever (85%), non-productive cough (69%), myalgia (49%) and dyspnea (42%), with a high frequency of admission to intensive care unit (ICU) [
