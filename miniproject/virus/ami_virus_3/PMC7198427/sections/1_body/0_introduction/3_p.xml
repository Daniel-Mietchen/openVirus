<p id="p0035">In December 2019, a new member of the 
 <italic>Coronaviridae</italic> family associated with severe pneumonia was detected in Wuhan, China [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Patients showed similar clinical findings to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV given by high fever, dyspnea, and chest radiographs revealing invasive multilobed lesions [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. The virus was initially termed as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and it is currently known as SARS-CoV-2 producing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The origin of the virus is unknown, however, a recent study showed that the virus shares 88% identity with bat-derived SARS-like coronaviruses named bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21, suggesting that bats are the most likely reservoir [
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Interestingly, phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were close to COVID-19 in about 79% and 50%, respectively. Recently, it has been discussed that the similar sequence of the virus with human proteins could be deleterious and associated with autoimmune phenomena [
 <xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Although the current situation argues for prompt vaccination strategies, it has been suggested that it would be safer to test cross-reactivity of different viral antigens with those in humans to reduce the probability of autoimmune reactions (
 <italic>i.e.</italic>, molecular mimicry), especially in individuals with genetic background for autoimmunity [
