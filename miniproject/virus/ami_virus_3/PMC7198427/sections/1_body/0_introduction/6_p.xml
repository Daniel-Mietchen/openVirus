 <xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The latter could be the case of COVID-19 in which an over-activation of the immune system may come with systemic hyper-inflammation or “cytokine storm” driven by IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17, IL-8, TNFα and CCL2. This inflammatory reaction may perpetuate pulmonary damage entailing fibrosis and reduction of pulmonary capacity [

Herein, we propose the likely beneficial mechanisms of administering CP to patients with COVID-19 and provide a summary of evidence of this strategy in the current pandemic. At the proof stage of this article there were 56 clinical trials registered at
