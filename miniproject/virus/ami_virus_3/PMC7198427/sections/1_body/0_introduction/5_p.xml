<p id="p0045">Given the lack of evidence for treatment of COVID-19 and vaccines, classical and historical interventions have remerged as options for the control of disease. That is the case of convalescent plasma (CP), a strategy of passive immunization that has been used in prevention and management of infectious diseases since early 20th century [

CP early administered after symptoms onset showed a reduction in mortality compared with placebo or no therapy in severe acute respiratory infections of viral etiology like influenza and SARS-CoV, however, a similar response in Ebola virus disease was not observed [
