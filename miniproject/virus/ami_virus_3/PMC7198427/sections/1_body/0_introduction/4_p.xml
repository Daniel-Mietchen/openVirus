<p id="p0040">Currently, treatment of disease is challenging and the lack of clinical evidence with antiviral agents is the rule. Therapeutic schemes with Lopinavir/Ritonavir failed to prove reduction in overall mortality [

Other study suggested that Azithromycin plus Hydroxychloroquine may reduce viral load, nonetheless, the clinical response associated with this approach was not evaluated and remains to be defined [
