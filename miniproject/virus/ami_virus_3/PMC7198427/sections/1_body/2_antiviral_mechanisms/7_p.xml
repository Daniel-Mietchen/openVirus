<p id="p0125">Shen et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>], showed that recovered donors from COVID-19 infection had SARS-CoV-2–specific antibody titers ranging between 1.800 and 16.200 and NAbs titers were between 80 and 480. The plasma obtained from the donors and transfused in the recipients on the same day lead to viral load decreased. After transfusion of CP, the titers of IgG and IgM in the recipients increased in a time-dependent manner. Moreover, presence of NAbs in the recipients played a vital role in the restriction of viral infection. Another study evaluated the kinetics of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs development during the course of the disease. The titers of NAbs in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 were low before day 10 post-disease onset and then increased, with a peak 10 to 15 days after disease onset, remaining stable thereafter in all patients [
