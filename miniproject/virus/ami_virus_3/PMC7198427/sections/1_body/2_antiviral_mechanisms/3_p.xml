<p id="p0105">Tian et al. [
 <xref rid="bb0300" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], showed through ELISA and Biolayer Interferometry Binding that one SARS-CoV-specific antibody, CR3022, bind with COVID-19 RBD and more importantly this antibody did not show any competition with angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2) for the binding to COVID-19 RBD. The RBD of COVID-19 varies broadly from the SARS-CoV at the C-terminus residues. Although this difference does not enable COVID-19 to bind ACE-2 receptor, does influence the cross-reactivity of NAbs [
