<p id="p0100">NAbs are crucial in virus clearance and have been considered essential in protecting against viral diseases. Passive immunity driven by CP can provide these NAbs that restrain the infection. The efficacy of this therapy has been associated with the concentration of NAbs in plasma from recovered donors
