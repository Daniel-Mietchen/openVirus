 <italic>p</italic> = 0.316). As age increases and marital status changes, K6 scores have a downward trend. Those with a history of visiting Wuhan and a history of epidemics occurring in the community have higher level of psychological distress than those without such experiences. The psychological distress tended to increase with concern with media reports related to the epidemic and perceived impacts of the epidemic. At the same time, the results also show that those with negative coping style have higher level of psychological distress than those with positive coping style (
