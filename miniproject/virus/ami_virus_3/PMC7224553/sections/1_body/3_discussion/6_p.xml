<p>There are several limitations in our study. Firstly, the survey method is based on network invitation rather than face-to-face random sampling, and participants need to be able to use network tools. As a result, the status of the general population who cannot use network tools is unclear. Secondly, we did not assess whether and how respondents were engaging in prevention. Finally, our study design is cross-sectional and thus cannot capture changes in psychological distress and its predictors over the course of the COVID-19.</p>
