An initial set of invitees (10 participants) was chosen to ensure broad representation of age, gender, occupation, education level, and city. This set of invitees then forwarded the questionnaire to 10 companions whom they considered suitable for the survey, and this second set forwarded the questionnaire in the same way. The study included a general population aged 18 years or older who volunteered to participate in the study. The participants received a complete description of this survey and were asked to sign an online informed consent prior to data collection. Respondents were excluded if they reported a history of mental illness and/or could not complete the online survey independently.
