<p>As public health resources are limited, quarantine of individuals who may have been exposed to infectious disease is crucial for preventing local transmission. Therefore, strict home-quarantine of individuals from countries at risk for COVID-19 infection is important to reduce the number of infected individuals and to prevent possible epidemics in the community. Additional studies measuring the compliance of self-quarantine would be valuable for the evidence based public health policy as well as modelling studies in future epidemics.</p>
