<p>We assumed that the population mixed homogeneously, and that no COVID-19 transmission had occurred within the community in Seoul. Furthermore, we assumed that either 0.1%, 0.2%, or 1% of the incoming international students (

We also assumed that the international students would arrive in Seoul, South Korea in the 15 days before and after 1 March, 2020, and that no individuals were isolated during entry screening upon arrival. Furthermore, we assumed that all quarantined individuals were confined at home or to the university dormitory as per the current South Korean quarantine program for COVID-19. The baseline scenarios were based on the currently identified number of infected persons from China in South Korea, which was 12 on 6 February, 2020 [

Scenarios with different quarantine compliance rates (70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%) among these international students as well as local cases were also modeled. We considered a time horizon of 180 days for the number of individuals infected and quarantined since 20 January, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was identified in South Korea.
