<p>To simulate possible epidemics, we used the deterministic compartmental model of susceptible–exposed–infectious–removed type. The population is divided into five distinct classes: Susceptible, exposed (infected with the virus but not symptomatic), quarantined (with a fraction of compliance rate), infectious (and symptomatic), and removed (or recovered from the infection).
