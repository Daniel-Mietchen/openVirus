<p>Our findings indicate that the number of infected and isolated individuals could increase by mid or late March 2020. Furthermore, the quarantine program may consume a large number of public health resources because it involves monitoring quarantined individuals and isolating infected individuals. However, our findings also suggested that most of the infected individuals could be isolated from the home-quarantine program under the compliance rate of home-quarantine between 70% and 100%. Therefore, epidemics by incoming international students from China are unlikely to occur in Seoul, South Korea. </p>
