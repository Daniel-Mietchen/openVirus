<p>The present study has several limitations. First of all, some parameters including the latent period and rate of infection among those in contact with a person with infection were obtained from the modelling studies of COVID-19 [

Second, we used a deterministic model, and canâ€™t evaluate the uncertainty of these estimates, which is an inherent feature and missed under current analysis. However, allowing a search of different plausible values of these parameters through this model simulation approach, ensures the reliable parameter estimates and able to mimic the future dynamics of the number of infected individuals, which is much smaller than the total population [
