 <caption>
  <p>Graphical illustration of deterministic SEIR compartment model with quarantine. The population is divided into five classes: susceptible, exposed (infected with the virus but not infectious yet), infectious (symptomatic only), and recover. Exposed individuals are quarantined on contact tracing with a fraction of the compliance rate.</p>
