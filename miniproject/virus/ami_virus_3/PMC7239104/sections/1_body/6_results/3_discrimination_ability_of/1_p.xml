<p>Using receiver operating characteristic curves, the predictive value of the nomogram model for the probabilities of COVID-19 and the single marker, according to the values for age, L%, and MC, could be compared. Moreover, the predictive value of the nomogram was compared with that of the previously reported marker, LMR. As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>, the developed nomogram model occupied the highest AUROC (0.913; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883–0.937), compared with LMR (0.849; 95% CI, 0.812–0.880; 
 <italic>P</italic> = .0007), L% (0.808; 95% CI, 0.768–0.843; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), MC (0.780; 95% CI, 0.739–0.817; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001), and age (0.656; 95% CI, 0.610–0.699; 
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The sensitivity of the model was 0.834 (95% CI, 0.772–0.885); it had a specificity of 0.841 (95% CI, 0.792–0.882), a positive predictive value of 0.774 (95% CI, 0.712–0.840), a negative predictive value of 0.885 (95% CI, 0.839–0.916), a positive diagnostic likelihood ratio of 5.233 (95% CI, 3.961–6.914), and a negative diagnostic likelihood ratio of 0.197 (95% CI, 0.142–0.275).
