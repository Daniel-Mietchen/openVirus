<p>The calibration curves demonstrated that the predictive probability of the nomogram conformed to real results observed for COVID-19 (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). As shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, the predictive risk conformed to the observed outcome of frequency in most of the risk ranges. The x-axis represents the COVID-19 probability groups (% range), and the y-axis represents the probabilities of COVID-19. The red histogram represents the predicted probability of COVID-19, and the blue histogram represents the observed probability of COVID-19.
