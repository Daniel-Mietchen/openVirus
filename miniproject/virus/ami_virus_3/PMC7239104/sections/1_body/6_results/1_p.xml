<p>A summary of the demographic characteristics of the patients in the COVID-19 (n = 181) and influenza (n = 276) groups is provided in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The median age of the 2 groups was statistically different (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The COVID-19 group had a median age of 38 years, whereas the median age of the influenza group was 29 years (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). No significant differences were observed between the 2 groups in terms of gender (
 <italic>P</italic> = .686). The nonspecific laboratory tests showed that the WBC, NC, MC, and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR) values in the influenza group were significantly higher than those in the COVID-19 group, where the LC, L%, and LMR values in the influenza group were significantly lower (
 <italic>P</italic> &lt; .0001). The results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that age, L%, and MC were nonspecific laboratory markers predictive for COVID-19 (
