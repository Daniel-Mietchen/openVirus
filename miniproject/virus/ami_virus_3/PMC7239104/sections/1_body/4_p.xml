<p>Two approaches have been used for the diagnosis of outpatients infected with influenza: quick influenza diagnosis experiments (RIDTs) and viral PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swab specimens. The former is more frequently used as it is quick, simple, and inexpensive; however, the large number of false-negatives resulting from this test is problematic [

During a disease outbreak, the amount of time needed to obtain a result can exceed the optimal time frame allowed for diagnosis, resulting in the use of tests incorporating nonspecific indicators or surrogate influenza markers, while the outcome of the PCR diagnosis is being processed. These markers include relative lymphopenia, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocyte:monocyte ratio (LMR) [
