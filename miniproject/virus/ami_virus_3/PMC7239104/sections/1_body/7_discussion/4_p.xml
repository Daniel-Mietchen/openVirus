<p>This study contains some limitations. First, this study included a single center and did not have any external validation cohort. Second, we were unable to obtain the complete baseline characteristics for the majority of patients with influenza A or B virus infection. However, despite these limitations, according to the basic demographic indicators and nonspecific laboratory indicators, this study established a good predictive model to assist in clinically differentiating COVID-19 infections from influenza A or B infections.</p>
