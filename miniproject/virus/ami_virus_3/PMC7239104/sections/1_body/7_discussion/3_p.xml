<p>In this study, data from 181 patients with COVID-19 and 276 patients with influenza were analyzed, and the characteristics of the patients in the 2 groups were compared. The independent risk factors predicting COVID-19 were screened. The results revealed that age, L%, and MC had a significant predictive value. Based on these 3 variables, we established a dynamic nomogram to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza A or B. The distinguishing value of the nomogram was greater than that of LMC, L%, MC, or age alone. The nomogram developed here allows COVID-19 to be reasonably predicted based on the patientâ€™s age and nonspecific laboratory results, permitting rapid and straightforward diagnosis. This tool is readily available online and can be utilized freely by the public.</p>
