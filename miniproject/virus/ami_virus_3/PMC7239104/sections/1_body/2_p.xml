<p>The influenza viruses (including influenza A and B viruses) and the novel coronavirus are both infectious and can cause respiratory diseases. According to data from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, about 2.3% of patients infected with COVID-19 have died in China, indicating a higher mortality rate than influenza (0.05%). Currently, in outpatients, quickly differentiating COVID-19 from influenza A or B is the main issue. The early and accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 is essential to establish suitable measures for controlling the infection as well as establishing appropriate treatment methods.</p>
