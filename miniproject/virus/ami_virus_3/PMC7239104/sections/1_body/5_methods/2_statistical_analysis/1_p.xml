<p>Age is presented as the median (range), categorical variables are arranged by number, and continuous variables are presented as mean (interquartile range). A comparison of the differences between the 2 groups was performed using the 
 <italic>t</italic> test, chi-square test, or Mann-Whitney 
 <italic>U</italic> test. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was used for the selection of variables that may differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. We then tested the linearity between logitP and these continuous variables. The statistical package SPSS 22.0 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to analyze the related information. A dynamic nomogram was generated using the DynNom package in R (version 3.0.2; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The predictive accuracy of the nomogram model was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) and calibration curves and the RMS packages with 1000 resample bootstraps. A 
 <italic>P</italic> value &lt;.05 (2-tailed) was considered statistically significant.
