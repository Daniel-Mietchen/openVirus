<p>We conducted a retrospective single-center study. In total, 181 outpatients with COVID-19 and 276 outpatients with an influenza A or B virus infection between January 13, 2020, and February 12, 2020, were enrolled.

Novel coronavirus detection was performed in upper respiratory tract samples at the Beijing CDC using RT-PCR. In this study, the specimens were collected by inserting long flexible nasopharyngeal swabs into the nasal palate of the nasal passages (~6–8 cm). After reaching in place for several seconds, they were slowly rotated during extraction. Influenza A virus (H1N1, H3N2, and H7N9) and influenza B virus detection was performed at this hospital using RIDTs. Nonspecific laboratory tests, including white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count (NC), lymphocyte count (LC), lymphocyte percentage (L%), and monocyte count (MC), were conducted on outpatient visits. The investigations were carried out in accordance with the ethics committee of the Beijing Ditan Hospital. Informed consent to disclosure of information relevant to this publication was obtained from all participating patients.
