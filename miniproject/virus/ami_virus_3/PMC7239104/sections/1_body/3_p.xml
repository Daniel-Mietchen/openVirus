<p>At present, a COVID-19 infection is diagnosed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is time-consuming (It takes ~6 hours for an RT-PCR technician to complete the assay) and is not available everywhere [

In addition to this, false-negative results are practically inevitable. According to a recent research report from China, the detection rate of SARS-COV2-RNA is ~50% depending on the stage of the disease, the location of sample collection (upper or lower respiratory tract), the extent of sample RNA degradation, and the different extraction reagents used [

The virus can be detected only by nucleic acid detection when a patient is discharged. If there are no symptoms or only mild symptoms at the early stage, the virus may not be detected. Furthermore, there are limitations with regard to the collection of nucleic acid samples. Throat swabs from the upper respiratory tract are prone to false-negative results. Moreover, as the lesions caused by the novel coronavirus mainly occur in the lungs, that is, in the lower respiratory tract, there are often very few to no pathogens present in the upper respiratory tract or throat of infected individuals.
