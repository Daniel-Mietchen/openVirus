<p id="para50">We have learned a lot from efforts to develop a Zika vaccine, and the experience acquired during the Zika outbreak is reflected by the rapid response to the call for development of vaccines for coronavirus disease 2019. However, we should not forget or underestimate the challenges involved in vaccine development and that real solutions can occur only with consistent efforts and sustained investments. Our technological state allows a rapid head start, but vaccine development is not a sprint race, it is a marathon. Efforts to develop Zika vaccines must continue to be supported financially if we are to be prepared for future outbreaks.</p>
