 </xref> report the final results of a phase 1 clinical trial on the safety and immunogenicity of a Zika purified inactivated virus vaccine given via standard, accelerated, or shortened schedules. The authors showed that their Zika vaccine formulation was well tolerated, immunogenic, and did not show signs of inducing any significant adverse medical outcome (eg, Guillain-Barré syndrome) through 52 weeks of follow-up. A two-dose prime–boost regimen of the vaccine, administered either via a standard schedule (weeks 0 and 4) or an accelerated schedule (weeks 0 and 2), elicited a robust Zika virus neutralising antibody response that peaked 2 weeks after the final vaccination, and then declined to a geometric mean titre of less than 100 by study week 16. The sharp decay in Zika virus neutralising antibody titres might be linked to poor induction of cellular immune responses by the inactivated vaccine.

 </xref> This antigen formulation is still far from an ideal vaccine, and efforts to develop or refine promising Zika vaccine candidates must remain a priority. However, because of the progresses made we might be somewhat better prepared should a new Zika outbreak occur.
