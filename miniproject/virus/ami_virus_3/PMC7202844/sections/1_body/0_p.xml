 </xref> Until then, Zika virus infection had been considered a benign viral infection with minor health consequences. However, during the 2015–16 epidemic, it was recognised that Zika virus infection can lead to neurological diseases of the peripheral and central nervous systems, including Guillain-Barré syndrome and congenital syndrome, which was initially characterised by microcephaly. The spectrum of clinical presentations of congenital Zika syndrome is still not fully described. Studies have shown that about 20% of babies of mothers exposed to Zika virus during pregnancy who were born with no initial signs of birth defects presented impaired cognitive development and other neurological abnormalities later in life.

 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Zika is endemic in all tropical areas of the world, following a pattern of global distribution similar to that of dengue. Nearly half of the global population lives in areas at risk of Zika transmission, and the chance for future Zika epidemics remains very real. 5 years after the 2015–16 outbreak, we still do not have a licensed Zika vaccine despite substantial efforts throughout this time period.
