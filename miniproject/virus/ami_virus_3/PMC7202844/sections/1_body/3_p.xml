Moreover, it is still uncertain whether low levels of anti-Zika antibody can affect the clinical outcome of dengue infection. Anti-dengue antibodies have been shown to enhance Zika virus infection in in-vitro, ex-vivo, and animal models, but the role of anti-Zika antibodies in dengue infections remains unclear.

 </xref> In an ex-vivo human skin model, low titres of anti-Zika antibodies enhanced dengue infection of macrophages and dendritic cells, suggesting that a vaccine formulation that induces low immunogenicity might increase the risk for severe dengue.

 </xref> This potential risk could probably be mitigated by administering Zika vaccine to individuals who have already been exposed to dengue.
