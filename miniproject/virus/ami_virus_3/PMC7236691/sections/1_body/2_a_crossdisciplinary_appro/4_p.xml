<p id="p0045">Owing to international sharing of spatiotemporal data, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is the most meticulously mapped biological invasion ever documented on a global scale [
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This unprecedented rapid sharing of information, particularly from the early stages of an invasion, is not only an extraordinary opportunity for advancing the frontiers of invasion biology and epidemiology, but also demonstrates the potential for global cooperation in biosurveillance of all types of novel organismal threat. Emerging infectious diseases, and invasive organisms in general, are increasing in frequency with no sign of saturation [
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and their prediction, prevention, and control are a societal priority. A crossdisciplinary invasion science offers valuable underexploited frameworks and insights that can facilitate such initiatives and we hope that the COVID-19 pandemic will serve to catalyze greater collaboration.
