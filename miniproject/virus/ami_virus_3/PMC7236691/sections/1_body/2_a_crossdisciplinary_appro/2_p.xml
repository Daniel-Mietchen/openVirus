<p id="p0035">Biomedical research on emergent infectious diseases would benefit from what invasion science can offer in terms of, for example, (i) a consolidated array of frameworks for studying the consequences of eco-evolutionary novelty, specifically the release of organisms lacking ecological analogues in their recipient environments [
