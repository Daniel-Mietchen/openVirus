<p id="p0030">We believe the COVID-19 pandemic can provide a powerful impetus for ecologists, epidemiologists, sociologists, and biomedical researchers to develop an expanded invasion science that makes broader contributions to global biosecurity by embracing the philosophy of the One Health Initiative, the goal of which is to achieve optimal public health outcomes by monitoring and managing the interactions between humans, animals, and their environment [

Invasion science, a broad field devoted to understanding the processes behind the spread and impact of novel organisms, is positioned to help prevent, control, and potentially eradicate harmful invasive organisms, such as SARS-CoV-2, thereby allowing a more sustainable human existence within an increasingly altered natural world.
