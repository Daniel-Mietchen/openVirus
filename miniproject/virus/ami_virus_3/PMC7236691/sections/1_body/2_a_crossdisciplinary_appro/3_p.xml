<p id="p0040">However, although some invasion biologists have advocated greater integration of their field with human epidemiology, published evidence of crossdisciplinary research applied to emergent infectious diseases remains relatively meager. Ogden and colleagues [

Undoubtedly, there is a need for further advancement of crossdisciplinary approaches toward applied research and management of invasive human pathogens.
