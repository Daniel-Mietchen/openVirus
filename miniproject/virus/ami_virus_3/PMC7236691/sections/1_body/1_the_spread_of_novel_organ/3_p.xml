<p id="p0025">It is not known what proportion of introduced novel organisms will proliferate and cause substantial damage. Many have subtle or apparently minimal impacts on their environment. Others can remain innocuous for periods of time before suddenly becoming invasive (or virulent) in response to environmental change. Biological invasions are growing in frequency worldwide [
 <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and the impacts of even a small proportion (but an escalating absolute number) of these can be so disruptive and costly that the issue is of societal importance, including to human health and well-being [
 <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. At a time of unprecedented globalization, managing the threat of invasive novel organisms requires internationally coordinated rapid response plans. Poor preparedness and delayed response to invasions can lead to inadequate biosecurity measures and potentially devastating costs, as the world has witnessed with SARS-CoV-2.
