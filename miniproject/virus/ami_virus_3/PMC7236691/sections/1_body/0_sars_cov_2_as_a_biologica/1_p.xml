<p id="p0005">A sinister combination of ecosystem alteration, wildlife exploitation, and global connectedness is increasing the risks of novel infectious disease emergence and spread [
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. This combination of factors goes far in explaining recent viral epidemics and pandemics such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; the virus responsible for COVID-19 disease; 2019–ongoing), Zika (2015–2016), H1N1 (2009), and SARS (2002–2004), and forewarns of others in the future. Accordingly, societal efforts must be directed toward managing not only the pathogens themselves, but also the environmental factors that facilitate their emergence, spread, and impacts. In addition to resolving the immense socioeconomic and cultural challenges to this goal, clearly we must develop a crossdisciplinary research program to address the consequences of increasing global connectedness and alteration of biological systems. This collaborative effort must include the study of biological invasions, that is, the spread and proliferation of organisms in new regions.
