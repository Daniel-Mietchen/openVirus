<p id="p0010">SARS-CoV-2 should be viewed as a biological invasion, although infectious human diseases are rarely treated as such. Despite the longstanding debate on how to classify viruses as living organisms, this viral outbreak has traits typical of an invasive species: sudden emergence, rapid proliferation and spread, adaptation to new environments (or hosts), large-scale geographic dispersal via human transportation networks, and significant impacts, in this case on human health and well-being. Its management requires consideration of stage-based processes and expansion phases similar to those of invasions of nonpathogenic organisms (
