  <p>Stages of a Zoonotic Viral Epidemic Compared with those of a Biological Invasion.</p>
  <p>Similar stage-based processes affect the spread of infectious zoonotic pathogens (such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; SARS-CoV-2) and nonpathogenic invasive organisms, demonstrating the need for a common set of international management actions (e.g. early detection, rapid response, eradication or containment, and mitigation) appropriate to each stage of the process.</p>
