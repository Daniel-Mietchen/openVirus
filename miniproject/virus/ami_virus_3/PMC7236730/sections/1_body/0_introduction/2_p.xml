<p id="p0025">Coronaviruses were not previously considered highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) observed in 2002–2003 in Guangdong province of China and up to the outbreak emerged ten years later in the Middle Eastern countries known as the Middle East respiratory syndrome disease (MERS) (
 <xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). In December 31, 2019, the official Chinese authorities announced that a novel coronavirus capable of infecting humans had emerged from the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan, China. The new coronavirus was termed SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 as its respiratory infectious disease. Since that, reports of positive confirmed COVID-19 cases have been informed in &gt;205 countries worldwide (

In Mexico, the official announcement on the first infected patient was on Feb 29, 2020. To date, there were informed 42,595 cumulated confirmed cases, 26,746 suspected cases, 10,057 confirmed active cases, and 4477 deceases alongside the 31 provinces belonging to Mexico and its capital (

For previous historical outbreaks of SARS, MERS or influenza viruses some epidemiological studies have suggested that environmental conditions altered the spread pattern. For instance, in the case of influenza infections, Tamerius and cols., assured that in temperate regions the virus exhibited a strong occurrence according to the seasonal cycle: May to September (annual summer) in the southern hemisphere and November to March (annual winter with the minimal levels of specific humidity and temperature) in the northern hemisphere (
 <xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Tamerius et al., 2013</xref>). They concluded that the virus is highly sensitive to high temperature. Lowen and cols., have showed in experiments with guinea pigs as host model at laboratory scale, that both cold (low-temperature) and dry (low-humidity) conditions favor transmission of influenza increasing its infectivity (
 <xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Lowen et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, if temperature and relative humidity increased, the influenza transmission was entirely blocked. Regarding to SARS-CoV in studies developed at laboratory scale, Chan and cols., founded that such virus was active for at least 5 days at 22–25 °C within a relative humidity between 40 and 50%. In opposite, once the temperature reached 38 °C with a relative humidity of 95%, the virus lost its activity. At 56 °C, virus survival lasted only 15 min (
 <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). Casanova and cols., employed the TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) as potential surrogates of SARS-CoV to determine the air temperature and relative humidity effects on the viruses survival once deposited in metallic surfaces (
 <xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Casanova et al., 2010</xref>). At 4 °C, viruses persisted as long as 28 days. The lowest level of inactivation occurred at 20% of relative humidity. Inactivation was faster at 20 °C than at 4 °C and the fastest inactivation was observed at 40 °C. Tan and cols., showed a close statistical association between environmental temperature and the SARS outbreak observed in 2003 in 4 cities in China (
 <xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Tan et al., 2005</xref>). The optimum environmental temperature associated with the SARS outbreak was observed between 16 °C and 28 °C. Yuan and cols., confirmed a significant SARS transmission in correlation to 3 principal environmental factors: air temperature, humidity and wind speed (
 <xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>). The above-mentioned studies predicted the spring as the most suitable environmental seasonal condition for reoccurrence of SARS. In contrast, Cai and cols., suggested that the SARS outbreak was significantly associated with wind speed but only to some extent with the pressure, relative humidity and UV solar irradiation (
 <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Cai et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, the same authors did not find association between SARS transmission to neither air temperature nor air pollution. Regarding MERS virus, Doremalen and cols., observed that the virus activity persisted for long time in low-temperature and low-humidity stable and controlled conditions at laboratory scale (
 <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Doremalen et al., 2013</xref>). Concerning the new COVID-19 disease, recent statistical researches have demonstrated a solid relationship between the total number of positive cases and the cold-dry environment (between −4 °C and 15,58 °C and low humidity) registered in several countries during January and February 2020 (
 <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Sajadi Mohammad et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Keshavarzi, 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Nazari et al., 2020</xref>). According to the above-mentioned authors, spread of the new virus was associated with the latitude and longitude as geographical indicators and seasonal dynamics (
 <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; 
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Keshavarzi, 2020</xref>). Additionally, Araujo and cols., assured that tropical countries have been marginally affected by SARS-CoV-2 virus and that a high COVID-19 transmission has been observed in countries with cold-dry weather in temperate climates (
 <xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Araujo and Naimi, 2020</xref>). Similarly, Bukary and cols., estimated that the low number of positive COVID-19 confirmed cases observed in tropical countries might be explained due to their usual warm-humid environmental conditions. They also assessed that countries experiencing high absolute humidity above 10 g/m
 <sup>3</sup> could see in a short time a slowdown in the COVID-19 transmissions (
 <xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Bukhari and Jameel, 2020</xref>). Ma and cols., assured that temperature and humidity were affecting factors related to the number of COVID-19 mortality in Wuhan, China (
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Ma, 2020</xref>). 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> recapitulates the above-mentioned researches regarding to the effect of ambient factors on the survival, the transmission and/or the infectivity of influenza, SARS-CoV, MERS and the novel SARS-CoV-2 viruses. As possible to see in 
 <xref rid="t0005" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>, most of the reports rarely have considered neither the well-differentiated stages of the epidemic evolution (phases 1, 2 or 3) nor the origin type of affected patients (imported or local). Therefore, the present study shows the effects of the air temperature, precipitation and regional climate on the daily evolution of the local confirmed COVID-19 positive cases (LCPC) documented in 31 provinces and capital of Mexico since February 29, 2020 to March 31, 2020, i.e. during the phase 1 of the epidemic. This study contributes to elucidate on eventual SARS-CoV-2 reoccurrence considering weather conditions, environmental local characteristic and seasonal cycles in each regional climate existing in Mexico.
