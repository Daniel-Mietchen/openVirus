<p id="p0030">Onset data and the cumulative number of positive confirmed COVID-19 cases, alongside with age, sex, preceding type (local or imported), confirmation date, number of day with symptoms and deceases per state were daily collected from the Mexican Health Commission's website (

Climate regional categorizations according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification for each state and capital of Mexico were obtained by INEGI database (

Full-meteorological statistical data (daily highest, lowest and mean temperature, monthly mean atmospheric evaporation and precipitation) were obtained from the historical climatology database of CONAGUA (

 <sub>2m</sub>) and specific humidity at 1000 hPa (SH
 <sub>1000hPa</sub>) was provided by the Copernicus Climate Change Service database (

Development of a dynamic database on Excel spreadsheet was designed in order to compile and handle the last information. The statistical association and qualitative correlation of both the regional climate and daily weather conditions with LCPC for each Mexican state were calculated by the Spearman's non-parametric test (r
 <sub>s</sub>). r
 <sub>s</sub> determines the strength or weakness of monotonic association between variables through of positive or negative correlation (between −1 and +1) with a concomitant statistical significance (p). All the statistical analyses were two-sided at a 5% level of significance using the R software, version 3.5.3.
