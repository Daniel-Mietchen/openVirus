<p id="p0040">The evolution of ICPC, LCPC and TCPC in each of the 31 Mexico's states and its capital were used to determine whether regional climate and daily weather condition could be a factor in the spread of the COVID-19. This descriptive analysis have considered 3 main thoughts further explained: a) to focus on phase 1 of the epidemic, b) to focus on the communitarian confirmed positive cases (LCPC) observed in each state, and c) to enclose the local transmission rate (LTR) based on the effective regional spread since imported onset (I
 <sub>onset</sub>) case until March 31, 2020. In Mexico and internationally, the COVID-19 disruption has raised high attention to governments and institutions in order to design sanitary emergency actions. The Mexican Health Commission announced the China's epidemic situation in January 3, 2020. Special attention was paid on the international airports where was estimated to detect the earliest infected people arriving to Mexican territory via airplane. The first ICPC was announced on February 28, 2020 in Mexico City arrived from Italy. Since that, Mexican authorities declared phase 1 and the contention strategy emphasized the isolation of all detected imported cases and tracked down their primary near contacts. Few days later, several contagion cases emerged (both imported and local types) in most of Mexico's states. In March 23, 2020 phase 2 was implemented with many major governmental intervention measures (for instance the massive quarantine and massive mobility reduction) in order to deaccelerate the communal infection and to avoid the hospital-system collapse. Since that, the massive quarantine stopped progressively the people's daily activities through the social distance and the confinement. In March 31, 2020, the people's quarantine and the mobility reduction up to 50% decrease were clearly manifested in all of Mexico's states. In this study, the period since February 29, 2020 until March 31, 2020 was of analytic importance from an epidemic-evolution point of view. In phase 1, the human-to-human spread of the virus in both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases was developed predominantly from people with previous stay abroad under usual environmental conditions and unrestricted contention control of the transmission. Neither imported cases nor deceases account were considered as responses related to environmental effects, because the initial imported seed of infection is randomly distributed without reasonable association neither to climate nor weather conditions. On the other hand, during the pandemics events, the peak number of deceases normally take place during phase 2 or 3. Deceases are strongly related to previous individual health condition, comorbidity and/or hospital facilities availability rather than climate and weather conditions. Therefore, LCPC factor was chosen as reasonable variable to analyze the association with weather and regional climate instead of ICPC or TCPC. Moreover, due to the regional onset varied in each state, the Local Transmission Ratio (LTR) was defined as the number of local COVID-19 confirmed cases divided by the effective lapse of dissemination into the cumulated days since regional imported onset (I
 <sub>onset</sub>) until March 31, 2020.
