As possible to observe, in general both monthly average temperature and monthly mean evaporation decrease as LCPC increases. 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref> shows the monthly average max and min temperatures (red and blue boxes respectively) and LCPC values clustered in tropical (pink bars), dry (brown bars) and tempered (green bars) climates. 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> shows the mean temperature (boxes) and LTR (bars) also classified by climate clusters (tropical in pink color, dry in brown color and temperate in green color). As possible to observe in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, climate clusters pointed highlight out the role of environmental factors on LCPC. In the dry cluster, the average evaporation value was 6.65 mm similar to evaporation observed in tropical and temperate climates, 5.5 mm and 6.11 mm respectively. However, precipitation in the dry cluster (20.87 mm) was around two folds higher, than the observed in tropical and tempered clusters, 8.74 mm and 8.84 mm respectively. Tropical cluster showed the highest mean temperature of 25.95 °C in comparison to 20.57 °C and 19.65 °C for dry and temperate clusters respectively. Similar behaviour was observed for the max and min temperatures with higher values in tropical areas (32.87 °C and 19.03 °C) than in dry (28.39 °C and 12.75 °C) or temperate (28.97 °C and 10.33 °C) regions. Thus in tropical areas infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 disfavour transmission under stable high temperature conditions. In temperate regions, both low temperature and low evaporation with poor precipitation favoured the local infectivity observed in cities such as Tlaxcala, Guanajuato or Michoacan. LTR is statistically significant correlated to climate factor as previously observed in 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. LTR describes the dynamics of the epidemics into the effective elapsed time since regional onset. Average onset data occurs later in tropical climates but earlier in the dry and temperate climates (25.09, 22.35 and 19.57 days respectively) as observed in 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. Thus, the negative association between LCPC and local onset is considered statistically significant with r
 <sub>s</sub> = −0.65207 and p = 5E-05. Moreover, the number of days between the I
 <sub>onset</sub> and the L
 <sub>onset</sub> was 8.54, 8.35 and 5.28 days respectively in tropical, dry and tempered climates respectively. According with the last results, high LCPC values would be not expected in tropical climates such as Yucatán or Quintana Roo states. However, as possible to observe in 
 <xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="f0015" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, both Yucatán and Quintana Roo belonging to the tropical cluster, were states with high LCPC values. The last likely resulted due to the high touristic character of both states where the ICPC were the highest values reported (24 each) for the whole tropical cluster. In temperate climate, the infectivity and virus transmission were facilitated in local community due to the low-temperature and low-humidity reported compared with temperature in the dry and tropical clusters. Mexico city and EdoMex, classified as temperate states, reported the highest national local transmission not only justified to the environmental factors but also by the demographic aspects such as the population density (see 
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Therefore, in Mexico, the climate characteristics played a crucial role on the initial local infection during the phase 1 being the tempered regions (as Michoacán, Jalisco, Puebla, CDMX, among others) more vulnerable than the dry (as Chihuahua, Durango or Zacatecas among others) or tropical areas (as Colima, Campeche, Morelos among others). The last assumption agreed with previous evidences observed in tropical areas of Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand during the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 (
