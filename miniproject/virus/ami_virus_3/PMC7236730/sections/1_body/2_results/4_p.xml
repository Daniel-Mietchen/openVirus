 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, 48.23% and 51.77% were classified as ICPC and LCPC respectively. On average, there were approximately 19.65 LCPC per day. Initial imported cases came from Europe (Spain, Italy, France and Germany), the US and Asia (Singapore). 51.77% and 48.23% were male and female respectively with an average age of 43.32 and 42.84 years old correspondingly. 87.5% of the states reported &lt;50 ICPC, 9% between 51 and 100 ICPC and 3% higher than 100 ICPC. 94% of states shown 66% LCPC and only 2% (2 locations) represented 33% of local contagion including both Mexico City (CDMX) and Estado de Mexico (EdoMex) urban megacities as conjoined metropolitan area with &gt;20 millions of inhabitants. As possible to observe, Colima is the state with the minimum number of ICPC (2) and did not report LCPC in the studied period. Since February 29, 2020 to March 31, 2020, temperatures in Mexico ranged from 0.87 °C to 38.55 °C with a mean temperature of 22.22 °C. The maximum temperature reached between 30.71 and 38.55 °C with an average of 34.61 °C and the minimum between 0.87 and 17.79 °C with an average of 9.97 °C, respectively. Evaporation ranged from 4.5 to 9.2 mm and a mean of 6.14 mm. The average of total precipitation during this period was 13.99 mm. The T
 <sub>2m</sub> and SH
 <sub>1000hPa</sub> values in Mexico within the studied period were 19.82 °C (13.5 °C &lt; T
 <sub>2m</sub> &lt; 24.9 °C) and 5.92 g/kg (3.1 g/kg &lt; SH
 <sub>1000hPa</sub> &lt; 8.6 g/kg) respectively. 
 <xref rid="t0020" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref> shows the correlation parameter r
 <sub>S</sub> resulted from association between TCPC, ICPC, LCPC and LTR with both meteorological measures (i.e., monthly average temperature -max, min and mean-, evaporation and precipitation data) and the main climate regional characterization. Qualitative climate factor was associated to numerical equivalences as 1, 2 and 3 for tropical, dry and tempered climates accordingly. The association between of TCPC, ICPC, LCPC and LTR were in all cases negatively associated with temperature (−0.007 &lt; r
 <sub>S</sub> &lt; −0.182) and evaporation (−0.221 &lt; r
 <sub>S</sub> &lt; −0.317) without statistical significance. The association between ICPC and monthly average T
 <sub>max</sub> was positive. Association between of TCPC, ICPC, LCPC and LTR were positively associated with precipitation (0.176 &lt; r
 <sub>S</sub> &lt; 0.0282) without statistical significance as similar with the TCPC positive association to SH
 <sub>1000hPa</sub> (r
 <sub>S</sub> = 0.1677). In contrast, a negative association was observed between each TCPC, LCPC and LTR with climate factor with resulted r
 <sub>S</sub> values equal to 0.39041, 0.39031 and 0.46377 respectively. All of last associations resulted statistically significant with 
 <italic>p</italic> values of 0.02716, 0.02721 and 0.00751 concomitantly. ICPC was also negative associated with the climate variable without statistical significance. TCPC and T
 <sub>2m</sub> association resulted positive and statistically significant (r
 <sub>S</sub> = 0.866 and p = 0): as increasing T
 <sub>2m</sub>, increasing TCPC accordingly. Similarly, SH
 <sub>1000hPa</sub> associated positively to TCPC (r
 <sub>S</sub> = 0.167) without statistics significance.
