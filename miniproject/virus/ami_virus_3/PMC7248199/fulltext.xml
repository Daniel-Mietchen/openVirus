Many host factors have been identified that act as regulators of the inflammatory response and virus replication in influenza A virus (IAV) infected cells including nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD) like receptor (NLR) family proteins. Evidence is emerging that NLRC5, the largest NLR member, is a regulator of host immune responses against invading pathogens including viruses; however, its role in the avian immune system and AIV pathogenesis has not been fully explored. In this study, we found that NLRC5 is activated by a range of low and highly pathogenic AIVs in primary chicken lung cells and a chicken macrophage cell line. Further, siRNA mediated NLRC5 knockdown in chicken macrophages resulted in a significant reduction in AIV replication which was associated with the upregulation of genes associated with activated NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. The knockdown of NLRC5 enhanced the expression of genes known to be associated with viral defense and decreased innate cytokine gene expression following AIV infection. Overall, our investigation strongly suggests that NLRC5 is a pro-viral factor during IAV infection in chicken and may contribute to pathogenesis through innate cytokine regulation. Further studies are warranted to investigate the IAV protein(s) that may regulate activation of NLRC5.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>NLRC5</kwd><kwd>chicken</kwd><kwd>avian influenza</kwd><kwd>NF&#x003ba;B</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">College of Agricultural Sciences, Pennsylvania State University<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100009791</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="7"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="43"/><page-count count="10"/><word-count count="7051"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to spread globally and have increased the potential to cause epidemics due to their wide host range and mutation frequency. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs), have caused a significant socio-economic impact on global poultry production, trade and public health (Capua et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>; Alexander, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Basuno et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While ducks and waterfowl are considered natural reservoirs for IAVs and typically harbor asymptomatic infection, the disease in chickens can range from mild to severe or even fatal in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). In such cases, death typically occurs within 6 days, before an adaptive immune response, suggesting that innate immune mechanisms play a crucial role. While the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to this disparate pathogenesis are not fully understood, it has been suggested that the elevation of cytokines during HPAIV infection contributes to the mortality (Karpala et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Moulin et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and that rapid cell death could have a protective role (Kuchipudi et al., <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs) have gained increased attention in recent years for their role in the modulation of innate immune responses, modulating a wide array of pathways in response to viral infection. The CARD domain containing 5 (NLRC5) protein is the largest NLR member and is highly expressed in the myeloid and lymphoid immune cell lineages (Kuenzel et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While NLRC5 has been well-described as an inducer of MHC I genes in many cell types (Kobayashi and Van Den Elsen, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), various roles have been demonstrated in recent years, sometimes showing contradicting effects to innate immune processes. For example, the siRNA-mediated knockdown of NLRC5 expression in various cell types has shown both enhancement (Cui et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) as well as the decrease of interferon (IFN) response (Kuenzel et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), suggesting NLRC5 can act as a positive and negative regulator of IFN response during viral infection. These contradictory reports also suggest that the role of NLRC5 could be cell type and/or stimulus specific (Ranjan et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>Although a few other members of the NLR family have been studied for their differential regulation during IAV infection, such as NLRP3, NRLX1, and NOD 2 (Allen et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kanneganti, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), limited work has been done to evaluate the role of NLRC5. Likewise, the function of the NLR family members has not been well-characterized in avian species. The one study performed to date demonstrated the upregulation of NLRC5 within 2 h of lipopolysaccharide treatment, suggesting it plays a role early in the immune response (Lian et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the regulation of NLRC5 in chicken cells infected with both low and high pathogenicity AIVs. Further, we have investigated the role of NLRC5 in the modulation of antiviral cytokine response and demonstrated that NLRC5 plays a role in regulating the replication of AIV in chicken macrophages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cell and Virus Propagation</title><p>With the exception of the initial transcriptome analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) and chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infection assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>), all assays were performed in chicken macrophage MQ-NCSU cells.

All viruses were propagated in 9- to 11-day old embryonated chicken eggs as described elsewhere (Brauer and Chen, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Briefly, the chicken eggs were candled to aid in marking the air sac and relatively low vascular region. The eggshell was pierced at the marked location and 100 &#x003bc;l of virus inoculum was delivered to the allantoic cavity using a tuberculin syringe with a 26-gauge needle. The eggshell was sealed with glue, and the eggs were placed in an egg incubator at 37&#x000b0;C. At 72 h post infection (hpi), the allantoic fluid was harvested and centrifuged at 330 g for 15 min. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C. All experiments involving HPAIV were performed under biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) conditions. All LPAIV experimentation was performed in BSL-2.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptome Analysis in Primary Chicken Lung Cells</title><p>Primary cell cultures were prepared in house using lungs of 4 wk old broiler chickens. Fine lung pieces were trypsin-digested overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Large undigested tissue pieces were removed using a cell strainer and the remaining suspension was centrifuged at 1,200 &#x000d7; g for 5 min. The resultant cell pellet was reconstituted in small volume of cell culture medium. Primary chicken lung cells were infected with A/mallard/duck/England/7277/06 (H2N3) LPAIV, A/turkey/England/50-92/91 (H5N1) HPAIV, or A/turkey/Turkey/1/05 (H5N1) HPAIV. Mock infections were performed using phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Total RNA was collected at 24 hpi, and microarray analysis was performed to evaluate the global gene expression as previously described (Kuchipudi et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Microarray datasets are available on the gene expression omnibus (GEO) site under accession number <italic>GSE33389</italic>. Gene expression analysis was carried out using R build 3.3.1 [Bioconductor (V3.4)]. The core Bioconductor algorithms, including necessary library packages essential for the analysis of raw transcriptomic data, were installed locally before execution. The data analytical command line scripts were run through R studio (1.1.383), an integrated development environment interface for R. The Robust Multichip Averaging probe summarization algorithm described previously (Irizarry et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2003a</xref>,<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>) allowed for background correction and normalization of the data. Comprehensive annotation of normalized data yielded log expression values of over 33,000 transcripts, which were transferred to a spreadsheet for further grouping and selection of genes. Expression log values (duplicates) of pre-identified genes (selected based on peer-reviewed publications (Hers et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ehrlich et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) as well as commercial assay kits) were then plotted in Prism 7 (GraphPad; San Diego, CA, USA) for visual interpretation.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcript Quantification</title><p>For the quantification of host transcripts, total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), then quantified using NanoDrop&#x02122; Lite Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cDNA was prepared with the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantabio, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) using 1 &#x003bc;g of the total RNA per sample. The quantitative PCR for host gene amplification was performed with the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 1:10 dilution of cDNA and the primer sets shown in <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The PCR reaction was run at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 60 s. Melt curve analysis was performed for each PCR run to ensure a single peak indicating a single amplicon resulting from the reaction. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) was used as the house keeping gene for relative quantification of gene expression using the &#x00394;&#x00394;Ct method described previously (Livak and Schmittgen, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>).

To determine if members of this family are upregulated during IAV infection, microarray analysis was performed in primary chicken lung cells after infection with classical or Eurasian lineage H5N1 HPAIVs, H2N3 LPAIV, or sterile PBS. NLRC5 was observed to be upregulated in each of the AIV infections compared with the PBS mock infection control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Macrophages act as the first line of defense following infection and are known to be susceptible to infection by both LPAIVs and HPAIVs. Besides, excessive pro-inflammatory cytokine production is a major pathogenicity factor during HPAIV infection in chicken, and macrophages are the major contributors of cytokines during viral infection (Kuribayashi et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). To determine whether IAV infection influences the regulation of NLRC5, we used chicken macrophage MQ-NCSU cells for these studies. MQ-NCSU cells were infected with three different subtypes: LPAIV H7N2, LPAIV H5N2, or HPAIV H5N1. In both LPAIV infections, NLRC5 was upregulated. At 24 hpi, infection with LPAIV H7N2 caused a significant increase in NLRC5 mRNA expression relative to the housekeeping gene HMBS from 0.40 &#x000b1; 0.057 times in mock-infected cells to 8.86 &#x000b1;0.499 times in LPAIV-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the case of LPAIV H5N2, not only was a similar increase noted, but the expression increased over a time course of 2 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also saw an increase in viral titer over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2C</xref>) which was positively correlated with the increase in NLRC5 transcript (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> = 0.9515, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0127, two-tailed). This increase in NLRC5 mRNA was also seen in CEF cells infected with H5N2, albeit lower than observed in the macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S1</xref>).

From the full data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>), variation in key functional groups was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). Overall, pattern recognition receptor genes, genes relating to the inflammatory response, and genes involved in viral defense showed increased expression in the AIV-infected NLRC5 KD cells compared to control cells, suggesting that NLRC5 plays a role in the regulation of genes in these categories. Conversely, expression of innate cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b2;, IL-15, IL-18, IL-1&#x003b2;, and IL-8, were decreased. This result was further confirmed by evaluating the mRNA expression of two innate cytokines in the NLRC5 KD cells. Both IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 transcripts were lower in the NLRC5 KD cells as compared to the mock-transfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>).

The analysis suggests that the knockdown of NLRC5 during IAV infection enhances the activation of the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. In particular, seven genes that were upregulated in the absence of NLRC5 during infection were identified by this analysis as playing a direct or indirect role in the upregulation of the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, the increase in IL-2 directly upregulates NF&#x003ba;B signaling, while the enhancement of CASP-1 or TLR5 can indirectly upregulate the pathway through IL-6. While there are limitations involved in obtaining monoclonal antibodies for chicken NF&#x003ba;B proteins, further studies are required to provide concrete phosphorylation evidence to determine the effect of NLRC5 on NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway.</p><fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Putative pathway showing regulatory relationships of key genes to NF&#x003ba;B activation transcriptionally regulated by NLRC5.

In particular, NLRC5 is biologically conserved in the immune tissues as well as in lung and intestines, where the host often has initial contact with pathogens (Li et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), suggesting a role in innate immunity. Further, NLRC5 is highly expressed in monocyte/macrophage cell lineages (Davis et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>), which are central drivers of the host innate immune response and have a well-defined role during invasion by viral pathogens. It is also known that NLRC5 is activated during several viral infections in different cell types including Raus sarcoma virus-infected A549 cells (Guo et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), cytomegalovirus-infected HFF cells (Kuenzel et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and Sendai virus-infected HeLa cells (Neerincx et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). To date, there have been few reports on the role of NLRC5 in IAV infection, for example it has been shown that NLRC5 is upregulated in HPAIV infected chicken by 2.9-folds (Ranaware et al., <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Most previous NLRC5 work has been limited to human and mouse cell-based infection systems (Benko et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Cui et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Davis et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Ranjan et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Despite this, currently available data across hosts and stimuli suggest that NLRC5 can act as both positive and negative regulator of the inflammatory immune response. In the current study, we observed a number of effects on IAV replication and host immune function in chicken macrophage, which highlight NLRC5 as a cellular pro-viral factor and moderator of cytokine expression.</p><p>This study provides strong evidence that NLRC5 is acting as a pro-viral factor in chicken macrophages during AIV infection. We first observed that NLRC5 is strongly upregulated after infection in both chicken macrophages and chicken primary lung cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), demonstrating that AIV infection can effectively upregulate expression in various cells. This finding is in line with previous data in human cell lines showing that NLRC5 is induced following viral infection, however, the degree to which it is cell type-dependent, as we have seen here. For example, ~6-fold upregulation of NLRC5 mRNA and protein was observed in HeLa cells upon infection with Sendai virus, whereas in THP1 cells &#x0003c;2-fold upregulation was seen (Neerincx et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>In addition, we observed a strong positive correlation between the upregulation of NLRC5 and increasing AIV titers, a phenomenon also observed in human cell lines (Guo et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), suggesting that NLRC5 activation leads to a more productive infection across species. Moreover, we did not observe an increase in virus replication over time in the A549 cell line where NLRC5 was not upregulated (data not shown). This was confirmed by knockdown experiments where, in the presence of decreased NLRC5, we observed decreased intracellular viral RNA and extracellular AIV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>NLRC5 also has the potential to serve as a pro-viral factor during AIV infection by modulating the immune response. NLRC5 has been implicated in the regulation of IFN-dependent gene transcription where its knockdown impaired the release of IP10, IFN-&#x003b2; and CCL5 and diminished secretion of IFN-&#x003b1; (Neerincx et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) suggesting NLRC5 can enhance the pro-inflammatory response. However, in addition to its role as a positive regulator of antiviral cytokines, it is also reported as a negative regulator of NF&#x003ba;B (Benko et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) which is a hallmark for most virus infections and gatekeeper to several key actors in the innate immune response (Santoro et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>; Zhao et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While AIV infection in the wild-type macrophage suppresses the expression of NF&#x003ba;B pathway modulators, this suppression was reversed when NLRC5 expression was decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1">Figure S2</xref>). The RT<sup>2</sup> profiler array analysis of the change in innate immune gene expression in AIV-infected NLRC5 KD revealed activation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway based on the upregulation of several key pro-inflammatory mediators including IL-2, IL-6, CCL5, IL-5, STAT3, and IFN-&#x003bd; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). This observation indicates a possibility of NLRC5 being a NF&#x003ba;B inhibitor in chicken macrophages. Further protein-based experiments are warranted to confirm this observation. This is in line with previous studies in the mouse model which have consistently shown activation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway in the absence or suppression of NLRC5 expression. Bone marrow-derived dendritic cells from NLRC5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed activation of NF&#x003ba;B and NF&#x003ba;B-dependent cytokine IL-6 after IAV infection (Lupfer et al., <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2017</xref>) and shRNA-mediated knockdown of NLRC5 murine macrophages have shown induction of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF&#x003b1;, and IL-1&#x003b2; (Benko et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). As in murine models, our data suggests a possibility that the upregulation of NLRC5 in chicken macrophages dampens the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway which could dampen the secretion of the antiviral cytokines. These results indicate a possibility that, through modulation of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway, NLRC5 expression results in the establishment of a pro-viral state in the cells, leading to an increase in virus replication. Further protein-based experiments are warranted to fully uncover the mechanistic details of this observation.</p><p>It has been shown that NLRC5 competes with NEMO for binding to IKKa/IKKb in 293T cells and blocks IKK phosphorylation, thus inhibiting NF&#x003ba;B activation (Cui et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While such mechanistic insights are yet to be confirmed in chickens, our data suggest there may be a similar protein-protein interaction taking place, leading to inhibition of the NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway. Viruses have evolved strategies to inhibit NF&#x003ba;B activation by interfering with most steps of NF&#x003ba;B signaling pathway (Mulhern et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Antiviral drugs face the risk of development of resistance by newly emerging virus strains. There have been reports of IAV strains which were found to be resistant to compounds which target viral proteins M2 and NA. As an alternate strategy, reports have suggested targeting host proteins which facilitate IAV replication (Shaw, <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In recent years, several host-protein targets have been identified as alternative or supplementary approaches to the existing antiviral strategies. NLRC5 maybe an option as a potential therapeutic target, the blocking of which can amplify the NF&#x003ba;B expression and help limit IAV replication. However, detailed studies are required to understand the tissue and cell-type specific role of various isoforms of NLRC5 as indicated earlier (Ranjan et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) in regulation of NF&#x003ba;B pathway.</p><p>In addition to enhancing activation of NF&#x003ba;B pathway, IAV infection in NLRC5 KD cells resulted in a significant decrease in the expression of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), the two key cytokines involved in inflammasome formation. Recent reports have highlighted the importance of the inflammasome in antiviral defense (Allen et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Ichinohe et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Thomas et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It is currently thought that NLRC5 acts cooperatively with NLRP3 to activate the inflammasome-dependent secretion of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-18 in response to stimuli (Davis et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Yao et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Pontigo et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Further, overexpression of NLRC5 was shown to upregulate IL-1&#x003b2; in human hepatic stellate cells (Xu et al., <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). While it is not clear whether inflammasome activation also takes place in chickens, our data raises a strong possibility that chicken NLRC5 could be involved in the activation of inflammasome or a related response in chicken cells.</p><p>In summary, our findings strongly suggest that NLRC5 is a negative regulator of NF&#x003ba;B pathway and a pro-viral factor of IAV infection in chicken, possibly involved in activation of inflammasome complexes. Further studies are warranted to identify viral factors responsible for upregulation of NLRC5 and define protein-protein interactions in the chicken which may lead to direct regulation of virus production and effect NF&#x003ba;B pathway regulators.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>The datasets generated for this study can be found in the Microarray datasets are available on the gene expression omnibus (GEO) site under accession number <ext-link ext-link-type="NCBI:geo" xlink:href="GSE33389">GSE33389</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>SK conceived the study.
