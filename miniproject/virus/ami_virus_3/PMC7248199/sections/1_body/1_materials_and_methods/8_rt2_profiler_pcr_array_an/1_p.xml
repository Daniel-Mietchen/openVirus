<p>The RT
 <sup>2</sup> Profilerâ„¢ PCR Array Chicken Innate &amp; Adaptive Immune Responses (Qiagen) is a SYBR Green qPCR-based gene expression analysis system. Cells were infected with LPAIV H5N2 and total RNA was extracted at 24 hpi. RT
 <sup>2</sup> First Strand Kit (Qiagen) was used to generate cDNA, and cDNA was used in the PCR Array using RT
 <sup>2</sup> SYBR Green ROX qPCR Mastermix following the manufacturer's instructions. Data was analyzed for fold-change determination using Qiagen's GeneGlobe data analysis center web resource (

The significance of the change in gene expression between the two samples was evaluated by unpaired Student
