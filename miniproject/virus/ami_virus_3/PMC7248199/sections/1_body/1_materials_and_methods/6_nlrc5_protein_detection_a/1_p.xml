<p>Immunofluorescence staining was used to visualize the NLRC5 protein in infected cells at 24 hpi. Cells grown on Nunc Lab-Tek four-chamber slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific), were fixed using acetone:methanol (1:1) for 10 min then incubated with primary anti-NLRC5 rat monoclonal (catalog MABF260 clone 3H8, EMD Millipore, Burlington, MA) at a concentration of 1:1000 in Tris-buffered saline followed with three washes with Tris-buffered saline washes. The cells were further incubated with goat polyclonal FITC-conjugated anti-rat IgG (catalog ab6840, Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA) at a concentration of 1:500 for 30 min. The cells were mounted using ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (Invitrogen) and left at room temperature overnight in the dark for curing. The slides were observed under confocal microscope for imaging using an Fluoview 1000 (Olympus, Waltham, MA, USA). In addition, to quantify the expression of NLRC5, a quantitative sandwich ELISA was performed using a commercial ELISA kit (MyBioSource, San Diego, CA, USA) as per the manufacturer's instructions.</p>
