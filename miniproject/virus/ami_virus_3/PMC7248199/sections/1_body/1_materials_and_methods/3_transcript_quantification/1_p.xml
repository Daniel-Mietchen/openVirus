<p>For the quantification of host transcripts, total RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit following the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Germantown, MD, USA), then quantified using NanoDrop™ Lite Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The cDNA was prepared with the qScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Quantabio, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) using 1 μg of the total RNA per sample. The quantitative PCR for host gene amplification was performed with the Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a 1:10 dilution of cDNA and the primer sets shown in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>. The PCR reaction was run at 95°C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s. Melt curve analysis was performed for each PCR run to ensure a single peak indicating a single amplicon resulting from the reaction. Hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS) was used as the house keeping gene for relative quantification of gene expression using the ΔΔCt method described previously (Livak and Schmittgen,
