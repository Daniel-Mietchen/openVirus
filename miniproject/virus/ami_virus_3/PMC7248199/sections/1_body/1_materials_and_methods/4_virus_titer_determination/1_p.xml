<p>Calculation of the relative equivalent units (REUs) was based on influenza viral M gene amplification. For REU calculation, viral RNA was extracted from the supernatant of infected cells of known TCID
 <sub>50</sub>, serially diluted, and assayed by the viral M gene qRT-PCR. A standard curve of was plotted between TCID
 <sub>50</sub> units and corresponding mean Ct values, and experimental viral RNA output Ct values were fitted to the standard curve to estimate REU TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of each experimental sample.
