<p>The REU viral titers were calculated for cells infected with LPAIV H5N2 and H7N2 whereas the relative matrix gene quantification was carried out for cells infected with HPAIV H5N1 to reduce handling of the virus in BSL3 conditions. Both REU and relative matrix gene quantification are based on viral M gene amplification and provide equivalent information.</p>
