<p>Antiviral drugs face the risk of development of resistance by newly emerging virus strains. There have been reports of IAV strains which were found to be resistant to compounds which target viral proteins M2 and NA. As an alternate strategy, reports have suggested targeting host proteins which facilitate IAV replication (Shaw, 
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). In recent years, several host-protein targets have been identified as alternative or supplementary approaches to the existing antiviral strategies. NLRC5 maybe an option as a potential therapeutic target, the blocking of which can amplify the NFκB expression and help limit IAV replication. However, detailed studies are required to understand the tissue and cell-type specific role of various isoforms of NLRC5 as indicated earlier (Ranjan et al., 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) in regulation of NFκB pathway.
