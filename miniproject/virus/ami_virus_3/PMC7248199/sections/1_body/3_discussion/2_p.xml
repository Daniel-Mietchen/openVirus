<p>This study provides strong evidence that NLRC5 is acting as a pro-viral factor in chicken macrophages during AIV infection. We first observed that NLRC5 is strongly upregulated after infection in both chicken macrophages and chicken primary lung cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), demonstrating that AIV infection can effectively upregulate expression in various cells. This finding is in line with previous data in human cell lines showing that NLRC5 is induced following viral infection, however, the degree to which it is cell type-dependent, as we have seen here. For example, ~6-fold upregulation of NLRC5 mRNA and protein was observed in HeLa cells upon infection with Sendai virus, whereas in THP1 cells &lt;2-fold upregulation was seen (Neerincx et al.,
