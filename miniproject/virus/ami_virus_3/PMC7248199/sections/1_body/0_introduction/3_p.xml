<p>Although a few other members of the NLR family have been studied for their differential regulation during IAV infection, such as NLRP3, NRLX1, and NOD 2 (Allen et al., 
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Kanneganti, 
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), limited work has been done to evaluate the role of NLRC5. Likewise, the function of the NLR family members has not been well-characterized in avian species. The one study performed to date demonstrated the upregulation of NLRC5 within 2 h of lipopolysaccharide treatment, suggesting it plays a role early in the immune response (Lian et al., 
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Therefore, in this study, we have investigated the regulation of NLRC5 in chicken cells infected with both low and high pathogenicity AIVs. Further, we have investigated the role of NLRC5 in the modulation of antiviral cytokine response and demonstrated that NLRC5 plays a role in regulating the replication of AIV in chicken macrophages.
