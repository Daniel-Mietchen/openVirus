<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) continue to spread globally and have increased the potential to cause epidemics due to their wide host range and mutation frequency. Avian influenza viruses (AIVs), have caused a significant socio-economic impact on global poultry production, trade and public health (Capua et al.,

 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Basuno et al., 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). While ducks and waterfowl are considered natural reservoirs for IAVs and typically harbor asymptomatic infection, the disease in chickens can range from mild to severe or even fatal in the case of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAIVs). In such cases, death typically occurs within 6 days, before an adaptive immune response, suggesting that innate immune mechanisms play a crucial role. While the underlying molecular mechanisms that lead to this disparate pathogenesis are not fully understood, it has been suggested that the elevation of cytokines during HPAIV infection contributes to the mortality (Karpala et al.,

 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) and that rapid cell death could have a protective role (Kuchipudi et al.,
