  <p>Increase in NLRC5 mRNA and virus production in HPAIV- and LPAIV-infected chicken macrophages. Chicken macrophage MQ-NCSU cells were infected with the LPAIV H7N2, H5N2, or HPAIV H5N1. Total cellular mRNA and viral supernatant were collected at the designated timepoints. 
   <bold>(A)</bold> NLRC5 mRNA levels at 24 hpi with H7N2 are shown. After LPAIV H5N2 infection, 
   <bold>(B)</bold> NLRC5 mRNA levels and 
   <bold>(C)</bold> virus production in the supernatant were measured between 4 and 48 hpi. After HPAIV H5N1 infection, 
   <bold>(D)</bold> NLRC5 mRNA levels and 
   <bold>(E)</bold> virus production in the supernatant were measured at 24 and 48 hpi. All NLRC5 mRNA levels were normalized to the housekeeping gene, HMBS. Data represents average of three biological replicates with error bars showing standard deviation.
