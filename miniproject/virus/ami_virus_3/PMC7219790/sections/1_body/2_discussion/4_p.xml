<p>There are several limitations of the approach outlined above. The regime switching model structure demands parsimony as each additional regime requires an additional fold of explanatory variables for estimation. Longer dynamics are thus harder to estimate for BRS. While the model estimates phenomological components, such as the evolution of dengue case counts through autoregressive parameters and structural components, such as the regimes of dengue transmission, the interpretation of structural breaks within the model remains a largely qualitative exercise. Serotype switching, which is documented to be a possible cause of epidemics in endemic regions [

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], which limits BRS to in-sample analysis of dengue counts. Lastly, further work is required to enhance the model to incorporate more policy components which may affect dengue transmission such as vector control efforts. Incorporating vector control and serotype switching will allow investigation in the important interactions between structural and phenomological effects on the temporal evolution of dengue.
