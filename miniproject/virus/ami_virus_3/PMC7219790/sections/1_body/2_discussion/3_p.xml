<p>Exploring long-term structural dynamics of dengue is important for vector control as it signals that considerable forward planning and financial resource allocation is necessary for successful implementation. Distinguishing between epidemic and endemic regimes, prediction of upcoming regimes and characterizing the persistence and climatic differences of epidemics provides policy makers with the estimated duration required for epidemic control where other data such as serotype switching may be unavailable. The methods described here could be easily applied to other countries where dengue transmission counts are collected. One potential application could be to compare the regime lengths and dynamics of different countries, and explore the factors driving different dengue regime patterns.</p>
