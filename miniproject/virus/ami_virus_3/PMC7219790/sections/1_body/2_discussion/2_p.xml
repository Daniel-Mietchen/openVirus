<p>The results show varying levels of persistence across the epidemic and endemic dengue regimes with the endemic regime generally being more persistent on average. However, when we explored the effects of climate on the estimated regimes, results suggest that climatic factors up to even 20 weeks before do not affect the probability of being within a regime or another.

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007839.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>), our results suggest that regimes in dengue transmissions are driven structurally by the changes in dengue counts themselves rather than climatic factors. Mechanistically, the epidemic regimes classified using BRS on simulated data also point towards the epidemic regime as periods of high infection probability (
