<p>BRS models above can identify characteristic changes in the behavior of dengue case counts, which form different repeating phases where regimes alternate. The methods utilized here can also estimate the variables which explain the trends of dengue case counts in each of these regimes. We interpret regime 1 as a stable endemic regime where changes in dengue counts are pushed down to a proportion of the week before, and regime 2 an epidemic regime which is characterized by an increase in change of dengue differenced dengue counts in comparison to the week before. Both regimes, the endemic and epidemic regimes are highly noncyclical with varying temporal lengths across time in Singapore (Figs
