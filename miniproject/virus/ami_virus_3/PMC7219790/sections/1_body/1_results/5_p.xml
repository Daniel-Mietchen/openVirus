<p>The BRS model characterizes 2 different stages of dengue transmission dynamics, which are apparent from the estimated regime-specific autoregressive parameters. Future changes in dengue transmission counts in the endemic regime are expected to go lower as a proportion of the observed change in dengue differenced counts one week before (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>, BRS-3 Lag Model, Lag 1 Autoregessive Endemic Coefficient: -0.289). The epidemic regime values are expected to increase as a proportion of the observed dengue transmission counts one to three weeks before. (
