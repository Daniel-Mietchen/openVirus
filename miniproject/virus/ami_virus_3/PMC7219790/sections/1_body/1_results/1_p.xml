<p>We fitted BAR and BRS models for up to 2/3 lagged differenced dengue case counts, with an additional BAR 3 specification containing climatic variables. (Tables 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007839.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>) Convergence was achieved on Gibbs sampling the posterior of BAR and BRS parameters (

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007839.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). Residual autocorrelation was adequately accounted for by BRS and BAR models, but with autocorrelation on around the 1
 <sup>st</sup> to 5
 <sup>th</sup> lags exceeding the 95% confidence interval for the BAR-2/3 Lag and BRS-2 Lag models (
 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007839.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>). We use the BRS model with 3 lags for parsimony and its ability to account for residual autocorrelation across both regimes. The BRS-3 Lag model performed marginally better on fitting the time series with 5.43% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared to 5.61% and 5.55% on the BAR 2 and 3 Lag model respectively.

 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t001" ref-type="table">1</xref> and 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t002" ref-type="table">2</xref>) Regime switching models also characterized the likelihood of change in Dengue transmissions better with the Bayes factor and relative DIC highly favoring regime switching models over autoregressive models (Tables
