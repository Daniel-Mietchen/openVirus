<p>Our results suggest persistent epidemic and endemic regimes. Transitions across regimes are characterized by the transition probabilities (TP) matrix in 
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>. This matrix shows the likelihood of being in the same regime or switching over to another Regime in the next time period. TP across the endemic (EN) and epidemic (EP) regimes are low (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, TP regimes EN to EP: 2.0%, TP regimes EP to EN, 5.5%), while the TP of staying within the EN and EP regimes are high (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>, TP regime EN, 98.0%, TP regime EP, 94.5%). The average lengths of the endemic and epidemic regimes appear persistent but the endemic regime is marginally more so in comparison to the epidemic regime, with the epidemic regime less likely to remain in its current regime compared to the endemic regime (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>).
