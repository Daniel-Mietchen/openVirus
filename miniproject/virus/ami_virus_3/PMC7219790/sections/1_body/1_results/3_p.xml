<p>Posterior predictive checks indicate that the posterior predictive density replicates the true distribution of the data in the BRS 3 Lag model, however, more error and noise is observed in fitting the epidemic regime. (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007839.g005">Fig 5</xref>) 95% Credible intervals exclude 0 for lags 2 and lags 2 and 3 on BAR-2 and BAR-3 Lag models respectively, but only the endemic regime lag 1 and 3 coefficient on the BRS-3 Lag model. Plotting posterior samples of coefficients across regimes showed that this is likely due to correlation between sampled parameters rather than a result of unimportant dimensions being specified (
