<p>LASSO with logistic link was conducted using regimes from the BRS-3 Lag model as dependent variables (
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.t004" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>). Ranking the 600 independent variables according to coefficient magnitude showed that a quadratic 5 week lagged response to air temperature, equivalent 14–20 week lag for relative humidity and 2–5 week lag for 2
 <sup>nd</sup> order interactions between relative humidity and air temperature, absolute humidity and dewpoint temperature are correlated to epidemic regime shift initiation with poor predictive ability in climatic responses with AUC = 0.603 (
