<p>We simulated the sSIR model over a daily timescale for 6600 time points, with the burnin of 2000 time points being discarded. The remaining time points were then aggregated into the weekly level (

Fitting BRS to the differenced and normalized simulated case counts using 3 lag terms showed that all residual auto-correlation was accounted for within the model. The fitted regimes using BRS correspond to periods where the number of infected individuals is elevated (
