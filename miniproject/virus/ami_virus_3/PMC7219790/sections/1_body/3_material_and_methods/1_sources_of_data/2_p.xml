<p>Climate data was obtained from ERA5, published by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. ERA5 provides hourly estimates across a 30km grid [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], which we have aggregated over a weekly timescale and spatially averaged over Singapore. Mean, minimum and maximum air temperature at 2m was calculated to represent thermal forcing and stress on vector population growth, and total rainfall for the weekly interval obtained for breeding site availability. Air temperature and dewpoint temperature were utilized to calculate saturation vapor pressure and actual vapor pressure using Tetens formula, whence relative and absolute humidity could be estimated using standard formula [
