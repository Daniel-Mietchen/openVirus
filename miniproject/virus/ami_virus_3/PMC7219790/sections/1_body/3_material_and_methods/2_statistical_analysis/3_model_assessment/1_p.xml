<p>First, Geweke convergence diagnostic checks are conducted to ensure that MCMC estimation is well-behaved [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Residual autocorrelation is computed to ascertain whether dengue transmission dynamics are properly accounted for and to determine the maximum lag order for each specification. Next, posterior predictive checks are conducted by comparing the fit of the posterior predictive distribution with the actual data. Fourth, posterior probabilities of the fitted regimes, which provide a measure of uncertainty to regime classification are computed. Fifth, we used mean-absolute percentage error (MAPE) and log Bayes factor as the model assessment criterion for comparing model fit of dengue differenced transmission counts between BAR and BRS as it balances explanatory power of the estimated model along with parsimony. The log Bayes factor was computed using na√Øve Monte Carlo simulation as detailed in

 <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007839.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>. Lastly, ex-ante classification efficacy of BRS on regimes is conducted in a rolling manner, where we fit the BRS specification sequentially from around 1/3 of the data set at the 250
 <sup>th</sup> week onwards and increase the information set provided to the BRS by 1 more week in each refitting. We obtain the contemporaneously classified regime from the regime fitted to the final timepoint in each model iteration and compared the classification to the case where BRS is estimated on the full dataset.
