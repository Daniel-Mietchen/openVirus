<p>Regime switching models [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] were used to estimate the dynamics and change points in dengue transmission across time. In contrast to normal autoregressive models, regime switching models are characterized by multiple autoregressive models contingent on which regime the dependent variables are currently in. The estimation detects and fits separate models depending on its classification at the current time point of an epidemic or endemic regime.
