<p>Five-fold cross validation was first conducted to yield test error rates which do not suffer from unreasonably high bias or variance [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The cross-validation step optimizes the regularization parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic> using area under curve of the receiving operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) as the tuning criterion. We then refitted our data using the optimal regularization parameter 
 <italic>λ</italic>* to produce probabilities for being in each regime at each timepoint. Next, bootstrapping was conducted over 1000 iterations to recover confidence intervals and bootstrap mean estimates [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007839.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] for each of our LASSO dependent variables. The bootstrap also allows computation of LASSO inclusion probabilities, which provides a measure of the number of times the LASSO estimation strategy assigns a parameter null value.
