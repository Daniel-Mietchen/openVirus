Widespread ongoing urbanization and greater host movement rates via both domestic and international travel have increased transmission, particularly across highly connected cities such as Singapore. With favorable climatic conditions, a large daily influx of travelers and high population density, the conditions for dengue transmission are ideal, as reflected in national case counts being non-zero for every week in the past 10 years.
