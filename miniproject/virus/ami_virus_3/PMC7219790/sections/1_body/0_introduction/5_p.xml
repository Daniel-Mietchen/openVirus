<p>This paper therefore explores the utility of regime switching models to investigate the dynamic signature of dengue within Singapore. We aim to classify the irregularity in epidemic lengths, estimate the different dynamics in dengue transmission across the different regimes and examine whether climate characterizes the estimated regimes. First, Bayesian Autoregressive (BAR) models of various lags derived using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimate dengue transmissions across time as a benchmark model to explain dengue transmission counts. Next, we utilized Bayesian fixed transition probability regime switching models (BRS) to account for the endemic-epidemic structure of dengue while allowing autoregressive parameters to vary in separate regimes. Model explanatory power was assessed with the mean-absolute percentage error, log Bayes factor, relative deviance information criterion, as well as the predictive power of the BRS by ex-ante classification accuracy of regimes. Next, we estimate the influence of climate on dengue transmission behavior by using the classified regimes from BRS as a dependent variable to climate with the least absolute shrinkage operator (LASSO) with logistic link using area under the receiver operator characteristic (AUC-ROC) as a tuning criterion. The LASSO was subject to nonparametric bootstrapping to recover confidence intervals for inference of climatic variables on the classified regimes. Lastly, using simulated data generated from a stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, we provide possible mechanistic links between infectivity and regimes classified using BRS.</p>
