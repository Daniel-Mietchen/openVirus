<p id="p0010">Three novel coronaviruses that are capable of causing severe disease have emerged in human populations in the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century. The 2003 severe acute respiratory coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 2012 Middle East respiratory coronavirus (MERS-CoV) foreshadowed the emergence potential of zoonotic coronaviruses. In December 2019, a strain of coronavirus that was 22% different from the 2003 SARS-CoV, later named severe acute respiratory syndrome strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, and the resulting pandemic has caused over 3.2 million confirmed infections and over 225,000 deaths in nearly 5 months (as of April 29, 2020). The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies has simplified the tracking of viral sequence diversity and evolution in both human and animal populations. Metagenomic surveillance of bat populations in areas near population centers in China has led to the identification of numerous civet and bat coronavirus strains closely related to the 2003 SARS-CoV. Moreover, strains like BatCoV-RaTG13 and pangolin GD/P2S1 share 96.2% and &lt;90%, respectively, genome identity with SARS-CoV-2 (

 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al. (2020)</xref> outlined the two most notable genetic features of SARS-CoV-2 that likely contribute to its virulence in humans: (1) a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that is optimized for binding to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) molecule as the viral receptor and (2) the presence of a polybasic (furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary in the spike protein. The authors describe how these features contribute to virulence in other betacoronaviruses and then sketch two possibilities by which they may, through natural selection processes, have arisen in the coronavirus currently infecting humans worldwide.
