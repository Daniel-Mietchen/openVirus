<p id="p0030">Given the high correlation of many, but not all, of the early cases of COVID-19 disease in Wuhan with the Huanan wet market, it is possible that an animal reservoir of the virus was present at that location, and genome evolution analyses have suggested an earlier time of origin (
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). This scenario would have allowed for the establishment of earlier human-to-human transmission networks independent of the open market. The BtCoV-RaTG13 virus is the closest currently characterized relative to SARS-CoV-2, and it encodes 7/14 changes in the S glycoprotein RBD. More distantly related coronavirus genome sequences have also been identified in illegally imported Malayan pangolins (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2020</xref>), and while these strains encode 8/14 changes in the RBD interface residues, they do retain 6/6 of the most critical ACE2-interacting RBD residues with SARS-CoV-2 (
 <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Lam et al., 2020</xref>, 
 <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). The presence of highly related viral sequences in diverse species argues strongly for natural selection being the major driving force for the optimization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD among these related viruses. While a more homologous zoonotic relative has yet to be identified that shares the polybasic site with SARS-CoV-2, the sheer diversity of coronavirus sequences that have been identified in bat populations in China and worldwide indicates that zoonotic reservoirs are drastically under-sampled and under-characterized. Clearly, additional studies into the diversity of zoonotic coronavirus strains are essential for global public health preparedness, for the development of countermeasures, and to clarify the origins of SARS-CoV-2.
