<p id="p0035">Anderson et al. also argue that it is possible that a progenitor coronavirus jumped to humans prior to acquiring its polybasic site and key hACE2 interaction residues, acquiring these features through undetected human-to-human transmission events prior to the first documented cases of COVID-19 disease that triggered human surveillance systems (

In support, antibodies targeting the group 2b SARS-like coronaviruses can be detected in people living and working near or in bat hibernacula in China, suggesting frequent exposures in a rural setting. As SARS-CoV-2 infections are frequently asymptomatic or mild, initial exposures would easily have allowed for extended silent transmission events in rural settings prior to the emergence of a strain that could support sustained human-to-human transmission, especially when brought into an urban setting.
