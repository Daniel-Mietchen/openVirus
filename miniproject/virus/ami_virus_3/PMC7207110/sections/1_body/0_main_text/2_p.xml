 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Wan et al., 2020</xref>). However, while computational analyses indicate that this interaction has high affinity, the RBD sequence is clearly different from those shown to be optimal for hACE2 binding, suggesting that this binding interface is a product of a natural selection process on hACE2 or a human-like animal ACE2.
