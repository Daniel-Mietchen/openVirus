<p id="p0045">In summary, Andersen et al. have outlined many of the key elements of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that could be mediating its extraordinary global expansion and summarize how the virus may have emerged from zoonotic populations (
 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). The authors do not discuss the potential role for other less defined virulence determinants in the spike protein that alter host signaling networks and cytokine levels that may be associated with disease or transmission frequency. The virus, which is similar to yet distinct from the two previous zoonotic coronaviruses from the 21
 <sup>st</sup> century, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, marks the third emergence of a coronavirus that is capable of causing severe disease within the last 20 years. Novel bat coronaviruses have also emerged in swine populations in the past few years. As the pace of coronavirus emergence appears to be accelerating, these data not only underscore a common event in nature but also emphasize the urgency to develop vaccines and therapeutics with broad efficacy. Thus, studies characterizing the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing epitopes and identifying broadly cross-neutralizing epitopes are clear priorities for immunotherapeutic and vaccine countermeasure design. This work should be performed with due caution, ensuring that putative enhancing epitopes are likewise identified and avoided in the course of vaccine design to minimize the risk of potentiating disease. Additionally, T cell epitopes should be identified across outbred populations to determine the key correlates of protective immunity. A key priority in combating the current pandemic and constructing readiness programs for future emergence events is the development of broadly effective medical countermeasures and therapeutics that can be stockpiled as insurance against future viral emergence events to prevent the human loss and economic and social catastrophe of global pandemics.
