<p id="p0020">The other distinctive genetic feature SARS-CoV-2 possesses that potentially mediates virulence in humans is a polybasic (i.e., furin) cleavage site at the S1-S2 junction in the spike amino acid sequence. This site allows cleavage by proteases such as furin and is another factor that can determine viral infectivity and host range (

While such cleavage sites have not been detected in other lineage B betacoronaviruses, they have been identified in betacoronaviruses in lineages A and C (in HCoV-HKU1 and MERS-like CoVs, respectively). Moreover, the O-linked glycans likely associated with the polybasic site may alter immunogenicity in response to herd immunity within natural animal hosts, which is likely not necessary in naive human populations (
