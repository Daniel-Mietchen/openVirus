<p id="p0040">As emphasized by the authors, retroactive mapping of the paths of emergence of human pathogens is critical, especially in light of the global emergency fomented by the current pandemic. The presence of abundant sources of coronaviruses in zoonotic populations and the continuing and advancing encroachment of humans into animal habitats argue that emergence events will only become more common in future years. Indeed, prior to 2003, only two human coronaviruses were known: HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E, which cause mild, cold-like disease. After 2003, heightened surveillance retroactively identified two additional human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. Nearly 10 years separated the documented emergence of SARS-CoV in 2003 and MERS-CoV in 2012, and just under 8 years have now separated the emergences of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. These patterns suggest that the global ecology has shifted and now favors the continued emergence of zoonotic coronaviruses, resulting in micro-outbreaks, continued low-level epidemics, or global pandemics.</p>
