 </xref> in this edition of Resuscitation have examined possible emission of particles using 2 models – one a simulator manikin and the other a cadaver model. In the simulator model detergent detectable by ultraviolet light was nebulised into the manikin at an airflow rate of 8 l/min, and chest compression performed. For the cadaver model the airways and lungs were insufflated with the same ultraviolet sensitive detergent using an ambu bag via a shortened endotracheal tube. The endotracheal tube was then removed and chest compression was applied, with visualisation of the emitted material as in the simulator model.
