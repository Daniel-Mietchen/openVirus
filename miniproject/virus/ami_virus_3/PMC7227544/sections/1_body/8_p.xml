<p id="par0045">Infection control precautions are predicated on a conventional categorisation that recognises droplets as greater than 5 μm in size, and ‘larger droplets’ more than 10 μm, whereas an aerosol is defined by particles of less than 5 μm. However this simple division into particles above and below 5 μm, is entirely arbitrary. Recent analysis has shown that respiratory emissions from human coughs and sneezes constitute a mixture of mucosalivary droplets and a multiphase gas cloud or plume of matter which behaves in a dynamic manner.

 <xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Larger droplets settle out in the vicinity of the individual, contaminating the environment and acting as a direct and indirect contact risk. Smaller droplets evaporate as they move away from the warm moist airway, and become droplet nuclei or aerosol. Within the atmosphere of gas cloud aerosol may persist for much longer periods than isolated droplets. The trajectory of the cloud is influenced by evaporation rates (in turn affected by environmental humidity and temperature), and the speed and force of the cough or sneeze. Cough peak flow in normal adults is in excess of 400 l/min. Droplet nuclei may stay suspended in the air for hours depending on ambient conditions such ventilation, or air changes in the room.

 </xref> The presence of viral antigen within these droplets, and the infectivity of the material are further important variables. The exposure ‘dose’ from a cough, sneeze or exhalation is likely to vary according to the proximity of the healthcare worker (HCW) to the patient's airway, the patient's viral load, and the use and type of PPE protection. It is also plausible that underlying conditions such as asthma, bronchiectasis, and COPD may not only increase propensity to cough or wheeze, but may produce secretions with different muco-elastic properties, which affect particle size and behaviour.

Sputum produced in this group is observably different to the clearer more mucoid secretions found in those with viral infection and without pre-existing airway disease.
