<p id="par0030">These are interesting results, adding to argument that chest wall compression may be an AGP but the study raises further questions. It is clear that a plume of material was produced from both models, but particle size was not measured. It is likely than some aerosol generated was that from nebuliser in the simulator model. As a consequence it is difficult to know to what extent the simulator and even cadaver model reproduces chest wall recoil in patients, and the shifts in airflow associated with this. Moreover, droplets and aerosol from a human airway will behave physically in accordance with changes in temperature on exhalation, and other variables, which are quite different to the behaviour of particles in the simulator model or cadaver.</p>
