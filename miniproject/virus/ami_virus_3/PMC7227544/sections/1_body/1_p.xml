 </xref> This discrepancy highlights problems in understanding how respiratory aerosols are generated, and has important relevance to the risk management in those attending infected patients, including the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Full enhanced PPE (FFP3 mask, eye shield, gown and gloves) is recommended when managing patients using AGPs, whereas if the main source of transmission is thought to be droplets and/or direct/indirect contact when working within 2 m of the patient, the PPE recommended consists of surgical mask, eye protection, gloves and plastic apron.
