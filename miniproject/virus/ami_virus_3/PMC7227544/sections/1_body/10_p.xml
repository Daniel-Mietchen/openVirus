<p id="par0055">Overall these findings suggest that the risk of 
 <italic>aerosol transmission</italic> of SARS-COV-2 should be considered even in the absence of use of typical AGPs, and this alters considerations about PPE use in hospital and community settings.

 </xref> How should we use this information? While full enhanced PPE is indicated for aerosol generating procedures, the above work suggests that some patients themselves are aerosol generators, and this is a particular risk in COVID-19. Persistent cough in an individual with high viral load may conceivably put those in the vicinity at as much risk as if, say, continuous positive airway pressure or non-invasive ventilation is applied. Distancing of more than 2 m may also be insufficient in those with a paroxysmal, propulsive cough. This may also explain the increased occupational risk to members of the public such as taxi and bus drivers in an enclosed environment, in the vicinity an infected passenger. Clearly mitigating the effects of the cough with the patient using a surgical mask is useful, but not always possible e.g. in a child. Those with pre-existing respiratory disorders may also find face coverings difficult to tolerate. Undoubtedly this creates a dilemma, as it is not feasible to use enhanced PPE, in particular FFP3 or N95 masks during all patient contacts. However, it remains the case that clinical situations should be judged and managed according to risk, and PHE recognise that ‘
 <italic>provision of healthcare is dynamic and in a single care episode more than one context may be encountered, PPE should be changed (upgraded) as appropriate</italic>’.
