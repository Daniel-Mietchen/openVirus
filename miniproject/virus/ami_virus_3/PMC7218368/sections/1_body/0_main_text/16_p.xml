<p id="p0085">This project will also facilitate the detection of individuals naturally resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Why would the spouse of a patient already ill for days and now in intensive care remain not only healthy but seronegative? How could a health care worker treating contagious COVID-19 patients with insufficient protection remain healthy and seronegative? If such individuals also test negative for TÂ cell responses to SARS-CoV-2, it is plausible that some are genetically resistant to the virus. The first example of such a situation was a regulatory DARC variant discovered in the 1970s and deciphered genetically in 1995. In the homozygous state, this variant confers resistance to 
 <italic>Plamodium vivax</italic> by abolishing the expression of a parasite receptor on erythrocytes. Two other known monogenic forms of resistance are more directly relevant to COVID-19. Homozygosity for 
 <italic>CCR5</italic> null mutations protects against CCR5-tropic HIV, and homozygosity for null 
 <italic>FUT2</italic> alleles protects against intestinal norovirus infection. Similarly, we speculate that loss-of-function variants of 
 <italic>ACE2</italic>, encoding a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, might confer resistance, while hypomorphic variants might protect against severe disease in infected individuals. Identifying the genetic basis of resistance to SARS-CoV-2 would provide a pharmacological target for preventing or reducing viral infection in other individuals.
