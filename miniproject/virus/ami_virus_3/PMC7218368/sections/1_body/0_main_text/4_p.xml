<p id="p0025">These studies launched a painstaking mission to decipher the genetic basis of susceptibility to infections in humans, from the individual to whole-population levels. This genetic patient-by-patient, family-by-family, disorder-by-disorder approach was highly productive in the few patients studied but seemed unlikely to deliver results of great significance for the general population. First, the phenotype of multiple and familial infections is not observed in most people, who typically display isolated and sporadic infections. Second, populations consist of huge numbers of individuals, so defining the population genetic architecture of infectious diseases through causal analyses and genetics of individual cases is a Herculean task. A more tenable pathway from the population to the individual was proposed, based on associations and biometrics.</p>
