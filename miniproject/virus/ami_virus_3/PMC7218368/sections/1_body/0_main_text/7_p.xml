<p id="p0040">After 1996, the horizons of the field of inborn errors of immunity broadened, with discoveries of both Mendelian and non-Mendelian monogenic bases of infectious diseases striking previously healthy, seemingly immune competent patients. This paradigm shift was inspired by two spectacular forward genetics studies in which the genetic bases of susceptibility to influenza virus (
 <italic>Mx</italic> locus, 1962) or 
 <italic>Mycobacterium bovis</italic> BCG (
 <italic>Bcg</italic> locus, 1975) were characterized in inbred mice. The protein encoded by 
 <italic>Mx</italic>, a gene cloned by cell complementation, protects mice from influenza virus (

 <italic>Nramp1</italic> mutations render animals susceptible to mycobacteria (
