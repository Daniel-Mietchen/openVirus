<p id="p0045">Unlike specific gene-targeting approaches, these two studies focused on mouse phenotypes suggestive of a narrow pattern of infection susceptibility. These laboratory mice were not challenged with as many microbes as they would encounter in the wild, but elucidation of the underlying genotypes and mechanisms confirmed that the corresponding gene products were probably essential for immunity to only a few infectious agents. Prior to these results, human monogenic inborn errors of immunity were considered to be rare, Mendelian disorders underlying recurrent, multiple, and often unusual infections in individual patients. After, the search for the molecular and cellular basis of human genetic susceptibility to isolated infections, rare or common, began in earnest.</p>
