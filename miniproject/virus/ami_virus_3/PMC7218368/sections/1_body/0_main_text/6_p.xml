<p id="p0035">We can hope that genome-wide association studies for COVID-19 will generate results of similar or greater importance. Nevertheless, this approach is intrinsically limited by genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity and by the need for multiple testing corrections. More importantly, statistical association studies do not provide mechanisms. Without determining the chain of cause and consequence, causality between a candidate genotype and a clinical phenotype remains uncertain, no matter how statistically probable. In human medicine, establishing causality between genotype and phenotype requires the rigorous validation of mechanisms at the molecular, cellular, tissue, and whole-organism levels. The genome of the individual must explain the mechanisms underlying severe COVID-19, and this requires in-depth biochemical and immunological studies. Investigators have thus long been faced with the cruel dilemma of deeply understanding a single patient through genetics or attempts at understanding the entire population through biometrics.</p>
