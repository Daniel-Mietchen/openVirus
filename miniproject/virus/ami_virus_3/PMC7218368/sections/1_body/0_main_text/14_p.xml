<p id="p0075">More importantly, this initiative will also detect genetic homogeneity, if the same gene is mutated in geographically distant patients. The analysis and comparison of genetic variants from a large number of individuals from diverse backgrounds will be crucial, as we cannot solely rely on current databases of data for “healthy” individuals to identify rare variants, which include individuals never before exposed to SARS-CoV-2. A large sample of genomes may also facilitate the detection of a polygenic background for monogenic mutations or the testing of polygenic signals detected by other studies. Finally, the inclusion of patients of diverse ancestries will make it possible to detect candidate genotypes specific or common to ancestries and to consider the evolutionary forces driving variation at these loci (

Once candidate genotypes have been identified, their contribution to the pathogenicity of severe COVID-19 will be investigated with in-depth molecular, cellular, and immunological approaches. Studies of single patients can be illuminating, but more detailed mechanistic studies are required for firm conclusions (
