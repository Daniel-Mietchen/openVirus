<p id="p0030">The ambitious population-based biometrics approach to studying infectious diseases, initiated in the 1950s, highlights the persistent divide between Mendelian geneticists and Galtonian biometricians. The biometric approach began with a spectacular discovery when Anthony Allison found that the sickle cell trait provided 10-fold protection against severe forms of 
 <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria. With hindsight, this discovery told us more about the selective pressure imposed by malaria on the 
 <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> genome than the mechanism by which individual human genomes predispose to malaria. It provided no significant explanation of malaria at the individual level, as it failed to explain why about 1 in 1,000 infected children develops severe malaria, or 1 in 10,000 sickle cell trait carriers. Furthermore, despite this initial breakthrough, the biometric approach fell short of its promise. Other association studies, whether genome-wide or candidate gene based, have not matched Allison’s discovery, in terms of effect size or proportion of the variance explained. However, this approach did yield two important results concerning viruses. Some HLA class I alleles are strongly associated with lower viral loads in the blood and slower disease progression in individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and homozygotes for a type III IFN (
 <italic>IFNL3</italic>-
 <italic>IFNL4)</italic> haplotype are more likely to clear hepatitis C virus spontaneously during primary infection.
