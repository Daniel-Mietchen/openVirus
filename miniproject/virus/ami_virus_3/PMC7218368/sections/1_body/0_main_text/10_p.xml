<p id="p0055">These studies paved the way for investigation of other sporadic infectious diseases, testing the hypothesis that they might be monogenic but not Mendelian. This hypothesis has been confirmed by molecular genetic studies, beginning with viral diseases in 2007 (
 <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The first and best example is that of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) encephalitis, a sporadic disease caused, in ∼5%–10% of cases, by mutations affecting the TLR3 or snoRNA31 pathways (forebrain infection) or DBR1 (brainstem infection) (
 <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). These mutations impair neuron-intrinsic immunity to HSV-1 in the CNS. Other examples more closely related to COVID-19 include influenza virus pneumonia, which can be caused by inborn errors impairing antiviral type I and III IFN immunity (IFN-α/β and -λ), including IRF7, IRF9, and TLR3 deficiencies, in circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells and/or pulmonary epithelial cells (

 <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Lim et al., 2019</xref>), and rhinovirus pneumonia, which can be caused by a deficiency of IFN-inducing MDA5 (

 <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Lamborn et al., 2017</xref>). These disorders underlie severe viral disease through the impairment of antiviral type I and/or III IFN immunity.
