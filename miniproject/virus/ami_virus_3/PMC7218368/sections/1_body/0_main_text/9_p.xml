<p id="p0050">Rare human “Mendelian infections” had been recognized since the description in 1946 of epidermodysplasia verruciformis, an autosomal recessive predisposition to viral warts and cancer. However, they remained largely neglected until 1996, when the first inborn error of immunity selectively underlying infectious disease segregating in families as a Mendelian trait was molecularly deciphered (
 <xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). The first and best studied of these conditions is Mendelian susceptibility to mycobacterial disease (MSMD), caused by inborn errors of type II interferon (IFN-γ). Additionally, both Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and beta human papillomaviruses (beta HPV) are usually benign but can cause a lethal disease that is strictly Mendelian. Severe EBV-induced disease can be caused by inborn errors that disrupt the killing of EBV-infected B cells by cytotoxic T and natural killer (NK) cells. These deficiencies affect the collaboration between two major arms of adaptive immunity. By contrast, epidermodysplasia verruciformis results from disruption of the EVER-CIB1-dependent control of beta HPV in keratinocytes, a deficiency of non-hematopoietic, cell-intrinsic immunity. Together with MSMD and two other fungal infections, these disorders define the five known Mendelian infections.
