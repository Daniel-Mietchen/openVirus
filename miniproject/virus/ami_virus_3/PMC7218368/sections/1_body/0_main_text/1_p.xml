<p id="p0010">There are seven known human-tropic coronaviruses (CoV), three of which have caused severe epidemics. These three RNA viruses—SARS-CoV-1 (discovered in 2002), MERS-CoV (2012), and SARS-CoV-2 (2019)—are much more virulent than the other four (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1), which cause common colds and only rare cases of severe disease, including pneumonia. In 2002, SARS-CoV-1 caused an epidemic limited to China. In 2012, MERS-CoV caused an epidemic that began in Saudi Arabia, subsequently spreading primarily in the Middle East before containment. SARS-CoV-2 was first detected in China in 2019, but has since become a devastating ongoing global pandemic. Most SARS-CoV-2 infections are asymptomatic or benign, but SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) can cause life-threatening disease, which typically begins with pneumonia. Severe COVID-19 occurs much more frequently in patients over the age of 50 years and/or with comorbid conditions such as pulmonary, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders (

Life-threatening disease probably strikes less than 1 in 1,000 infected individuals below the age of 50 without underlying conditions but more than 1 in 10 infected patients over the age of 80 years with multiple comorbidities. The identification of advanced age and comorbidities as major risk factors is clinically important and suggests that the decline of the body weakens immunity, which may be difficult to translate into molecular, cellular, and immunological terms.
