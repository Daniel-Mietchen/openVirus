<p id="p0020">Since 1950, genetic and molecular studies have provided an immunological basis for inherited predispositions to infectious diseases. Patient- and family-based studies led to the discovery of autosomal recessive neutropenia and X-linked recessive agammaglobulinemia. These two seminal inborn errors of immunity appeared to be Mendelian, and the pathophysiological mechanism of each was elucidated, providing proof of principle for genetic predisposition to human infectious diseases. These and many other inborn errors of immunity are individually rare and underlie multiple, recurrent, and often unusual infections in individual patients. Since 1985, molecular genetics studies have confirmed these disorders to be Mendelian (monogenic with complete clinical penetrance).</p>
