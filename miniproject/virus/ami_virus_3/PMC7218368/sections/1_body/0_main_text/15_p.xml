<p id="p0080">We anticipate that monogenic cases will provide insight into other types of cases, such as severe COVID-19 in elderly patients with several comorbid conditions, suggesting novel therapeutic possibilities for these patients. The pathogenesis may be similar in these patients, with different causes converging on common pathophysiological mechanisms. For example, inborn errors of IFN-γ and IL-17A/F immunity underlie mycobacteriosis and candidiasis, respectively. The same infections occur in patients with autoantibodies against IFN-γ and IL-17A/F, and in patients infected with HIV who have low levels of IFN-γ and IL-17A/F production by CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells, providing broader indications for the therapeutic use of the corresponding cytokines. Thus, monogenic cases may clarify pathogenesis more broadly for COVID-19 patients. Such clarification cannot easily be achieved by directly studying patients with acquired immunodeficiencies, due to the many confounding factors and difficulties in determining whether immunological abnormalities in patients are causes or consequences of infection. Genetics provides us with access to the root cause of phenomena.
