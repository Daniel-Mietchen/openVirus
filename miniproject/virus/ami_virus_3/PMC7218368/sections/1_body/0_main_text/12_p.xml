<p id="p0065">COVID-19 is a completely new disease, and the current pandemic dwarfs previous SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV outbreaks. We can, therefore, study newly infected patients on a massive scale, with minimal interference from vaccines, previous related infections, and herd immunity, in sharp distinction to influenza. COVID-19 provides us with a tragic but unparalleled opportunity to define precisely the genetic requirements for the control of an emerging, virulent, viral infection. The body makes use of the pleiotropic functions of many cells to control infection, including subsets of pulmonary cells and leukocytes. Many genes are also pleiotropic. Genome-wide searches for candidate monogenic, or digenic, disorders should therefore be immunologically agnostic, testing diverse genetic hypotheses. Approaches should include searching not only for highly penetrant rare variants but also for common variants that can be highly penetrant in specific infections, as recently shown for a common monogenic etiology of tuberculosis (

 <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Drutman et al., 2020</xref>). Amid the uncertainties concerning the genetic architecture of COVID-19 suceptibility, only one thing is almost certain: as for other infectious diseases, there will be considerable genetic heterogeneity, reflecting the multiple layers of host defense that a virus must overcome to lead to mortality.
