<p id="p0070">To understand the genetic requirements for immune control of SARS-CoV-2, in February 2020, we began recruiting COVID-19 patients from as many centers and countries as possible to the COVID Human Genetic Effort. We target young patients (&lt;50 years) with life-threatening disease and no pre-existing medical conditions. Our initiative has been rapidly expanding, with a growing number of centers that recruit patients, take clinical histories, and send blood samples to sequencing hubs. The exome and genome data are analyzed simultaneously locally at the hubs and centrally by the consortium. Hypotheses of genetic heterogeneity (one causal locus per kindred) and genetic homogeneity (a causal locus in two or more kindreds) are being tested in parallel. The large number of patients may facilitate the detection of promising candidate genotypes in single patients or families, including variants of known viral susceptibility genes.</p>
