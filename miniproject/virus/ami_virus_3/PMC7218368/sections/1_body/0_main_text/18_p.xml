<p id="p0095">The COVID-19 pandemic should make us consider an alternative approach to studying infectious diseases. We have all witnessed enormous interindividual clinical variability in response to SARS-CoV-2 exposure, ranging from resistance to death, and everything in between. Similar variability is observed for all human-tropic microbes, whether viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites. The proportion of life-threatening cases varies among microbes, from less than one in a million to greater than one in ten. This clinical variability during primary infection is the fundamental “infection enigma,” which in 1955, led René Dubos to pen “Second thoughts on the germ theory” (
 <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Dubos, 1955</xref>). It is now time to test more comprehensively the hypothesis that the clinical manifestations of human infections, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2, can be governed by human genetics, at least in outliers resistant to infection or unusually prone to severe disease. This paradigm shift would open up new avenues for studying host-pathogen interactions in the course of evolution, controlling the current COVID-19 threat in the general population, and developing the infrastructure required to thwart future emerging threats.
