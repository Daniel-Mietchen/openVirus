<p id="p0015">However, there is also a more perplexing, but perhaps less difficult, problem. Why are previously healthy children, adolescents, young, or middle-aged adults being admitted to intensive care for respiratory failure, encephalitis, or Kawasaki disease, due to COVID-19? Why would a 40-year-old man who completed a marathon in October 2019 find himself intubated and ventilated for COVID-19 respiratory failure in April 2020? The COVID Human Genetic Effort (

This hypothesis is not yet supported by specific genetic epidemiological studies of COVID-19, but it follows a long line of classical genetic studies since 1905, relating to diverse infections in plants and animals, including humans (

Twin studies have shown that concordance rates for some infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, are much higher for monozygotic than dizygotic twins. Adoption studies have shown that early death from any type of infection is paradoxically correlated with early death from infection of the biological but not the foster parents. Finally, susceptibility to various infectious diseases has been shown, particularly by segregation studies, to be heritable and to reflect the impact of a major gene.
