<p id="p0060">Similar immunological scenarios, and even some of the same inborn errors, could underlie severe pulmonary COVID-19 in previously healthy young patients with monogenic disorders. In the absence of known human genetic determinants of susceptibility to other coronaviruses, influenza is likely to provide the best comparison. The threshold levels of type I and/or III IFN for protection against SARS-CoV-2 might be similar to those for the 1918 influenza virus but higher than those for seasonal influenza. IFN-dependent control of the virus could be profoundly impaired during initial infection in patients with early-onset pneumonia, whereas those whose condition deteriorates later could have milder IFN deficiency or genetically determined excessive inflammation. For example, 
 <italic>IL18BP</italic> mutations underlie fulminant viral hepatitis because they unleash IL-18-dependent inflammation in the liver, whereas 
 <italic>SH2D1A</italic> mutations underlie hemophagocytosis following B cell infection with EBV. Inborn errors could impair IFN immunity in leukocytes or pulmonary cells or enhance local or systemic inflammation. It will be interesting to determine whether known inborn errors of inflammation, such as deficiencies of IL-1 or IL-6 immunity, protect against severe forms of COVID-19. Inborn errors of cell-intrinsic immunity in the CNS might be involved in the rarer neurological complications of COVID-19. The anosmia reported by some patients suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may infect the olfactory bulb, from which it may invade the forebrain, as for HSV-1 in patients with 
 <italic>TLR3</italic> mutations.
