  <p>Monogenic Causes of Susceptibility or Resistance to SARS-CoV-2 Infection</p>
  <p>In the naive general population (black), a proportion of people become symptomatic (purple) when infected. Severe cases (red) tend to occur in the elderly or in those patients having co-morbidities. However, rare “idiopathic” severe cases can occur in the young without co-morbidities, and these are hypothesized to represent patients with monogenic causes. A proportion of people remain asymptomatic (blue) when infected. In some instances, these may be people who remain resistant to infection (orange), who can be identified by their remaining seronegative despite heavy or repeated exposures to the virus.
