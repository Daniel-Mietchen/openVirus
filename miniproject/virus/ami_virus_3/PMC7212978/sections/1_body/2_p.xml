 </xref> The advantages offered by ultraviolet radiation make UVGI (ultraviolet disinfection) a very effective disinfection tool.

 </xref> Ultraviolet light can be classified into three subtypes by radiation wavelengths: ultraviolet A (320-400 nm), ultraviolet B (280–320 nm) and ultraviolet C (200–280 nm).

 </xref> The commonly used wavelength for UVGI is ultraviolet C because its germicidal effectiveness peak wavelength is 260–265 nm, which is equivalent to the peak of ultraviolet radiation absorption of nucleic acids.

 </xref> It is known that as the ultraviolet wavelength decreases, the germicidal effect of ultraviolet radiation increases.

  <sup>8</sup>
 </xref> Therefore, ultraviolet wavelengths below 320 nm are classed as actinic—ie, causing photochemical reactions. Since ultraviolet A radiation is insufficiently absorbed by viral nucleic acid, ultraviolet A radiation is not considered germicidal.
