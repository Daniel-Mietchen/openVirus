<p id="para20">The output of both the popular and scientific press have included hopeful speeches by politicians or scientists suggesting that the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will be contained within the coming months because of increasing temperatures and solar ultraviolet radiation during the summer season in countries in the northern hemisphere. However, solar ultraviolet radiation and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) are not the same. To evaluate effectiveness of ultraviolet radiation, we need to consider the virology of SARS-CoV-2, an enveloped, single stranded RNA virus. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel betacoronavirus and showed 88% genome similarity with two SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) found in bats: SL-CoV-ZC45 and SL-CoVZXC21.
