 </xref> Ultraviolet radiation that is totally absorbed by the ozone layer is accepted as having the optimum germicidal wavelength—ie, ultraviolet C radiation.

 </xref> Unifying all these principles, it is clear that sunlight reaching the ground lacks germicidal ultraviolet C radiation.

 <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Studies show that UVGI methods can be used effectively to eliminate viruses—eg, in health-care facilities, schools, indoors, etc—by using special ultraviolet radiation systems (ultraviolet C lamps, chambers). Also, it is known that the ultraviolet absorption peak of RNA viruses is around 250 nm wavelength.

 </xref> Therefore, the germicidal effectiveness of ultraviolet C radiation is limited to such applications and sunlight is not an alternative. However, some studies based on SARS-CoV, have shown that at least 60°C (which the earth does not reach to this temperature) and a minimum of 90 min are required to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
