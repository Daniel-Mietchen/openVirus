<p id="para50">In the absence of scientific evidence showing ultraviolet B radiation's germicidal effectiveness on SARS-CoV-2, both politicians and scientists should avoid voicing assumptions on the effect of sunlight on viral transmission. Such uninformed statements can promoted misunderstanding and offer unrealistic hope to communities. This misunderstanding can also cause lethargy with regard to the government measurements in place in the community. Further studies should be done by simulating complex environmental conditions, in which a number of variables will test the effectiveness of ultraviolet B radiation against environmental SARS-CoV-2.</p>
