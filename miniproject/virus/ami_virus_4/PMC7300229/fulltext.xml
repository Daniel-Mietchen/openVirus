PRV tagged with a fluorescent reporter gene as a tracker has been used to analyze neuronal circuits, including anterograde and retrograde. In this study, we used fosmid library to construct a rapid and efficient platform to generate recombinant PRV. Firstly, the highly purified PRV ShuangCheng (SC) genomic DNA was sheared randomly into approximately 30&#x02013;49-kb DNA fragments. After end-blunting and phosphorylation, the DNA fragments were cloned into the fosmid vector and transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. A total of 200 fosmids that cover the complete genome of PRV SC was sequenced. Thirteen fosmid combinations in five groups were transfected into Vero cells, respectively, and each group can successfully rescue PRV strain SC. There was no significant difference between wild type and recombinant in both morphology and growth kinetics. In the next step, an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was fused into the amino-terminal of UL36 protein by Red/ET recombination technology, and recombinant rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was rescued successfully. At last, the single viral particles with green fluorescent were monitored retrograde moving in the axon with an average velocity of 0.71 &#x000b1; 0.43 &#x003bc;m/s at 0.5&#x02013;2 h post infection (hpi) and anterograde moving with an average velocity of 0.75 &#x000b1; 0.49 &#x003bc;m/s at eight hpi. Integration of fosmid library and Red/ET recombination technology in our work was highly efficient and stable for constructing PRV recombinants. This study will accelerate understanding the biology of PRV and the development of novel vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>pseudorabies virus</kwd><kwd>fosmid library</kwd><kwd>UL36</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>transport</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><table-count count="4"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="36"/><page-count count="13"/><word-count count="0"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a neurotropic herpesvirus, a member of <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic> subfamily (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2011</xref>). PRV invades the axon-endings distributed in the epithelial tissue after infection and replication at the epithelial cells. In detail, membrane fusion initiated between PRV envelope membrane and nerve cell membrane facilitates PRV to enter into neurons. Immediately, PRV virions undergo axonal retrograde transport from the axon to soma side and replicate in the nucleus. Subsequently, progeny virions are assembled and transported through the nervous system. Meanwhile, latency can also develop at the cell body in the neuron (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Koyuncu et al., 2013</xref>). Due to the latent infection, it is very difficult to eradicate PRV. The direct contact between diseased animals and healthy animals is the main transmission route for this disease (<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Pomeranz et al., 2017</xref>). Clinical symptoms of PRV-infected pigs vary by age. Fattening pigs mainly suffer from respiratory disorders, while nursery pigs and younger piglets die from central nervous system (CNS) disorders (<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Pomeranz et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>After PRV particle binding to axonal terminal, viral envelopes of PRV fuse with the plasma membrane of host cells. Then, viral particles enter into the axon where most tegument proteins are released into the cytoplasm. However, the inner tegument proteins such as UL37, UL36, UL21, UL16, UL14, US3, and ICP0 remain associated with capsids, and this capsid tegument complexes are transported toward nucleus where progeny viral genome is replicated (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Luxton et al., 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Radtke et al., 2010</xref>). Several tegument proteins such as UL36, UL37, and UL21 play an essential role in recruiting motors for viral capsid tegument complexes for retrograde transport (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Luxton et al., 2006</xref>). UL36 and UL37 proteins interact with each other to form a physical complex (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>); on one hand, UL36 is the critical protein that directly binds to the dynein motor subunit p150 and p50, on the other hand, UL37 renders PRV neuroinvasion and retrograde axonal transport (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2017</xref>). Viral particles are unable to retrograde transport when UL36 is deleted. The deletion of UL37 does not show the same result as the UL36; UL37-deleted PRV is defective for secondary envelopment, which reduces capsid transport (<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Schipke et al., 2012</xref>). UL21 is another protein associated with neuroinvasion. It can promote PRV retrograde transport through interaction with cytoplasmic dynein light chain Roadblock-1 (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2019</xref>); however, UL21 mutation causes a delay in the spread to presynaptic neurons and reduces infectious particle production (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Curanovic et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>US9 is the key factor for recruiting KIF1A to promote anterograde transport which also needs gE and gI as helper proteins. Additionally, UL36 and US11, as candidates of PRV viral proteins, could recruit kinesin motors to envelop viral particles for anterograde transport. So UL36 interacts with motor proteins of opposite polarity and transport viral particles in both the anterograde and retrograde directions (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Diefenbach et al., 2002</xref>). Fundamentally, the visualization of axonal transportation is the most convincing strategy to access this process, and the possible idealized marker locus is UL36 due to its direct interaction with molecular motor dynein (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zaichick et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>For neurotropic herpesvirus, viral particles tagged with fluorescent protein have proven to be a powerful tool to visualize virus replication cycle and transport in long-distance of neurons (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hogue et al., 2014</xref>). Since PRV is a linear, double-stranded DNA virus of about 143 kb, it is not easy to alter such a big genome. At present, several genetic manipulation methods have been used to modify the genome of PRV, including homologous recombination, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), and CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Lerma et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Hubner et al., 2018</xref>). These methods were time-consuming and labor-intensive due to a series of plaque purification or were genetically unstable. Recently, the fosmid library for PRV TJ strain has been established by <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al. (2018)</xref> and successfully constructed the rPRV TJ-VP26-EGFP. It was easily operated and highly efficient (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the fosmid library is relatively dynamic at present due to the high recombination efficiency and the needlessness of purification (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Extensive vaccination with Bartha-K61 vaccine strain has controlled PRV epidemics in China. Nevertheless, the disease still continue to circulate in China, especially after the emergence of variant PRV (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2013</xref>). All known full-length PRV sequences from the GenBank were divided into two clades according to ML phylogenetic tree analysis, and all the strains isolated from China were grouped in one clade (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2019</xref>). For the variant strain PRV TJ as an example, sequence comparison revealed that about 62 of total 67 viral proteins displayed variations compared with the previous isolates, and there are 43 viral proteins different compared with PRV ShuangCheng (SC) (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). To explore the characteristics of PRV, a convenient and efficient gene manipulation platform for PRVs is essential, especially for studying the evolution of PRV. Fosmid library is a convenient tool with numerous advantages.</p><p>In this study, a fosmid library for PRV SC was constructed. Using the fosmid library as well as Red/ET-mediated recombination, a recombinant rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP with EGFP fused into the amino-terminal of UL36 was successfully generated. It can help to visualize both anterograde and retrograde transport in neural circuits without affecting virus replication. This work will accelerate the progress of the PRV study and the development of novel vaccines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2.SS1"><title>Cells and Virus</title><p>The PRV SC strain (GenBank accession number: <ext-link ext-link-type="DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank" xlink:href="KT809429.1">KT809429.1</ext-link>) is a virulent strain isolated in China in 1980, which is a reference challenge virus to evaluate the efficacy of the Bartha-K61 vaccine in China (<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Yuan et al., 1987</xref>).

The rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was added into two wells of the microfluidics and flowed into the chamber in the axonal side. In the first 10&#x02013;20 min, the green particles randomly distributed in the medium; only a minority of viral particles that attached to the axon terminals were captured in the same focal length with the axons. At this time, viral particles were quiet at the vision of microscope as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. A little of the particles had entered into the axon, and maybe part of viral particles just attached to the upper axon not the end.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>FIGURE 5</label><caption><p>Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged capsid moving in the neuron.

There is more than one mode of movement after penetration of viral particles into the axon. Some viral particles in the terminal axon were moving toward the cell body (retrograde movement), here, the movement of one EGFP-tagged capsid was observed during 0&#x02013;32 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), but some capsids stopped halfway to the cell center (stationary). Other viral particles just moved back at one stage (anterograde movement) and forward at the next stage. The percentages of capsids in the three states including anterograde movement, retrograde movement, and stationary state were calculated as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>. In detail, 57.3% of total capsids moved through the retrograde at 0.5 hpi, 27.4% of capsids moved through anterograde, and 15.3% remained in stationary state. So, majority of viral capsids moved toward the cell body after entering into the axon. The instantaneous velocity of retrograde movement varied from 0 to 2.22 &#x003bc;m/s, and the average velocity was 0.71 &#x000b1; 0.43 &#x003bc;m/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5E</xref>).</p><p>The green fluorescence particles retrograde transport intermittently only happened at the first 0.5 to 2 h. The time duration varied based on the length and number of axons. Another continual particle movement can be observed until 8 hpi; the virus run away from the cell body (anterograde) reverse to the first 2 h observed, the movement of one particle from 0&#x02013;13.2 s was shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>. The capsids also perform three states at this time, including anterograde movement, retrograde movement, and stationary state. The percentages of each state were 50.9%, 30.4%, and 18.7%. So half of them moved far away from the cell body. The instantaneous velocity of anterograde movement varied from 0 to 2.35 &#x003bc;m/s, and the average velocity was 0.75 &#x000b1; 0.49 &#x003bc;m/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>Overview of the speed distribution of anterograde and retrograde shows that the forward velocity is widely distributed between 0 and 1.5 &#x003bc;m/s, while the reverse velocity tends to the normal distribution curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D,E</xref>). Subsequently, the distribution of virus particles&#x02019; state in the axon shows that the viral particles mainly conduct retrograde transport at 0.5&#x02013;2 hpi and mainly conduct anterograde transport at about eight hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Those results indicate that rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was suitable for tracing PRV behavior between cell body and axon in the neuron.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The technology for constructing recombination PRV develops quickly in recent years. CRISPR/Cas9 is applied, which leads to the gene deletion mutation easier than before, but the method cannot be used in the gene insertion mutation, especially specific site mutation and seamless insert (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, plaque purification of recombination PRVs from parental viruses always takes more than 1 month. Infectious BAC of PRV, another genetic manipulation technology, is efficient for gene insertion and deletion using Red/ET technology in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Osterrieder et al., 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, it takes several months to construct BAC clones, but the genetic and phenotypic change occurs in the recombinant virus due to the unstable large genome of PRV in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Fosmid library is a powerful platform for rescuing DNA viruses and has been used in genomic manipulation of DNA viruses to generate a duck enteritis virus vaccine strain (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The first fosmid library for pseudorabies variant strain PRV TJ has been reported in 2018 by our group (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, a fosmid library for pseudorabies strain PRV SC was established using the same method. In this study, we got 200 fosmid DNAs that cover the whole genome of PRV SC. Most of the DNA segments are between 30 and 49 kb, and each fragment was cloned into pCC1FOS vector hosted in the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain separately. The positive percentage of most of the fragments was more than 90%. We selected 13 plasmids separated into five groups, five plasmids in one group, and all the groups can rescue the virus successfully. Further, we rescued the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strains. There is no significant difference between rPRV SC and PRV SC in growth kinetics, restriction profiles, plaque size, and morphology of virus particles, so the fosmid groups are highly efficient for recovering recombination PRV SC.</p><p>The capsid protein VP26 was fused usually with fluorescent protein such as EGFP, Red, or mCherry as a tool for tracing PRV in neural circuits, but the amino-terminal of VP26 fused with EGFP would reduce virus replication by nearly 10-fold (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Douglas et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Krautwald et al., 2008</xref>). The recombinant virus with mCherry fusion to VP26 carboxy-terminal expresses more VP26 fusion protein in infected cells and incorporates more VP26 fusion protein into virus particles. Individual virus particle exhibits brighter red fluorescence compared to the amino-terminal mCherry&#x02013;VP26 fusion virus (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hogue et al., 2018</xref>). However, the fluorescent protein fusion to VP26 of herpes simplex virus (HSV) is also reported to cause a reduction of the neurovirulence in mice (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Krautwald et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>UL36 is the critical protein that links PRV capsid with the dynein of the neuron. UL36 and UL37 form viral capsid&#x02013;tegument complexes for retrograde transport <italic>via</italic> an amino-terminal domain. The carboxy-terminal of UL36 comprises a proline/alanine-rich region that plays an essential role in PRV replication (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bottcher et al., 2006</xref>). In this work, EGFP protein was fused to the amino-terminal of UL36 protein, and rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP performs the same morphology, growth kinetics, and plaque sizes with the parental virus; all these show EGFP protein fused at the amino-terminal of UL36 protein did not affect viral replication and also did not affect the pathogenicity to mouse. The green fluorescent-labeled capsid moving along the axon of neuron both anterograde and retrograde was monitored step by step, and the average velocities of retrograde and anterograde movements were 0.71 &#x000b1; 0.43 and 0.75 &#x000b1; 0.49 &#x003bc;m/s. This is close to 0.62 &#x000b1; 0.18 &#x003bc;m/s of HSV anterograde movement in cortical neuron axons by the same statistical analysis method (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). However, The average of PRV movement speed was 1.2 &#x003bc;m/s in the research by <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hogue et al. (2018)</xref>, while the events less than 0.5 &#x003bc;m/s were deleted in the data of Gaussian distribution. The velocity changed at different times post-infection (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the virus strain, the kind of neuron, and statistical analysis method may all affect the reported average speed of capsid transport in axon retrograde. So EGFP fusion to the amino-terminal of UL36 did not affect capsid&#x02013;tegument complexes transport along the axon of neuron <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our result demonstrated that the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP could be used for tracking PRV movement in the neuron.</p><p>In summary, this fosmid library was efficient and flexible for rescuing recombination PRV SC. The fosmid library and Red/ET technology would be applied in other PRV strains and other DNA virus research. We successfully rescue the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP using this method. Moreover, we found that the EGFP fusion to the amino-terminal of UL36 did not affect viral replication and could also work as a tool for tracing PRV in neural circuits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="S5"><title>Data Availability Statement</title><p>All datasets generated for this study are included in the article/supplementary material.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>The animal study was reviewed and approved by The Animal Ethics Committee approval number is Heilongjiang-SYXK- 2006-032.</p></sec><sec id="S7"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>YS and H-JQ designed the research.
