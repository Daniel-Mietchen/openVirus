<p>Extensive vaccination with Bartha-K61 vaccine strain has controlled PRV epidemics in China. Nevertheless, the disease still continue to circulate in China, especially after the emergence of variant PRV (
 <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">An et al., 2013</xref>). All known full-length PRV sequences from the GenBank were divided into two clades according to ML phylogenetic tree analysis, and all the strains isolated from China were grouped in one clade (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">He et al., 2019</xref>). For the variant strain PRV TJ as an example, sequence comparison revealed that about 62 of total 67 viral proteins displayed variations compared with the previous isolates, and there are 43 viral proteins different compared with PRV ShuangCheng (SC) (
 <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Luo et al., 2014</xref>). To explore the characteristics of PRV, a convenient and efficient gene manipulation platform for PRVs is essential, especially for studying the evolution of PRV. Fosmid library is a convenient tool with numerous advantages.
