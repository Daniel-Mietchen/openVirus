<p>US9 is the key factor for recruiting KIF1A to promote anterograde transport which also needs gE and gI as helper proteins. Additionally, UL36 and US11, as candidates of PRV viral proteins, could recruit kinesin motors to envelop viral particles for anterograde transport. So UL36 interacts with motor proteins of opposite polarity and transport viral particles in both the anterograde and retrograde directions (
