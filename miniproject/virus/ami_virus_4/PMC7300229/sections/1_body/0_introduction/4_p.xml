<p>For neurotropic herpesvirus, viral particles tagged with fluorescent protein have proven to be a powerful tool to visualize virus replication cycle and transport in long-distance of neurons (

 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Hogue et al., 2014</xref>). Since PRV is a linear, double-stranded DNA virus of about 143 kb, it is not easy to alter such a big genome. At present, several genetic manipulation methods have been used to modify the genome of PRV, including homologous recombination, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), and CRISPR/Cas9 (
