<p>In this study, a fosmid library for PRV SC was constructed. Using the fosmid library as well as Red/ET-mediated recombination, a recombinant rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP with EGFP fused into the amino-terminal of UL36 was successfully generated. It can help to visualize both anterograde and retrograde transport in neural circuits without affecting virus replication. This work will accelerate the progress of the PRV study and the development of novel vaccines.</p>
