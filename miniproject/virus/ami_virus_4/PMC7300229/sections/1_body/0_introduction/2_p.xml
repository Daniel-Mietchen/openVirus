<p>After PRV particle binding to axonal terminal, viral envelopes of PRV fuse with the plasma membrane of host cells. Then, viral particles enter into the axon where most tegument proteins are released into the cytoplasm. However, the inner tegument proteins such as UL37, UL36, UL21, UL16, UL14, US3, and ICP0 remain associated with capsids, and this capsid tegument complexes are transported toward nucleus where progeny viral genome is replicated (

 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Radtke et al., 2010</xref>). Several tegument proteins such as UL36, UL37, and UL21 play an essential role in recruiting motors for viral capsid tegument complexes for retrograde transport (

 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Luxton et al., 2006</xref>). UL36 and UL37 proteins interact with each other to form a physical complex (
 <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>); on one hand, UL36 is the critical protein that directly binds to the dynein motor subunit p150 and p50, on the other hand, UL37 renders PRV neuroinvasion and retrograde axonal transport (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Richards et al., 2017</xref>). Viral particles are unable to retrograde transport when UL36 is deleted. The deletion of UL37 does not show the same result as the UL36; UL37-deleted PRV is defective for secondary envelopment, which reduces capsid transport (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Schipke et al., 2012</xref>). UL21 is another protein associated with neuroinvasion. It can promote PRV retrograde transport through interaction with cytoplasmic dynein light chain Roadblock-1 (
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Yan et al., 2019</xref>); however, UL21 mutation causes a delay in the spread to presynaptic neurons and reduces infectious particle production (
