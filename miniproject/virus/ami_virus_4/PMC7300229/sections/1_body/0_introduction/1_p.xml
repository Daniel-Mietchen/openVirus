<p>Pseudorabies virus (PRV) is a neurotropic herpesvirus, a member of 
 <italic>Alphaherpesvirinae</italic> subfamily (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Kramer et al., 2011</xref>). PRV invades the axon-endings distributed in the epithelial tissue after infection and replication at the epithelial cells. In detail, membrane fusion initiated between PRV envelope membrane and nerve cell membrane facilitates PRV to enter into neurons. Immediately, PRV virions undergo axonal retrograde transport from the axon to soma side and replicate in the nucleus. Subsequently, progeny virions are assembled and transported through the nervous system. Meanwhile, latency can also develop at the cell body in the neuron (
