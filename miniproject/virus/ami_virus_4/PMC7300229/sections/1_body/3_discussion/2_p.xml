<p>The capsid protein VP26 was fused usually with fluorescent protein such as EGFP, Red, or mCherry as a tool for tracing PRV in neural circuits, but the amino-terminal of VP26 fused with EGFP would reduce virus replication by nearly 10-fold (

The recombinant virus with mCherry fusion to VP26 carboxy-terminal expresses more VP26 fusion protein in infected cells and incorporates more VP26 fusion protein into virus particles. Individual virus particle exhibits brighter red fluorescence compared to the amino-terminal mCherryâ€“VP26 fusion virus (
