<p>The technology for constructing recombination PRV develops quickly in recent years. CRISPR/Cas9 is applied, which leads to the gene deletion mutation easier than before, but the method cannot be used in the gene insertion mutation, especially specific site mutation and seamless insert (

 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Meanwhile, plaque purification of recombination PRVs from parental viruses always takes more than 1 month. Infectious BAC of PRV, another genetic manipulation technology, is efficient for gene insertion and deletion using Red/ET technology in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> (

 <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). However, it takes several months to construct BAC clones, but the genetic and phenotypic change occurs in the recombinant virus due to the unstable large genome of PRV in 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. Fosmid library is a powerful platform for rescuing DNA viruses and has been used in genomic manipulation of DNA viruses to generate a duck enteritis virus vaccine strain (
 <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). The first fosmid library for pseudorabies variant strain PRV TJ has been reported in 2018 by our group (
 <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, a fosmid library for pseudorabies strain PRV SC was established using the same method. In this study, we got 200 fosmid DNAs that cover the whole genome of PRV SC. Most of the DNA segments are between 30 and 49 kb, and each fragment was cloned into pCC1FOS vector hosted in the 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> strain separately. The positive percentage of most of the fragments was more than 90%. We selected 13 plasmids separated into five groups, five plasmids in one group, and all the groups can rescue the virus successfully. Further, we rescued the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strains. There is no significant difference between rPRV SC and PRV SC in growth kinetics, restriction profiles, plaque size, and morphology of virus particles, so the fosmid groups are highly efficient for recovering recombination PRV SC.
