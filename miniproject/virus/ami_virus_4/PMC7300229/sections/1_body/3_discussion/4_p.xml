<p>In summary, this fosmid library was efficient and flexible for rescuing recombination PRV SC. The fosmid library and Red/ET technology would be applied in other PRV strains and other DNA virus research. We successfully rescue the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP using this method. Moreover, we found that the EGFP fusion to the amino-terminal of UL36 did not affect viral replication and could also work as a tool for tracing PRV in neural circuits.</p>
