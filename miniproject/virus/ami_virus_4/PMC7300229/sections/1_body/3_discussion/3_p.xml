<p>UL36 is the critical protein that links PRV capsid with the dynein of the neuron. UL36 and UL37 form viral capsid–tegument complexes for retrograde transport 
 <italic>via</italic> an amino-terminal domain. The carboxy-terminal of UL36 comprises a proline/alanine-rich region that plays an essential role in PRV replication (
 <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bottcher et al., 2006</xref>). In this work, EGFP protein was fused to the amino-terminal of UL36 protein, and rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP performs the same morphology, growth kinetics, and plaque sizes with the parental virus; all these show EGFP protein fused at the amino-terminal of UL36 protein did not affect viral replication and also did not affect the pathogenicity to mouse. The green fluorescent-labeled capsid moving along the axon of neuron both anterograde and retrograde was monitored step by step, and the average velocities of retrograde and anterograde movements were 0.71 ± 0.43 and 0.75 ± 0.49 μm/s. This is close to 0.62 ± 0.18 μm/s of HSV anterograde movement in cortical neuron axons by the same statistical analysis method (

 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Hogue et al. (2018)</xref>, while the events less than 0.5 μm/s were deleted in the data of Gaussian distribution. The velocity changed at different times post-infection (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Dong et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the virus strain, the kind of neuron, and statistical analysis method may all affect the reported average speed of capsid transport in axon retrograde. So EGFP fusion to the amino-terminal of UL36 did not affect capsid–tegument complexes transport along the axon of neuron 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Our result demonstrated that the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP could be used for tracking PRV movement in the neuron.
