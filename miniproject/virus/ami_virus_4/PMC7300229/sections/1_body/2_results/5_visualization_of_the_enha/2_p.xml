<p>After membrane fusion, capsid–tegument complexes were started moving along the axon. There is more than one mode of movement after penetration of viral particles into the axon. Some viral particles in the terminal axon were moving toward the cell body (retrograde movement), here, the movement of one EGFP-tagged capsid was observed during 0–32 s (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5B</xref>), but some capsids stopped halfway to the cell center (stationary). Other viral particles just moved back at one stage (anterograde movement) and forward at the next stage. The percentages of capsids in the three states including anterograde movement, retrograde movement, and stationary state were calculated as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>. In detail, 57.3% of total capsids moved through the retrograde at 0.5 hpi, 27.4% of capsids moved through anterograde, and 15.3% remained in stationary state. So, majority of viral capsids moved toward the cell body after entering into the axon. The instantaneous velocity of retrograde movement varied from 0 to 2.22 μm/s, and the average velocity was 0.71 ± 0.43 μm/s (
