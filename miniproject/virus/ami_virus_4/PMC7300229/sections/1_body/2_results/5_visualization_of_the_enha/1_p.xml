<p>Next, we checked whether the EGFP-tagged reporter virus rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP could be used to track the trajectory of PRV particle transport in the neuron and analyzed the velocity kinetics, direction, and displacement of transport. The rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was added into two wells of the microfluidics and flowed into the chamber in the axonal side. In the first 10â€“20 min, the green particles randomly distributed in the medium; only a minority of viral particles that attached to the axon terminals were captured in the same focal length with the axons. At this time, viral particles were quiet at the vision of microscope as shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5A</xref>. A little of the particles had entered into the axon, and maybe part of viral particles just attached to the upper axon not the end.
