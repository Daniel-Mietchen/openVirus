<p>Overview of the speed distribution of anterograde and retrograde shows that the forward velocity is widely distributed between 0 and 1.5 μm/s, while the reverse velocity tends to the normal distribution curve (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 5D,E</xref>). Subsequently, the distribution of virus particles’ state in the axon shows that the viral particles mainly conduct retrograde transport at 0.5–2 hpi and mainly conduct anterograde transport at about eight hpi (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5F</xref>). Those results indicate that rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was suitable for tracing PRV behavior between cell body and axon in the neuron.
