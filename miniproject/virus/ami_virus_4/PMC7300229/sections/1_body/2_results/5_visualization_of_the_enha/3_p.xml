<p>The green fluorescence particles retrograde transport intermittently only happened at the first 0.5 to 2 h. The time duration varied based on the length and number of axons. Another continual particle movement can be observed until 8 hpi; the virus run away from the cell body (anterograde) reverse to the first 2 h observed, the movement of one particle from 0–13.2 s was shown in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5C</xref>. The capsids also perform three states at this time, including anterograde movement, retrograde movement, and stationary state. The percentages of each state were 50.9%, 30.4%, and 18.7%. So half of them moved far away from the cell body. The instantaneous velocity of anterograde movement varied from 0 to 2.35 μm/s, and the average velocity was 0.75 ± 0.49 μm/s (
