<p>To check the pathogenicity of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strain compared with the wild strain PRV SC, mice were infected with same titer of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP as PRV SC simultaneously. All the mice in the control group remained healthy during the experiments. The mice infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of both rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP and PRV SC strain showed serious itching at 2 dpi; the skin around of injected position was scratched and bitten intervally at the beginning, more and more frequently, until the mice could not move and died as 
 <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brittle et al. (2004)</xref> described. The itching symptoms of mice infected with 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> started at 3 dpi. The depression and rough hair could be observed in most of the mice infected with 10
 <sup>2</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>. When the mice suffered from itching, they would die at 10–12 h later. So the average time point of itching onset was earlier about half a day than the average mortality time point as shown in 
 <xref rid="T4" ref-type="table">Table 4</xref>. The LD
 <sub>50</sub> of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP (1.48 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>) was lower than that of wild PRV SC strain (2.09 × 10
 <sup>3</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub>), but there was no statistically significant difference. So the pathogenicity of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was the same as that of its parental virus PRV SC.
