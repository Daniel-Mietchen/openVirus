<p>The genomes of both PRV SC and rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strains were detected by real-time PCR to compare the viral replication in the injection point and nervous system. As a result, the viral genomic DNA was positive in the sciatic nerve (1.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> and 1.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4C</xref>), spinal cord (1.7 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> and 1.3 × 10
 <sup>9</sup> copies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4B</xref>), and brain (8.5 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> and 4.4 × 10
 <sup>5</sup> copies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4A</xref>) where particles of PRV were retrograde transported and replicated. Moreover, the highest viral copies were in the lumbar spine, the peripheral nerve center near the injection point. Although all the mice infected with 10
 <sup>4</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> of PRV SC and rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strain died before 4 dpi, the virus titers were lower in the brain compared to the spinal cord and sciatic nerves. There were also high copies of viral genomic DNA in the legs (7.0 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> and 7.6 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4D</xref>) and the feet (8.4 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> and 8.7 × 10
 <sup>7</sup> copies) (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4E</xref>) where PRV particles were anterograde transported to the nerve endings. The viral loads in the tissue of mice infected with rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strain were not statistically different from that of the PRV SC strain. In conclusion, the EGFP fused with UL36 gene of PRV SC strain did not affect viral replication and spread in the nervous system of mouse.
