<p>UL36, a large tegument protein, attaches to the capsid during axonal retrograde transport. Previous studies have shown that UL36 directly interacts with dynein subunit p150 and p50 to mediate PRV retrograde transport (
 <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Zaichick et al., 2013</xref>). Consequently, UL36 is a possible ideal reporter target for visualization axonal retrograde kinetics. To rescue rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP, EGFP was fused into the amino-terminal of UL36. Fosmid 50 (29470-63289) that harbors UL36 gene was modified by the Red/ET-mediated recombination (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3A</xref>). The modified fosmid 50 (fosmid 50-UL36-EGFP) and other fosmid plasmids in group five were transfected into Vero cells. After 5 daysâ€™ incubation, CPEs with green fluorescence were observed, and the supernatant was inoculated into PK-15 cells. The images of CPEs with green fluorescence were captured at 12 and 24 hpi in rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP-infected cells, and only CPEs were observed in the PRV SC-infected cells (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3C</xref>). To further identify rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP, the expression of gB, gI, and EGFP proteins were identified by Western blotting. The result showed the same bands of gB and gI presented in the samples of rPRV SC-UL36- EGFP-, rPRV SC-, and PRV SC-infected groups, and UL36-EGFP was detected only in rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP-infected group (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP and PRV SC showed similar growth kinetics in both PK-15 and Vero cells (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3E,F</xref>), and the plaque size of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was also the same as that of PRV SC (
