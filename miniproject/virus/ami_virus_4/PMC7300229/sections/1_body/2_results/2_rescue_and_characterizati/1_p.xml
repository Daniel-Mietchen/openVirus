<p>Five sets of fosmid plasmids were transfected into Vero cells to rescue rPRV SC; non-transfected Vero cells served as the negative control. CPEs of five transfection groups were observed at 5â€“7 dpi, while no CPEs in the negative control during the progress. This suggested that all the CPEs were caused by the rPRV SC, not by contaminated PRV or other viruses. Then Vero cells and PK-15 cells were infected with the first generation of rPRV SC. After culturing for 48 h, CPE and immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were performed, and the results were consistent with the first-generation virus (

 <italic>Bam</italic>HI, the result of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) showed no significant difference from parental PRV SC (

 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2E,F</xref>). So, the results demonstrated that rPRV SC could be rescued successfully using the five sets of fosmid plasmids.
