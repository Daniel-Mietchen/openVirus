<p>After end-blunting and phosphorylation, the DNA fragments were cloned into the fosmid vectors and transformed into 
 <italic>E. coli</italic>. A total of 200 clones were randomly picked from the fosmid library for end-sequencing. As a result, there are 165 clones match for PRV SC genome according to the two terminal sequences of each DNA fragment, and a majority of which contains insert of 30–49 kb. Moreover, the fosmid library can cover the complete genome of PRV SC. There are three DNA fragments including 5′ terminal sequence, two DNA fragments including 3′ terminal sequence, most DNA fragments including the middle part of genome, and some fragments including incomplete terminal genome. At last, 13 fosmids were selected for generating the fosmid combinations that cover the complete genome of PRV SC (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Five sets of overlapping fosmid combinations were prepared to rescue the recombinant PRV SC (rPRV SC); each group consisting of five overlapping fosmids (
