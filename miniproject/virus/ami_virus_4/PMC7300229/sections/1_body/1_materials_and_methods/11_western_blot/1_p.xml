<p>PK-15 cell monolayers infected with rPRV-SC were gently washed with PBS and lysed by NP40 lysis buffer containing 1% PMSF (Solarbio, Beijing, China) for 1 h at 4°C. The lysates were mixed with 5× sample loading buffer, incubated in boiling water baths for 10 min, and cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × 
 <italic>g</italic> for 5 min at 4°C. A total of 30-μl sample was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking with 5% skim milk for 2 h at 37°C, the membranes were incubated at room temperature for 2 h with specific mouse anti-gI polyclonal antibody (a gift from Jin Tian, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China), mouse anti-gB monoclonal antibody (a gift from Jing Zhao, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China), and anti-EGFP polyclonal antibody (Solarbio, Beijing, China). After washing membranes using PBST (PBS with 5% Tween 20) buffer, the membranes were incubated with DyLight 800 goat anti-mouse IgG (1:8,000; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at 37°C for 45 min, the membranes were washed three times in PBST, then visualized and analyzed with an Odyssey infrared imaging system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, United States).
