<p>Thirty-five 6-week-old specific pathogen-free (SPF) BALB/c mice were randomly divided into seven groups, five mice in each group. Groups 1–3 were each intramuscularly injected with 100 μl of different titer (10

The clinical signs were recorded every day until 7 days post infection (dpi), and the 50% lethal doses (LD
