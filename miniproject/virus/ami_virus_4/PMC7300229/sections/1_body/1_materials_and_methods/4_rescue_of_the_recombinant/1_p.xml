<p>Thirteen fosmids that cover the whole genome of PRV SC in five groups (
 <xref rid="T2" ref-type="table">Tables 2</xref>, 
 <xref rid="T3" ref-type="table">3</xref>) were transfected into Vero cells cultured in 10-cm plates. Five fosmids (2 μg each) in each group were gently mixed together with 30 μl X-treme GENE HP DNA transfection reagent in 1 ml DMEM, incubated for 30 min at room temperature, and added into Vero cells. Before transfection, Vero cells were washed twice with PBS, 10 μg genomic DNA of PRV SC was transfected using the same way as a positive control, and non-transfected cells served as a negative control. CPEs in the Vero cells were observed at 5–7 days post-transfection, and cell supernatants were collected and stored for further identification of the recombinant viruses.
