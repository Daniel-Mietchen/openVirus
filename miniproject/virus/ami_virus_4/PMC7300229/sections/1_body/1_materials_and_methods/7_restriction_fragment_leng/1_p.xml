<p>PRV SC genomic DNA was purified as described by 
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Enquist (1999)</xref>. For RFLP analysis, the genomes of the viruses were digested with 
 <italic>Bam</italic>HI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) in reaction mixtures containing 2 μg DNA, 10 × reaction buffer, 10 U restriction enzyme, and ddH
 <sub>2</sub>O in a total volume of 50 μl, and the reaction was performed at 37°C for 4 h. The digested samples were resolved in 0.8% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 1 × TAE buffer at 2 V/cm for 4 h at room temperature.
