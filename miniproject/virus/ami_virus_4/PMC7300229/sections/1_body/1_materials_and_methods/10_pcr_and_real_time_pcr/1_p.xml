<p>The genomic DNA was extracted from the cells and tissues infected with PRV as the template of PCR and real-time PCR amplification. The genomic DNA of PRV SC strain was used as the positive control and water as the negative control. The EGFP gene of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP was amplified using forward primer EGFP-F and reverse primer EGFP-R, and gI genes of PRV SC, rPRV SC, and rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP were amplified by forward primer gI-F and reverse primer gI-R (listed in 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The reaction mixture and condition were performed according to the manufacturerâ€™s instruction of LA Taq
 <sup>TM</sup> with GC Buffer (TaKaRa, Japan). Additionally, gI gene also was detected using forward primer gI-F and reverse primer gI-R and the Taq Man probe FAM-PRV-Cla (FAM-50-CGC GTG CAC CAC GAG GCC TT-30-BHQ1) in a real-time PCR as
