<p>Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) from the spine of new-born BALB/c mice less than 3 days were collected, washed, and digested by Collagenase/Dispase (Roche) at 37°C in the CO
 <sub>2</sub> incubator for 45–60 min. The neurons were separated from each other sufficiently, filtered, washed, and cultured in Neurobasal Medium (Gibco) supplemented with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor 2.5S (Invitrogen), 2% B27 (Gibco), and 1% penicillin and streptomycin with 2 mM glutamine (Invitrogen). Before the neuron was planted in one side of the microfluidic chamber, the coverslips were treated with Poly-DL-ornithine hydrobromide (Sigma) for one night and laminin (invtrogen) for at least 6 h and washed with Hanks’ balanced salt solution (HBSS) buffer two times, dried completely, then covered with microfluidic device, neurons were added in one well of microfluidic device, flowed into the chamber connected with two adjacent wells, after 3 days culturing, the axons grow to another chamber along the chamber microgrooves (see illustration). Infection was performed by replacing the Neurobasal Medium in the distal wells and changed with 10
 <sup>7</sup> TCID
 <sub>50</sub> rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP. Time-lapse imaging was achieved by automated sequential capture.
