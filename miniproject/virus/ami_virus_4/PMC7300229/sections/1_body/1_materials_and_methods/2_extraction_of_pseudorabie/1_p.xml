<p>The method of extraction of PRV full-length genomic DNA has been described previously (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Smith and Enquist, 1999</xref>). PK-15 cells in 10 75-cm
 <sup>2</sup> flask were infected with PRV SC strain at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 and cultured for 12–15 h at 37°C with 5% CO
 <sub>2</sub>. When all the cells show cytopathic effects (CPEs), the cells were collected, then washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice. The cell pellet was lysed with 10 ml of LCM buffer [130 mM KCl, 30 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 5 mM MgCl
 <sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5% Non-idet P-40 (NP-40), and 0.043% 2-mercaptoethanol] to release viral capsids. Capsids were extracted with Freon twice and separated by ultracentrifugation through glycerol step gradients (8 ml of 5% glycerol and 16 ml of 45% glycerol) at 28,000 rpm for 2.5 h at 4°C. The genomic DNA was released by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment. Then the DNA deposits were washed with 75% ethanol twice and dissolved in ultrapure water. The concentration of DNA was detected by the NanoDrop
 <sup>TM</sup> 2000 (Thermo Scientific, Carlsbad, CA, United States) and gI gene was amplified using the primers listed in the 
 <xref rid="T1" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> for sequencing. To check the infection activity, the genomic DNA was transfected into Vero cells using X-treme GENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
