<p>The fosmid 50 (containing UL36 gene) was modified using the Red/ET-mediated recombination Counter Selection BAC Modification Kit (Gene Bridges, Berkeley, CA, United States) according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. At first, the fosmid 50 and the Red/ET expression plasmid (pRed/ET) were co-transformed into competent 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B cells by electroporation, naming with 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-fos50-Red/ET. Then the selection antibiotic cassette (rpsL-neo) flanked by 50 bp homology arms was transformed into competent 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-fos50-Red/ET to get 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-fos50-UL36-rpsL-Red/ET in which the rpsL-neo gene was fused to the amino-terminal of the UL36 gene. Finally, the EGFP flanked by 50-bp homology arms was transformed into competent 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-fos50-UL36-rpsL-Red/ET to get 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-fos50-UL36-EGFP in which the rpsL-neo gene fused to the amino-terminal of UL36 gene was replaced by EGFP. The modified UL36 ORFs were amplified and sequenced. The modified fosmid 50-UL36-EGFP was extracted from 
 <italic>E. coli</italic> DH10B-fos50-UL36-EGFP and transfected into Vero cells with other fosmids to rescue the virus rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP. All the primers used in this experiment were listed in
