<p>One-step growth curve was performed to compare the growth kinetics of the rPRV SC and parental virus PRV SC. PK-15 cells (or Vero cells) cultured in 24-well plate were infected with each virus at an MOI of five, then the supernatants and cells from three wells were harvested at 4, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 h post infection (hpi) and stored at −80°C. The viral titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID
 <sub>50</sub>). To compare the plaque size of the rPRV SC and parental virus PRV SC, PK-15 cells (or Vero cells) were infected with each virus diluted serially in 10-fold and incubated for 1 h, then the medium was removed, and the cells were overlaid with 1% low-melting-point agarose diluted in DMEM. For each virus, 30 plaques were randomly selected, and their size was determined by ImageJ software.
