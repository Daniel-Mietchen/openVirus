<p>After infection, the cells were fixed with ethanol at −20°C for 30 min, then washed with PBS three times. The fixed cells were incubated with swine anti-PRV sera (1:200 dilution) for 2 h at 37°C and then incubated with Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-pig IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific) (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 h at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were washed three times. The images were captured using an Olympus CK40 microscope.</p>
