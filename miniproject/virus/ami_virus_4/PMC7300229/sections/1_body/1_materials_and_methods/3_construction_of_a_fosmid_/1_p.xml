<p>Twenty micrograms of highly infective genomic DNA of PRV SC was pipetted using 200 μl tip to shear the DNA. The sheared genomic DNA was end-repaired using the End-Repairing Enzyme Mix to generate 5′ phosphorylated DNA. The DNA fragment was analyzed on a 1% gold agarose gel by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), a Lambda DNA Mono Cut Mix (New England BioLabs, Beijing, United Kingdom) as a size marker. DNA fragments ranging from 33 to 49 kb were excised from the gel, recovered using GELase (Epicentre, Madison, United States) and ligated into the pCC1FOS cloning-ready vector at room temperature for 4 h. The ligation mixture was packaged using MaxPlax Lambda Packaging Extracts and transformed into EPI300-T1
 <sup>R</sup> cells. Except genomic DNA, all the materials and protocol as mentioned above were supplied by the Copy Control
 <sup>TM</sup> Fosmid Library Production Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, United States). Two hundred clones were picked randomly and cultured overnight in 5 ml of LB liquid medium containing 12.5 μg/ml chloramphenicol and 50 μl of auto-induction solution (Epicentre). The fosmids were extracted using ZR BAC DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, United States), and the terminal of DNA fragment in the fosmids was sequenced based on pCC1FOS sequencing primers. The whole genomic DNA of PRV SC was assembled according to the terminal sequence of DNA fragment.
