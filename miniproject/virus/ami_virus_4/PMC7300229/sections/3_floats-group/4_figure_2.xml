  <p>Identification of recombinant pseudorabies virus ShuangCheng (rPRV SC). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> The first row represents the cytopathic effects (CPEs) of Vero cells, which is infected with the first generation of rPRV SC, and no infection as negative control (NC). The second row represents the CPEs of PK-15 cells infected with the first generation of rPRV SC from different groups in the second line. The third row represents the immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of PK-15 cells infected with rPRV SC using an anti-PRV serum. The images were captured using EVOS Cell Imaging Systems under 10 Ã— magnification. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> Transmission electron of PRV SC and rPRV SC. The virus particles were 25,000 times magnified. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of the rescued and the parent PRV in 0.8% agarose. The genome of the rescued and the parent PRV was digested with 
   <italic>Bam</italic>HI. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> PCR amplification of the gI gene from the genome of PRV SC and rPRV SC. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Plaque of PRV SC and rPRV SC in the PK-15 cells. The diameter of plaques was averaged from three independent experiments. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> One-step growth curve of PRV SC and rPRV SC in the PK-15 cells.
