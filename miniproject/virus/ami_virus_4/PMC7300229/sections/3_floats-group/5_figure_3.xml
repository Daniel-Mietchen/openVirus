  <p>Rescue and identification of recombinant pseudorabies virus ShuangCheng (rPRV SC)-UL36-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> Schematic for rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP design. Finally, Fosmid 22(1-31943), 38(59987-92335), 24(80390-114445), 65(111583-142825), and Fosmid 50-EGFP were transfected into Vero cells to rescue rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The green fluorescence and cytopathic effects (CPEs) in the PK-15 cells infected with rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP or PRV SC at 12, 24 h post infection (hpi). 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The viral gene gI and EGFP from rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP and PRV SC were identified by PCR. Plasmid pflag-gI and pok-UL36-EGFP act as a positive control. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> The expression of gB, gI, and EGFP in the rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP- and PRV SC-infected cells were identified by Western blot at 12 hpi. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> One-step growth curves of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP and PRV SC in Vero cells. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> One-step growth curves of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP and PRV SC in PK-15 cells. 
   <bold>(G)</bold> Plaque size of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP and PRV SC. The diameter of 30 pots was measured.
