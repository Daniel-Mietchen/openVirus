  <p>Enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged capsid moving in the neuron. Dorsal root ganglia (DRG) were plated in the main channel of Microfluidics. After 3 days, neurons were infected with recombinant pseudorabies virus ShuangCheng (rPRV SC)-UL36-EGFP at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10 at the axon side. Visualization of rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP action by Time-lapse was performed at 0.5 h post infection (hpi). 
   <bold>(A)</bold> A large number of viruses attaching to the axon endings were captured. 
   <bold>(B)</bold> The retrograde of single rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP particle along the axon was tracked from 0 to 32 s. 
   <bold>(C)</bold> The anterograde of single rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP particle along the axon was tracked from 0 to 13.2 s. 
   <bold>(D)</bold> Instantaneous velocity distributions of retrogradely moving capsids. 
   <bold>(E)</bold> Instantaneous velocity distributions of anterogradely moving capsids. 
   <bold>(F)</bold> Proportions of capsids in the three states including anterograde movement, retrograde movement, and stationary state.
