  <p>Viral loads in the tissue of mice infected with pseudorabies virus ShuangCheng (PRV SC) and recombinant PRV SC (rPRV SC)-UL36-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) strains. The indicated tissues of mice that were mock infected or infected with 10
   <sup>4</sup> TCID
   <sub>50</sub> PRV SC or rPRV SC-UL36-EGFP strains, the gI gene was detected by real-time PCR to quantify genomic DNA of both two PRV strains. The data represent average copies + SE (error bars) for five samples per group. Samples of 100 mg brain 
   <bold>(A)</bold>, 100 mg lumbar spine 
   <bold>(B)</bold>, and the sciatic nerves 
   <bold>(C)</bold>, 100 mg leg muscles 
   <bold>(D)</bold>, and feet 
   <bold>(E)</bold> on the inoculated side were harvested from each mouse after they died of infections.
