    "Although Japanese encephalitis virus genotype Ib (JEV GIb) has replaced JEV GIII as the dominant genotype in endemic areas of Asia, no JEV GIb has been isolated from JE cases and natural mosquitoes at the same time in an outbreak of JE. In this study, we conducted virological and molecular biological laboratory tests on JE case samples (serum/cerebrospinal fluid) and locally collected mosquito samples from the 2018 JE outbreak in Ningxia, China. The result of JEV IgM antibody detection showed that 96% (67/70) of the suspected cases were laboratory-confirmed JE cases. Of the mosquitoes collected from local environments, 70% (17400/24900) were Culex tritaeniorhynchus of which 4.6% (16 /348 of the pools tested) were positive for JEV, other mosquitoes were negative. JEVs isolated from both the human cases and C. tritaeniorhynchus specimens belong to JEV GIb and are in the same evolutionary clade according to molecular evolution analyses. JEV GIb was detected simultaneously from specimens of JE cases and mosquito samples collected in nature in this study, suggesting that the JE outbreak that occurred in Ningxia in 2018 was due to infection of JEV GIb."
