<p>qRT-PCR was carried out to determine positive amplification of JEV or WNV in serum and CSF samples in the acute phase. One CSF sample (NX1889) was positive for JEV gene amplification (CT value 30.6) (
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). This positive result indicates the presence of JEV, so all the CSF specimen was inoculated into Vero cells for virus isolation. CPE can be serially passaged. Virus gene amplification and nucleotide sequence determination analyses confirmed that the virus isolate was JEV GIb, and was named virus isolate NX1889 (
