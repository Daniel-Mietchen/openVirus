<p>This study reported an outbreak of JE caused by JEV GIb in northeast Asia using evidence from both laboratory and field data, which showed that JEV GIb can separately cause an outbreak. (the number of JEV obtained from patient samples in this study was limited, and continuous surveillance is also needed). The molecular epidemiology of JEV GIb and epidemiology characteristic of this outbreak can be a reference for JE control and prevention of northern Asia. The outbreak shows that attention should be paid to the circulation of JEV GIb and its potential of causing an outbreak. In addition, JEV is mainly transmitted by mosquitoes (

Therefore, it is recommended that molecular biological test of JEV genotype and sub-genotype be performed along with routine detection of JEV IgM antibody and viral genes in patients infected by JEV, to clarify the threat of JEV GIb to public health.
