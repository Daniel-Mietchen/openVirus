<p>Since West Nile virus (WNV) and JEV are both mosquito-borne virus that can cause viral encephalitis (West Nile viral encephalitis is more likely to occur in adults) [
 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and there is significant antigenic cross-reaction between the two viruses. Therefore, in this study, IgM antibodies, neutralizing antibodies to JEV and WNV, and viral genes (qRT-PCR) of the two viruses in serum samples and cerebrospinal fluid samples collected from cases in Ningxia were tested in parallel. Two JEV IgM antibody detection kits were used to test serum and CSF samples: The Beixi Capture ELISA 24 Test ELISA kit (REVI-001M, Lot: 1807–1; Shanghai B&amp;C Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) and the JE Detect IgM Antibody Capture ELISA Kit (Mac-ELISA, 96 Test Kit, JEMS-1, Lot: XC1285; InBios International, Inc, Seattle, WA, USA). The West Nile Virus (WNV) IgM antibody was detected by the Capture Dx Select Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay ELISA Kit (96 Test, EL0300M, Lot: 1990N; Focus, Seattle, WA, USA), which does not support CSF specimen testing. The experimental procedures and interpretation of results were carried out in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions [
