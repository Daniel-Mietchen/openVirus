<p>The E gene was amplified by semi-nested PCR. cDNAs of CSF and mosquito grinding supernatant were added to a 25-μL reaction volume as the instructions of the GoTaq Green Master Mix Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The primers used for the first round of PCR were JEV-E-1F (TTCATAGAAGGAGCCAGTGGA) and JEV-E-1R (TCGTTTAAACTCGCGACTGA), and the primers used for the second round were JEV-E-1F and JEV-E-2R (TTTCCCGAAAAGTCCACATC) [

The primers used for the first round of PCR were JE-C+PrM-1F (CGTTCTTCAAGTTTACAGCATTAGC) and JE-C+PrM-1R (CCYRTGTTYCTGCCAAGCATCCAMCC), and the primers used for the second round were JE-C+PrM-1F and JE-C+PrM-2R (CGYTTGGAATGYCTRGTCCG). The product of the first round of PCR was used as the template of the second round. After the second PCR reaction, 5 μL amplification product was detected by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Nucleotide sequence determination was done by Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China, Beijing Sequencing Department) [
