<p>JEV is a positive RNA virus, and the length of the entire genome is ~ 11 kb. One polyprotein is encoded by the single open reading frame (ORF) of the genome, which can be divided into three structural proteins (capsid [C], membrane [M], and envelope[E]) and seven nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) [

 <xref rid="pntd.0008312.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Studies have indicated that JEV GI can be further divided into two sub-genotypes, JEV GIa and JEV GIb. The former only circulates in Cambodia (KF192509), Thailand (KF192510.), and Australia (EF434785), while the latter is mainly distributed in areas north of 23°N in Eurasia [
