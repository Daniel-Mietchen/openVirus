<p id="Par4">In the last years, many fluorescence-based techniques have been developed to study molecular dynamics. Among others, fluorescence correlation methods are a family of microscopic approaches that provide information about the dynamics of fluorescently labeled molecules from the intensity fluctuations encoded in the emitted signal. Fluorescence intensity fluctuations in a single point (pFCS) inside a cell can arise from several different biological processes such as the diffusion of molecules through the observation volume, molecular conformational changes, binding-unbinding processes, or molecular transport, among others

 </sup>. The fluorescence fluctuation autocorrelation function (ACF) calculated over the experiment time, is then fitted by analytical models of diffusion according to different biological processes

 </sup>. As the observation volume is stationary in one position, pFCS provides dynamic information at a single location in the sample, of the size of the observation volume. In order to extent the study to the whole cell, the observation volume can be scanned relative to the sample and the ACF calculated from the intensity fluctuations at the pixels over an entire image

 </sup>. Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) appears as a very convenient method to capture the subtle intensity fluctuations due to molecular dynamics and transport in an entire region or compartment of live cells. In this work, we used RICS to extract information about the average mobility of DENV C protein in cytoplasm and nucleus during the infection cycle.
