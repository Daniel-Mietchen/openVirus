<p id="Par9">Real-time imaging during this time-lapse allowed analyzing the spatio-temporal localization of C-mCherry (Movie 
 <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The C protein was readily detected in the cell at 1,5 h after the onset of viral RNA translation. Interestingly, a rapid accumulation of C protein in the nucleolus was observed as early as 2 h after transfection. A distribution and accumulation of C-mCherry in the cytoplasm and nucleolus was observed as a function of time. A global picture of the protein intracellular spreading can be achieved if the integrated fluorescence intensity is calculated in time at different ROIs within the cell. The normalized average fluorescence time-dependence obtained at different locations in the cell (cytoplasm and nucleus) was measured (Fig.
