<p id="Par22">As a control experiment, the same procedure was performed in cells expressing fluorescent mCherry protein alone. In this case, the protein is not expected to accumulate in a specific location, which is evident from the intensity image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4d</xref>). The distribution of the intensity along the image shows the heterogeneity of the nuclear environment. However, the connectivity map obtained for this sample (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4e</xref>) shows a highly isotropic motion despite the heterogeneity in the chromatin distribution and the presence of nucleoli. This result also indicates that the changes in the intensity from one pixel to the one next to it is not generating artifacts in the connectivity map. Similar results were observed for all analyzed cells expressing mCherry. By comparison of Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b,e</xref>, it is evident that in DENV replicating cells expressing C-mCherry, there are regions of “ordered diffusion”, meaning that the anisotropy direction changes softly from pixel to pixel, while there are some regions where the distribution appears to be random (no visible organization in the molecular flow). From the merged images (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c,f</xref>), we conclude that the ordered mobility occurs in specific regions of the cell and only when expressing C-mCherry, indicating specific behavior of the viral C protein in the cytoplasm-nucleus and nucleoplasm-nucleolus interfaces.
