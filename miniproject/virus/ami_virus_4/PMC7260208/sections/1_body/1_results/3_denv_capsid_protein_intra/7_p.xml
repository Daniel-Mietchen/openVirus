<p id="Par24">The analysis presented in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> indicates that, while mCherry in the nucleus diffuses isotropically, C-mCherry presents a dramatically different dynamic behavior. In order to quantitatively distinguish between these different outcomes, we studied the anisotropy distribution in the images. With this purpose, the anisotropy direction was indicated in a color-coded scale according to the angle of orientation (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6a</xref>). Each color represents the preferential direction of diffusion obtained from the anisotropy at each pixel, from red (horizontal or 0°) to blue (vertical or 90°). Then, the histogram for the color distribution, or anisotropy direction, was built (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref>). The quasi-uniform distribution shown in Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b</xref> reveals it is not possible to determine the prevalence of certain orientation. The required analysis for quantification of this effect, then, needs to contain spatial information. To this end, we created two additional images to compare with the real data. The first image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6c</xref>) was constructed by randomly re-distributing the colors of the original anisotropy image, and the second one (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6e</xref>) is a synthetic image obtained by randomly assigning to each pixel a color, assuming a uniform distribution. Histograms of color distribution are shown. As it was expected, Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6b,d</xref> show exactly the same distribution as they contain identical data. However, there are not significant differences with the histogram obtained when creating a random color distribution in the same range (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6f</xref>). As a biological-control experiment, the anisotropy map obtained from a cell expressing free mCherry, which was expected to undergo isotropic diffusion, was used (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">6g,h</xref>).
