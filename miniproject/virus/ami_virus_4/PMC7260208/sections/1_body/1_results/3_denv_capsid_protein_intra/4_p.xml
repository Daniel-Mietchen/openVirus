<p id="Par21">To analyze the molecular flow of the C-mCherry, a line where the anisotropy direction is maximized was drawn in every pixel of the image (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4b</xref>). The map of the anisotropy direction describes the most probable paths the molecules follow at each pixel, indicating the molecular flow. This representation, also named the connectivity map, because it is sensitive to barriers and obstacles for diffusion, allows the visualization of a map representing the protein intracellular flow. The connectivity map was plotted over the average intensity of a series of frames (Fig. 
 <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4c</xref>). This merge lets us identify the diffusion direction in every region of the nucleus, making it evident that in the cytoplasm-nucleus and nucleoplasm-nucleolus interfaces, the molecule’s motion has a unique behavior.
