<p id="Par12">Isotropic diffusion is the simplest model usually applied to proteins moving in the cellular environment. To compare the motion of C protein in different subcellular compartments, the ACF calculated from data obtained from cytoplasm and nucleus was fitted to a simple free diffusive mechanism. FigureÂ 
 <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> shows an example of a fitting function of the ACF (top) and the corresponding residual plot (bottom).
