<p id="Par13">RICS experiments were repeated at different times during viral replication (3–6 hours). Prior to 2 hours, the fluorescence intensity was not high enough to obtain a good signal to noise ratio image. Since the determination of the parameters is based on curve fitting of the correlation function, the quality of the results strongly depends on how accurate the model describes the data. The goodness of the fitting curve is judged by the chi-square. In those cases when more than one set of parameters finds a minimum of the chi-square, measurements were excluded from further analysis.</p>
