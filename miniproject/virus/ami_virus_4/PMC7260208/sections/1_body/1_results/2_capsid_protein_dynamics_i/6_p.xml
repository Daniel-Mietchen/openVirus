<p id="Par15">The different diffusion coefficient for C-mCherry observed in the cytoplasm as a function of time is likely due to different capsid-protein interactions during viral replication, since the control mCherry diffusion coefficient did not change as a function of time. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out that cellular stress, such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, apoptosis, or other processes, alter viral protein behavior in the infected cell.</p>
