<p id="Par16">As control, RICS analysis in non-transfected cells showed minimal autofluorescence signal and no correlations were detected. Also, RICS experiments performed with mCherry expressing cells, revealed autocorrelation functions providing an effective diffusion coefficient between 1 and 20
