 </sup> analysis of temporal fluorescence intensity fluctuations, which enabled us to obtain both high-time-resolution information on protein dynamics and spatial information of different mobility within the cell with subcellular (few 
 <italic>Î¼</italic>m) spatial-resolution. In short, the RICS approach compares the intensity fluctuations of different pixels in an image of the region we want to study. Because the image is obtained by raster laser scanning, the time delay between one pixel and its neighbor in the horizontal and vertical directions are known (pixel dwell time and line time, respectively). If molecules that were in the first pixel move to the neighbor pixel in that amount of time, then there will be a positive correlation in the fluorescence fluctuations of these two pixels. This correlation will strongly depend on the mechanism driving the fluctuations of the measured signal. By comparing the fluctuations of different pixels in the image (this is, comparing points with different time delays), we can infer about the mechanism underlying the mobility of the molecules (see Methods section for further detail).
