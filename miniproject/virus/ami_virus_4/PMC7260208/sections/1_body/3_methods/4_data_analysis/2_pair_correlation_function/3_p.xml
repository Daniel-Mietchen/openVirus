<p id="Par46">The 2D-pCF approach detects obstacles to diffusion by computing the delay time on the pair correlation-function-maximum amplitude (this is the case if there are interactions between the molecules and intracellular compartments) or, by the absence of a correlation between the two points (this will occur in the case of impenetrable barriers to diffusion). The pixel distance
