<p id="Par34">The C protein was found accessing the nucleolus as early as 2â€‰hours of the onset of viral translation, indicating that C molecules, translated from the incoming RNA, distribute between the cytoplasm and the nucleus, accumulating in nucleolus. The ordered motion of C protein observed at the cytoplasm-nucleus interface reflects the presence of the nuclear membrane as a physical barrier. When the protein enters the nucleus, it quickly associates to nucleolus. The molecular flow at the interface nucleoplasm-nucleolus indicates that the C protein also encounters an obstacle for diffusion, which forced the molecule to move around this structure. Despite this, the viral protein entered inside nucleoli and accumulated at high concentrations. Nucleoli are membraneless structures but organized by liquid-liquid phase separation. Although they are dynamic organelles, they have a densely packed structure. In this regard, the mobility of the C protein abruptly changes when it is found inside nucleolus. It is possible that C protein mobility is restricted by interactions with specific nucleolar components such as nucleic acids or proteins. Because the function of DENV C in nucleolus and other subcellular compartments is still unclear, and the dynamics of other viral proteins have not been examined, we propose to further explore the techniques presented here to understand biophysical and biological properties of viral proteins.</p>
