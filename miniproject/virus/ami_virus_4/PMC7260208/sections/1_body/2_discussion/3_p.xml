<p id="Par33">Second, to get further detail of the molecular mobility inside each region without the spatial average, we applied the 2D pair Correlation Function method. Although the pair Correlation Function is becoming a widely used method in the family of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy techniques, the two-dimensional approach has been introduced recently. From the correlation in every direction the diffusion anisotropy at every point of the image is obtained, meaning that the spatial resolution of this method is at the pixel level. From the 128 Ã— 128 calculated anisotropy values, we created connectivity maps excluding those values below a certain threshold that were associated to isotropic diffusion. The connectivity maps allowed us to visualize the average path followed by C protein, showing a particular behavior in the proximity to the nuclear membrane and nucleoli, which was not seen with the non-interacting fluorescent protein.</p>
