<p>It is, thus, possible to simplify a vast number of ecological factors by limiting the sampling to a selected plant family, and still include most of virus life strategies and plant-virus interactions [
 <xref rid="B78-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">78</xref>]. The potential of including most virus strategies is very hopeful, as viruses and viroids from more than 40 genera are naturally infecting solanaceous plants (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00667-t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). The 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plant family, with its major interest for agriculture, virology and epidemiology studies, is a good candidate for such host family-centered studies. Including cultivated and wild plant viruses and the interactions between and within these groups of plants will undoubtedly provide more valuable information for the prevention of future epidemics, as the virus emergence process involves multiple species in communities on a landscape level [
 <xref rid="B80-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">80</xref>]. It is suspected that plant viruses may be experiencing higher or more complex selection pressures in wild plant populations because of the increased within-species genetic heterogeneity compared to the limited genetic heterogeneity seen in crop plant populations [
 <xref rid="B43-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. At the same time, given the frequent occurrence of both cultivated and wild plants from this family in most parts of the world, research conducted on solanaceous plants could cover a wide spectrum of virus life cycles and their interactions.
