<p>In order to perform a viral ecology study focusing only on members of the 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> family, several factors need to be considered. In order to cover the agro-ecological interface in its entirety, it is indispensable to include both wild and cultivated plant species. This ensures that all virus infection pathways can be at least partially included, thus providing data that may help to evaluate their epidemiological impact. It is also necessary to consider the consequences of long-term agricultural practices on plant virus populations, including a weed species, which is taxonomically closely connected to crop species can be of great importance, as it may shed light on the underlying processes during virus transmission, which was proven to be often connected with phylogenetic distance [

 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> [
