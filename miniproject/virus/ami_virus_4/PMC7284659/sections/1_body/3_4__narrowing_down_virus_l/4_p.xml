<p>Interesting experiments involving two tospoviruses, namely tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and iris yellow spot virus (IYSV), infecting jimson weed plants was conducted by Bag et al. [
 <xref rid="B85-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">85</xref>]. This provided the first report of synergism between ambisense viruses in wild 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants. While jimson weed is infected by TSWV in a systemic manner, it restricts the systemic movement of IYSV, which is limited to the inoculated leaves and fails to move to younger ones. In mixed infection, symptom severity increased as compared to single TSWV infection, and IYSV could be detected in uninoculated leaves. These results suggest that virus synergism within wild 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants can lead, in some cases, to resistance-breaking or host range expansion as observed before on cultivated 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> [
 <xref rid="B86-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">86</xref>]. Examples of wild 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> plants roles in virus life cycles can be observed in the case of begomoviruses causing TYLCD, which is known to act as bundles of genomes undergoing mutation and recombination, called quasispecies. When SÃ¡nchez-Campos et al. [
 <xref rid="B87-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">87</xref>] compared four plant hosts infected by three viruses causing TYLCD, the black nightshade wild reservoir plant had higher quasispecies heterogeneity than tomato, showing its potential to contribute to viral evolution by providing a larger supply of variants for the natural selection processes.
