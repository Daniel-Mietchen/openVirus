<p>Crops are usually grown within a complex agro-ecosystem. The term agro-ecological interface is used to describe the border between cultivated and wild plant communities [
 <xref rid="B38-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. As viruses can infect both crop and wild plant species and can be dispersed by various vectors colonizing both types of species, it is possible to observe the movement of viruses between these two environments. A number of factors differ between these environments and are expected to impact viral populations and the development of epidemics (
 <xref rid="plants-09-00667-t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>), emphasizing the need for research considering the agro-ecological interface as a whole. The importance of interactions at the agro-ecological interface is underlined by the fact that wild plants can serve as reservoirs of crop-infecting viruses [
 <xref rid="B39-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] and, conversely, that wild species growing close to crops can be infected by crop viruses in a spillover process [
 <xref rid="B35-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. By taking into account the agro-ecological interface, it is, therefore, possible to keep track of interactions between and within groups of plants. It is also apparent from previous studies that wild plants can pose as refugium for viruses during intercropping periods; most solanaceous crops are annuals that are not grown all year long (at least in unprotected cultivation in temperate regions) and wild perennial plants may thus serve as virus reservoirs during the inter-crop season. It was shown, for example, that a wild perennial, black nightshade (
