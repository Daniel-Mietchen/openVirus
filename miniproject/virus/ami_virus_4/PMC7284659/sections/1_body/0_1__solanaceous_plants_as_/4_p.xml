<p>Viral phytopathogens present a great risk for plant production in agriculture as some of them can induce severe diseases [

 <xref rid="B26-plants-09-00667" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] viruses cause about half of emergent infectious diseases in plants. The majority of these emergence events are caused by the introduction of a pathogen (71%), followed by changes in vector populations as a second cause (17%). Recombination events of mutant strains accounted for 5% of emergence events in this study. In 
 <italic>Solanaceae</italic> species, previously documented emerging viruses, such as ToTV, tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV), tomato infectious chlorosis virus (TICV), PepMV or tomato brown rugose fruit virus (ToBRFV), all of which have been reported to infect tomato plants in Europe, have caused significant yield and economical losses [
