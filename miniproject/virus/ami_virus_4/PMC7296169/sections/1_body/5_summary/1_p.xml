<p>The highlighted work and those of others have shown an emerging role for IL-22 in promoting epithelial integrity and repair following infectious pathogen challenge in the lung. Precise mechanisms of IL-22 action have been more elusive, as IL-22 often has limited biologic effects on uninjured cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>. While data exist regarding the effects of IL-22 on epithelial cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic>, there remains much to be discovered. It will be important to assess the effects of IL-22 on epithelial cells in inflammatory settings, perhaps in combination with pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) or toxins. Evidence for direct impact of IL-22 on immune cells is less abundant and controversial. More work in this area is needed to determine if IL-22 affects lymphocyte function in the absence of signaling through lung stromal cells. Mechanisms by which IL-22 mediates pathogen clearance, in the case of bacterial infection, are mostly unknown. Several studies have shown that lung bacterial burden is altered when IL-22 is manipulated, indicating that IL-22's role is not solely focused on preventing dissemination from the lung. It is likely that IL-22, signaling through the epithelium, impacts host defense in several undiscovered ways. IL-22 has many described functions outside of the lung in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and thymus. It is possible that IL-22 regulation of immunity in the lung is not restricted to direct effects in lung tissue. Focused use of floxed IL-22Ra1 mice should enable high resolution study of tissue and cellular compartments where IL-22 signaling is required during infection. Regardless, pre-clinical animal models suggest that IL-22 has significant therapeutic potential in the context of infectious diseases. Additional study is required to confirm the current reports in the literature and expand the field beyond the few pathogens mentioned herein. Undoubtedly, studies of IL-22 in SARS-CoV2 infection would be of great interest. Beyond pre-clinical animal models, translational studies are now needed to determine if IL-22 can limit lung damage and promote repair in humans. Less is known with regard to human IL-22 production and signaling in human infectious diseases. This area will be critical to evaluate in human pneumonia.
