<p>Finally, deletion of IL-22BP negative regulation of IL-22 was shown to decrease lung inflammation and injury compared with WT mice after influenza infection (

 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Treatment of human bronchial epithelial cells with IL-22 resulted in increased expression of tight junction proteins and claudins, suggesting a direct role for IL-22 in mediating epithelial barrier integrity. Delivery of IL-22 to mice decreased influenza mediated inflammation and lung leak. IL-22 was also shown to inhibit viral induced expression of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on epithelial cells (
 <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). PD-L1 expression is a mechanism by which viruses evade T cell activation and clearance. In this manner, IL-22 may also promote antiviral immunity distinct from its barrier protective role. These data suggest that the IL-22/IL-22BP axis may be of critical importance in prevention of infectious lung injury.
