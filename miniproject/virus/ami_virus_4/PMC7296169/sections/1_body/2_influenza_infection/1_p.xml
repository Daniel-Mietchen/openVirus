<p>Influenza virus is the cause of world-wide, annual epidemics and can result in severe lung pathogenesis in people of all ages. Initial study into the role of IL-22 during influenza infection produced limited results. Antibody neutralization of IL-22 was not effective at reducing influenza mediated morbidity or mortality in mice, although a reductive effect on viral load was shown (
