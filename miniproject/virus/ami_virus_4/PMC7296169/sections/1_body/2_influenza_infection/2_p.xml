<p>These studies were then followed by a trio of studies of influenza infection in IL-22–/– mice. Conventional natural killer cells were shown to be a primary source of IL-22 following influenza challenge in mice (

 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). In that study, IL-22–/– mice had increased lung injury, decreased lung function, and increased pulmonary fibrosis compared with WT mice 3 weeks following influenza infection. A third study provided additional supportive data showing increased lung injury and decreased epithelial integrity after influenza challenge (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). However, the primary cellular source of IL-22 was γδT and innate lymphoid cells in that study. All three studies failed to observe an impact on viral burden, but were able to show an important role for IL-22 in preservation of the epithelial barrier in viral pneumonia.
