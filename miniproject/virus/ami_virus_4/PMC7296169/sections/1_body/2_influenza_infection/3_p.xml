<p>Regulation of IL-22 signaling during influenza infection has also been studied. Two studies showed that IL-22Ra1 is highly expressed on airway epithelial cells prior to influenza infection (
 <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). Following infection, expression of IL-22Ra1 is highly increased in injured areas of the distal lung. Tlr3 activation by viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern molecules in epithelial cells results in increased expression of IL-22Ra1 via IFNβ dependent STAT1 signaling (
 <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). Additional pathways have been shown to regulate IL-22Ra1 protein stability. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) was shown to phosphorylate IL-22Ra1 and increase its protein stability (
 <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Further, IL-22 was shown to inactivate GSK3β, perhaps as a feedback mechanism to terminate IL-22Ra1 signaling. IL-22Ra1 was also shown to be regulated via ubiquitination by the E3 ligase FBXW12 (
 <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). This interaction destabilizes IL-22Ra1. During infections, neutrophil serine proteases also can degrade IL-22Ra1 providing another mechanism of control of IL-22 signaling (
 <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). Regulation of IL-22Ra1 is complex and it is likely that we only have a limited understanding at this time.
