<p>A potential relationship between IL-22 and interferon lambda (IFNλ) has recently emerged. IFNλ is an antiviral cytokine family that has been shown to be protective during viral infections without pro-inflammatory effects, an important consideration in the lung. In the 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> model, IFNλR–/– mice exhibited better bacterial control and improved epithelial barrier function (
 <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). These IFNλR–/–mice had acute elevations in IL-22 production suggesting that IFNλ negatively regulates IL-22 in the lung. This regulation may be bi-directional as IL-22–/– mice had decreased IFNλ expression in the later phases of infection. Using IL-22–/– mice, IL-22 was shown to be critical for epithelial barrier stability in the 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> model, confirming aforementioned work using IL-22 neutralization. Consistent with the findings regarding IL-22 and IFNλ cross-talk, IL-22 treatment increased IFNλ production and anti-IL-22 decreased IFNλ levels in a model of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection and in an 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> alveolar epithelial cell line (
 <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). This interaction between IL-22 and IFNλ has also been suggested in models of bacterial pneumonia exacerbated by preceding influenza virus infection. IFNλR–/– mice were shown to produce increased levels of IL-22 following influenza, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> super-infection (
 <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). However, others did not observe an increase in IL-22 following exogenous IFNλ delivery in a similar super-infection model (
 <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). These data suggest a potentially complex role for IL-22 in modulating antiviral immunity in the lung.
