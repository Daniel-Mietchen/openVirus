<p>Using the 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> model of lung infection, antibody blockade of IL-22 was shown to increase infection, lung damage, and neutrophil accumulation (
 <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Consistent with this finding, exogenous IL-22 or neutralization of IL-22BP reduced neutrophil recruitment to the lung and pathology. More recently, IL-22–/– mice were tested in a model of 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection (
 <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). IL-22–/– mice had worsened lung injury when compared with wild-type (WT) control mice. These authors also showed that the inflammatory environment in the lung during 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> infection results in proteolytic degradation of IL-22 via the neutrophil serine protease 3. Further, the 
 <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> protease IV has also been shown to degrade IL-22 as a potential virulence factor (
 <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). These data suggest a critical role for IL-22 in Gram (−) host defense and identify targeting of IL-22 by pathogens as an immune evasion mechanism.
