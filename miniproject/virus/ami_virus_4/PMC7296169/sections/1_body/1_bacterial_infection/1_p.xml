<p>Bacterial infections of the lung with Gram (âˆ’) and (+) bacteria are common causes of both community and hospital acquired pneumonia. The first description of a host defense role for IL-22 in the lung was demonstrated using the 
 <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic> model of pneumonia (
 <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In that model, neutralization of IL-22 led to failed control of bacterial infection compared with control mice. Anti-IL-22 treatment resulted in increased bacterial burden in the lung and dissemination to the spleen. Induction of IL-22 in response to 
 <italic>K. pneumoniae</italic> was dependent on IL-23 production. IL-23 is a canonical Type 17 immunity promoting cytokine. IL-22 promoted proliferation of human bronchial epithelial cells 
 <italic>in vitro</italic> and improved transepithelial electrical resistance, a measure of barrier function, following scratch wounding. These data demonstrated an epithelial barrier protective effect of IL-22. Shortly thereafter, therapeutic delivery of IL-22 to rat lungs was shown to improve epithelial barrier function in a model of ventilator induced lung injury (
 <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). IL-22 treatment reduced lung edema and increased survival in this model providing further evidence for IL-22 acting and an epithelial protective cytokine.
