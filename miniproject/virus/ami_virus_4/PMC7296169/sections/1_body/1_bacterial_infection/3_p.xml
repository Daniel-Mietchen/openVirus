<p>The role of the IL-22/IL-22BP axis in Gram (+) host defense has also been shown. Deletion or antibody neutralization of IL-22 resulted in increased lung bacterial burden and dissemination compared with controls during 
 <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> infection (
 <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). These data are consistent with a barrier protective role for IL-22 in the lung. The role of IL-22 has also been studied in the context of 
 <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection (
 <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). IL-22–/– mice were shown to have increased bacterial burden in the lung compared to WT mice. Exogenous IL-22 was able to decrease 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> burden in the lung in WT mice. In a second study, IL-22BP–/– mice, lacking the inhibitory receptor of IL-22, were protected from lung injury and mortality compared with WT mice. Further, IL-22BP–/– mouse lungs had altered transcriptomes with a lack of oxidative phosphorylation gene expression, which was IL-22 dependent. Macrophages from IL-22BP–/– mice had increased glycolytic activity, suggesting that IL-22 may regulate macrophage metabolism. While much about the mechanisms by which IL-22/IL-22BP regulate anti-bacterial host defense remains to be discovered, it is clear that IL-22 is of importance in these settings.
