<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic has raised interest in immunomodulatory therapeutics. There are no published reports regarding lung IL-22 in coronavirus infections caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses (SARS-CoV1 or SARS-CoV2) or middle east respiratory syndrome virus (MERS). A recent report suggests that IL-22 may be systemically elevated in the acute phase of SARS-CoV2 infection and may play a role in cardiovascular injury (

 <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, 
 <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). The degree of similarity between SARS-CoV2 and influenza pathogenesis is currently unclear; however, it is likely that IL-22 plays a role in epithelial barrier integrity. Data is needed to assess the potential for targeting the IL-22 pathway in this context.
