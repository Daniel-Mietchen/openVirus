<p>Protective immune mechanisms of lung injury during infection are an important area of research that could provide new immunomodulatory therapeutic options. Maintenance of lung epithelial structural integrity during bacterial or viral pneumonia is of critical importance to limit lung edema and pathogen dissemination. The function of the cytokine interleukin (IL)−22 in the lung has only recently been elucidated and much is still to be discovered. Work over the last decade has shown that IL-22 likely plays a role in epithelial biology during infectious diseases (

Ligand binding leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT3 and nuclear translocation to regulate transcriptomic program in cells. IL-22 signaling is opposed by a soluble decoy receptor IL-22Ra2, or IL-22 binding protein (IL-22BP), which is coordinately regulated with IL-22 production to regulate IL-22 signaling. In this perspective article, the role of IL-22 in regulating the epithelial barrier in the lung during bacterial, viral, and super-infection will be discussed.
