<p>An important clinical exacerbation of influenza infection is secondary bacterial pneumonia. In both epidemic and pandemic seasons, bacterial super-infection is a severe complication that leads to a need for intensive care and in some cases, death. 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> has classically been the most common cause of influenza related super-infections, however over the last decade, 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> has become more predominant. IL-22–/– mice were shown to have increased bacterial burden and mortality compared with WT mice in a model of influenza, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> super-infection (
 <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). In this model, exogenous IL-22 delivered to WT mice decreased bacterial dissemination, but did not affect lung bacterial load (
 <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). IL-22 therapy increased epithelial barrier function and decreased lung leak. In support of these findings, deletion of IL-22BP in mice improved outcomes of influenza super-infection with both 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic> and 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> (
 <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). Severe lung pathology induced by influenza, 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection was significantly attenuated in IL-22BP–/– mice. Less lung leak and increased expression of claudin proteins were observed in IL-22BP–/– mice compared with WT mice. Finally, IL-22 treatment of air liquid interface cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells resulted in preserved tight junction function following injury with 
 <italic>S. aureus</italic>. These data demonstrate and important role for IL-22/IL-22BP in the context of polymicrobial infection.
