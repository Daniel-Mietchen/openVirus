<p>Zika virus epidemics have significant short and long-term impacts in the socioeconomic spheres in the Americas. In addition to the huge financial losses due to a heavy dependence on tourism and increased stress on the healthcare system, affected individuals with microcephaly may be unable to join the labor force in the future.
