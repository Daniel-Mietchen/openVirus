<p>Zika virus infection in acute stage is believed to be asymptomatic in up to 80% of the infected people and it is classically characterized by low fever, arthralgia, maculopapular rash accompanied by pruritis, and conjunctivitis. After a 12 day incubation period, symptoms usually last only a few days. Apart from the consequences in pregnancy, infections in healthy adults were associated with Guillainâ€“Barre syndrome as well [

However, infection during pregnancy can cause intrauterine growth restriction, birth defects, vision and hearing loss, resulting in cognitive and speaking problems accompanied by social and motor development problems in children. Zika virus disease is very often misdiagnosed because the symptoms are similar to the ones of dengue fever and chikungunya.
