<p>The objective was to systematically review the available evidence that causally links Zika virus and neonatal microcephaly. We conducted a review of different outbreaks of Zika virus disease, including investigations and case reports studies. The research was carried out based on PubMed, Crossref, and Google Scholar. The keywords used were: “Zika virus and microcephaly”, “Zika virus and fetal toxicity”, “Zika virus and craniostenosis”, “Zika virus and congenital malformations”, “Zika virus and teratogenesis”, “Zika virus and children’s mental health”. The timeline was set from February 2016 to December 2019 and out of 355 studies, only 15 were included in the review. More specifically, the articles identified through the initial search strategy were first screened by abstract and title. The full texts of appropriate studies were examined against the inclusion and exclusion criteria and from a total of 338 studies, a total of 150 reviews, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses were rejected. After further screening, 173 articles including other genetic disorders related to Zika, i.e., hearing problems, eye problems, cerebellum problems, hydrocephalus, intrauterine growth restriction, or even the Guillain–Barre syndrome, were rejected too (

The study also analyzed the exposure to Zika virus infection after doing appropriate tests (molecular and serology) in blood serum (mother–newborn), in amniotic fluid, in urine, and in the mother’s suspect Zika virus symptoms (low fever, rash, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, or headache), which were confirmed by examinations. As an outcome, we analyzed the frequency of microcephaly in infants (smaller head circumference more than 2 SDs depending on the sex and age). All infants with microcephaly underwent neural imaging examinations. Regarding the methodological quality of the articles, nine criteria were used to rate them. The first criterion, concerning the representative exposure sample was met by all studies except the two clinical ones. Regarding the second criterion, only four studies were graded because the other studies concerned infants or mothers who had been exposed to Zika virus. All studies met the third criterion because the exposure was identified with laboratory tests. In all studies except de Araújo et al. [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], the outcome did not precede the study. The fifth criterion, which was the adaptation for the educational level, did not exist in any study. In all studies apart from three, an adaption for an additional confounding factor had been used. All studies met the seventh criterion for evaluating the effects of microcephaly through examinations and also, in all studies there was sufficient follow-up time, thus fulfilling the eighth criterion. Finally, all studies met non-bias of wear, the ninth criterion. The score of studies varied between 8 and 6. No research had a score of 9 because all studies had a negative response to criterion5 (
