<p>The case–control research of de Araújo et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B20-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], investigated the relationship between infection with Zika virus and the occurrence of neonatal microcephaly. The cases studied consisted of 30 infants with microcephaly and 62 infants without outcome. Infants selected as controls had the same probable date of birth as patients and similarly with premature infants. The examination was followed by a blood sample from the umbilical cord and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of the infants with simultaneous laboratory tests for their mothers. The results of this study showed that 80% of 30 mothers of cases had Zika virus infection compared with 64% of 62 control mothers (
