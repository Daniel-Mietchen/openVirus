<p>There were three case studies in our review. In the case report of Driggers et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B25-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], a woman in the 11th week of her pregnancy reported mosquito bites after a vacation with her husband in Mexico. The day after their arrival in Washington, the woman and her husband experienced symptoms such as low-grade fever, ocular pain, and myalgia for five days. Initially, the results showed positive IgG and negative IgM against dengue virus, but subsequent serological analysis showed positive IgG–IgM against Zika virus, while serological analysis for chikungunya virus was negative. Furthermore, at 16 weeks, the presence of the virus was detected by RT-PCR, thus confirming infection with Zika virus. After the termination of pregnancy with the consent of the mother at 21 weeks of gestation, the brain had the highest viral load, weighed 30 g (reference weight, 49 ± 15 g) and neuropathological features of Zika infection. In a case study in 2016, Sarno et al. 2016 [
 <xref rid="B26-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], reported the case of a 20-year-old pregnant woman following a major outbreak of Zika virus Brazil. Following the standard ultrasound examination at week 18, low birth weight was observed for the week of gestation. Ultrasound scans at weeks 26 and 30 showed microcephaly; however, at week 32, an ultrasound showed no fetal heartbeat. Subsequently, Zika virus was detected in samples from the placenta, brain, CSF, and viscera. Moreover, in Martinez et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B27-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], samples from two neonates with microcephaly (estimates gestational ages of 36 and 38 weeks), dying within 20 hours of birth and two embryos miscarried at 11 and 13 weeks were sent to the CDC by the state of Rio Grande do Norte in Brazil for the evaluation of histopathological and laboratory tests after high suspicion of Zika infection. The four mothers had developed symptoms of the Zika virus infection, including fever and rashes during the first trimester of pregnancy, but they had no clinical symptoms of active infection during labor or miscarriage.
