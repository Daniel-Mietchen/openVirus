<p>In addition, a study by Rice et al., 2018 [
 <xref rid="B31-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], performed a follow-up on 1450 children (over 1 year) of mothers who had been infected with the virus during pregnancy. From the existing sample the 14% had birth defects associated with Zika virus syndrome and 6% of them had microcephaly. In the Hoen et al., 2016 [
 <xref rid="B32-ijerph-17-03806" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] study, 527 infants from mothers with laboratory confirmation of Zika virus were included. From this research, the risk of microcephaly is higher in the first trimester of pregnancy infection than in the second while increased rates of microcephaly are also present when the infection occurs in the third trimester. Therefore, according to the findings the increased rates of microcephaly (moderate or proportionate) in the third trimester show the increased risk of microcephaly throughout pregnancy.
