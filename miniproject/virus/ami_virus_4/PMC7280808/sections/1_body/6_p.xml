<p>If SARS-CoV-2 is airborne, then we must analyze two vitally important hypothetical questions: (1) What is the ideal protective method for the general population to use in crowded places? The current information indicates that homemade and cloth masks do not provide sufficient protection from acquiring an infection by a respiratory virus [

 <xref rid="b5-jpmph-53-3-178" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, the general population should be recommended to wear at least one surgical mask. (2) Would the extensive use of surgical masks be enough to avoid airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2? We know that in Asian countries, the use of masks has been prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the role of mask-wearing in the containment of the pandemic is limited, and any observed associations may even be coincidental, because so far, the evidence supporting the use of masks in the community is also scarce [
