<p>Although van Doremalen et al. [
 <xref rid="b4-jpmph-53-3-178" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] reported that viable viral loads could be detected in the air for up to 3 hours (the time the sample collection lasted), it is important to keep in mind that in their study, aerosols were generated in an attempt to simulate the possible aerial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 employing high-powered nebulizers (“three-jet collision nebulizers”) that do not reflect the droplets generated by human beings under actual coughing conditions. Thus, their findings may demonstrate that airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is possible, but under non-physiological conditions. As previously mentioned, there are some medical procedures, such as aerosol-generating nebulization, that are recognized as sources of nosocomial airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, this study does not demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is airborne in the community.
