<p>The known route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as for other respiratory viruses, is through droplets with an average diameter of 5 µm to 10 µm and through contact with fomites, which are contaminated surfaces that serve as a temporary “reservoir” of infectious particles that can remain viable for hours to days depending on the material and the environmental conditions [

Transmission via aerosols (airborne particles less than 5 µm also called “droplet nuclei”) is also known to be possible when these particles are generated during certain medical procedures such as nebulization, mechanical ventilation, endotracheal intubation, and bronchofibroscopy, among others. To date, insufficient scientific evidence exists to support the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted through the air through small particles that remain floating for hours in the environment.
