<p>In the study of Ong et al. [
 <xref rid="b2-jpmph-53-3-178" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], out of a total of 75 465 cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19; the disease caused by SARS-Cov2), no cases of airborne transmission were reported. In the study by Cheng et al. [
 <xref rid="b3-jpmph-53-3-178" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], a patient with a high viral load both in nasal swabs and in saliva was asked to speak, breathe normally, breathe deeply, and say 1, 2 or 3 consecutive sentences, while researchers collected the exhaled air at a distance of 10 cm. Their analyses found no detectable viral load in the samples taken from the exhaled air. Although this sampling was carried out in a room that simulated a well-ventilated room, it was possible to detect SARS-CoV-2 in an environmental sample taken from near the patientâ€™s bed, indicating that contact transmission, but not airborne transmission, was possible [
