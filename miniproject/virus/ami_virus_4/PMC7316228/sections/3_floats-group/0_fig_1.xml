  <title>Schematic of host-virus interactions at the hemagglutinin (HA) viral surface protein.</title>
  <p>(
   <italic>A</italic>) The structure of the H1N1 HA. The immunodominant HA head (HA1) contains the antigenic sites [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] onto which antibodies bind to neutralize the virus, whereas the HA stalk (HA2) is more conserved. (
   <italic>B</italic>) Immune escape due to increased avidity mediated by electrostatic charge, according to transmission experiments by Hensley and coauthors [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. To infect host cells, virions must first successfully enter cells. To accomplish this, the HA protein binds to a cellular receptor, 
   <italic>i.e.</italic> sialic acid, on the surface of the cell. An increase in charge is posited to increase HA avidity and therefore facilitate HA binding, leading to successful immune escape. (
   <italic>C</italic>) Patterns of charge over time in natural human sequences. Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
   <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] showed that the H3 increases over time, but that the H1 is constant. (
