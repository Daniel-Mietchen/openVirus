 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2</xref> explores how functional selection and expected charge are related, and explores whether these measures can identify distinct groups of residues. By examining the relationship between functional selection and expected charge across the whole protein (
 <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Materials and methods</xref>), we identified three groups of sites (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). The first set, hereafter named the “negative branch”, exhibits a negative linear relationship between expected charge and functional selection (yellow in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The second set, hereafter named the “positive branch”, mirrors the negative branch by having a positive linear relationship between expected charge and functional selection (light blue in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). The last set, hereafter named the “zero branch”, has functional selection independent of expected charge which is clustered around zero charge (dark blue in 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Thus, we have now grouped residues on the HA protein based on their functional constraints and charge implications, and 
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g002">Fig 2</xref> illustrates that the distribution of these groups are elaborate. These groupings thus serve as the basis for our further investigations into other properties of the residues in each group (
