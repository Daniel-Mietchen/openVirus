<p>Could patterns of localized electrostatic charge within the HA reconcile these findings? Perhaps the simplest explanation for the discrepancy between H1N1 and H3N2 HA net charge over time is that the H1N1 HA could be less tolerant to an overly positive net charge, and thus an increase in charge must be accompanied by a decrease elsewhere to keep the net charge relatively constant and preserve proper protein folding and function (more generally, for a discussion of charge and protein stability, see, e.g. [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]). Here, “function” refers to cell entry and viral replication in the absence of immune selection. Therefore, this hypothesis would posit that while certain regions are under strong immune selection to become more positive (in agreement with the immune escape model of Hensley and coauthors [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), an additional selective pressure acts elsewhere to keep the net H1N1 HA charge constant (thus reflecting the pattern observed by Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). To investigate this hypothesis, local patterns in the HA charge must be examined. Yet, selection for immune escape may modulate residues independent of charge due to function. Thus, while it would be possible to simply group residues based on individual distance to the receptor binding site and to examine their local charge, such an approach would not appropriately account for the functional constraints (on individual residues) that were present from early on in H1N1 HA evolution. Here, we aim to separate local changes in charge due to protein function versus evolutionary pressures from host immune systems, and this requires estimates of local functional selection on the HA protein.
