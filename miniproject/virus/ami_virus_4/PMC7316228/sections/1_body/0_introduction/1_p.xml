<p>Influenza A viruses (IAVs) are responsible for a major burden of disease in human populations [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. IAVs are segmented RNA viruses, generally characterized by the two surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Much of the acquired humoral host immune response to IAVs acts against the HA, which is responsible for cell entry. The HA consists of two subunits, HA1 and HA2, the former containing the receptor binding site (RBS) and exhibiting greater variation, while the latter is more antigenically conserved. Phylogenetically, HAs of IAVs form two monophyletic clades, known as group 1 and 2, and each group contains multiple subtypes, including the HA of H1N1 and H3N2, respectively [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. These viruses evolve via two mechanisms. Strong selective pressures from the host immune system, combined with error-prone RNA polymerases, lead to seasonal variants of a given subtype emerging through “drift” [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These yearly epidemics contrast to pandemics caused by a “shift” that occurs when IAVs of different animal species reassort, resulting in viruses with antigens to which the human population has little prior immunity [
