<p>With an aim toward disease control and pandemic preparedness, there have been considerable efforts to identify and characterize IAV dynamics across scales from molecular to global by confronting theory with data [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, the role of molecular characteristics such as glycosylation and electrostatic charge in evolutionary dynamics have yet to be fully resolved [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Glycosylation is known to be involved in IAV evolution [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], and Kobayashi and Suzuki [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] examined net charge in the context of N-linked glycosylation patterns over time. Mechanistically, electrostatic charge may play an important role in biomolecular interactions between virions, host cells, and antibodies. Local charge could also be involved in HA interactions with host immunity. As the cell surface is negatively charged, an increase in net charge is posited to aid the HA in binding to the cell surface, and thereby lead to successful immune escape due to more efficient viral entry [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Hensley and colleagues [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] illustrated the importance of HA avidity to the RBS in immune escape, and tied this to electrostatic charge by examining mutations leading to escape (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Furthermore, the actual number of charged amino acids in H3 was shown to be greatest in the dominant epitope [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. By considering the five charged amino acids and summing across IAV sequences, Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] found that the net charge of the H3N2 HA increased over time (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). However, no such increase was found for the H1N1 HA [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] (
 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007892.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition to starkly contrasting with the results from natural sequence analyses with H3N2 HAs, these findings are particularly puzzling since the transmission experiments in mice by Hensley and coauthors [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] were with H1N1 viruses. Arinaminpathy and Grenfell [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] proposed other explanations to account for their findings: in particular, they highlighted the possibility that the observed trends are covariates of other, more important factors, or that immune escape could also be the result of other mechanisms.
