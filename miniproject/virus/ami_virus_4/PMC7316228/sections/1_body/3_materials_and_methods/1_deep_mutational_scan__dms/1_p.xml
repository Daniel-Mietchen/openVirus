<p>The DMS generates amino acid preferences for each site, which are normalized enrichment. A preference of 0 denotes complete depletion of that particular amino acid and a preference of 1 denotes a complete depletion of all other amino acids in favor of that particular amino acid. For H1N1 HA data using dmstools2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], these preferences can be calculated (see example of Doud and Bloom [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] in dmstools2 documentation) for the HA using a Bayesian approach, in order to account for the possibility of errors in sequencing. We obtained the HA amino acid preferences from the Bloom lab GitHub repository.
