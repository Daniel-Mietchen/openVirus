<p>For HA residues, we computed relative solvent accessibilities (RSAs) using dmstools2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], and distances from the centroid of each residue to the centroid of the receptor binding site (RBS) were obtained from PyMOL 2.2.0 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] using the HA monomer. The pdb file for the HA monomer was generated with pdb-tools [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] by selecting chain A of the trimer. Note that RSAs and distances to RBS could not be computed for certain sites in the reference DMS sequence, as these values rely upon the closest available 3-dimensional H1N1 HA protein (used in Doud and Bloom [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]). Values for RSAs and distances to the RBS are also missing since we consider HA1 to contain the signal peptide, and some HA2 sites are not identified on the 3-dimensional H1N1 HA protein. To determine which sites on the HA are in the receptor binding site (RBS), we followed [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] (in H3 numbering) and comprised the RBS of the 130-loop (residues 135 to 138), the 190-helix (residues 190 to 198), the 220-loop (residues 221 to 228), and the RBS base (residues 98, 153, 183, and 195). To convert from H3 numbering to sequential numbering, we followed the conversion scheme given in Doud and Bloom [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. To compute RSAs for beta-lactamase, we followed Bloom [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and also used dmstools2 [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].
