<p>To compute evolutionary rates of amino acid substitutions, we selected the 958 unique sequences between 1918 and 2008, aligned these within fludb, and used the Rate4Site algorithm [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. To statistically test differences in distributions of evolutionary rates and other HA characteristics across groups of residues, we used the non-parametric Kolmogorov-Smirnov test with ks.test from R [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] (note that the p-values from these tests are sometimes not exact, due to ties). For beta-lactamase, we used the sequences given in Bloom [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and computed rates using the Rate4Site algorithm [
 <xref rid="pcbi.1007892.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].
