<p>Why are there contrasting net charge patterns for each branch over time, in conjunction with differing rates of evolution? These results could imply the following: as the positive branch evolves more slowly than its negative counterpart, it is possible that the decrease in net charge over time seen in the positive branch is in response to an increase in net charge over time of the negative branch. Our results also indicate that the sites in the zero branch are highly conserved on average, that their net charge does not vary significantly over time, and that their site-wise fitted observed charge is generally zero.</p>
