ICV and IDV have also zoonotic potential but cause mostly mild respiratory diseases (<xref rid="bb0010" ref-type="bibr">Asha and Kumar, 2019</xref>). <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> form enveloped, spherical or pleomorphic virions with 80&#x02013;120&#x000a0;nm in diameter. Their linear, negative-sense RNA genome has a total length of 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;kb and is divided into eight (IAV, IBV) and seven (ICV, IDV) segments, respectively. It encodes for up to 12 proteins, among others, in IAV and IBV, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for attachment, cell entry, and release of new particles. The NA and HA proteins are regularly subjected to small changes, which are capable of producing viral strains causing annual epidemics. This phenomenon is called &#x0201c;antigenic drift,&#x0201d; while &#x0201c;antigenic shift&#x0201d; is the process by which a sudden major change in the HA or NA proteins of IAV occurs due to genetic reassortment (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">King, 2011</xref>). Instead of HA and NA, which bind and cleave sialic acid (<italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid), ICV and IDV express one combined protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fution glycoprotein (HEF).

Control of the transmission of respiratory infections may be partly achieved through adequate hygiene practices and avoidance of congregation and stress.</p><p id="p0115">Upon entering a susceptible host through eyes, nose, or mouth, respiratory viruses replicate in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells or in the epithelium of the lower respiratory tract. In more severe cases, a subsequent systemic spreading of the virus is possible. The site of the deposition of inhaled particles also depends on their size. While inhalation of aerosols with influenza virus may lead to infection of the lower respiratory tract, larger droplets are retained in the upper respiratory tract (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Paules and Subbarao, 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0120">Between respiratory viruses, patterns of infection differ, too. For example, epithelial infection by RVs has a &#x0201c;patchy&#x0201d; distribution and is not overtly cytotoxic, in contrast to many other respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses, paramyxoviruses, and adenoviruses, which cause extensive inflammation and epithelial shedding (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">Royston and Tapparel, 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Pawe&#x00142;czyk and Kowalski, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Shim et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0125">Several pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) contribute to the detection of viral structures within the infected cell, among them specific toll-like receptors (TLRs), which bind viral nucleic acids and stimulate the production of type I interferons (<xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Pichlmair and Sousa, 2007</xref>). One way of IAV to suppress interferon expression and finally cell death is the production of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) within a few hours after infection.

The nature of the response is associated with age, previous infection, and vaccination status of the host. Recovery from respiratory viral illness is usually achieved prior to the detection of specific antibodies indicating that cellular and/or non-specific immune responses are primarily responsible for viral eradication. Nevertheless, antibodies are able to provide protection from secondary infections. However, different aspects limit the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies against specific viruses: (a) the effect may not be long-lasting (e.g., for HMPV), (b) high mutation rates lead to the occurrence of escape-mutants (e.g., in influenza viruses), (c) many different serotypes of one virus are circulating and antibodies are lacking cross-reactivity (e.g., against other RVs).</p><p id="p0140">Respiratory viruses not only induce a local inflammatory reaction at the level of infected epithelial cells but may also act at a distance through neuronal pathways. All parasympathetic, sympathetic, and nonadrenergic noncholinergic nervous supply of the respiratory tree may be affected by viral infections, suggesting an important neuroimmune interaction, which may contribute to the virus-mediated reactive airway disease (<xref rid="f0030" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>

Neurogenic pathways are also involved in the development of clinical manifestations.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0030">Fig. 5</alt-text><graphic xlink:href="f11635-05-9780128012383"/><attrib>Reproduced with permission from Papadopoulos NG and Skevaki CL (2006) Viruses of the lung.

While acute infections are usually self-limited, severe forms may occur. There is considerable overlap between viruses and clinical presentations. Although differences exist, all agents may cause any of several clinical syndromes (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>
). Among these, the common cold is by far the commonest with an enormous socioeconomic impact. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and nasopharyngeal irritation, lower respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, to systemic symptoms including general malaise, fever, headache, and sleep impairment depending on the viral culprit and host. The incubation period is 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h and symptoms usually last for 5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;days with a peak of viral replication before or together with the first clinical symptoms. The common cold is a rather benign clinical entity, which may however be complicated by secondary bacterial infections, otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbations; severe courses of disease and death may occur in young children and immunocompromised patients.<table-wrap position="float" id="t0010"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Disease syndromes of common respiratory viruses in upper and lower respiratory tract.</p></caption><alt-text id="al0035">Table 1</alt-text><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Asthma</th><th>Bronchitis</th><th>Bronchiolitis</th><th>Common cold</th><th>Croup</th><th>Otitis/sinusitis</th><th>Pneumonia</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Adenoviruses</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>**</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>**</td></tr><tr><td>Coronaviruses</td><td>**</td><td>*</td><td/><td>**</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>**</td></tr><tr><td>Influenza</td><td>**</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>**</td><td>**</td></tr><tr><td>Parainfluenza</td><td>*</td><td>**</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>***</td><td>*</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>Rhinoviruses</td><td>***</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>***</td><td>*</td><td>**</td><td>*</td></tr><tr><td>RSV</td><td>*</td><td>*</td><td>***</td><td>*</td><td>**</td><td>**</td><td>**</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The number of asterisks (*) is proportional to the relative frequency of the respective clinical presentation induced by each virus.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot><attrib>Papadopoulos NG and Skevaki CL (2006) Viruses of the lung.

The latter is one of the commonest infections among children and is very often attributed to viral etiology. Respiratory viruses may also predispose to nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization and alteration of the host's immune response. Finally, viruses may be responsible for antibiotic treatment failure in cases of concurrent bacterial and viral infections. Likewise, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of sinusitis, either directly as an extension of URT infection or as a result of secondary bacterial infection.</p><p id="p0155">Laryngitis and laryngotracheobronchitis-croup have more frequently been associated with the parainfluenza virus group. Pneumonia in infants and young children is most commonly attributed to viruses. Disease burden is also significant among the elderly and the immunocompromised. RVs and RSVs are the agents most frequently isolated in viral pneumonias, although age, season, year, and other variations can be considerable. The presence of adenovirus is a risk factor for severe disease in infants. Influenza occurs in yearly winter epidemics and pandemics every 10&#x02013;40&#x000a0;years resulting in enormous morbidity and mortality, especially among the very young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Infections with IBV or ICV are mostly milder than those with IAV (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Paules and Subbarao, 2017</xref>). The zoonotic potential of IDV is yet unknown. So far, this virus could not be found in patients with respiratory symptoms although a high seroprevalence in people working with cattle has been observed (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Su et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0160">RSV is the major pathogen implicated in acute bronchiolitis in infants up to 1&#x000a0;year and is responsible for a great number of hospitalizations and deaths in this age group. In the second year of life, RV and HBoV become more frequent pathogens (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Jartti et al., 2019</xref>). Host immune response skewed towards type 2 cytokine production seems to play a central role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Bronchiolitis is further associated with recurrent wheezing.</p><p id="p0165">The great majority of acute asthma exacerbations in children and a considerable proportion in adults is preceded by a viral URT infection. Such exacerbations may often result in hospitalization. The most frequently isolated offending agent is RV, a fact that reflects the preponderance of the virus among common cold cases. Finally, exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease may also have a viral etiology, most commonly due to RVs.</p><p id="p0170">WUPyV and KIPyV have so far only been associated with increased sputum production and wheezing; a clear role as causative agent has not been shown (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Cook, 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s0065"><title>Diagnosis, Vaccination, and Treatment</title><p id="p0175">The diagnosis of respiratory viral infections relies upon clinical criteria and is further supported by laboratory techniques such as direct viral, nucleic acid or antigen detection, culture, and serology. Direct detection is based on the identification of whole virus or inclusion bodies with electron or light microscopy, respectively. Viral antigens may also be detected by the use of immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays but an adequate viral load is required. Viral cultures usually demonstrate the biological effects of an agent, such as the cytopathic effect or hemagglutination, in cultured cells. Culture methods, however, have drawbacks due to their low sensitivity, extensive time length (days to weeks), and sometimes complex culture systems. Determination of specific viral antibodies in a host's blood sample and comparison between acute and convalescent phases of respiratory illness is another diagnostic modality, which is mainly used for epidemiological purposes. Serological tests include immunoassays, complement fixation, and passive agglutination assays as well as hemagglutination inhibition. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), like real-time polymerase chain reactions (real-time PCRs), are gaining more and more importance due to their high sensitivity and specificity, combined with low turnaround times. Together with antigen-based diagnostic tests, NAATs are used in point-of-care tests (POCTs), which are able to provide results much faster than lab-based tests and directly at the site of sample collection. In the field of genetic epidemiology and virus discovery, next-generation sequencing (NGS) became the method of choice, as no susceptible cell lines are required.</p><p id="p0180">Usually, samples from the respiratory tract are taken for diagnostic purposes. These include swabs from nose or throat, nasopharyngeal aspirates, nasal washes, sputum, bronchial aspirates, and bronchoalveolar lavages. Upon infection with HPeVs or HAdVs systemic infections or other complications, e.g., gastrointestinal or neurological symptoms, may occur. In this case, additional specimens, ranging from stool, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid, are taken (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Olijve et al., 2018</xref>; <xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Khanal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0185">The development of effective vaccines is hampered by the large number of viral serotypes. Currently, licensed vaccines are available only against influenza A and B viruses, as well as an oral live vaccine against HAdVs for U.S. military personell (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Paules and Subbarao, 2017</xref>; <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Crenshaw et al., 2019</xref>). Following the regular recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccines is updated every year to include the most important strains and to confer the best protection. However, as the actual frequency of the circulating influenza strains in each season may differ from this recommendation, the efficacy of these vaccines vary from year to year. Mostly, tri- and quadrivalent influenza vaccines, inactivated, live-attenuated, or recombinant vaccines are used. To overcome the need for a yearly vaccination, the search for alternative approaches and universal influenza vaccines is ongoing. Vaccine candidates against other respiratory viruses, like HRSVs, HPIVs, HMPV, and MERS-CoV are in development or under clinical investigation.</p><p id="p0190">Over-the-counter remedies for the alleviation and reduction of duration of common cold symptoms include vitamin C, zinc, and echinacea, although these agents are only moderately effective. Nasal decongestants, first generation antihistamines, anticholinergic nasal sprays, oral and intranasal &#x003b1;-adrenergic agonists, inhalation of humidified hot air at 42&#x02013;44&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cromones have been proposed for symptomatic relief with moderate results. A combination of specific antivirals with one or more anti-inflammatory drugs may offer the ideal therapeutic approach since it would both inhibit viral replication and block inflammatory events, although cost and compliance are considerable obstacles.</p></sec><sec id="s0070"><title>Current Antimicrobial Therapy</title><p id="p0195">Unfortunately, only a limited number of antiviral agents against respiratory viruses is available, due to the frequent mutations resulting in the constant emergence of new and often resistant strains. Nevertheless, many new drugs and experimental approaches are under investigation (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0200">The licensed antiviral chemotherapy against influenza viruses can be grouped into four classes, which prevent uncoating (adamantanes like amantadine and rimantadine), inhibit NA (e.g., oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir), prevent membrane fusion (arbidol), and interfere with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (the broad-spectrum antiviral favipiravir). Adamantanes are only active against IVA, however, today all circulating seasonal strains of IAV are resistant against this antiviral, so the use is not recommended any more. NA inhibitors are available for treatment and prophylactic purposes, but prophylactic applications are more effective as randomized controlled trials showed only marginal effects on the duration of symptoms (<xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Paules and Subbarao, 2017</xref>). New experimental antiviral agents target both the virus and the host, e.g., by inducing apoptosis only in infected cells (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Shim et al., 2017</xref>). Another experimental host-targeted strategy, against infections with HBoV, is repurposing of kinase inhibitors developed for tumor treatments (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0205">Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody against RSV F glycoprotein, which may be administered prophylactically to reduce the risk of severe bronchiolitis and hospitalization in specially vulnerable children, i.e. preterm infants and children with chronic lung or heart diseases (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Jartti et al., 2019</xref>). The antivirals cidofovir and ribavirin have been used against RSV especially in immunocompromised patients, but little to no beneficial and many adverse effects have been observed. Consequently, their widespread use is not recommended (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Khanal et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p id="p0210">The clinical usefulness of the capsid binding antivirals pleconaril, vapendavir, and pocapavir against RVs still has to be shown. A high likelihood for drug resistances limits their clinical applicability (<xref rid="bb0095" ref-type="bibr">Papadopoulos et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p id="p0215">A long-known effective compound against a variety of respiratory viruses and the resulting common cold is interferon alpha-2b, administered intranasally, before or shortly after exposure. However, due to its high cost, dosage frequency (six times daily), and side effects (mainly nasal irritation and bleeding) clinical application has been abandoned (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Mossad, 1998</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ac0010"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would like to thank the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and
