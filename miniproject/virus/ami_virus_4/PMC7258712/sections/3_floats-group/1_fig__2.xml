   <italic>Influenza virus.</italic> Schematic representation of an influenza A virus (IAV). Hemagglutinin spikes (green) radiate all over the surface and are interspersed by neuraminidase (yellow) and matrix protein M2 (light blue). The latter are embedded in the envelope's lipid bilayer(light yellow), which in turn surrounds a layer of matrix protein M1 (dark blue). The segmented RNA (orange) of the virus is located in the interior.
