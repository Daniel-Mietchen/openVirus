  <p>Pathogenesis of respiratory viral infections. Respiratory viruses enter the human body mainly through the nose. Thereafter, they replicate in nasopharyngeal epithelial cells, but also in the lower respiratory tract. Immune mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, and bradykinins will both elicit an “immune” response leading to effective virus eradication and contribute to the development of associated symptomatology, through vascular leakage and increased glandular secretions. Neurogenic pathways are also involved in the development of clinical manifestations.</p>
