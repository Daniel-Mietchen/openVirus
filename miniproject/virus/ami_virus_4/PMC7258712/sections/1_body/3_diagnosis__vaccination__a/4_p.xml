<p id="p0190">Over-the-counter remedies for the alleviation and reduction of duration of common cold symptoms include vitamin C, zinc, and echinacea, although these agents are only moderately effective. Nasal decongestants, first generation antihistamines, anticholinergic nasal sprays, oral and intranasal α-adrenergic agonists, inhalation of humidified hot air at 42–44 °C, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and cromones have been proposed for symptomatic relief with moderate results. A combination of specific antivirals with one or more anti-inflammatory drugs may offer the ideal therapeutic approach since it would both inhibit viral replication and block inflammatory events, although cost and compliance are considerable obstacles.</p>
