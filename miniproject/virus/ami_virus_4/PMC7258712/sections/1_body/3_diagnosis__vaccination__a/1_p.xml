<p id="p0175">The diagnosis of respiratory viral infections relies upon clinical criteria and is further supported by laboratory techniques such as direct viral, nucleic acid or antigen detection, culture, and serology. Direct detection is based on the identification of whole virus or inclusion bodies with electron or light microscopy, respectively. Viral antigens may also be detected by the use of immunofluorescence and enzyme immunoassays but an adequate viral load is required. Viral cultures usually demonstrate the biological effects of an agent, such as the cytopathic effect or hemagglutination, in cultured cells. Culture methods, however, have drawbacks due to their low sensitivity, extensive time length (days to weeks), and sometimes complex culture systems. Determination of specific viral antibodies in a host's blood sample and comparison between acute and convalescent phases of respiratory illness is another diagnostic modality, which is mainly used for epidemiological purposes. Serological tests include immunoassays, complement fixation, and passive agglutination assays as well as hemagglutination inhibition. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), like real-time polymerase chain reactions (real-time PCRs), are gaining more and more importance due to their high sensitivity and specificity, combined with low turnaround times. Together with antigen-based diagnostic tests, NAATs are used in point-of-care tests (POCTs), which are able to provide results much faster than lab-based tests and directly at the site of sample collection. In the field of genetic epidemiology and virus discovery, next-generation sequencing (NGS) became the method of choice, as no susceptible cell lines are required.</p>
