<p id="p0185">The development of effective vaccines is hampered by the large number of viral serotypes. Currently, licensed vaccines are available only against influenza A and B viruses, as well as an oral live vaccine against HAdVs for U.S. military personell (

Following the regular recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), the composition of the seasonal influenza vaccines is updated every year to include the most important strains and to confer the best protection. However, as the actual frequency of the circulating influenza strains in each season may differ from this recommendation, the efficacy of these vaccines vary from year to year. Mostly, tri- and quadrivalent influenza vaccines, inactivated, live-attenuated, or recombinant vaccines are used. To overcome the need for a yearly vaccination, the search for alternative approaches and universal influenza vaccines is ongoing. Vaccine candidates against other respiratory viruses, like HRSVs, HPIVs, HMPV, and MERS-CoV are in development or under clinical investigation.
