<p id="p0200">The licensed antiviral chemotherapy against influenza viruses can be grouped into four classes, which prevent uncoating (adamantanes like amantadine and rimantadine), inhibit NA (e.g., oral oseltamivir and inhaled zanamivir), prevent membrane fusion (arbidol), and interfere with the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (the broad-spectrum antiviral favipiravir). Adamantanes are only active against IVA, however, today all circulating seasonal strains of IAV are resistant against this antiviral, so the use is not recommended any more. NA inhibitors are available for treatment and prophylactic purposes, but prophylactic applications are more effective as randomized controlled trials showed only marginal effects on the duration of symptoms (
