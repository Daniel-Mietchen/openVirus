<p id="p0125">Several pathogen recognition receptors (PRRs) contribute to the detection of viral structures within the infected cell, among them specific toll-like receptors (TLRs), which bind viral nucleic acids and stimulate the production of type I interferons (
 <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Pichlmair and Sousa, 2007</xref>). One way of IAV to suppress interferon expression and finally cell death is the production of non-structural protein 1 (NS1) within a few hours after infection. NS1 binds viral RNA and prevents recognition by PRRs and inhibits expression of interferon-induced genes (
