<p id="p0135">Humoral immunity is also activated in response to viral infections with production of serotype-specific antibodies. The nature of the response is associated with age, previous infection, and vaccination status of the host. Recovery from respiratory viral illness is usually achieved prior to the detection of specific antibodies indicating that cellular and/or non-specific immune responses are primarily responsible for viral eradication. Nevertheless, antibodies are able to provide protection from secondary infections. However, different aspects limit the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies against specific viruses: (a) the effect may not be long-lasting (e.g., for HMPV), (b) high mutation rates lead to the occurrence of escape-mutants (e.g., in influenza viruses), (c) many different serotypes of one virus are circulating and antibodies are lacking cross-reactivity (e.g., against other RVs).</p>
