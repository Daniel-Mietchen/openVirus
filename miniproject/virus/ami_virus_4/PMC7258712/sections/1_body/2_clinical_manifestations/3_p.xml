<p id="p0155">Laryngitis and laryngotracheobronchitis-croup have more frequently been associated with the parainfluenza virus group. Pneumonia in infants and young children is most commonly attributed to viruses. Disease burden is also significant among the elderly and the immunocompromised. RVs and RSVs are the agents most frequently isolated in viral pneumonias, although age, season, year, and other variations can be considerable. The presence of adenovirus is a risk factor for severe disease in infants. Influenza occurs in yearly winter epidemics and pandemics every 10–40 years resulting in enormous morbidity and mortality, especially among the very young, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Infections with IBV or ICV are mostly milder than those with IAV (
