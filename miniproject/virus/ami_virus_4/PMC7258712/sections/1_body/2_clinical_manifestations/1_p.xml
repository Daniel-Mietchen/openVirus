<p id="p0145">Respiratory viruses are related to various distinct as well as non-specific clinical presentations. While acute infections are usually self-limited, severe forms may occur. There is considerable overlap between viruses and clinical presentations. Although differences exist, all agents may cause any of several clinical syndromes (
 <xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref> ). Among these, the common cold is by far the commonest with an enormous socioeconomic impact. Clinical presentation ranges from asymptomatic to upper respiratory tract (URT) symptoms such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and nasopharyngeal irritation, lower respiratory tract symptoms such as cough, to systemic symptoms including general malaise, fever, headache, and sleep impairment depending on the viral culprit and host. The incubation period is 24–48 h and symptoms usually last for 5–7 days with a peak of viral replication before or together with the first clinical symptoms. The common cold is a rather benign clinical entity, which may however be complicated by secondary bacterial infections, otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, and asthma exacerbations; severe courses of disease and death may occur in young children and immunocompromised patients.
