<p id="p0150">Viral URT infections often result in impairment of the function of the eustachian tube, which predisposes to the development of acute otitis media. The latter is one of the commonest infections among children and is very often attributed to viral etiology. Respiratory viruses may also predispose to nasopharyngeal bacterial colonization and alteration of the host's immune response. Finally, viruses may be responsible for antibiotic treatment failure in cases of concurrent bacterial and viral infections. Likewise, respiratory viruses have been implicated in the development of sinusitis, either directly as an extension of URT infection or as a result of secondary bacterial infection.</p>
