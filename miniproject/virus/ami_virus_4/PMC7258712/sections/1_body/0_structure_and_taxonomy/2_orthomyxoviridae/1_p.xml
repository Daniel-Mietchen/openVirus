 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic>’s major representatives are the influenza viruses, which are grouped into four genera with one member per genus: influenza A virus (IAV, 
 <italic>Alphainfluenzavirus</italic>), influenza B virus (IBV, 
 <italic>Betainflunenzavirus</italic>), influenza C virus (ICV, 
 <italic>Gammainfluenzavirus</italic>), and the recently discovered influenza D virus (IDV, 
 <italic>Deltainflunezavirus</italic>). While IAV has a wide host range with water fowl as main reservoir, IBV mainly infects humans. ICV and IDV have also zoonotic potential but cause mostly mild respiratory diseases (

 <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> form enveloped, spherical or pleomorphic virions with 80–120 nm in diameter. Their linear, negative-sense RNA genome has a total length of 10–15 kb and is divided into eight (IAV, IBV) and seven (ICV, IDV) segments, respectively. It encodes for up to 12 proteins, among others, in IAV and IBV, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for attachment, cell entry, and release of new particles. The NA and HA proteins are regularly subjected to small changes, which are capable of producing viral strains causing annual epidemics. This phenomenon is called “antigenic drift,” while “antigenic shift” is the process by which a sudden major change in the HA or NA proteins of IAV occurs due to genetic reassortment (

 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid), ICV and IDV express one combined protein, the hemagglutinin-esterase-fution glycoprotein (HEF). This protein requires an acetylated derivative of 
 <italic>N</italic>-acetylneuraminic acid for attachment to the host cells (
