<p id="p0090">Adenoviruses are non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses with a genome of 26–48 kb in icosahedral virions ranging from 70 to 90 nm in diameter (
 <xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">King, 2011</xref>). Fiber-like protrusions extend from each of the 12 penton base capsomers at the corners of the icosahedron. The knobs at the ends of these fibers confer attachment to the host cells, among others to coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR) or membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46). While most HAdVs only use one of the two receptors, group D viruses use both receptors simultaneously (
