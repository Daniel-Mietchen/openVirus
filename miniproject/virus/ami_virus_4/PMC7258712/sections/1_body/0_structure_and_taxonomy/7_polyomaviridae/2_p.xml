<p id="p0100">PyVs are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses of 40–45 nm diameter and contain a single, circular double-stranded DNA genome of ~ 5 kb. Inside the virion, the genome is packed with histone proteins H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. The capsid consists of 72 pentameric capsomers of the major capsid protein VP1 and the two minor capsid proteins VP2 and VP3. Typically, the two regulatory proteins large and small tumor antigen (LTAg and STAg, respectively), which are expressed early during infection, are used for phylogenetic analyses (
