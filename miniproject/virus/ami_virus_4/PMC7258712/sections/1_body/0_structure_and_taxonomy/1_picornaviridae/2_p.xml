<p id="p0020">Rhinoviruses (RVs) belong to the genus 
 <italic>Enterovirus</italic> and probably represent the most abundant human pathogenic microorganisms universally (
 <xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Mäkelä et al., 1998</xref>). Genetically, they are classified into the species RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C and further divided into distinct types by sequence variances of VP1. These types have been formerly called serotypes and were based on their antigenic properties (
 <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">McIntyre et al., 2013</xref>). So far, around 80, 30, and 55 types have been described for RV-A, RV-B, and RV-C, respectively (see website of the picornavirus study group). Most RV-A and all RV-B use intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 as cell entry receptor (major group), while the remaining RV-A bind low density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R, minor group). RV-C attaches to cadherin-related family member 3 (CDHR3) (
