<p id="p0015">The family of 
 <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> comprises several viruses associated with respiratory tract infections. Members of this family form non-enveloped, icosahedral virions with approximately 30 nm in diameter and a single linear, positive-sense RNA genome of 7–10 kb. It encodes for a polyprotein containing the four capsid proteins VP1-4 and the seven non-structural proteins 2A-C and 3A-D in the precursor proteins P1 and P2, respectively (
