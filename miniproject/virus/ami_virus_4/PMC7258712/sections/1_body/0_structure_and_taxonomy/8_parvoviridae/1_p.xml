 <italic>Parvoviridae</italic> are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses of around 25 nm diameter. The capsid encloses a single, linear, mostly negative-sense DNA-genome with approximately 5.5 kb. The genome encodes for three capsid proteins (VP1-3) and five non-structural proteins (NS1–4, NP1). Human bocavirus 1 (HBoV1), a member of the species 
 <italic>Primate bocaparvovirus 1</italic>, in the genus 
 <italic>Bocaparvovirus</italic> and the subfamily of 
 <italic>Parvovirinae</italic>, is strongly associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in young children. The related viruses, HBoV2-4, are only found in stool samples. By exploiting the cellular DNA repair machinery, HBoV1 is independent from the cell cycle for genome replication (
