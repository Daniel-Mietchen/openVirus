<p id="p0050">Viruses of the family of 
 <italic>Pneumoviridae</italic> form enveloped, spherical or filamentous virions with 100–200 nm in diameter, which contain a single, linear, negative-sense RNA genome. This genome is bound in a complex with the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the polymerase (L), and a necessary co-factor (P). The glycosylated fusion (F) and attachment (G) proteins in the envelope mediate cell entry. In contrast to paramyxoviruses, almost all pneumoviruses lack a hemagglutinin and neuraminidase (
