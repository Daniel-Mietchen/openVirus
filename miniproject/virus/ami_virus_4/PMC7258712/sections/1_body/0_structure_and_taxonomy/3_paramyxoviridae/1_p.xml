<p id="p0040">Human parainfluenza viruses (HPIVs) are respiratory viruses in the family of 
 <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic>. They have enveloped, pleomorphic but mostly spherical virions with a diameter of 300–500 nm. The single, linear, negative-sense RNA genome consists of 14.5–20 kb in a helical nucleocapsid. For efficient replication, the genome length is confined to multiples of 6 nucleotides. Among others, it encodes for the glycosylated fusion (F) protein and the glycosylated receptor-binding protein (RBP), also called haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein, which binds to neuraminic acid on the cell surface.
