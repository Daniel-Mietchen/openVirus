<p id="p0070">Coronaviruses form enveloped, spherical virions with a diameter of 120–160 nm. The size of the single, linear positive-sense RNA genome ranges between 26 and 32 kb, which represents the largest genome of known RNA viruses. The trimeric glycosylated spike (S) protein forms characteristic 15–20 nm long protrusions, which mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion. Common to all coronaviruses are also the membrane (M) and envelope (E) glycoproteins and the nucleocapsid (N) protein. Depending on the species, other proteins are included, e.g., a hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) for reversible attachment to
