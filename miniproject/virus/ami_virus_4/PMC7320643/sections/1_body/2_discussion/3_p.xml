<p>Unfortunately, the COVID-19 virus not only affects the respiratory tracts, it also may manifest in other regions like the gastrointestinal tract and ocular tissues, as conjunctivitis has been reported during this outbreak and conjunctival secretions yielded positive RT-PCR results [
 <xref rid="REF17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. This suggests that COVID-19 can infect the conjunctiva and cause conjunctivitis, and virus particles are present in ocular secretions. Indeed, there is also evidence that some coronavirus family can occasionally cause conjunctivitis in humans. In fact, human coronavirus NL 63 (HCoV-NL63) was first identified in a baby with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis. In 28 cases of children with confirmed HCoV-NL63 infections, 17% had conjunctivitis [

Despite being fully dressed in a protective suit and N95 respirator, he was still infected by the virus, with the first symptom being unilateral conjunctivitis, followed by fever. In spite of the controversy about the eye as the possible means of transmitting disease, Qing et al. posit that the virus enters the tear duct through droplets, which may pass through the nasolacrimal ducts and then into the respiratory tract [
