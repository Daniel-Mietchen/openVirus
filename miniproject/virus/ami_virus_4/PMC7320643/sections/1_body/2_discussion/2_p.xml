<p>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2), also known as COVID-19 virus, is a species of the coronavirus family that infects humans, bats, and certain other mammals. In fact, bats are a major reservoir of many strains of SARS-related coronaviruses, and several strains have been identified in palm civets, which were likely ancestors of SARS-CoV-2. Cross-species transmission (CST), also called host jump, or spillover, is the ability of a foreign virus, once introduced into a new host species, to infect that individual and spread throughout the new host population, as has happened with swine flu, SARS-COV-1, and now COVID-19 [
 <xref rid="REF11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. It is a member of the genus betacoronavirus and subgenus Sarbecoronavirus and is an enveloped positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus that enters its host cell by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) receptor [

This primarily occurs when an infected person coughs or sneezes and produces respiratory droplets that spread like other respiratory pathogens. These droplets can settle in the mouth or nasal mucosa and lungs of people who inhale the air [

 <xref rid="REF14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused epidemics in the past years, the usual first symptoms are commonly defined as fever, cough, and shortness of breath. In 99 patients with COVID-19 virus infection, chest pain, confusion, and nausea-vomiting were noted in addition to previous findings [
 <xref rid="REF15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. X-ray and thorax CT imaging of patients with COVID-19 showed unilateral or bilateral involvement compatible with viral pneumonia. Reported complications include acute heart damage, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), secondary infections, pneumothorax, and some patients with other comorbidity exhibited more severe symptoms and even death [
 <xref rid="REF16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The diagnosis of COVID-19 infection is based on history, including detailed contact and travel history aided by laboratory testing. Viral infection laboratory testing methods are important, including serology tests and viral culture. The most commonly used diagnostic methods are molecular methods, such as reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or real-time PCR by using a respiratory sample as the oropharyngeal swab, sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage.
