<p>A 33-year-old ophthalmologist, Dr. Li Wenliang, was the first to raise the alarm about a cluster of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like pneumonia cases late December 2019 at Wuhan City, China. Regrettably, that warning was not taken seriously. Following that, Dr. Li returned to work and, unfortunately, contracted the virus from an asymptomatic glaucoma patient in early January. Later on, Dr. Li passed away, leaving behind a child and a wife, who is pregnant, and opened the doors and discussions about the risk of infection among ophthalmologists. A survey study by Nair and colleagues reported that the majority of ophthalmologists in India (59.1%) felt that ophthalmologists were potentially at a higher risk of contracting COVID-19 as compared to other specialties while examining patients [

In fact, ophthalmologists are at high risk of contracting the COVID-19 virus through unprotected eye contact with secretions during routine ophthalmic examinations with direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examinations, which are usually performed in a setting that has close doctor-patient contact. On December 31, 2019, the WHO was notified by China about an outbreak of pneumonia with an initially unknown etiology in Wuhan city in Hubei province. In January 2020, the causative organism was identified as a novel member of the coronavirus family. Initially tentatively named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and named SARS-CoV- type 2 by the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), this virus is the cause of the disease named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). To date, COVID-19 has already confirmed to have affected over 5,000,000 people and caused over 300,00 deaths worldwide, spanning 205 countries in South East Asia, Europe, North America, Australia, and the Middle East and led to huge public health challenges [
