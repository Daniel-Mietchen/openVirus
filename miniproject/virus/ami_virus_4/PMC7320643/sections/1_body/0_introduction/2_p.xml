<p>The transmission route of COVID-19 is not yet fully known but it is thought to be mainly respiratory. It is even more overwhelming that many infected persons showed no apparent respiratory symptoms and presented with non-respiratory manifestations, including conjunctivitis in the ocular tissue [
 <xref rid="REF3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and diarrhea in the gastrointestinal system [
 <xref rid="REF4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. COVID-19 may spread through the eye’s mucous membrane via indirect contact with droplets. The variable presentation of the disease makes transmission via contact, especially for health care providers like ophthalmologists, possible. Since the outbreak, more than 3,300 healthcare professionals having been infected, with 44 deaths, including one ophthalmologist. Multiple comprehensive recommendations by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) [
 <xref rid="REF5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and a well-designed study from Hong Kong [
 <xref rid="REF6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] were announced helping ophthalmologists for safe practices. However, it is the responsibility of global organizations to review daily evidence and provide instructions and uniform guidelines. This paper aimed to provide an evidence-based approach, although this may not be applicable to all institutes and is not a proven medico-legal recommendation. Subsequent information about the nature of COVID-19 may change these recommendations in the future. In light of these, specific measures are needed from an ophthalmic point of view to control the COVID-019 outbreak and to protect health care providers.
