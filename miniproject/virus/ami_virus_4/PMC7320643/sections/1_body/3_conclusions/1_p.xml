<p>At the time of the pandemic, with limited information, no treatment for COVID-19, and no vaccine as yet, we will need to stay highly cautious to recognize the possible non-respiratory early manifestations of COVID-19 infection, including the consideration of viral conjunctivitis as a possible presentation. Healthcare professionals, including ophthalmologists, should take the full recommended measures and precautions to protect themselves and their patients and stop the spread of the infection.</p>
