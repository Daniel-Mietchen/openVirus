<p>Because of the disease's contagiousness and way of spread, it is better and safe to keep non-urgent patients away from the hospital during the pandemic period. The priority should be on how to reduce the risk of COVID-19 virus transmission from human to human and the rate of new case development. Then, we “flatten the curve” and not overwhelm the health services and limited supply of hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, ventilators, and others. Second, direct all disposable medical supplies and focus them on hospitals where they are most needed [

Therefore, all non-urgent routine follow-up and surgeries like mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or routine scheduled cataract surgery should be postponed. It is even better if patients can be sent text messages or called to discuss the need to reschedule their appointment or a public announcement to cancel all routine follow-up visits and surgeries, in order to minimize all non-urgent cases coming to the eye clinic or hospital [

In addition, infection control was provided to the environment and health personnel.
