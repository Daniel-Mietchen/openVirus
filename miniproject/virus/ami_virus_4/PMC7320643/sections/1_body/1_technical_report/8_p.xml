<p>After seeing every patient, standard cleaning and disinfection should apply to all patient care, regardless of the suspected or confirmed infection status of the patient [

All ophthalmic instruments, including slit-lamps, tonometer, and contact lenses, and all places the patient touched should be disinfected. Standard hand hygiene is critical, including frequent hand wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds before and after seeing patients [

The virus causing COVID-19 is an enveloped virus, making it very susceptible to the same alcohol- and bleach-based disinfectants that ophthalmologists commonly use to disinfect ophthalmic instruments and office furniture. Some methods recommended by the CDC to disinfect and destroy the COVID-19 virus include alcohol solutions with at least 70% alcohol and diluted bleach. However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shared a list of antimicrobial products like Stepan Company (Northfield, Illinois) products (disinfectant spray) that are expected to be effective against COVID-19 [

There are a wide range of disinfectants available that can be used to disinfect surfaces. Kampf et al. found that some members of the coronavirus family - SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) - can persist on surfaces like metal, glass, or plastic for up to nine days but can be efficiently inactivated by surface disinfection with 62%-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite within one minute. Other biocidal agents, such as 0.05% to 0.2% benzalkonium chloride or 0.02% chlorhexidine digluconate, are less effective [
