    "Several coronaviruses can infect humans, and the globally endemic human coronaviruses, HCoV-229E (human coronavirus 229E), HCoV-NL63 (human coronavirus NL63), and others, tend to cause mild respiratory diseases. The zoonotic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type1 (SARS-CoV-1) have high fatality rates. In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified by Chinese authorities about an outbreak of pneumonia before the causative organism was identified in January 2020 as a novel coronavirus family. The WHO refers to the virus as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Within several weeks, the outbreak has become an emergency, and many countries have since been affected. The method of transmission is not yet fully known but is thought to be mainly respiratory. Healthcare providers, particularly ophthalmologists, are at high risk of a COVID-19 infection through unprotected contact with eye secretions during routine ophthalmic examinations that involve the use of direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp examinations, which are usually performed in a setting that allows for close doctor-patient contact. In light of these, specific measures are needed from an ophthalmic point of view to control the COVID-19 outbreakÂ and to protect health care providers."
