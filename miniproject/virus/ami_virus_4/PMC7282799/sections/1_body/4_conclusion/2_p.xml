<p id="d1e8543">This paper has presented a robust model for COVID-19 based on a modified SEIRS method to include considerations for the ageing population, and time delay for control action as well as resusceptibility of the recovered population due to temporal immunity. Two case studies using real-world data were presented in this research; the first case for verification of the model based on the data in South Korea including a study on the possibility of resusceptibility of recovered population; and the second case for prediction study of the model using data and up-to-date control action and related events in Northern Ireland. The simulation results from the case studies have clearly shown that the time of which the control action is taken and also the time for the public to properly respond to such intervention measures are critical in helping to flatten the curve. Also, until a time where a vaccine is developed and made available to the general public, the possibility of resusceptibility, no matter how small, will lead to subsequent waves of infections in the future depending on the time of temporal immunity. A simulation package was developed using the MATLAB/Simulink environment to ease understanding on the spread of the virus as well as the efficiency that needs to be achieved by the control action in order to successfully flatten the infection curve to not overload the healthcare capacity.</p>
