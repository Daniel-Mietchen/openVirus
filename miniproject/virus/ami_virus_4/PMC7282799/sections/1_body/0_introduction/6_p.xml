<p id="d1e1038">This paper is organised as follows: Section 
 <xref rid="sec2" ref-type="sec">2</xref> introduces the mathematical model; Section 
 <xref rid="sec3" ref-type="sec">3</xref> presents the theoretical proofs for the positivity, boundedness, and stability of the model, as well as describes the model with time delay factors for the control action and potential resusceptibility; Section 
 <xref rid="sec4" ref-type="sec">4</xref> verifies the proposed model and also provides some extensive results and discussions on predictions using the model through case studies based on real-world data; and Section 
 <xref rid="sec5" ref-type="sec">5</xref> concludes the paper. 
 <xref rid="appA" ref-type="sec">Appendix A</xref> presents the design of the simulation package using the MATLAB/Simulink environment.
