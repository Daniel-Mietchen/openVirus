<p id="d1e978">The symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus have large variations with most people only experiencing mild to moderate respiratory illnesses and only a smaller group of people would develop complications of respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Based on clinical data reported from Wuhan where the outbreak began, elderly patients have been identified to have higher odds to experience severe symptoms with higher mortality rate compared to people of younger age 
 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Study also shows that up to approximately 80% of the people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic carriers, i.e. they experience no or mild symptoms but are still able to transport the virus to others 
 <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. This has caused the detection and containment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be much more challenging. As a result, social distancing has been widely implemented in many countries worldwide to slow down the transportation of the virus through minimised human-to-human contact. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 after experiencing mild or moderate symptoms are more likely to develop temporary resistance towards the virus and are unlikely to experience severe respiratory illnesses 
 <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. However, in rare occasions, there have been clinical findings showing that patients who have recovered from the disease have been tested positive again. For instance, in February 2020, a patient in Osaka, Japan, has been tested positive towards the SARS-CoV-2 a few days after being discharged from the hospital for treatment with the disease 
 <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Due to very limited knowledge on the immune response of humans to this novel virus, the possibility of reinfection cannot be ruled out at the moment.
