 <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Most notably, the SEIR (Susceptible–Exposed–Infected–Removed/Recovered) model has been widely reported during the past decades in quantitative modelling studies of infectious epidemics/pandemics, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 
 <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, the influenza A (pH1N1) pandemic in 2009 
 <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) pandemic in 2013 
 <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, as well as the latest Ebola outbreak in 2018 
 <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The SEIR model represents a typical infectious epidemic disease using four distinctive phases; susceptible (S) represents the population that has yet to be infected by the virus; exposed (E) represents the number of individuals exposed to the virus; infected (I) models the number of people infected, have demonstrated symptoms, and are able to spread the virus to the people in the S compartment; and lastly, recovered/removed (R) models the number of people who have recovered and are assumed to have immune response towards the virus

 <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Thus, based on the model, the S compartment will slowly deplete as the outbreak prolongs further, and the virus will eventually die out due to insufficient population within the S compartment. This compartmental modelling method allows transport of population from one compartment to another, where the disease transmission rates with respect to time can be simulated.
