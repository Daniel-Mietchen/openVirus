<p id="d1e1024">In this work, we propose a modified SEIRS model based on the Kermack–McKendrick model 
 <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> with consideration for time delay and resusceptibility to the virus after recovery. In this model, the probability of a recovered patient to be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 is taken into consideration to predict the future projection of COVID-19 cases. Resusceptibility is one of the crucial keys that could possibility lead to a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. Time delay in the control action representing the time taken for the authorities to act on the virus and also the duration of short-term immunity after recovery, which may lead to resusceptibility, are also considered in the model. The time delay factor is applied to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model and simulation, hence to better reflect on the timely situation with specific measures to control the transmission of the disease. The consideration for resusceptibility with time delay is an important highlight in this paper as it has rarely been considered in the SEIR models reported thus far

 <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, 
 <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Other than that, we also included information such as demographic details for the ageing population, who seem to experience a higher fatality rate due to COVID-19
