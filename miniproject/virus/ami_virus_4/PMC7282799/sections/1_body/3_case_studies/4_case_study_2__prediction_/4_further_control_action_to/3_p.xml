<p id="d1e8504"> Therefore, on day 38, which is about one week after the infection curve started to flatten due to the first control action, a second control action was introduced into the model. This second control action also reflects on the announcement made by the United Kingdom government in early April 2020 to allow police officers to enforce social distancing measures. Assuming that this second control action results in a further efficiency of 66%, the reproduction number could then be reduced to

 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>a that the peak in the infection curve is now reduced to 3500 cases. As such, the critical care capacity should be able to meet the demand for treatment based on the same assumption made earlier in this section, where it is estimated about 10% of the infected cases are admitted to the ICU. Another observation worth noting is that the number of deaths in the worst case scenario has also been reduced to about 3000 cases. See 
 <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>b. This value echos the projection made by the government in Northern Ireland that COVID-19 could lead to 3000 deaths during the first wave
