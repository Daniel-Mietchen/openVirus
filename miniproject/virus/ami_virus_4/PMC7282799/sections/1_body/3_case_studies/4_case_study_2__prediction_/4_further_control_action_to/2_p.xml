<p id="d1e8481">However, based on the results shown in 
 <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, it is essential to further flatten this curve due to the limit of about 330 critical care beds available in Northern Ireland (100 initial setup + 230 introduced by the newly built Nightingale hospital) 
 <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. According to the Intensive Care National Audit &amp; Research Centre (ICNARC) with its “Report on 2249 patients critically ill with COVID-19” dated 4th April 2020, about 6% of those tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 required critical care 
 <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. Meanwhile in Italy, as of 29th March 2020, up to 12% of all positive cases were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) 
 <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As such, should we assume that approximately 10% of those tested positive in Northern Ireland would require ICU admission, then the peak of the infection curve should not exceed 3300 cases, i.e. more control actions have to be taken to reduce the peak of 350,000 cases as seen in
