<p id="d1e7842">South Korea is used as a case study due to the amount of data available given that it is one of the first few countries to be directly affected by the virus outside of China. Its first confirmed case was reported on 20th January 2020

The other reason is that South Korea is also one of the very few countries that managed to effectively flatten the infection curve and it has set itself apart from others in leading the fight against COVID-19, at least for the moment. For example, the country started vigorous testing among its population with contact tracing, especially those of confirmed and suspected cases during the early stage of the epidemic. The government accomplished this by maintaining a public database keeping track of mobile phones, credit cards, and other data of patients who tested positive
