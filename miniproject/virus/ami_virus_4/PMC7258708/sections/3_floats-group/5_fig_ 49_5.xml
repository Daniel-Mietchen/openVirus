  <p>Typical course of HIV Infection.</p>
  <p>During the early period after primary infection, there is widespread dissemination of virus and a sharp decrease in the number of CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cells in peripheral blood. An immune response to HIV ensues, with a decrease in detectable viremia followed by a prolonged period of clinical latency. The CD4
   <sup>+</sup> T cell count continues to decrease during subsequent years, until it reaches a critical level below which there is a substantial risk of opportunistic diseases.
