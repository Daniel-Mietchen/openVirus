  <p>General concepts and properties of polarized macrophages.</p>
  <p>Classically activated macrophages (M1) are induced through LPS and/or microbial product stimulation. Their inflammatory repertoire is characterized by the secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators and the release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates. In contrast, alternative activation of macrophages (M2) covers a continuum of functional states classified as M2a, induced by IL-4/IL-13; M2b, induced by immune complexes and TLR agonists; and M2c, induced by IL-10 and glucocorticoid hormones.</p>
