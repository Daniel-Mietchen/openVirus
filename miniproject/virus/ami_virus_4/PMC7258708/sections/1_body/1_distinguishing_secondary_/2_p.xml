<p id="p0345">Patients with normal immune systems who become infected with viruses, bacteria, or parasites known to temporarily subvert or paralyze adaptive immunity without the above history are more likely to have secondary immune defects caused by microbes that prevent appropriate immunity to other organisms. Thus, the challenge for clinicians is to distinguish between patients with PID versus those with microbe-induced, secondary immune deficiency at the time of first presentation of a serious infection. In this review, we address the patient population with secondary, infection driven immune compromise, in contrast to patients with PIDD who are the focus of the remainder of this textbook. </p>
