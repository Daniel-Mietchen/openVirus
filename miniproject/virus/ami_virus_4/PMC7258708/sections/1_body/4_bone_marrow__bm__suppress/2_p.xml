<p id="p0480">There are 4 different mechanisms by which viruses can affect hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC). These mechanisms include: (1) direct viral infection, (2) viral recognition by HSPCs and indirect effects, (3) inflammatory mediators, and (4) changes in the BM microenvironment. Taken together, many types of viruses can affect hematopoiesis acutely (Parvovirus B19, dengue), transiently, permanently, chronically (CMV, HIV), systemically (HIV), locally (Influenza), directly, or indirectly, causing disruption of the hematopoietic process.
