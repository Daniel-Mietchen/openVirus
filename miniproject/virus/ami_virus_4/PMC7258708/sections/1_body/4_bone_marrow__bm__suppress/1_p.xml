 </xref> However, the specific pathogenic mechanisms that underlie the reported virally induced BM manifestations have not been fully characterized. Nonetheless, many different viruses generate the same pathological condition. This suggests that a common underlying mechanism(s), specifically virologic or immunologic are responsible for the clinical pathologic outcome. Certain virus can also lead to different pathological manifestations in different patients heralding a genetic basis for aberrant immune activation in BM failure.
