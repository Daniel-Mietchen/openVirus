<p id="p0455">Human T-Lymphotropic viruses (HTLV) are complex type C retroviruses with a capsid that contains two simple RNA strands with associated reverse transcriptase and integrase enzymes which are essential for insertion of the virus into the host genome.

 </xref> Several types of HTLV have been identified (HTLV-1, HTLV-2, HTLV-3, HTLV-4). While HIV-1 was previously called HTLV-3, HTLV-3 is a different virus.

 </xref> Similar to other retroviruses, HTLV-1 contains 
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pro/pol</italic> and 
 <italic>env</italic> genes that have structural and functional roles. In addition, the pX region codes for regulatory proteins (such as transactivator protein, Tax, and the helix basic zipper protein, HBZ) essential for viral transcription, and inhibition of signal transduction pathways, such as NFκB (leading to decreased SOCS1), and AP-1. This leads to HTLV-1 inducing cytotoxic T cells that can kill virus-infected cells.
