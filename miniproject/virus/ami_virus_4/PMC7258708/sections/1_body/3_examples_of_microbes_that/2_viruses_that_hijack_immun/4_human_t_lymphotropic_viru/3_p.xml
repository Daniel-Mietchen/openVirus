<p id="p0465">The development of the HTLV-1 induced autoimmunity is thought to rely on molecular mimicry, and HTLV-1 induced T cell immunosuppression is caused by direct infection of CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells. CD4
 <sup>+</sup> T cells that have altered function and cytokine production. Tax is the primary inducer of clonal infected T cell expansion, and genetic instability.

 </xref> Clinically, patients infected with HTLV1 have increased infections and increased autoimmunity, particularly rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome. The autoimmunity correlates somewhat with viral load, however, there are immunologic mechanisms that probably facilitate breaks in tolerance leading to autoimmunity.
