<p id="p0440">HIV is a double-stranded, enveloped RNA retrovirus from the genus Lentivirus within the subfamily Retroviridae, with a tropism for human CD4
 <sup>+</sup> cells, including T cells and macrophages.

 </xref> Two HIV types have been identified, HIV-1 and HIV-2, and both cause similar but not identical human disease. The HIV genome contains three structural genes (
 <italic>gag</italic>, 
 <italic>pol</italic>, and 
 <italic>env</italic>) and six regulatory genes (
 <italic>tat</italic>, 
 <italic>rev</italic>, 
 <italic>nef</italic>, 
 <italic>vif</italic>, 
 <italic>vpr</italic>, and 
 <italic>vpu</italic>). These proteins, their function, and their role in forming the viral particle have recently been summarized.

 </xref> The Env protein is cleaved to produce two envelope proteins, gp120 and gp41, which are involved in HIV binding to CD4 and the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 on cell surfaces.

 </xref> The classical HLA presenting molecule HLA-C on antigen presenting cells is not as potent in presenting viral peptides to T cells similar to the non-classical MHC class I molecule HLA-E. However, the non-classical MHC class I molecule HLA-E, similar to HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C, suppress NK function. This viral strategy to evade immune surveillance serves two functions: (1) prevent CD8
 <sup>+</sup> T cells from recognizing HIV peptides presented by class I MHC molecules, and (2) prevent NK cell recognition and activation because HLA-C and HLA-E remain on HIV-infected cells leading to inhibition of NK killing of class I MHC expressing target cells. The Nef protein also downregulates CD4 expression on the surface of HIV-infected cells, which is a co-receptor of the T cell receptor participating in T cell activation.
