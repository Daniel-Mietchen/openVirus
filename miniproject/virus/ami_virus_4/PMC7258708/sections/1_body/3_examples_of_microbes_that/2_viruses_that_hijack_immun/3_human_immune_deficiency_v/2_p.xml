 </xref> In addition, shedding of gp120 molecules by HIV triggers a series of events that cause the adaptive immune system to become less effective by altering the normal balance of immunoregulatory Th1 and Th2 T cells. Impaired function of HIV-infected macrophages and dendritic cells contributes to the failure of effective innate and adaptive immune responses to secondary infection.
