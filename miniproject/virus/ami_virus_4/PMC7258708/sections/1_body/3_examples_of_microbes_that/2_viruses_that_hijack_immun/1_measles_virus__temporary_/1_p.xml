 <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Part of the reason why control of MV continues to be elusive is that it is highly contagious for susceptible individuals and there are difficulties with vaccine delivery. MV infection begins in the respiratory tract, spreads systemically in lymphoid, epithelial and endothelial cells, and ultimately infects multiple organs,

 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 49.3A and B</xref> ). High fever, rhinorrhea and conjunctivitis typically precede the rash and the rash migrates from the head and neck to the hands and feet over 3–4 days. Many of these manifestations are caused by the immune response made to MV, and commonly this response clears MV in infected tissues and prevents re-infection for life (
 <xref rid="f0020" ref-type="fig">Fig. 49.3C and D</xref>). However, MV infection can cause several weeks of immune suppression after resolution in select individuals. This is the primary cause of measles-associated deaths: MV-induced secondary infection.
