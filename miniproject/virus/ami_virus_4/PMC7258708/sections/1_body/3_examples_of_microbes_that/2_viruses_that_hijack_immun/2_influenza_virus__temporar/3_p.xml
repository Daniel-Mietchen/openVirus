<p id="p0435">IL-10 is also elevated in post-influenza pneumococcal pneumonia, leading to increased susceptibility to

 <xref rid="bib104" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>104</sup>
 </xref> Susceptibility remains at least 14 days after a primary influenza infection, and is thought to be mediated by IL-10 inhibition of neutrophil function, resulting in increased bacterial growth in the lungs leading to mortality.

 </xref> Of note, viral influenza neuraminidase increases 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> adherence in the lungs by cleaving sialic acid residues, and exposing receptors to which 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> can adhere.

 </xref> Thus, both neutrophil-dependent and -independent mechanisms cause increased susceptibility to secondary 
 <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> infection after a primary influenza infection. Novel therapies that can restore neutrophil function caused by IV infection may be helpful.
