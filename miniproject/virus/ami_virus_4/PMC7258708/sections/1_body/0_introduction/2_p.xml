<p id="p0300">A critical component of host defense includes the expression of immunosuppressive cytokines. IL-10, and TGF-β, and the generation of regulatory T cells that can express these cytokines serve to limit the immune-mediated damage related to host defense. These same elements also cause secondary immune deficiency by suppressing or blocking effector Th1-like responses. These immunoregulatory elements, generated in response to the original infection, as a consequence, can lead to secondary immune deficiency and the development of severe or fatal infection with other microbes. Some of the microbes that cause temporary or permanent changes in immune responses to other organisms are shown in
