<p id="p0305">The amount of immunomodulatory cytokines, such as IL-10, expressed during infection contributes to the development of secondary infections during and after recovery from the primary infection. Alteration in the balance between immunity and immune suppression is in part, based on how much IL-10 is expressed during a given infection. IL-10 promoter polymorphisms that control high, intermediate, or low expression of IL-10

Excessive IL-10 levels defined by a given host's IL-10 genotype could predispose an individual to develop secondary infections by blocking appropriate pro-inflammatory responses. In contrast, low IL-10 levels, also defined by a given host's genotype, could protect against secondary infection, at the expense of limiting collateral tissue damage and T cell memory that higher IL-10 expression would support.

 </xref> Taken together, the successful balance of cellular innate and adaptive immune responses, and the cytokine/chemokine repertoires that they express during a primary infection to an infectious microbe, can temporarily or permanently “hijack” effective immune responses that are necessary to prevent other infections by microbes that are commonly found in the environment. Thus, an imbalance in the immune responses made during a primary infection can have devastating consequences on the ability of an individual to generate effective immune responses to prevent or survive secondary infections caused by different microbes. Failure to establish an appropriate innate/adaptive immune balance can lead to persistent, severe, or fatal infections cause by secondary infections.
