<p id="p0295">Immune deficiencies can be subdivided into two categories: primary or secondary. This chapter describes secondary defects related to infection, and other forms of secondary immunodeficiency are described elsewhere in this book. Some microbes manipulate or exhaust effector immune responses, leading to secondary infections by other microbes. While the manipulation or exhaustion of immune responses is an important defense mechanism of some microbes to evade effective immune clearance, it is also likely that the genetic immune response repertoire that programs how an infected individual will respond to these microbes contributes significantly to whether the resulting immune responses will protect against, or facilitate, superinfection by other microbes. In this chapter, we discuss how some microbes manipulate or, in the case of the human immune deficiency virus (HIV), exhaust protective innate and/or adaptive immunity, ultimately leading to severe microbial superinfections by other infectious organisms that cause significant morbidity and, on occasion, mortality from secondary infections.</p>
