  <sup>191</sup>
 </xref> The effect on DC changes occurs during the different phases of this infection. Although DC function is impaired immediately following the initial burst of parasitemia, T and B cell responses to heterologous antigens change dynamically during the course of infection.
 <xref rid="bib191" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>191</sup>
 </xref> T cell proliferation, and effector function and migration are suppressed, and B cells do not expand or produce antibodies. HZ, prevents the formation of stable, long-lasting cell–cell contacts between T cells and DCs impairing co-stimulatory activity.

 </xref> Nonetheless, there is also a T cells functional defect.
 <xref rid="bib188" ref-type="bibr">
  <sup>188</sup>
 </xref> Taken together, impairment of both innate and adaptive signaling induced by malarial infection/HZ pigment skews the immune response toward tolerance instead of immunity, and this subversion of effective immunity leads to secondary infection with other organisms as a consequence of this parasitic infection.
