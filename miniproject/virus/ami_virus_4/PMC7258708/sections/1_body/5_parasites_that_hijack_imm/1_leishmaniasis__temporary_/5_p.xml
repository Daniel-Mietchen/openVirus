 <italic>Staphylococcus</italic>, 
 <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, 
 <italic>Proteus</italic>, and 
 <italic>Klebsiella</italic> have been cultured from lesions (listed in decreasing frequency). However, the incidence of these infections is higher in ulcerated compared to non-ulcerated lesions. Thus, both disruption of the skin, and possibly immunosuppression caused by CL, likely play roles in the development of secondary bacterial infection in CL, leading to severe or lethal bacterial infection.

 </xref> Increased Treg numbers in CL have been linked to activation/reactivation of latent microbial infections (
 <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, 
 <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, herpes viruses) that cause significant morbidity and mortality, possibly as a result of immunosuppression and other factors, although how activation/reactivation of dormant infections occurs remains unknown.

 </xref> VL has been associated with significant secondary infections. These may be confounded by HLH where neutropenia is common. Infections ranging from sepsis to urinary tract infections occur in a significant subset of patients with VL. The most common pathogens causing sepsis are 
 <italic>S. aureus, Klebsialla pneumonia</italic>, and 
 <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. Common laboratory features include neutropenia, eosinopenia and leukopenia. Co-infection with HIV alters the clinical presentation with more lung and gastrointestinal involvement.
