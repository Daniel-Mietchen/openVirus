<p id="p0485">Leishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus 
 <italic>Leishmania</italic> of the family Trypanosomatidae, and is transmitted by a sand fly vector. It infects over 12 million individuals globally in tropical and subtropical regions, with approximatel

 </xref> Three major clinical forms of leishmaniasis are known (VL, CL, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis [MCL]); all are the result of infection by different species of this parasite and the various host immune responses made to these microbes (
